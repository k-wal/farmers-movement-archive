01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Villagers claim illicit liquor trader-police nexus||Residents of Muchhal village near Jandiala Guru town of Amritsar district that witnessed 10 deaths due to consumption of hooch on Saturday claimed the illicit liquor trade thrived since there is a nexus between smugglers and police. Balkar Singh, a village resident, said, “As per our information, this (hooch consumed by locals who died) was alcohol used in making of liquor. They bring small bottles of concentrated alcohol and mix it with water. The people indulging in this business earn around Rs 3,000 by investing only Rs 60.”“The families into this business have become rich overnight. It can be gauged the fact that some of them have constructed lavish multi-storeyed houses,” he added.Charan Kaur, whose husband Balwinder Singh (65) died after consuming the hooch, is a neighbourer of Balwinder Kaur, who has been arrested for illegally selling liquor from her house. She said, “It was like living in hell in the neighbourhood of Balwinder Kaur who was into this illicit business for more than two decades. Her customers came to her residence starting morning till late night.”“In my family, only my husband consumed liquor. He purchased it from Balwinder Kaur. The narrow street leading to my house remained packed with the customers most of whom were drug addicts or bad elements. When police would come she bribed them,” she told.‘IT TASTED DIFFERENTLY FROM NORMAL LIQUOR’Some of the village residents, who consumed the hooch but survived, said the alcohol they consumed looked and tasted differently from the normal country-made liquor.Inder Singh (65) said, “I purchased liquor for Rs 50. I consumed some at Balwinder Kaur’s residence and brought the rest home. Immediately after consuming it, I had food which possibly saved me. I felt some uneasiness thereafter.” “I am not well since I consumed the hooch,” said Gurbir Singh, a rickshaw puller from the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/villagers-claim-illicit-liquor-trader-police-nexus/story-466PYwxQqShwpDlhagXZGI.html

This took the total recoveries to 2,66,883 at a recovery rate of 61.82%, closer to the national rate of 64.54%, as of Friday. The state has 149,214 active cases. Maharashtra reported 9,601 new infections in the past 24 hours, taking the state tally to 431,719, including 1,047 new cases in Mumbai. Mumbai’s caseload touched 115,331 and toll reached 6,398 with 45 more deaths. Pune topped the chart in terms of daily cases and deaths with the addition of 2,699 cases (461 in rural Pune, 1,441 in Pune city and 797 in Pimpri-Chinchwad) reported on Saturday. The district tally stood at 91,930, including 60,000 in Pune city. The district also saw 76 deaths (42 in city, 21 in rural Pune and 13 in Pimpri-Chinchwad), taking the toll to 1,175. Aurangabad and Jalgaon districts reported 17 and 20 deaths, while Raigad rural reported 26. Thane district and Vasai-Virar saw 19 and 12 fatalities. 64,845 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, translating into a test positivity rate of 14.80%. State’s cumulative positivity rate was 19.66%. 908,099 people are in home quarantine and 38,947 are institutionally quarantined. In the month of July, the state reported 247,357 cases, which accounted for 58.6% of the case tally in the state. While Mumbai cases came down drastically in July, Pune and other districts like Nashik, Aurangabad, Jalgaon and Solapur registered a rise in July.Of the total cases in the state in July, 14.81% or 36,626 cases were in Mumbai, 46.24% (114,383) in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), 31.43% (77,757) were in MMR, excluding Mumbai and 27.05% (66,904) in Pune.In June, MMR accounted for 69.09% (74,003 cases) of the total number of state cases (107,106) in the month. MMR, excluding Mumbai, accounted for 33.64% (36,031) of the state’s share. Mumbai’s share was 35.45% (37,972 cases), while Pune’s case share in June was 13.45%. Districts like Nashik, Aurangabad, Jalgaon and Solapur saw more cases in July than in June. While Mumbai and other cities in MMR have shown a fall in cases, Pune district and other parts of the state have reported a rise in cases in the last few weeks. Officials attribute the rise owing to the weak health infrastructure and lack in tracking-tracing the contacts. “Pune city and district administration initially failed to ramp up the facilities to cope with the spike after unlocking measures. It has now been done by setting up jumbo hospitals and acquisition of the private hospitals. Nagpur has adequate number of beds, but has no management of beds and proper tracking of the contacts. Similar are the cases with other districts where the number is rising. The cities in MMR could manage the addition of beds speedily, resulting in the fall in numbers,” a state government official said.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said, “In Pune, the growth is more in rural parts than the city because of the movement of people from outskirts of the Pune city. We have been focusing in Pune and other districts like Jalgaon, Aurangabad with the high growth rate by strengthening the infrastructure. We expect the infection curve to stabilise by August end even in these areas.”Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said that the number of cases has increased after the relaxations from the lockdown curbs and the district administrations will have to be on toes to contain the spread. “The spread can be arrested with more tests and aggressive tracking of the contact under ‘Chase the Virus’ mantra, which worked in Dharavi and Worli. It will help break the chain of the virus. The patients with comorbidities should be minutely monitored to keep the fatality rate in check,” he said. Thackeray inaugurated the ICU ward at a district hospital in Ahmednagar.Health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government has ramped up its health infrastructure over the past few months. He said that the number of laboratories for coronavirus tests has touched 211 and more than 21 lakh tests have been conducted in the state so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharpest-1-day-spike-of-322-deaths-takes-maha-toll-past-15k/story-V3XNjqioncucL8B5cfI2QJ.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Illicit liquor smuggling link traced to Rajpura, Noida||The link of smuggling of extra neutral alcohol (ENA), which is used for manufacturing illicit liquor, has been traced to Patiala’s Rajpura town and Noida in Uttar Pradesh with the interrogation of those arrested in connection with the 84 hooch-related deaths in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts. The police claimed to have identified the alleged racket kingpin as Gurpal Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran’s Dhotian village, who supplied illicit liquor in the area. He is already lodged in the Kapurthala jail. Officials investigating the matter suspect that a single lot of spurious alcohol smuggled in the area might be the reason behind the mass deaths.Till Friday, 41 people had lost their lives. The death toll mounted to 84 after Tarn Taran district reported 43 more fatalities between Friday night and Saturday morning.On Friday, the Tarn Taran police arrested four persons —Kashmir Singh, Angrej Singh, Amarjit Singh and Baljit Singh— from Pandoori Gola village for selling illicit liquor in the area on the basis of the complaints lodged by the some of the victims’ family members.

Our preliminary probe has revealed that Gurpal smuggled ENA from Noida in UP. We have also identified four more suspects who are also lodged in jail. The hunt is on to arrest Gurpal’s brother.”Gurpal along with Nirmal Singh and Attar Singh of Sarhali village was arrested on July 9 this year in Phillaur of Jalandhar district with 4,000 litre alcohol being smuggled from Rajpura, as per the FIR registered at the Phillaur police station. An official said, “Balwinder Kaur purchased illicit liquor from Mithu and Gobind Singh of Kathunangal village. We have arrested Gobind Singh also. Mithu was producing illicit liquor at his home while Gobind purchased it from someone else. We are tracing the links of those who had been supplying alcohol to the village-level liquor suppliers.”Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Druman H Nimbale said they were considering Gurpal, his brother, and Kashmir Singh and Angrej Singh as the masterminds of the illicit liquor smuggling racket.ACCUSED FACING MULTIPLE CASES Kashmir, Angrej, Amarjit and Baljit were already booked under the Excise Act at various police stations, officials said.

01-08-2020||City||Sisodia urges Shah to let hotels, weekly markets reopen in Delhi||New Delhi: Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday urged Union home minister Amit Shah to allow hotels and weekly markets to reopen in the national Capital and accordingly issue directions to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, the government said. A day earlier, Baijal had rejected the Delhi government’s decision to allow hotels and weekly markets to reopen in the capital, saying the Covid-19 situation continued to be “fragile” in Delhi and the threat was still “far from over”. In a letter written in Hindi, the deputy chief minister said the Delhi government would again send its proposal on reopening of hotels and weekly markets to the lieutenant-governor on Tuesday. “I request you to reconsider your decision and direct the L-G to approve the proposal. If traders start their business, jobs will be generated, and that the condition of economy will improve,” Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, wrote in the letter. There was no immediate from the Union home ministry to HT’s requests for comment.On Thursday, the Delhi government decided to allow hotels, hospitality services, street hawkers to operate and did away with the night curfew hours applicable between 10pm and 5am under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan. The government intended to allow weekly bazars to operate for a week on a trial basis to check if social distancing norms were being followed. An official order regarding the same was to come by Saturday. But the LG rejected the proposal on Friday, saying that Delhi still needs to hold on to a cautious and conservative approach in controlling the pandemic. The L-G’s office did not respond to HT’s query for a fresh comment on the matter.Sisodia, in his letter, said the Centre is showing “double standards” towards Delhi at a time when the entire country is following the Centre’s unlockdown rules and efforts are being made to resume economic activities. He said at a time when Delhi’s controlled Covid-19 cases and the situation started to stabilise, it is not being allowed to resume economic activities while states such as Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, which are seeing a surge in cases, are being allowed to operate hotels and weekly markets. He wrote that 8% of Delhi’s business and employment has been hit due to the coronavirus disease outbreak. “Due to the closure of weekly markets, five lakh families are sitting at home. Now when they are hopeful that with control over coronavirus in Delhi, they will get an opportunity to restart their business, binding them under the decision of closure is unfair to Delhi’s economic situation and hopes of lakhs of people…If traders start their business, jobs will be generated, and that the economy will improve,” he said. The Delhi hotel and restaurant owners’ association said nearly 4 lakh people are associated with the industry in Delhi. “Hotel owners have not been able to meet their domestic expenses due to the closure since March 15...We demand the Centre and the Delhi government to waive off 80% tax on electricity bills, and provide rebate in house tax and water bills. We urge them to simplify the process of getting a fire NOC and police licence,” the association said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-urges-shah-to-let-hotels-weekly-markets-reopen-in-delhi/story-vwvant71ULwwFj6RTXjiZO.html

While the CCTV footage of the animal moving about in front of the house is grainy, making a confirmation difficult, officials have not ruled out the possibility of the animal being a leopard. The CCTV footage of the animal roaming around the lane around 4.30am, was circulated on social media on Saturday and was brought to the attention of the forest department. Following this, teams were dispatched to Vaishali where officials traced the footage to a camera installed outside a house in Vaishali’s Sector 3. “The family living in that house had gone out of town three days ago. But while monitoring the CCTV footage from their phones, they saw the leopard-like animal moving about the lane and immediately sent the video to the local residents’ welfare association to alert neighbours and other residents,” Deeksha Bhandari, divisional forest officer, said. The officer said the size of the animal could not be fully ascertained due to the field of the CCTV camera but it had a long tail, which is generally found in animals belonging to the cat family. “The animal seems to be from cat family. It could be a leopard or a fishing cat, both of which are from the cat family. Both animals are listed under the Schedule I (of the Wildlife Protection Act). Our teams have distributed contact numbers of the local residents and have asked them to inform the department in case they spot the animal. Our teams are ensuring that there is no threat to human life and also to the animal. We are not ruling out the possibility of the animal being a leopard. However, at the location, we found no pug marks,” Bhandari said. The officials also took up combing operations in the area and suspect that the animal may have strayed into the area from the Hindon canal, which is adjacent to Vaishali, and has thick vegetation. The canal separates the two prime localities of Vaishali and Indirapuram. The sighting of leopard in Ghaziabad is not new. On December 17 last year, one had ventured into the Hindon airbase. The three-and-half-year old male leopard was trapped and later released safely in the Saharanpur forest range. A male leopard was also sighted in April 2017 in the Krishna Vihar Kuti area near Bhopra which is also near the Hindon airbase. The leopard was captured. However, it had by then injured a man, a child and cattle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leopard-like-animal-caught-on-cctv-cameras-in-vaishali-forest-dept-officials-on-alert/story-XInrEcBx6yKTKEhqOkFEDL.html

Leela Dhar, 52, was in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Tahirpur since July 19. But his condition did not improve and he died on Friday, senior police officers said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that on July 11, the head constable had reported mild fever at the police station, after which he was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was tested for Covid-19. His reports came positive and he was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.“As Dhar’s condition deteriorated, he was shifted to the ICU. He was given plasma therapy. On Friday, we were informed about his death,” said Thakur, adding Dhar was on general duty and not deployed in a containment zone.A police officer from the Defence Colony police station said Dhar was diabetic and suffering from liver ailment and had symptoms of hypertension for the past few years. “He recently suffered from pneumonia,” the officer said, adding he lived in south Delhi’s Sri Niwaspuri police colony with his family. Before Dhar, 14 officers of Delhi Police, including an inspector of the special cell, died of Covid-19.

01-08-2020||Noida||Changes in billing slabs to spike power bills in UP, residents oppose move||The proposed changes in different slabs of electricity consumers’ categories of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) are likely to burden the users. And, if the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) approves these proposed slabs, it is believed that domestic and commercial consumers will see a spike in their electricity bills in the next fiscal.According to sources, the UPPCL has proposed only two slabs, i.e., consumption up to 200 units and above 200 units for the domestic category. Earlier, there were four different slabs under this category. “At present, there are around 80 slabs in different categories. However once the UPERC approves the new proposal, it will be around 50 slabs,” said a senior UPPCL official, preferring anonymity.He further said that under the new proposal, electricity bills for temporary power connections given for construction work, wedding events and religious programmes, will be reduced. “At present, a minimum-20 kilowatt (KW) power connection for such functions is given after a payment of Rs 4,750 per day, plus 20% electricity duty. On an average, people have to pay around Rs 5,500 for these functions. Under the proposed rates, electricity bills for these functions will be reduced by around 40%. Under the new tariff structure, similar relief will be given to different government and private educational institutions. However, the tariff is expected to be the same for private hospitals and nursing homes,” the UPPCL official quoted above said.When contacted, Virendra Nath Singh, Noida divisional chief engineer of Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said that the proposed bracket of tariffs are to be approved by the UPERC and that the discom has no role in it. “The PVVNL is an electricity distribution company and it has no say in fixing the brackets of tariffs,” he said.Meanwhile, criticising this proposed change in slabs, PS Jain, the president of confederation of NCR residents’ welfare associations (CONRWA), said any change in tariffs will adversely affect consumers. “It is going to burden consumers. Noida’s power consumers are already paying the maximum fixed electricity charges in all of NCR region, despite generating maximum revenue and having minimum line loss. I’ve written a letter to the chief minister and the power minister to revoke any proposal from the UPPCL that suggests any change in power tariffs and consumer categories,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/changes-in-billing-slabs-to-spike-power-bills-in-up-residents-oppose-move/story-4TTab7Xn9HqRg4LWIbYJfK.html
01-08-2020||City||Gurugram: SIT formed to probe Covid drug smuggling racket||Gurugram: A special investigation team (SIT) was formed on Saturday to investigate an alleged racket wherein pharmaceutical drugs and medicines, including those used in the treatment of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and cancer, were being illegally supplied to pharmacists and Iraqi interpreters. The matter had first come to light on July 28, when the city police had arrested four Iraqi nationals in two separate raids. K K Rao, police commissioner, Gurugram, said, “An SIT has been formed in the case. The team will be headed by an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) rank officer.” The police on Saturday arrested a pharmacist from Delhi, who was allegedly involved in supplying Remdesivir- an experimental drug administered to Covid-19 patients in emergency situations- to another pharmacist, identified as Pardeep, who had been arrested earlier. Police did not disclose the name of the arrested suspect from Delhi, stating that some of his aides are yet to be arrested and revealing his name would jeopardise further arrests. The police had earlier said that the role of some hospitals had also come under the scanner after vials and injections of Remdesivir were recovered in two raids this week. Police said the SIT would question the suspects and probe links to Delhi-based pharmacists. Police is also likely to probe the links of two Iraqi suspects to Kolkata, from where they claimed to have sourced several medicines. On July 28, the police had arrested four Iraqi nationals in two separate raids from sectors 47 and 57 after the drug control department had received a tip-off. Forty-eight vials of Remdesivir, 55 strips of Fabiflu (Favipiravir) and 18 packs of Lopikast — the three drugs used in the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus — among a large cache of antibiotics, antacids, anti-allergics and other cancer treatment medicines were recovered in the raid. One SUV and Rs 74.55 lakh was also seized. Police probe has found that the suspects had been smuggling medicines to Iraq for at least two years and since the pandemic broke out, they had started dealing primarily in drugs used to treat Covid-19 which were in short supply and sold at exorbitant prices in Iraq. The suspects worked as translators for medical tourism patients at private hospitals and enlisted the patients or their attendants as conduits and asked them to carry medicines along with their personal medicines in the flights to Iraq, where an aide would collect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-sit-formed-to-probe-covid-drug-smuggling-racket/story-iR3ZOU1zlMB6nYc65RT7kI.html

He has suffered multiple fractures and is undergoing treatment at a hospital,” he said. According to the police, the suspects had assaulted the victim with iron rods and a hammer. Tahir Qureshi, who has been running a meat shop in the Sadar area for the past 11 years, said that the area is no longer safe. “This is not the first such incident. Four years ago, a similar incident took place with one of our men. On Friday, despite calling on the police control room number five times, they did not respond and took more than 1.5 hours after I informed them that the suspects might kill the victim,” he said. Qureshi said that the shop owners have demanded a permanent police post in the area and regular patrolling. Police commissioner Rao said the SHO has been suspended as he failed to handle the situation. “We have already deployed a police team in the area, and have taken a serious note on why the police control room number does not respond at the time of emergency. We have given the task to the technical team who will resolve the glitches,” he said. The police said the suspects had also manhandled policemen who had reached the spot and broken window panes of a PCR van as the cops were trying to shield the victim. Several videos have emerged on social media which purportedly show at least a dozen policemen watching as suspects were beating up the victim. The police had on Friday registered an FIR against unknown persons, though one suspect was already arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assault-on-truck-driver-transporting-meat-badshahpur-sho-suspended/story-i7KmRe5Tyfws59UHeLFAlL.html
01-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad case burden shifts from planned localities to old city||Ghaziabad Cis-Hindon area of the district reported the most number of Covid-19 cases in July, reversing the trend when trans-Hindon area comprising prime localities such as Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara had accounted for maximum positive cases till a month earlier. After Unlock 1 which started June 1, the trans-Hindon area was high on positive cases with a share of 52.72% while the cis-Hindon had a share of 33.7% of the 1,267 cases in the month, according to figures of the health department. The trend, however, has got reversed with the opening up of more activities under Unlock 2 and more testing taken up with the help of rapid antigen kits since June 26, officials said. In July, share of trans-Hindon area went down to 39.12%, while the cis-Hindon had 47.57% share of the total 3,134 cases reported in the last month, as per the official records. However, overall, the trans-Hindon area still has the maximum number of cases. As per the figures, areas of trans-Hindon, cis-Hindon and rural accounted for 44.22%, 41.92% and 13.87%, respectively, as their share in Covid-19 cases till the end of July. Notably, the first Covid-19 case was reported in Ghaziabad on March 5. “If we look at the overall figures, the trans-Hindon had about 2% more cases till July 31. Initially the trans-Hindon area was largely affected as many people go to Delhi for work. There was effect of cross-border infection. That’s why containment exercises were carried out in Khoda, Vaishali and Loni which yielded results and cases decreased,” said an officer from the health department, who wished not to be named. The trans-Hindon area, close to Delhi border, and cis-Hindon area are primarily separated by river Hindon. The cis-Hindon area comprises old city areas which have planned and unplanned colonies, and major markets. The trans-Hindon area, on the other hand, has more of planned residential localities and comprise majorly high-rise societies in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Kaushambi, and Vasundhara, among others. The district administration said that irrespective of spread of cases in the cis-Hindon area, it is focusing on early detection, faster testing and immediate referral of Covid-19 cases for treatment. “We have taken several steps to contain the Covid-19 spread. The testing has also improved vastly with the introduction of rapid antigen kits. We are also keeping in check the fatality rate and measures have yielded results. The spread of cases in cis-Hindon area in July could be due to high density of population as people started mixing after activities were allowed and more of testing taken up,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Our surveillance and other teams are working round the clock. Besides, more of rapid response teams will be roped in to keep track of patients in home isolation. The monitoring of such patients will be strict. Our focus is to reach out to maximum people who have contracted virus. With all efforts, our discharge rate has touched 83.32% (till July 31), which is encouraging,” Pandey added. The overall figures of the residential segments in trans-Hindon indicate that Karhera-2 (comprising Indirapuram, Makanpur and Kanawani) has reported highest number of 549 cases, segment of Sahibabad-2 (Raj Bagh, Shalimar Garden, Rajendra Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, etc) account for 363 cases, Vaishali (comprising Vaishali, Ramprastha, etc) account for about 248 cases, while Vasundhara has about 233 cases.In cis-Hindon area, the Carte segment (Kavi Nagar, Avantika, Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Chiranjeev Vihar, Daulatpura, Maliwara, Mahindra Enclave, Ashok Nagar, and Nasirpur) has about 371 cases while Raj Nagar segment (Raj Nagar, Sanjay Nagar, New Friends Colony, Govindpuram, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Panchsheel Primrose, Guldhar, Bhatta Number 5, etc) has about 341 cases, Vijay Nagar-1 segment (Krishna Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Vijay Nagar, SP (city) office, Pratap Vihar, New Vijay Ngar, old Vijay Nagar, Mawi, Vijay Ngar PS, etc) has about 243 cases, while Sadik Nagar (Raj Nagar Extension, Sihni village, Noor Nagar etc) has about 222 cases. The rural area that includes Dasna and Loni, among others, reported at least 446 cases till July 31, as per the records. “During the initial months, the trans-Hindon area, which is are very close to Delhi border, was more affected. Now, with less cases being reported in Delhi, the infection is also on decline in trans-Hindon. Besides, initially the testing was more concentrated on high risk groups which largely surfaced from trans-Hindon areas,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “Now, the testing centres have come up in all areas of the district and anyone can walk-in and get tested. So, city areas with high density of population churned out more positive patients in June-end and also in the month of July. However, the figures indicate that overall cases are now on decline in Ghaziabad for the past 10-15 days,” he added. According to official records, the Ghaziabad district had collected 105,202 samples for Covid-19 test till July 31, out of which test reports were received for 105,099 samples. The testing included 61,258 tests done through rapid antigen kits from June 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-case-burden-shifts-from-planned-localities-to-old-city/story-aQTzBZPhcPpdqSMIh9tWUM.html
01-08-2020||City||Supplying of mobile phones and drugs to inmates: Deputy superintendent’s son held from Sirsa||Gurugram Just over a week after a deputy superintendent of Gurugram’s Bhondsi jail was arrested for allegedly supplying mobile phones and drugs to inmates, his 30-year-old son was arrested from Sirsa on Saturday and charged with sedition for allegedly threatening prison officials, said police.The suspect was identified as Ravi Chautala, a resident of Sirsa and his father is Dharambir Chautala.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (Crime), said that Chautala threatened to “blast Bhondsi jail” in a purported audio clip that did the rounds on social media. He is also purported heard telling all officials — from constable to superintendent — to seek a transfer to another jail, Sangwan said. “Ravi is heard saying that he was in touch with all the gangsters lodged in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi jails and would take their support to extract revenge for his father’s,” he said. The crime teams traced his mobile number to Sirsa on Friday and arrested from his house early Saturday morning, said police. During questioning, Sangwan allegedly told police that he had recorded the audio on Wednesday night under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The mobile phone on which he made the purported recording has been recovered from is possession, said police. “The audio was cited as a national security threat following which we have registered a case and arrested him,” he said, adding that the arrest was based on a police complaint.A case under sections 121(waging war), 124A (sedition), 189 (Threatening a public servant with injury), 506 (threatening for life) and 507 (Criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the suspect at Bhondsi police station. Suspect was produced before the court on Saturday and was sent to 14-day judicial custody , said police. Ravi was also allegedly involved in drug peddling in Gururgam and Sirsa. “He was in touch with Bhondsi jail inmates and used to offer them drugs and mobile phones at cheaper prices and got them delivered through his father,” said Sangwan. Preliminary investigation has revealed that Ravi had come under scanner earlier also as he was allegedly involved in supplying mobile phones and drugs to inmates and people who have been out on parole and acquitted. He has completed Masters in History from Hisar and then did not continue with his studies and allegedly slipped into depression after he met with an accident in 2009 and remained in coma for a few days, said police. The father and son are now lodged in different barracks and are placed under quarantine. Dharambir Chautala was arrested last week for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards to inmates over the last two years. According to officers, 240 grams of a narcotics substance (Sulfa) and 11 SIM cards were allegedly recovered from his government accommodation. Police commissioner K K Rao said they are investigating the case and have identified a few people who are on their radar. They will be questioned by the police teams and will check if anyone else from the jail was in touch with Ravi Chautala. “We are monitoring calls of a few people and keeping a close watch on their movement. The crime teams have begun tracking the movement of drug peddlers who have criminal records,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/supplying-of-mobile-phones-and-drugs-to-inmates-deputy-superintendent-s-son-held-from-sirsa/story-eI462piygfRseJEiabHUQI.html

01-08-2020||City||Over 8,000 North MCD teachers, unpaid since May, threaten strike from Aug 16||New Delhi: Over 8,000 teachers of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, who said they have not received their salaries since May, have threatened to go on strike from August 16 if they are not paid. The teachers’ association said they were yet to receive salaries for May, June and July and on Saturday sent a letter to the north corporation’s mayor and education department, giving them a “15 day-ultimatum”. The civic agency said they were facing losses of around ₹200 crore due to the lockdown, but are working to find a solution to pay the teachers within 10 days. The north corporation employs around 8,500 teachers across 714 of its primary schools. Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary, MCD Teachers Association —an umbrella body of all teachers’ association under the city’s civic bodies — said that though schools are shut for students, teachers are taking classes online and have also been distributing books and study material to students. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said the already cash-strapped civic body’s troubles were exacerbated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which he said severely hurt their earnings. Property tax, parking contracts, advertisements, stamp duty are among the body’s main sources of revenue. “Our earnings have been affected drastically due to the pandemic. We are facing a loss of around ₹200 crore in the first two quarters of this financial year, so paying our employees has become tough. We are in contact with our teachers and have assured them to pay their salaries in next 10 days,” the mayor said. Solanki added that the admissions process has started, and warned work on that front would be affected if they go on strike. “We have been working without salaries for three months. The last salary we got was of April. For teachers, survival has become tough especially during the pandemic. We have today written a letter to the mayor and to concerned authorities in the education department to pay our pending salaries. We have given 15 days ultimatum to the corporation, so if they do not clear our dues we will stage an indefinite strike from August 16,” Solanki said. He said that in June, the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) directed the North corporation to release teachers’ salaries at the earliest, after which they were paid their April remuneration last month. Till June-end, teachers were engaged in distributing dry rations and cooked food, in the wake of the lockdown. While the food distribution has stopped, they are now taking online classes and are also sending students recorded audio and video lectures on WhatsApp. Kuldeep Khatri, president, Shikshak Nyaya Manch Nagar Nigam, a teachers’ union, said the situation of North civic body school teachers has taken a turn for the worse, with many now forced to take loans to manage their expenses. “Things have come to such a pass that we are not able to take care of our families. It has become a perennial problem, and the civic body should come up with a permanent solution,” Khatri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-8-000-north-mcd-teachers-unpaid-since-may-threaten-strike-from-aug-16/story-JVfa0wzgW1ZHKY8D7j3fdN.html
01-08-2020||City||Second phase of mock tests begin at DU ahead of open-book exam||New Delhi: Ten days before its first online open-book exam (OBE), Delhi University on Saturday began the second phase of mock tests for final-year students. The first phase of mock tests conducted between July 27 and 29 consisted of generic questions while those that began on Saturday, and will continue till August 4, were “based on real version and single paper of each program of final semester/year of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes of the current batch”. Students took to social media on Saturday to complain of issues they faced during the papers. “I was previewing my answers and when I opened the second file, someone else’s file was showing,” tweeted a final-year student of Faculty of Law, Delhi University. Students, however, said they faced fewer technical glitches this time as compared to the two previous mock tests. Utkarsh Singh, a final-year undergraduate student at Satyawati College, said, “Several students faced issues with the server today as well. Though I wrote my papers, I wasn’t able to submit because the site doesn’t work well on the phone and I couldn’t access my laptop at that moment. So many of my batch mates just don’t want to appear for these mock tests anymore because they are exhausted.” Dean (exams) Vinay Gupta said they had not received any such complaints. “Mock test may be considered to test the portal and to prepare for the final exam. At this difficult time, we are trying to facilitate the students and to get the system robust,” he said. The first mock test held on July 4 was riddled with glitches. Lakshita Sethi, a final-year undergraduate student of Shri Ram College of Commerce, said, “Though there weren’t any technical issues this time, we had to scan and upload pages one by one instead of compiling into one file. That can be a time-consuming process. On the final day, it can be a challenge and it would have been better if we had more time to practice.” Many students opted out of the tests on the first day as they said it wouldn’t help them much. Amreen Kohli, a final-year undergraduate student of Gargi College, said, “I didn’t appear for the test because it wouldn’t help me. Since our paper pattern changed this year, we should have mock tests for all papers but the administration is just holding the mock test for just one paper – that too in my case, it isn’t a high-stakes subject.” The varsity had announced OBE exams for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students as a one-time measure due to the Covid-19 crisis. DU teachers and students have been protesting against the open book online exams for over two months now, and demanding cancellation of final-year exams. Despite the opposition, DU has scheduled the online exams between August 10 and August 31. On Thursday, the university submitted in the Delhi High Court that of the 182,237 final year students who had registered for online exams, around 70,101 had logged in for the first phase of mock tests that started from July 27. Of these, 39,159 (21.4%) students attempted the exams and only 22,372 (12%) could submit their answer sheets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-phase-of-mock-tests-begin-at-du-ahead-of-open-book-exam/story-xXCCrhGO3qfhf2IOV1SmwM.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Clear your municipal dues before planning to sell property in Haryana||Those wanting to sell their properties in urban Haryana will have to clear their municipal dues first as the government is putting in place a mechanism to electronically disallow registration of transfer deeds in case of outstanding levy. The dues can be in the form of property tax, fire tax, development charges, water and sewerage charges. The move to introduce technology-based checks into the Haryana Land Records Information System (HALRIS), an online platform used for registration of properties, is aimed at preventing malpractices in registration of sale deeds. The state government recently halted the registration of transfer deeds across the state for a limited period citing alleged corrupt practices. “The default of the amount will be available online on the HALRIS. The system won’t allow the seller or buyer to take an online appointment for registration of a property unless the municipal dues are cleared,” said an official involved in building technology checks. Officials said that the idea behind introducing technology-based checks was to reduce physical interface between public and officials. “Gradually, it will be ensured that every property owner can pay the levies online and the municipal body data will get automatically updated,” said an official. The requirement to obtain a no dues certificate (NDC) from the municipal body before the registration of sale deed was always there but not enforced. “With an application programming interface (API) of the urban local bodies department, the HALRIS will automatically show whether any municipal levy is outstanding or not on a particular property. Each property in the municipal areas will be assigned a property identification number for this purpose,” the official said. Common online platform for municipal bodies The Urban Local Bodies (ULB) department is setting up a common online platform to facilitate generation of no dues certificate (NDCs) initially for 10 municipal corporations and 12 municipal bodies at district headquarters. “The measure is part of the framework to reduce malpractices in the registration of sale deeds and secure the tax revenue of the municipal bodies,” said a ULB official. While a few municipal corporations, such as Gurugram, Rohtak and over 20 smaller municipal bodies, have already provided the facility of online generation of NDCs individually, the state government intends bring the entire property data of urban areas on a single web portal. “There are some municipal bodies which have online systems but they are not linked to HALRIS,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/clear-your-municipal-dues-before-planning-to-sell-property-in-haryana/story-X4flfvRjKc3l3GtcJPkPpM.html

01-08-2020||City||Violation of environment norms: NGT orders closure of sugar, distillery units of Panipat mill||Taking a serious note of environmental violations, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the closure of sugar and distillery units of the Panipat Cooperative Sugarmill until remedial measures are taken.The bench, headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, observed, “There are serious environmental violations in the functioning of both units. The norms under the Water Act, Air Act and the Environment Protection Act are also not being followed, which amounts to criminal offences.” “Groundwater is being illegally extracted which may seriously and irreversibly affect the environment,” read the order.HSPCB TO ENSURE UNITS IMPLEMENTATIONWith both the units and the sugarmill closed, the NGT directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to ensure that the units can’t resume work until remedial measures have been adopted and the joint committee certifies this.The orders were based on the findings of a joint team, comprising officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and HSPCB. The joint team was formed by the NGT following complaints of pollution by the sugarmill’s distillery and sugar units. Though a closure notice was subsequently issued, the units had continued to function, causing air and water pollution. The NGT had then sought a joint status report from the CPCB and HSPCB.Talking to Hindustan Times, Pradeep Ahlawat, managing director the sugarmill, said, “The order is about compliance and they (joint team) have suggested remedial measures to resume operations of the units.”When asked if the mill will resume crushing operations this season, beginning in November, Ahlawat said, “Maintenance is underway and we will surely resume operations this season and ensure compliance of NGT orders.”S. Narayanan, member secretary of HSPCB, said that the closure orders have already been issued for the distillery and it will be closed in a couple of days by the field staff and the units will be allowed to operate only after full compliance as directed by the NGT.THE VIOLATIONSThe sugar and distillery units were meeting fresh water requirements through a borewell, without obtaining a no-objection certificate from the Central Ground Water Authority. Pit for collecting treated effluent was overflowing. Press mud (sugarcane residue) and boiler ash was dumped in open. Excess bagasse (sugarcane residue) from the mill house was falling from a height resulting in air pollution. At the distillery unit, the housekeeping was poor and stagnant water was found at several places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/violation-of-environment-norms-ngt-orders-closure-of-sugar-distillery-units-of-panipat-cooperation-sugarmill/story-nG8gmBGrsfEYWnP9KT6dcL.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Of a Prince, Poppadums, Podcasts & Parotta||Poor Poppadums! Never in their wildest dreams would they have imagined such a fairytale unmasking in the face of a Pandemic – Poppadum’s Fifteen Minutes of Fame meets Prince and Podcasters.When Duke of Cambridge Prince William invited football star-turned-BBC podcaster Peter Crouch for a ‘Lads’ Night In’ at Kensington Palace, there were invitees not only of the guzzling kind but gastronomic guests, too. Poppadums met pints over podcasts at the Palace high table. Chitchat about Chelsea FC & Co was peppered by none other than curry and chutney from Crouch’s chosen Indian takeaway, Samrat. What a paradox of the Pandemic! While the Occident found it hard to digest that Prince Charles cold shouldered the customary “handshake” in favour of the Indian “namaste” as a Covid-safe Oriental form of greeting, ironically, his heir has extended a hand – “helping hand” – to pluck Poppadums out of pandemic-propelled pauper-hood.The curious case of the Prince and the Pauper called Pandemic’s Pappad.The Pandemic may be staging Poppadum’s Day Out At Palaces, but back home Poppadums aren’t currying much favour with the Lamba jis or Lally jis.Blame it on the Paratha. Gol-maal GST tried its level best to edge the tax-fattened frozen Parotta out of the platters of Lockdown-fattened Lollitas and Lamba jis. Alas, it lost the battle to a fabled foodie truism – You may or may not be able to take Lockdown’s Lamba ji & Co out for a Paratha, but you can’t take the Paratha out of Lamba ji or Lally ji. Such is the hold of this stuffed species parading puffily as a cousin of the reed-thin Roti, the latter looking in front of the Paratha of Punjabi eatopia as emaciated as a famished famine-hit baby of Ethiopia, that Poppadums simply stand sidelined on the Punju platter in ‘relation’ to the Parotta.Thus it transpires that Lockdown got the L ollitas and Lamba jis so ardently addicted to the readymade frozen #Parotta or #Parota, that even in Unlock 1. 0, it has their hearts as melted in its favour as the butter swimming on it. This brings us to the new lease of life Unlock 1.0 has delivered to the frozen Parotta.This also brings us to the rites of passage that may “accidentally” accord to the Poppadum a place on the Punjabi platter.In Unlock 1.0, the battle for a slice of the Punjabi platter is thus not between the Poppadum and Parotta. What’s rolling out instead is a battle more on manufacturing lines – Malabar Parotta VS Malaysian Parota, or Karumanchery Parota VS Kawan Paratha.The frozen Malabar Parotta denoting desi brands that beckon from Big Bazaar or Big Basket catalogues. And the Malaysian Parota playing brand ambassador for videshi manufacturers who are invading inventories to cash in on the readymade Roti space. Picture this. On any #WorkFromHome day of Unlock 1.0, a spectacle such as this can be sighted. Lollita potters into the kitchen to rustle up breakfast, only to find Lamba ji or Lally ji already lolling thereabouts in suspicious avatar. As a wannabe MasterChef India. Lamba ji & Co not quite the subscribers to subtleties of sayings like “Too many cooks spoil the (quarantine) broth”. So far so good. The only pot-ential hazard – Lamba ji or Lally ji’s palate pangs for the Paratha propel him to parade pots ‘n’ pans between two or more gas burners. Two, because he is thawing the Malabar Parotta on the traditional tawa and elsewhere on a non-stick pan he dabbles in defrosting of the paper-thin Malaysian Onion Parota. So far, two good. Lollita exits the scene out of deference for idiomatic indiscretions called ‘Too many cooks spoil …’ and for diversions like a webinar. Some seconds later, Lamba ji also executes an exit in a huff, but not because the Parotta has been fried to a perfect puff. His hasty exit has more to do with being manoeuvred out of momentary amnesia by the morbid memory of a meeting on Zoom with his CEO or Chairman in five minutes’ flat. Lamba ji enters the virtual meeting on the dot, only to exit the Zoom room in less than five minutes because his room is suddenly too hot. It’s not the Boss who’s fuming, but the whole house. Lamba ji rushes out for role reversal into MasterChef mode, only to encounter not the defrosted Parotta but things more frozen – Lollita’s frosty glare. Lamba ji’s countenance contorts with consternation at the charred contents. His puckering at the Parotta’s rites of passage being reminiscent of that mournful melancholy mapping the faces of kith and kin who’re called upon to identify a mishap-maimed relative. The curious case of Pandemic’s frozen Parotta being reborn as a Poppadom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-of-a-prince-poppadums-podcasts-parotta/story-Wly2lulRMlD5EiTFrUjJbK.html

Further, a resolution approved by gram sabha of the village against acquisition of land will also be sent to the Prime Minister. Apart from providing legal help, AAP will also raise an agitation, along with the villagers, if required,” said Cheema, who was accompanied by deputy leader of opposition in Vidhan Sabha, MLA Sarvjit Kaur Manuke and other AAP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aap-backs-ludhiana-villagers-fight-against-land-acquisition/story-Vn7X35VR5IhGb7ADWruvQK.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||IndiGo to compete replacing A320 Neo aircraft engines by August end||Budget carrier IndiGo will complete replacing engines in its last batch of 14 Airbus A320 Neo aircraft, by August-end. The aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had on June 1 extended its May 31 deadline to refurbish engines in A320Neo fleet to August after supply chains and production lines were hit owing to the ongoing pandemic.The Pratt and Whitney (PW) engine-powered A320 neo planes in IndiGo has been facing glitches both mid-air and on-ground since their induction in 2016, following which, DGCA at the end of 2019 had directed the low-cost airline to replace them with a modified version, by May 31 this year.According to DGCA, IndiGo had 106 PW powered A320Neo planes in its fleet.“We are coming to finish this whole exercise, and by August we will have everything done and the whole fleet will be refurbished. Right now we still have 14 aircraft left which needs to be refurbished and we can see from the pipeline of the incoming engines, the whole exercise will be finished by the end of August,” (sic) IndiGo chief operating officer- Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, told analysts on a call during the airline’s June quarter financial results that took place on Wednesday. A query to IndiGo on how many aircraft had undergone engine replacement did not yield any response. IndiGo has a fleet of 274 aircraft, until June 30, 2020, including 120 A320 CEOs, 108 A320Neos, 18 A321neo and 25 ATRs.

01-08-2020||City||With 80% recovery rate, Bhiwandi now aims for zero deaths||With a recovery rate of over 80%, the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation has now launched Mission Zero Deaths to focus on ensuring there are no fatalities due to Covid-19. The city has managed to increase its doubling rate from 6.4 days in June-end, to 47 days – the highest in any corporation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Bhiwandi city has reported a total of 3,831 Covid-positive cases and 263 deaths by Friday. For almost a fortnight, the daily death toll has varied between zero and two. Rajesh Narvekar, district collector, Thane, said, “Bhiwandi city has drastically lowered its fatality rate and the number of positive cases, in the last one month. There is enough availability of beds in the city as well, due to the increased recovery rate.” After Pankaj Ashiya took over as civic commissioner in Bhiwandi, he focused on contact tracing, testing, and institutional quarantine, to slow down the spread of the coronavirus in the city.Ashiya has now initiated Mission Zero Deaths that will focus on zero fatality. “At present, 200 patients are receiving treatment at various hospitals in the city. We have more than 1,000 beds available for Covid patients, with facilities for oxygen and ventilators. Moreover, an efficient team of doctors and nursing staff are present to handle positive cases. Hence, we are now focusing on fatalities. We aim to ensure that not even 1% of Covid deaths should be from Bhiwandi,” said Ashiya. Continuous appeals have been made to ensure that locals visit a mohalla clinic or government hospital immediately if they recognise symptoms such as cough, fever, cold, and difficulty in breathing. IGM Hosp to admit non-Covid patients Within a week, the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Bhiwandi will open up for non-Covid patients as well. This is the only Covid-19 dedicated hospital in Bhiwandi city. “Non-Covid patients are finding it difficult to get treatment. With the decreasing number of cases, we are planning to let IGM Hospital treat all patients. However, a strict protocol of wearing masks and social distancing will be followed,” said Ashiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-80-recovery-rate-bhiwandi-now-aims-for-zero-deaths/story-9hWNSc0KbisGJNeQfpFk0O.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||After recovery, Covid-19 survivors battle anxiety, paranoia, depression||Psychiatrists across the city say survivors of Covid-19, particularly those who had severe cases, may suffer mental health issues while rehabilitating, after recovering from the infection.Anita Agarwal, 42, tested positive for Covid-19 on June 29, and was admitted to Seven Hills Hospitals where she was kept on a ventilator for five days and spent another week in the intensive care unit (ICU). She was discharged on July 12 and has been since battling severe anxiety. She is afraid of spreading the infection even though she is now Covid-free. “Even after 14 days in home quarantine after she was released from the hospital, she refused to step out of her room. She wouldn’t allow our son to go near her. She was panicking continuously in fear,” said Anil Agarwal, the patient’s husband.City psychiatrists say many Covid survivors are experiencing mental health issues, including post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), anxiety, sleep difficulties, depression and delirium. “Covid-19 survivors often develop weakness and fatigue with muscle weakness. This adds to their anxiety levels. Many are showing signs of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), where they constantly clean their hands with sanitiser. They even refuse to remove masks at home,” said Dr Avinash De Sousa, a psychiatrist and editor of the Indian Journal of Mental Health. Ashita Bose, 55, had come to Mumbai to visit her son in June when she was diagnosed with Covid-19. She spent 13 days at the isolation ward at Hinduhridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray (HBT) Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari, and was discharged on July 2. “For seven years, my mother was treated for depression in Kolkata and had recovered gradually. Since her release from hospital, she has once again developed symptoms. She can’t sleep at night and has almost stopped eating. She gets scared even if anyone rings the doorbell,” said Bose’s son, Satadru who works for an IT firm. Owing to the infectious nature of Covid-19, medical staffers working in isolation wards have to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) all the time, which can make patients feel isolated and yearn for human contact. “The relationship between doctors and patients relies on trust. But when a patient can’t see the face of their treating physicians, it does sour ties. At the same time, they don’t find their close ones beside them. This can lead to delirium, a confused state of mind post-discharge,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital and in-charge of managing Covid-19 beds in private hospitals. Patients who were intubated often experience flashbacks or feelings of paranoia. “These patients have seen people die before them in hospitals, which is not an easy experience to forget. Many recovered patients keep checking their temperature in panic,” said Dr De Sousa. Recovered patients may also face stigma and discrimination from others. “Some neighbours are welcoming while others stigmatise Covid-19 survivors. In fact, often recovered medicos also get humiliated when they return after being discharged. This instigates the sensitive minds of survivors, who are already fragile after fighting against the virus,” said Dr Milan Balakrishnan, secretary of Bombay Psychiatric Society.A report on psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections, which studied patients from China, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA was published in the medical journal Lancet in May. It stated that 65% of discharged patients complained of delirium. “Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the aftermath,” reads the study in its conclusion. Another study, by Henk Stam from Erasmus University Medical Center, Netherlands, has also advised continuing medical attention for Covid-19 survivors. “The notion that patients surviving intensive care and mechanical ventilation for several weeks can be discharged home without further medical attention is a dangerous illusion,” reads Stam’s study, which was published in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine in April. What to do after recovery? 1. Keep busy and follow a regular schedule 2. Don’t oversleep or sleep less than eight hours 3. Be physically active 4. Practice meditation 5. Don’t keep discussing Covid-19 with family members 6. In case of anxiety, try to breathe slowly 7. When feeling angry, count backward from 100 to 1 8. If you keep feeling sad persistently for days, consult a psychiatrist 9. Avoid tobacco, alcohol and other drugs 10. Avoid interaction with people who stigmatise or lack knowledge of the virus 11. Maintain a diary or blog 12. Listen to music.

According to the Mahatma Phule police, the murder took place after the victim assaulted the main accused’s friend. The police have identified two people, including the main accused, but are yet to identify their two accomplices. No arrests have been made yet.The victim, Jignesh Thakkar alias Munna bhai alias Muniya, owned a club in Kalyan, and also operated a stone crushing business. From the past few years, he had been running a lottery business and was known as Kalyan’s matka king. According to the police, Thakkar was talking on the phone around 10pm on Friday inside Suyash Plaza building compound, where he has an office. Four bike-borne people reached the spot and shot at Thakkar four-five times and threatened the people present at the spot too.After the accused left, the people present at the spot rushed Thakkar to hospital, but he died on the way. “Three bullets hit the victim and died while he was being taken to the hospital. From the CCTV footage of the spot, we have identified one accused as Dharmesh alias Nitin Shah, while the second accused is Jaypal. We don’t know his second name yet, and are also trying to find out the identities of their two accomplices,” senior police inspector N Bankar of Mahatma Phule police station said. Bankar further added that through initial inquiry, the police have established that Thakkar and Shah were childhood friends and have 15 to 20 criminal cases, including those of extortion, attempt to murder, robbery and murder, registered against them. However, owing to a financial dispute, the two parted ways. On July 27, Thakkar had a huge fight with Shah’s close friend Chetan Patel at Shankar Rao Chowk in Bazarpeth. Patel had also registered a case of assault against Thakkar. “Shah, the main accused in the case, is a close friend of Patel. Shah planned the murder after discovering that Thakkar assaulted his friend. We have registered a case against Shah, Jaypal and the two unidentified accused for murder and criminal intimidation,” deputy commissioner of police V Pansare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/43-year-old-matka-king-shot-dead-in-kalyan/story-v4bCddgXQnNahHlAYHWCoN.html

So far, 103 policemen have succumbed to the infection. This includes 55 victims from the Mumbai Police.According to the Maharashtra Police, while over 100 new cases are being reported daily, the number of cops discharged daily is higher. In the past 24-hours, 238 infected policemen were discharged. Overall 7,414 cops have recovered so far.“Infected policemen are recovering fast and also resuming duty as they are no longer scared of the disease. Initially, policemen were fearful, but as awareness about the disease spread and subsequent precautionary measures were taken, they started carrying out their duties fearlessly while following all safety precautions,” said Vinayak Deshmukh, assistant inspector general of police (law and order).In Mumbai, around 3,800 policemen have tested positive for Covid-19 so far.To protect police personnel and boost early detection, the top brass of the Mumbai Police organised mass rapid antigen testing for its personnel.In the first phase of testing, only those policemen in the 44-55 age group who worked in infection-prone areas were tested. In the next phase, younger policemen will undergo testing.So far, 77 personnel from Mumbai Police have tested positive after 3,446 policemen underwent rapid antigen testing in South, East, Central, and West regions.

01-08-2020||Mumbai||At 2.04 lakh, July topped in Covid tests in city: BMC data||The city saw a rise in Covid testing in July, with 2.04 lakh samples being tested, compared to 1.32 lakh in June and 1.2 lakh in May, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The number of average daily tests, too, went up to 6,600 in July, from 4,422 in June and 3,872 in May. The overall positivity rate has gone up to 21% as of July 31, from 20% on June 1 and 9% on May 1. As of July 31, Mumbai had conducted 5.37 lakh tests. BMC started to screen fliers at the airport since January 18. The first test was conducted on February 3 and first positive case was reported on March 11. The one-lakh-testing-mark was crossed on May 6, two lakh on June 1, three lakh on June 24, four lakh on July 14 and five lakh on Wednesday. Although Mumbai’s testing has increased, it is lower compared to Delhi, which has carried out 10.13 lakh tests until July 30. In May, BMC had conducted over 1 lakh tests, of which around 31,000 were positive. In June, around 36,500 cases were detected against around 1.20 lakh tests. In July, Mumbai recorded around 35,000 cases from around 2 lakh tests. According to BMC officials, the testing numbers have gone up owing to usage of rapid antigen kits and liberalised testing policy. The civic body last month procured 1 lakh rapid antigen kits, which give results in 30 minutes. Further, on July 7, BMC liberalised testing policy allowing any citizen to and get tested without the prescription of any medical practitioner A BMC official said, “In the first half of July, we were testing 5,000-7,000 samples. However, in the second half of July, we tested 7,000-11,000 samples a day. This was possible due to aggressive usage of rapid antigen kits, and liberalised testing policy.” Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner of BMC, had last week told HT that of the total tests being conducted daily, 30-35% are conducted using rapid antigen kits. Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant, said, “The more samples we test, the earlier we will detect those having Covid-19. Early detection will also help bring down the fatality rate, which is over 5% in Mumbai. Also, BMC should undertake sero survey on a larger scale in locations such as Dharavi, Worli, Chembur, Deonar and parts of central Mumbai that were earlier hot spots. This will give a better understanding for tracing and testing strategy.” On Saturday, Mumbai recorded 1,047 fresh cases and 45 new deaths, taking the city’s case tally to 115,331 and toll to 6,398. The number of discharged patients in Mumbai was 87,906, with a recovery rate of 76.22%, and active cases stood at 20,731. The fatality rate was 5.54%, and doubling rate 77 days. Dharavi, an earlier hot spot, recorded only four new cases on Saturday, bringing the area’s count to 2,560, of which 2,235 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-2-04-lakh-july-topped-in-covid-tests-in-city-bmc-data/story-eoi9XgirhIqSE6nyqczjFN.html

Two of the accused are 15 years old, while the other two are 16 and 17 years old. The also threatened the boy of dire consequences if he revealed the crime. The incident came to light last week when the boy visited his aunt’s house and she observed changes in his behaviour. The boy’s aunt said that he also suffered from pain, after which she took him to a private doctor. However, the treatment did not help the boy and his aunt took him to Rajawadi Hospital, where the doctor informed her that her nephew was sexually assaulted. She then filed a complaint with the police and a first information report (FIR) was registered on Thursday. The four minors are booked under sections 377 (unnatural offences), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) and 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012. “After the lockdown was imposed, the accused left the hostel and went to their respective villages. We are probing the case further,” said Senior inspector Sushil Kamble from Tilak Nagar police station said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-minors-booked-for-sexually-assaulting-14-year-old-at-hostel-in-mumbai/story-z6tJIvwb4Wi4PsjEA3kVkJ.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra cyber police issue advisory about ‘virtual kidnappings’||The state cyber police on Saturday issued an advisory to alert citizens about virtual kidnappings, a new modus operandi used by cyber fraudsters for ransom. As per the advisory, parents whose children are studying or staying abroad are targeted. “Eight such cases have been reported in the US and 15 in Australia this year. This could happen in India as well, and hence, we are alerting citizens about it,” Yashashvi Yadav, special inspector general of police (Cyber). The gang calls children living abroad posing as security officers and tells them that their hostel or house is surrounded by attackers and asks them to switch off their phones. The fraudsters could also send a parcel to the child and later call them, posing as officials from their embassy, to inform that the parcel is linked to illegal activities. The fraudster then recommends the child to switch off the phone and go in hiding for some days. After that, fraudsters call parents and tell them their child has been kidnapped and demand ransom in cryptocurrency or wire transfers. Fraudsters use ‘DeepFakes’, fake videos or audio recordings of the child created using technology, to ensure that the act does not seem staged. As the parents are unable to contact their child, they pay the ransom.The police requested citizens to be alert and not fall prey to such frauds, adding that if they find themselves in such a situation, they should first inform the local police and also check if the ‘kidnapping’ calls are actually from their child’s phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cyber-police-issue-advisory-about-virtual-kidnappings/story-tnBrg2LHFBEZ9d7odlsGUJ.html

As most of the families are not able to do it as they are already infected or they fear getting infected, we will do it,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner. The civic body has paid for around 40 cremations over the past four-five days. As per KDMC, it spends around ₹4,000-₹5,000 on each body for cremation in the traditional method using stand and wood. The cost covers wood, staffers and diesel required for the process.“Earlier, when most of the bodies were cremated through gas method, machines often failed due to the continuous cremation and the load. So we have now decided to help families do the cremation through traditional way, and that too free of cost. The civic body will bear the entire expense,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.

01-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Labour dept initiates work on unified database for workers, industries||Gurugram: To ensure that all information pertaining to workers and commercial enterprises is available through a single platform, the Haryana government has decided to create a unified database, called the Haryana Udhyam Memorandum (HUM), which will have information about all shops, MSMEs (micro small and medium enterprises), as well as large and mega industries in the state. The details of all their employees would also be registered on the database. The government has decided to launch a six-month-long campaign to register the different entities across the state.The HUM database was launched by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on June 6.Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who was in Gurugram on Thursday, said that unique identification numbers will be issued to these enterprises and the other departments concerned have been asked to expedite the registration of stakeholders. “The decision to create a unified portal has been taken after the experience of handling the emerging situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Chautala, adding that information on a single platform would enable easier formulation and execution of welfare policies.Officials also said that the HUM portal will provide real time data for flexible policy planning and to meet emerging situations like the coronavirus pandemic, as lack of quality data with regard to commercial entities, migrant workers and employees acted as a handicap while carrying out relief operations.Following the directions of the state, Gurugram’s labour department on Saturday said it has written letters to all industrial associations and major contractors in the city to get themselves registered with HUM and seed the details of the employees. According to officials, HUM is a user friendly portal wherein users can fill in the details of their enterprises and workers with ease.At present, over 506 industrial units and 480 commercial units from across the state are registered on the HUM portal but registration of workers seems not to have started, as per details on the portal. Gurugram has around 20,000 large and small industrial units which operate in industrial areas developed by the government, as well as in old industrial clusters. “We are reaching out to industrial units across the district and have asked them to register at the earliest. The details of the workers will have to be seeded and this exercise will be carried out for the next six months,” said Manish Sharma, additional labour commissioner, NCR, Haryana.As per the labour department, all establishments in the city, including industrial units, shops and commercial establishments, in due course will have to seed the details of their employees on the portal so that the workers can get benefits under the Employee’s Provident Fund (EPF) rules and Employees State Insurance (ESI) Act.Sharma also said that in the next six months, all organisations employing contractual workers will have to get a HUM number and the registration of contractors and workers will be done through Aadhaar numbers. The government has also proposed to take action against firms as well as individuals who do not register by February, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-labour-dept-initiates-work-on-unified-database-for-workers-industries/story-8DiitNlsygoVWrKaI28iEN.html

01-08-2020||City||FYJC admissions: New portal has list of all Mumbai Metropolitan Region colleges, details||Students who apply for a first-year junior college (FYJC) seat will now get to see the list of available college options under a new option, ‘Know your eligibility’, introduced on the online admission portal this year. The portal will also have details of all colleges in a region such as fees and subjects offered. For 2020-21, around 3.19 lakh seats will be up for grabs in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) across 819 colleges. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad inaugurated the portal for FYJC (https://11thadmission.org.in) on Saturday afternoon. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the education department has introduced a zero-contact admission process for students in six regions across the state – Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati. Students can complete the entire admission process, from filling their admission forms to confirming their seat in an allotted college, online this year. More than 1.92 lakh students registered on the portal until Saturday evening, of which over 1.72 lakh are from state board schools. “We understand the current situation and associated challenges and have hence simplified the process for admissions. We have tried to address the glitches reported in the previous years to make the process smooth,” said Gaikwad. This year, the department has added several features to the admission portal. In addition to the feature that allows students to check previous cut-offs and colleges in their score range, the portal will allow them to address their grievances with respect to filling forms online. Students from IGCSE and ICSE boards who usually have to approach guidance centres to get their grades converted to marks for the admission process can now do it on the portal itself. Students will also be given a three-month window period to submit their original documents to the college. From August 1, the portal opened for students to fill Part 1 of their form, which includes basic details. The department will later notify students on the dates for filling Part 2, which includes entering marks and college preferences. The department also plans to roll out a mobile application. “It has been tested and will be launched soon,” said an official from the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fyjc-admissions-new-portal-has-list-of-all-mumbai-metropolitan-region-colleges-details/story-fSmHHwATfbG53uk9wpdvDK.html

Under the pretext of extending the complainant’s credit limit from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh, the caller obtained her other card details such as CVV number and the card’s expiry date,” said an officer.Under the pretext of completing the procedure, the accused told the victim that the system would generate passwords to complete the process and the victim would have to share it to proceed with the process.As per her instructions, the woman shared the passwords (OTPs). The amount was then deducted from her account. When inquired about it, the caller told her that it’s a part of the process and once her credit card’s limit is exceeded to ₹2 lakh she would get all her money back in her account, the police said.In July first week when the complainant received her credit card’s statement, she realised that ₹2 lakh had not been credited back and the caller woman was a fraud.The complainant then filed an online complaint and on Thursday registered an FIR at Mahim police station.The police have begun the probe and are obtaining call details of the phone number used in the crime and also obtaining details of the fraudulent transactions from the concerned bank and e-wallet service provider.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/66-year-old-duped-of-2-lakh-in-an-online-fraud/story-WAy8ekMhM3qpPB9j9iLoDK.html

01-08-2020||City||Three booked for black marketing of rice||The Navi Mumbai police on Friday booked three persons and busted a rice black-marketing racket. Police have also seized 110-tonne (1.10 lakh kg) rice worth ₹33 lakh. According to police, the trio had been allegedly black-marketing the subsidised rice allotted under the public distribution system for the last three months. The accused illegally bought 110-tonne (1.10 lakh kg) rice meant for the poor in the ration shops in Solapur. They, then, exported the rice to Dhaka, Qatar and Madagascar and sold them for three times the price. The accused identified as Bhimashankar Khade, Iqbal Kazi and Laxman Patel are currently at large. With the help of his co-accused, he would store it at Kazi’s warehouse located along the Mumbai-Goa highway in Palasphe. Once the consignment was brought over to the warehouse, they would break the seals of the rice sacks and refill it in other sacks with ‘Asian Rice’ printed on it. Once the rice was repackaged, Patel, a Ghatkopar resident, would export it to countries like Dhaka, Qatar and Madagascar. Kazi is the director of the warehouse, said police. “We seized 110-tonne of rice valued at ₹33 lakh from the godown along the highway. The rice was brought to the warehouse in four containers in the last four to five days,” said Ashok Dudhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2. During the raid, the police found workers at the warehouse, who were segregating and loading the sacks. The daily wage workers were employed by the accused and their statements are being recorded. Police said they were not aware that the rice was black marketed. “The accused were essentially selling the rice under a new name called Asian Rice and then exporting it for a profit. We suspect they were making Rs 25 profit for every kg of rice exported. Patel, the exporter, was previously booked under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and Khade also has a cheating case registered against him at Bhoiwada police station dating back to 2001,” said an officer from Panvel police station. The police have also procured CCTV footage which established that the accused were involved in the racket for at least three to four months. The accused have been booked under sections of Essential Commodities Act, said Ajay Kumar Landge, senior inspector at Panvel police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-booked-for-black-marketing-of-rice/story-SCMEiP46rBIvZ5tBnmNELL.html

The illegal liquor factories in Khanna and Ghanaur were being run by Congress leaders while the material used for making spurious liquor in Ghanaur was being supplied by a SAD leader.”While demanding compensation for the families of the deceased, Bains said that the state government should tighten the noose around the liquor mafia, otherwise the LIP will plan an agitation against the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooch-tragedy-bains-demands-rs-1-crore-compensation-for-victims-families/story-Ig1R0xbVU41G2VQ864MfuK.html

As elsewhere in the state, lockdown has seen a spike in smuggling as well as recovery. Police have recovered over 30,000 litre illicit liquor in the region this year.A police officer said most illegal production cases were in rural areas due to shortage and costlier availability of liquor during the lockdown.Jalandhar district has seen the registration of 810 FIRs, with 791 accused being put in jail and 65,000 liquor bottles being seized.

01-08-2020||Mumbai||Can’t exclude days from period of actual detention for default bail: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday held that no period from actual detention, especially the day of first remand of the accused and that of filing of the charge sheet, can be excluded from consideration while counting the period for default bail.“The period envisaged under Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) has to be calculated from first date of remand order and the said day cannot be excluded,” said justice PD Naik while granting default bail to Deepak Kudalkar, who was arrested by Navghar police for cheating and criminal breach of trust.He was arrested on February 26, 2020, the day on which an FIR was registered against him. He was produced before a magistrate and was remanded in police custody the same day.On May 26, 2020, he applied for bail contending that the period of 90 days for filing charge sheet against him was over on May 25, and thus he was entitled to default bail as provided for in section 167(2) of the CrPC.An additional sessions judge at Thane, however, rejected his plea after the police filed charge sheet on May 26 itself. The sessions court concluded that the date of first remand and the date of filing of charge sheet were excluded from the period of 60 or 90 days — depending on the punishment provided in the sections applied in the case, as per sections 9 and 10 of the General Clauses Act.Kudalkar then moved HC contending that he was entitled to default bail and the two days could not be excluded from the statutory period, as done by the sessions court.Justice Naik accepted his arguments. After perusing case law on the subject, the judge held that the provisions of the General Clauses Act were inapplicable in the case and “there cannot be exclusion of any period from authorised detention while computing the period of 60 days or 90 days as the case may be by invoking provisions of General Clauses Act”.HC then held that Kudalkar was entitled to default bail as no charge sheet had been filed till the time he applied for default bail on his 91st day in detention, and ordered that the accused be released on furnishing personal bond in the sum of ₹50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-exclude-days-from-period-of-actual-detention-for-default-bail-hc/story-cN7eiwopZZT948zx7F4cyK.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: HC strikes down special court’s observation||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday struck down observations made by the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court, that offences of cheating and criminal breach of trust were “made out” against all the accused in the Yes Bank fraud case.CBI has booked Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapur and Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 7 (public servant taking gratification), 12 (abetment of offences), and 13(2) (criminal misconduct) r/w. 13(1)(d) (obtaining any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by any corrupt or illegal means or by abusing position) of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988.However, on July 17, the special CBI court found that the investigation agency (CBI) had not applied to obtain sanction to prosecute the accused persons under provisions of the PC Act, as required under section 19 of the said Act. It remitted the case for trial to the metropolitan magistrate concerned and observed that the charges under the IPC sections were close to being proved.The special court had said that it would not be proper and legal to keep the proceedings pending for an indefinite period in the hopes that the prosecution would apply for sanction in regards to the PC act charges.The Wadhawans had moved the HC, taking strong exception to the observation, contending that it was likely to cause prejudice against them.Justice Anuja Prabhudessai found substance in their objection. The judge said the observation was made without any application of mind, as on the relevant date, the special court only considered the aspect of want of sanction to prosecute and remitted the matter to the magistrate.“It is thus evident that the impugned observations have been made for the purpose of remitting the proceedings to the metropolitan magistrate, and that there was no application of mind for arriving at a prima facie conclusion that offences under sections 420, 409 r/w 120B of the IPC are in fact, made out against all the accused,” said the judge.“The apprehension of the applicants, that these observations may leave no discretion unto the learned metropolitan magistrate... cannot be said to be baseless,” she said and clarified that the magistrate shall proceed with the matter without being influenced by the observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-hc-strikes-down-special-court-s-observation/story-ToCQIUK4YD05QVVTivOAkP.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Memories and poetry brewed with tea and a little sugar||Making myself a glass full of tea, I glance after many years at the volume of memoirs and poems in English translated from Punjabi, of poet Lal Singh Dil. On the front cover he is referred to as the Poet of the Revolution, but the back cover carries lines of his poem negating the title. The poem reads: For us trees do not bear fruits, For us Flowers do not bloom, For us there is no spring, For us there is no Revolution! Memory not being what it was, I wonder at the contradiction between the title and the poem. But then life is often a jumble. Then I turn the pages of the book and somehow spill a little tea on a page with my shaky hands. In panic I try to rub it off but the pale brown stain is there for keeps and on the next page I find the picture of the poet pouring steaming tea from a jug with half a smile on his lips.And there I am in the tea shack opposite the motor market on Machiwara road in Samrala town, which I would once frequent to meet the legendary poet of Naxalbari. He is acknowledged till date as one of the top 20 poets of Punjabi with his poetry inviting research and scholars penning copious thesis. Dil too had dreamt of a revolution and a time when he would no longer be the outcaste whose bowl had to be thrown into fire for purification after he had sipped his tea and the water jug at the party meeting would not be pulled away when he tried to reach out to it for some water. Well, such are the contradictions of a caste-ridden society and he realised that for the Dalits there was no revolution. The comrades of his Naxalbari days had returned to their folds and were now editors, executives, professors, businessmen or expatriates.Dil was the first of his tanner clan to complete school. His mother had to sell the only pair of gold earrings she possessed to buy him a bicycle to pursue a junior basic teacher training course. He would have come up in life but then came the dream of the revolution and claimed him as one of its own. However, when the dream died, he had nowhere to go. So after jail, police torture and harassment of his family members, he chose exile in the fruit orchards as a caretaker, embraced Islam to escape the caste stigma; convinced that ‘Allah is very kind to Maoists because he understands cultures!’ This was what he wrote to his poet friend Amarjit Chandan in explanation of choosing to convert to Islam and have a religion to call his own. Alas! He was to find that even there caste existed.When he returned home to Samrala and was desolate after his mother’s death friends tried to help by setting up the tea shack with wooden planks nailed together. Dil found in the drug addict upper caste friend Pala a partner and happily poured tea from a dented jug into the glasses in a tote for the drivers, mechanics, teachers and writers who frequented his shack in the motor market. When free he would scribble some lines in between or talk to the literati that gathered there to discuss poetry and politics. And I awaited my tumbler of tea, asking for a little less sugar and a little more ginger in the brew. Tea shacks were my haunt all through youth but tea had never tasted as good as it did in downtown Samrala!The tea shop closed after Pala’s death when, disoriented, Dil forgot to keep accounts or collect payments. When I went to meet him years later in his one-room brick home built on the family plot of Chamar Basti with a little open space, I found the wooden planks of the tea shop stacked in the ‘kacha kotha’, perhaps for firewood. A little flower bed in a corner had a couple of red roses blooming amid green leaves. And his little hungry grand-niece would come crawling up the stairs to take a sweet from the kind old man who knew that her mother’s breasts did not have enough milk for her. No matter how hard life is, Lal, there is always room for a few green leaves, a child’s smile and some sweetness. Oh! Let me add a little more sugar to my tea.nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-memories-and-poetry-brewed-with-tea-and-a-little-sugar/story-0m9bjSiB4LDhRDkOorKfxI.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||AICTE approval for 100 institutes to start admissions in 2020-21||Over 100 new professional institutes for engineering, management, and pharmacy have received approval from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to start admissions from the 2020-21 academic year. Keeping in mind the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19, for the first time, AICTE approved these colleges by scrutinising all necessary documents online and conducting a virtual tour of the institute to check the infrastructure, before signing off on their approvals.According to figures shared by AICTE, a total of 58 new engineering diploma and degree colleges have been approved for the 2020-21 academic year, increasing the overall intake capacity by 16,333 seats. However, due to the gradual decline in overall demand for engineering seats, more than 600 engineering institutes have sought a reduction in their intake capacity, and another 140 institutes across the country have asked for permission to shut down completely. This will further bring down the total intake capacity of engineering institutes by over 1.22 lakh in the upcoming academic year.In a statement released in May, the council had clarified that the requirement of documents remains the same as for the previous few years. “We devised online scrutiny of documents and virtual institute inspections in order to proceed with approval of new colleges. This was done as the approval process could not be delayed any further, and therefore, we had to come up with a viable solution,” said Anil Sahasrabuddhe, chairman, AICTE. He added that the online scrutiny has been at par with any physical scrutiny done in the past.Once again this year, not a single new engineering institute has received approval in Maharashtra for 2020-21, as yet.Last year, new approvals made way for 54,618 seats across diploma, undergraduate (UG) and post-graduate (PG) institutes. However, the total intake capacity of engineering institutes went down by over 2.20 lakh, which included 99,806 diploma seats and 1.20 lakh UG and PG seats, owing to either closure of institutes or divisions in certain sectors.“Engineering institutes across the country have been suffering, and a majority of them have not managed to attract enough students over the years. The ban on new engineering institutes has been to ensure control over the mushrooming of institutes that don’t promise quality education,” said Sahasrabuddhe.Since the two-year ban on new engineering institutes was implemented starting 2020, several institutes have sought permission to start new branches in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Data Science and Analytics, and Robotics.“Several branches of engineering, including civil and mechanical, are attracting very few students off late due to the low job offers they get. The software industry, on the other hand, is continuously evolving and thus, attracting good jobs and students,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra. He added that reducing seats in redundant branches and giving a boost to new dimensions in the field are moves welcomed by engineering aspirants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aicte-approval-for-100-institutes-to-start-admissions-in-2020-21/story-j4CaCg1x2hO653JOws0NhP.html

For Kinder Kaur, 40, and Sona, 16, of Sangha village, 5km from the district headquarters, these are the last memories of Manjit Singh, 45. Manjit was their breadwinner and pulled a rickshaw for a living, despite a disability with his right hand. Kinder and Sona are also polio afflicted.At last count, Manjit was just one among nearly 90 persons, who have died after consuming spurious liquor in Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts over the past few days. Manjit had drunk illicit liquor on Thursday night. “As soon as entered home, he threw up and complained of stomach pain. We rushed him to Tarn Taran civil hospital, where he succumbed on Friday morning,” said Kinder. She added, “I and my son were dependent on him. Liquor has destroyed my family, which was already struggling for livelihood.” Nirvail Singh, a resident of Sangha, said, “Manjit had purchased illicit liquor from Resham Singh’s home in the village itself. Resham also drank from the same lot and he died on Saturday morning. Resham is survived by his four daughters, wife and mother.” He added that the government must give compensation to both families. KILL ME ALSO, SAYS WIFE OF LABOURERLakhwinder Singh, 55, a labourer of Kang village, falling under Khadoor Sahib sub-division, has left behind his wife Kirandeep Kaur, 50. The couple had no children. “I married Lakhwinder 30 years ago. We had no children, but we were living happily. Now, the liquor has stolen all my happiness. What will I do by living alone now, I should also die,” said Kirandeep. She alleged that her husband had purchased illicit liquor from Pal Singh and Meek Singh of the village (both brothers). She added, “Pal Singh and his family have been selling illicit liquor for decades. Villagers had approached the police, but no action was taken. Pal and his family have been protected by Congress leaders of the area.”Her nephew, Gurpreet Singh, said, “Police and politicians are the real killers of my uncle. If they had acted to stop the selling of hooch, several lives would have been saved.”3-YEAR-OLD REFUSES TO LET GO OF PAPA’s PHOTOMuchhal (Amritsar) Physical challenges were already creating hurdles for him. The only breadwinner in his family, Joga Singh, 32, another victim, was a construction labourer. He aspired for a good life and planned to get a washroom constructed in his house. “My husband rarely partook of liquor earlier, except at weddings. On Wednesday evening, the mason, who was working to build the washroom in our house, asked my husband to bring liquor worth Rs. 20. They drank and he died, ruining my life,” said Paramjit Kaur, who has two kids—son, 7, and daughter, 3. When this correspondent asked her to show photo of her husband, the daughter did not want to let go of the photo of ‘Papa’. “I don’t how will my sister live, because she is also handicapped. The announcement made by the government to give compensation is not enough, as Rs 2 lakh is small amount. Secondly, a government job should be given to all the kin”, said Manjit Kaur, sister-in-law of Joga Singh.FARMER’S WIDOW SEEKS DEATH FOR HOOCH SELLER Jaswinder Singh, 37, of Muchhal village was a farmer, but the family owned only 3 kanal land.

01-08-2020||Mumbai||Decline in shark species due to flawed fishing practices, fin trade: Report||Unsustainable fishing practices, excessive juvenile bycatch and illegal shark fin trade are leading to a rapid decline of threatened, vulnerable, and critically endangered sharks and allied species.A report published by the Mangrove Foundation under the state forest department (mangrove cell) has documented such practices along commercially important landing sites, where high-density of elasmobranch population along the Maharashtra coast was leading to overall habitat degradation at fishing grounds. Elasmobranchs are sharks, skates, rays and sawfish that have a skeleton made of cartilage instead of bone. Their distribution ranges from near-shore regions to the deep oceanic waters.Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner, state fisheries department said, “This is an extremely serious issue. We will call for exact details from the forest department and see to it that immediate action is taken for the shark fin trade while sensitising fishers against juvenile fish catch is being undertaken.”The report identified a fish landing centre in Satpati, Palghar where the capture of eight shark species, including some part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, saw their fins removed and kept out to dry. Though fishers admitted they were stored for trade, it was not clear whether these fins were meant for export purposes.Shark fin import and export was banned by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 2015.“Satpati is famous for pomfret fisheries that operate using gillnet gear. Different mesh sizes lead to a variety of sharks getting caught. Locals separate their meat, body parts and fin. When we asked where fins are sold, they refused to share the information,” said Dhanashree Bagade, author of the report and marine biologist, Mangrove Foundation. “Similar reports have been received from Malvan but we did not find proof of such activities.” Shark fishing is not illegal in India. Only catching protected species (10 sharks – see box) are prohibited by law, and are considered illegal.The study identified 34 elasmobranch species - 14 sharks, 15 rays and five species of wedges, sawfish and guitarfish - being caught across Satpati, Sassoon Dock, New Ferry Wharf, and Versova in Mumbai, Alibag in Raigad, Harnai in Ratnagiri and Malvan in Sindhudurg along the Maharashtra coast including Mumbai. “Maximum quantity was identified across fish landing centres in Mumbai owing to the highest number of boats with fishing grounds from south Ratnagiri to the Gujarat coast. Species including Hammerhead shark and Blacktip shark juveniles were spotted at Mumbai, Malvan, and Harnai,” said Bagade.Of 34 species caught, 31 were identified by marine biologists. Of these, eight species each fell under vulnerable, endangered, and near-threatened categories of the IUCN Regional Red List while one species of guitarfish (schedule I under WPA) was critically endangered. “The most striking factor was 18 of the 31 species caught or 58% were juvenile elasmobranchs,” said Bagade. The study was undertaken between April and December 2019.Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell) said, “There is a need for capacity building and sensitisation within the fishing community. More research on affected habitats and species risk is needed, which our small grants research projects are looking into.”Experts said conservation actions require stakeholder involvement and practical measures. “By catching threatened fauna and increasing juvenile catch is a threat to vulnerable marine fisheries of Maharashtra. Mitigations are limited or challenging and don’t apply to all species or all fishing gear together. We have to think about practical options without affecting livelihood taking all stakeholders on board,” said Anulekshmi Chellappan, scientist-in-charge, CMFRI Mumbai.WHY SHARK FINS?Shark-fins are one of the most luxurious fish products in the world that get higher prices in the export market. The white fins gave a superior yield than the black fins. Fins are used as shark fin soup, a delicacy in China and various parts of South-East Asia. “The value of the shark fin ranges between Rs.1000 to Rs.15,000 per kg in the international market, making it a lucrative clandestine business. After catching protected shark species, fishermen remove the fin, scale the skin, and finally collect a bone-like ray that is used as soup sticks in China and other Southeast Asian countries, mostly to enhance flavour. The rays are packed in stacks and shown as wood so they are not detected by customs or coast guard. The value of the fin for ranges from Rs.1000 – 5000 for sharks that are allowed to be caught, and fins of protected schedule 1 species sells as high as Rs.15,000 since they are protected along Indian waters,” said E Vivekandanan, former principal scientist and current national consultant at CMFRI.YEAR WISE SHARK LANDINGS IN MAHARASHTRAMaharashtra witnessed its lowest annual fish catch in 45 years in 2019, as per the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). Shark captures witnessed a 43% drop from 2018. Other elasmobranch species caught include Skates, rays, eels, and catfish. They are exploited by a variety of fishing gears like gill nets, long lines and trawls along the Indian coast by both traditional and mechanised sectors. While guitarfish and wedge fish capture marginally increased while 446.5-ton rays were caught. The drop in catch was owing to extreme weather events and successive cyclones in the Arabian Sea that reduced fish catch day.2019 - 1299 tons2018 - 2295 tons2017 – 3086 tons2016 – 3031 tons2015 – 3548 tons2014 – 4780 tons2013 – 4550 tons(Source: CMFRI)SPECIES AT RISKProtected under Wildlife laws: Whale sharks, tiger sharks, white sharks, Speartooth sharks, and other elasmobranch species such as hammerhead sharks, pointed sawfish, Largetooth sawfish, Longcomb sawfish, and guitarfish. 14 species at risk according to the study: Spadenose shark, Tiger shark, Grey dog shark, Milk dog shark, Black tip shark, Spot tail shark, Bull shark, Scalloped Hammerhead shark, Hard nose shark, Grey bamboo shark, Ridgeback catshark, Thresher shark, Fawn shark, Graceful shark.(Source: Mangrove Foundation Research)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decline-in-shark-species-due-to-flawed-fishing-practices-fin-trade-report/story-eCjjvH9jLDGj6O4Upik2JL.html

01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Random forays: Our world needs true leaders today||The world needs true leaders more than ever before. The happenings of our world do not, by and large, inspire in us any confidence about the current crop of individuals who lead their countries. We live in such connected times that it is easy to know what goes on in the back alleys of Manila or the corridors of power in Venezuela. There is no excuse for shoddy leadership, no place to hide. Why is humanity unable to produce inspirational and impactful leaders in this era of widespread knowledge and high learning? Why, despite all the mind-boggling progress that the world has made in artificial intelligence and high technology, have we not been able to propel the best of men and women to positions of eminence and power?The recently popular social media post about women leaders who have successfully contained the pandemic in their lands, starkly in contrast to a group of male heads of government who have utterly failed to do so, actually gives us a clue. Women clearly possess minds and hearts which are more empathetic and emotionally refined than do men. Whether such qualities have actually translated into concrete results on the ground as a result of leadership which cares, is a moot point. But it is evident that leaders of nations need to be extra special human beings, which is unfortunately not the case in most countries.All the portals of learning that society can offer, online or on campus, cannot combine to impart the skills of leadership that are actually needed by achievers. Which university for instance offers a course titled “Qualities of the Head and Heart”? It is virtually impossible to inculcate such invaluable nuances into the mindset of any person simply by educating him or her.Contrastingly, the general thought process of society has a major role to play in this process. When divisiveness and self-centredness become the global norm, it is impossible to produce balanced leaders. Leaders like Nelson Mandela and even Barack Obama would perhaps have at least been able to inspire some of the populace to think rightly in order for individuals to give off their best for the larger good.Empathy. level headedness, presence of mind, creative thinking, poise and unstinted inspiration are not injectable tonics which a youngster can gulp down. Families, schools and neighbourhoods must play a large role in infusing such delicate sensibilities into growing youngsters.A society gets the leadership it deserves, after all. Why are we not preparing our youngsters to become visionary, large hearted, compassionate grown ups of the future? The whole emphasis of our educational system seems to be that individual success matters, and everything else can go out of the window. And how many right-thinking youths want to enter the rough and tumble of politics? Only the rare ones, for sure. Even seemingly sane men often become wonky when political power is thrust upon them. Groucho Marx said, “Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies!” Many a promising leader starts appearing like a much deflated version of himself once he is in the hot seat. The grounding which potential leaders must possess and the training which they must undergo have to necessarily be firm and rigorous. In India, bureaucracy, industry and academia have suffered too, on account of often not being led by inspirational human beings with a sense of rectitude and probity. An ability to lead from the front and to stay calm in a crisis are sorely missing too.Perhaps the solution lies in actually incorporating subjects of leadership in school curricula. When leadership becomes our priority, then we will encourage the flowering of superior leadership qualities in our young ones. Role models are needed too. Theoretical imparting of knowledge about leadership will not achieve any perceptible results. Outstanding individuals from all walks of life need to be invited to walk into schools and address the citizens of tomorrow as mentors.As I pause to gaze out of the window into the still azure skies, I sense hope. Humanity loves a challenge. Out of the mire, will surely rise, some real heroes.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-our-world-needs-true-leaders-today/story-8gS6EaQIIi2Ds3YaceMSmM.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Snake with a white bindi||Two species of snakes, encountered rarely in the tricity region, share common aspects. The Common Bronzeback Tree snake sports a distinct white spot on its head. The orange-reddish Black-headed Royal snake displays inky splotches across its body and is the only Indian snake known to change its patterns and colours through its lifetime.Both these species are adept climbers. The very thin tree snake prefers to dwell in twiggy bushes, leafy branches among trees and merges deftly with drooping vines. It has a very long tail and can grow to 5.5 feet. To the uninitiated observer, the sheer agility of tree snakes is mistaken for a magical power to fly among trees! But this is not so as the legendary herpetologist Rom Whitaker points out: “Unlike other snakes, bronzebacks have no fear of falling and regularly jump about branches and to the ground from heights of 10-20m...the female lays about six long, thin eggs in a tree hole or old bird nest...(food is) mainly frogs and lizards. It is not uncommon for bronzebacks to hunt tree frogs and lizards in thatched roofs; consequently they sometimes get into trouble with human occupants.’’Snake rescue personnel in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula have found tree snakes in balconies, backyards and kitchens, especially in the rainy season. The royal snake also nurtures a ferocious climbing ability. In fact, the first record for the tricity of the royal snake was when Salim Khan rescued one specimen hiding in the lofty ceiling of Room No 26, Punjab and Haryana High Court, in June 2011. Referred to as ‘Rajat Bansi’ in the vernacular, the royal snake is a destroyer of rodents and helps farmers. It looks like the venomous Russell’s viper and emulates the viper by hissing madly like a bursting pressure cooker when challenged. Both the royal and tree snakes are basically non-venomous, though the former’s bite is reckoned as possessing a mild toxicity to humans.A FLOWER FROM MEMORY LANE What is more blue, the Indus or the Ladakh sky? Neither, if you have a glad eye for Himalayan flowers! Then, it is the dreamy blue of the Himalayan Blue poppy, deeper than the oceans glimpsed from eyes in the high skies. Last year in July, tourists and travellers were soaking in the awesome spectacles of Ladakh, wondering, and wandering to a blue horizon. No one could have imagined then that a year hence, that ethereal horizon would be lost. A brutal Covid lockdown and LAC tensions turned the paradise into a no-go zone. So, what do we have left but memories. A gorgeous picture of poppies. That juxtaposed the fragility of the flower with the gaunt grandeur of rugged ridges. In turn, they were streaked with a sigh, of ebbing snows.It was a traveller from far away New Zealand and an accomplished photographer, Peter Sheppard, who had chanced upon poppies in July 2019. In his words then, the magical moments.“From New Zealand, late last July, I was heading for Zanskar in the remote Himalayas with Lynne Welch and Tenzin Wangjor. I was interested in seeing the high Himalayan Blue poppy. We were driving towards Zanskar from the wonderfully-isolated setting of Rangdum, which sports a wonderfully-perched monastery. On the drive to Zanskar, we suddenly noticed these rare poppies among rocks close to the road. We stopped, leapt out, and admiringly photographed their intense blue colour and characteristic foliage. As you will know, they are regarded as rare, even endangered,’’ Sheppard told this writer.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-snake-with-a-white-bindi/story-sgQ7shOQ0pFAkqahFYAxVM.html

The state government had sent the funds to the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) office, Ludhiana from where the amount was e-transferred to the schools. Government Primary School, Jahangirpur has received a grant of Rs 9 lakh for construction of three new classrooms. The school, situated at Rahon Road, has five classrooms which had been declared unsafe two years ago. The school authorities had been forced to adjust students of two classes at a nearby dharamsala, another two at Gurdwara Sahib, and one class on the school premises. School head Manmohanjit Singh, said, “This is a big relief for the school as after construction of the rooms, students will get a better learning environment. We have received Rs 9 lakh to get the construction of three new classrooms started.” Government Model Senior Secondary Smart School, Punjab Agricultural University, got Rs 15 lakh to come up with five new rooms as the school strength has reached 4,300. School principal Sanjeev Thapar said, “To accommodate 4,300 students, we require more rooms and authorities have transferred the grants for the construction of the same. We will be constructing the five rooms in the primary section building.” GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL, SUNET RECEIVES GRANT FOR TWO CLASSROOMS Students of Classes 6 and 7 of Sunet’s Government High School had been attending classes in the school’s corridors for the past two years. The public works department had declared one of the school’s two blocks unsafe in the second week of August in 2018. The ‘unsafe’ block had nine rooms, five of which were classrooms while the remaining ones were being used as an office, a clerk room, a home science laboratory, and a chowkidar room. School headmaster Ravinder Singh said, “We have received grants for construction of two classrooms but we require around 15 classrooms to accommodate 805 students. We are already constructing one new classroom with the staff and NRI’s contributions.” Rajinder Kaur, district education officer, elementary, said, “We have transferred the grants to the 17 schools so that construction work can be started by the school authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-govt-schools-receive-75-lakh-grant-for-construction-of-new-classrooms/story-GhASI6rmHbleNqtOmp2yhL.html

01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Bitter times for Ludhiana sweet shop owners ahead of Raksha Bandhan||Sweetshop owners, who were relieved by the government’s decision to reopen confectionaries on the eve of Raksha Bandhan, have reported poor sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic. While a few said business was slowly coming back on track, others said they had never witnessed such slowdown in the market during Raksha Bandhan and the festive fervour was conspicuously missing from the markets. Punjab Halwai Association president Narinder Pal Singh Pappu said, “The decision taken by the state government to open sweet shops on Sunday will help the sector move past the slowdown. Initially, we were expecting low sales. Only 30-35% material is being prepared in comparison to last year, but business has improved ahead of Raksha Bandhan, as residents have started purchasing sweets. We are taking all precautions to avoid spread of infection.”However, few shopkeepers said they were still witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in the countdown to the festival. The owner of Amanz Sweets, Model Town, Shamsher Singh, said,”We have been in business for around 12 years now, but have never witnessed such a poor response during Raksha Bandhan. Fear has gripped the residents and only around 25% people have bought sweets in comparison to the past .” Shopkeepers are hoping for better sales on Sunday. Owner of Chawla sweets in the Field Ganj area Mohinder Pal Singh said, “We have only received a 25%-30% response. Festive fervour is missing from the markets. We hope residents step out of their homes on Sunday and an increase in sales is witnessed.”Social distancing a rare sitePunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s appeal to distribute free masks with sweets received a lukewarm response. While city-based shops were seen distributing masks, shopkeepers in the interior refrained from doing so. Also, social distancing norms were not followed. While shopkeepers were avoiding crowding inside the shops, residents waiting for their turn outside the shops ignored social distancing. Pappu said,”The association has asked every shopkeepers to distribute free masks with sweets and take all precautions required to control spread of disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bitter-times-for-ludhiana-sweet-shop-ownersahead-of-raksha-bandhan/story-ZFxhQ6CL2mncNzpQJispnM.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Drive against dangerous driving in Ludhiana, 13 land in lock-up||Gone are the days when rash drivers were let go with a challan. Nowadays, traffic police personnel in Ludhiana are cracking down on dangerous drivers and jailing them. The Ludhiana traffic police on Saturday initiated a special drive against wrong-side driving and dangerous-driving on National Highway 44 near Basti Jodhewal Chowk. They arrested 13 violators who were caught turning from unauthorised cuts in road dividers.The violators were arrested under Section 202 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic) Gurdev Singh said police had received complaints against people driving on the wrong side of the National Highway-44. He added that instead of issuing challans to such people, they had decided to arrest them. In almost four hours, police arrested 13 violators. They were jailed for a few hours and then released on bail.“Section 202 of the Motor Vehicle Act gives power to a public servant to arrest violators without a warrant. Violations under three sections - Sections 184 (dangerous driving), 185 (drunk driving) and 197 (taking a vehicle without authority) of the Motor Vehicle Act can land one in jail,”said the ACP.“The violators can be imprisoned for around six months or a fine between ₹1,000-₹5,000 can be imposed. Second time offenders can get a fine of ₹5,000-₹10,000 or be imprisoned for up to two years,” he said.The ACP said the drive will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/drive-against-dangerous-driving-in-ludhiana-13-land-in-lock-up/story-ba3JPvDukJwEbXVquzyERN.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh our take: Stop begging in tricity at any cost||UT adviser Manoj Parida’s recent tweet urging Chandigarh residents not to give money to beggars clearly highlights the administration’s failure in rehabilitating beggars. Parida said the beggars could not be jailed since “beggary is not a crime,” to which Rajesh Jogpal, a Haryana-cadre Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer and former Panchkula MC commissioner, responded (also in a tweet): “The Chandigarh administration has adopted Haryana Prevention of Beggary Act 1971, under which beggary is a crime.” Jogpal also said that Chandigarh had three certified institutions to house people nabbed for begging. Provisions say they can’t be jailed, but put in these institutions. Given that the tricity is also coping with the Covid-19 pandemic, to have people subsisting on meagre earnings from begging, living in unhygienic conditions and sleeping in the open is clearly an invitation to disaster. Not just that, to have families without a source of income, living under the open skies with no idea where their next meal is coming from, underlines the failure of society to provide them the requisite support to help them join the mainstream. Tricity authorities should realise that simply allowing people to beg reflects badly on them and on their will, administrative capabilities or whatever you choose to call it, to do everything possible to end this problem. Right thinking individuals in charge should put their heads together to look for a way out – including providing beggars skills training, mental and physical health treatment, drug rehabilitation, education and work. A sustained rehabilitation programme to mainstream them with a source of livelihood as well as social intervention seems to be the best solution.People who give money to beggars and encourage idleness and crime should also be penalised. The lockdown after the Covid-19 outbreak too has led to millions of jobs drying up. If urgent measures are not taken going forward to generate more employment, begging and associated health and law and order problems are set to rise exponentially.Can an exhaustive survey be undertaken to identify beggars in the tricity and cross-border checks imposed to make them stay within their own territories? From family planning measures to education – can the remaining beggars then be monitored and rehabilitated? This is the time to put an end to an age-old scourge that Indians have become accustomed to living with. How society can figure out a way to do this is the bigger question. THE END What is the best solution to the problem of begging?What needs to be done to stop this problem of begging?

01-08-2020||Dehradun||India’s first snow leopard conservation centre to come up in Uttarakhand||Taking another step towards conservation of elusive snow leopards, India’s first Snow Leopard Conservation Centre will be opened in Uttarkashi forest division in Uttarakhand, officials informed.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat along with state forest minister and officials from the state forest department took a meeting in this regard on Saturday. The conservation centre will be built by the Uttarakhand forest department along United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of its six-year long project, SECURE Himalayas. The project aims at securing livelihoods, conservation, sustainable use and restoration of high range Himalayan ecosystems. The project also looks into conversation of snow leopards and other endangered species and their habitats, found in Himalayas. This project was started in 2017. Chief minister Rawat said that special efforts should be made to conserve and increase the number of snow leopards in the state. “Areas where snow leopards have been seen in the last few years, such areas should be identified by the forest department in collaboration with local people and military forces. Snow leopards should be estimated in these areas by making grids. The conservation of snow leopards and other wildlife in the area will give a boost to winter tourism in the state,” said Rawat. He said that there are many species of wildlife in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand, which become the centre of attraction for tourists. The chief minister was apprised by officials that snow leopards have been frequently sighted in in Uttarkashi and Pithoragarh districts but an estimation has not been conducted so far. There are currently 86 snow leopards in Uttarakhand based on various researches. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand said that the conservation centre will be built at a place named Lanka, near Bhaironghati bridge in Uttarkashi district. “The snow leopard conservation centre aims to protect the animal with the help local community and also give employment to locals from nearby villages through tourism. Today (Saturday) a presentation was made in front of the chief minister where the design of the conservation centre and other details were discussed,” said the chief wildlife warden. Rajiv Bhartari, chairman of Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board who was also a part of the meeting said that the aim of the conservation centre is to generate awareness amongst people about the elusive big cat. “Architect Anne Feenstra shared details of how the snow leopard conservation centre will be; it will have three blocks, a learning block, a café block and a forest department facility. Given that the centre will be made at such a height, the structure is very important so that it withstands the extreme snowfall and the heat level is maintained in a sustainable manner,” said Bhartari. He added that the centre through the café block and souvenir shops aims to give employment to locals from five villages in that area.

This way we can ensure proper bed management, and improve contact tracing, which will help us identify more positive patients,” said Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, said, “It is true that the coordination needs to improve. Data from private labs goes directly to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It also creates differences between PMC and state Covid numbers every day. We are working on it and in the next two -three days, the issue will be sorted out.”The state government had allowed private labs to conduct Covid-19 tests after ICMR approval and even fixed the test rates. However, there have been a series of complaints that labs are not submitting information to the PMC. Earlier, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol had even raised questions about the coordination between private labs and the administration. The mayor appealed to the administration to appoint a deputy collector level officer to ensure better management.During a meeting with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, the mayor and other representatives had raised this issue as many patients were reported running from one hospital to another hospital in search of beds. The chief minister asked the administration to ensure that private labs submit all information of positive patients to the PMC.A patient from Vishrantwadi, said, “We got tested at a private lab and three members of our family were positive. We preferred to go for home isolation. Irony is that PMC was not aware that we tested positive for Covid and did nothing to isolate us in our society and did not even call us to cross check. We came to know that the PMC did not get our information from the lab. We called the PMC and informed them of our results. However, no one came forward to check our contacts. We, then, informed all the people we met and requested them to get tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-administration-meet-pvt-labs-ask-them-to-first-submit-reports-to-authorities/story-d1Si6WJnmICqSCe27trGhN.html

01-08-2020||Chandigarh||A juvenile can’t be denied bail merely on report of threat to life: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that merely an apprehension that a juvenile in conflict with law could be harmed, is no ground to deny bail.The HC bench of Justice GS Sandhawalia said that bail to a juvenile ‘is a rule’. “It will not be fair as such that he should continue to be detained in juvenile home on this aspect,” the court said, while referring to a social background report which had been furnished by the child welfare police officer, wherein it is observed that life of a child in conflict with law is in danger if he is set free.The court said that if there is any danger to life of the juvenile, it is for his family to approach the state to protect him from the threat perception. “If he is not released on bail, he will only be exposed to other children who have also been detained on account of having committed offences. The ends of justice will not be served if the petitioner is kept in juvenile home during pendency of trial. Possibility of the petitioner being misguided by other accused in calling the deceased cannot be discounted,” the bench observed, ordering his release on bail. The court also took note of the fact that he and his family had no other criminal cases against them.The order came in a bail plea filed by a juvenile, aged 16 years. The juvenile was among three persons booked in a murder case reported in November 2019. The allegations were that the boy called the deceased on some pretext and then two more persons joined in and the victim was allegedly burnt to death.The crime was a result of the victim’s brother marrying the sister of two other accused against wishes of the family. The Juvenile Justice Board had denied bail in December 2019.The order was upheld by the district and sessions court, Mansa, in February this year, which prompted the family to approach HC. The Mansa court had denied bail observing that the juvenile will be exposed to physical danger since the dispute arose out of honour killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-juvenile-can-t-be-denied-bail-merely-on-report-of-threat-to-life-hc/story-dvPMbCoMg0YLuDFrZPdwFL.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Is it so difficult to wear masks, questions Punjab CM||Taking a serious note of the “highly irresponsible” behaviour of people who continue to put lives of others at risk by violating the covid safety rules, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday warned of serious consequences for the state, which is witnessing a spike in cases over the past few days.Stating that the state reported 665 cases on Friday, which also saw 4,900 challans being issued for covid violations, Captain asked why it was so difficult to wear masks, wash hands and not spit on roads.“Don’t people care about their fellow beings?” he questioned those who insist on continuously ignoring his appeals to adhere to all safety norms. Citing examples of Maharashtra and Delhi, he said that safety of Punjab is in hands of people.During his weekly Facebook Live #AskCaptain interaction, the CM added that his government has announced opening of gyms from August 5 in line with the central government’s Unlock 3.0 guidelines, but they will need to strictly adhere to protocol and directives of the health department.Stressing on the need for precautions and early detection to save lives, Captain reiterated his appeal for recovered covid patients to donate plasma, for which a plasma bank is already operational and two more are all set to come up in state.“If I was a recovered patient, I would have definitely donated plasma,” he said, adding that he has already directed that plasma be made available free of cost at all government and private hospitals.In response to a request from a Ludhiana resident for daily updates on bed availability to be posted on Cova app, the CM said he will direct the health department to arrange for the same.On a question from Kargil Gallantry Award and Sena Medal winner Balkar Singh from Barnala regarding one-rank promotion for police and defence personnel as announced earlier, the CM said the state government is committed to giving one-step promotion to the Gallantry Award winners.On some Punjabi singers promoting gun culture, the CM appealed to all artistes to stop singing such songs and promote Punjab’s culture and ideology instead.When a Rajpura resident raised concern on the issue, he said that arresting singers is no real solution and these singers need to understand the negative impacts of such songs on youth.The CM asked Hoshiarpur DC to submit a report within a week on complaint of Commodore VK Gautam Retd NM alleging fabrication of revenue records by circle revenue officer of Mukerian to omit the process of auction to blackmail him after he purchased a property in auction. Captain said the matter is serious and action will be taken against the guilty.The Punjab government will soon introduce urine test every six months for dispensing de-addiction drugs to check abuse.A Ludhiana youth requested the CM to direct OOAT clinics to give 10 days’ medicine at a time as per past practice, as otherwise a lot of time is wasted every day in long queues to get daily dose of medication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/is-it-so-difficult-to-wear-masks-questions-punjab-cm/story-389NkumzMIL6BYDNA22azH.html

He tested positive on July 31 at Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, Chandigarh,” said Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh. “According to his family, he was due for a surgery at a private hospital in Mohali. He died on the way to the hospital, probably due to a heart attack, on Saturday.” The total number of cases in the district has gone up to 894,of which 351 are active.

Interstate movement a challenge: Civil surgeon “Mohali faces greater challenges compared to other districts as there is constant movement of people to and from Panchkula, Chandigarh and even Himachal Pradesh,” said the civil surgeon. “A large number of people from other states either live or work here. So, controlling Covid spread in Mohali does not mean just taking care of the local population but also requires hashing and rehashing strategy in sync with neighbouring states,” he said. Health teams are working round the clock and collecting 450 to 500 samples daily, and nine flu clinics are operational and are supported by 18 sampling teams, said the civil surgeon, adding that health workers are also screening every entrant to the city be it via road, rail or air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-district-sees-15th-covid-19-fatality-steepest-single-day-spike-with-44-cases/story-WPVvWiZjtj8A2Toauuie3H.html

All guilty, including ministers and ruling party’s MLAs should be arrested,” he added. He warned the CM against “making scapegoats to shield himself and his colleagues” who are “directly responsible for the tragedy”.Sukhbir said that more tragedies like this can happen anytime as “there is no stopping the Congress ministers and MLAs under the CM’s patronage from carrying on the illicit liquor trade”.“The CM cannot escape responsibility. He not only heads the excise department but had also been forewarned by us against such tragedy. But he kept ridiculing our warnings out of greed for quick money through illicit liquor trade,” he claimed. The SAD president demanded Rs 25 lakh compensation and job for each bereaved family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cm-should-own-responsibility-for-hooch-tragedy-step-down-sukhbir/story-vCYEScLrg3Zc9PmhQJgAbN.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Number of Covid-19 containment zones down to 496 in Delhi||The number of Covid-19 containment zones has come down to 496 in Delhi after an extensive review by the AAP government, providing relief to thousands of people living in such restricted areas.The number of containment zones was 715 in Delhi by the end of July, affecting nearly 3.5 lakh people. With the number going down to 496, the movement of only about one lakh people will be affected, Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot said in a statement on Saturday.The review of the containment zones by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government comes after a Union health ministry memorandum earlier this week, allowing all states and Union territories to de-notify a containment zone 14 days after the discharge of the last Covid-19 patient, officials said. Earlier such a de-notification could be done 28 days after the discharge of the last patient.“As desired by Honble CM @ArvindKejriwal all the containment zones in Delhi were extensively reviewed in last 2 days with each District DM and surveillance Team,” Gahlot said in a tweet.  A locality is declared a containment zone by the district authorities in Delhi if three or more persons there test positive for Covid-19.Reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the national capital on June 29, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had expressed concern over the large size of the containment zones as it restricted the movement of a huge population, Gahlot said.“During the last two days, an extensive review of containment zones was carried out with Revenue and Health officials. The result has been quite satisfactory. Against 715 containment zones affecting 348099 people, the number of containment zones is now down to 496, which affects the movement of 10,6211 people,” the minister said in the statement.The situation was again re-assessed by the chief minister, who directed such reviews at regular intervals.The Delhi government had been demanding changes in the containment zone norms as some restricted areas in the city were under a complete lockdown for three-four months with a large number of people forced to stay indoors, a senior government officer said.He said the redesigning of the containment zones will affect a lesser number people, while pointing out that the Rajnagar containment zone in southwest-Delhi, which affected around 43,000 residents earlier, will affect only about 1,600 people after the exercise.All entry and exit points are barricaded in a containment zone to prevent any movement of the residents. Police personnel are deployed to keep a watch on it, while necessary supplies are provided to the people in such zones at their doorstep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/number-of-covid-19-containment-zones-down-to-496-in-delhi/story-oPjTsT1v7UeBpU2P0xNLyK.html
01-08-2020||Kolkata||Bengal governor raises questions over funding of state’s Global Business Summit||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has raised questions over the funding of the Mamata Banerjee administration’s flagship annual investors’ meet, Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS). The governor has asserted that more money was spent in organising these events since 2015 than the investments that these summits have attracted. He has also raised questions about the funding agencies through which payments have been made to organise such events. “Assertion is that more amount is spent in BGBS than the investment generated on the ground,” Dhankhar tweeted on Saturday. He has sought a response from the state finance secretary about the details of the funds that have been spent into organising these summits, investments accrued and the jobs generated. The BGBS, which started in 2015, is attended by Union ministers and top industrialists. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) had many times claimed that these events have generated business proposals amounting to thousands of crores while highlighting the achievements of Banerjee’s administration. Dhankhar has also raised questions about fiscal irregularities and patronage of these summits. “Issues of fiscal irregularities and patronage are also raised,” he tweeted. Dhankhar has sought details of the agencies through which funding has been made to organise the annual events and whether the payment was made directly or through the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI). “The governor has every right to seek any information he wants from the state government. However, tweeting about these and going to the press every time is unbecoming of a governor. He has failed to maintain the sanctity of his position,” said Tapas Roy, a TMC leader and one of the party’s spokespersons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-governor-raises-questions-over-funding-of-state-s-global-business-summit/story-QDRqIdfl4aMT8Q83N6ucMP.html

Cheema visited families protesting against the ‘fake’ (dummy) auction of panchayat land in May-end at Gharachon village on Saturday. “A new policy must to formulated to give direct benefits to landless farmers, and others from backward classes and dalit communities. Nowadays, a shabby game is being played by leaders of the ruling party to leverage the existing policy to their own interests,” Cheema claimed.

However, an FIR was lodged after YAD held a protest,” he added. Gosha said even health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu attended a function near Raikot on Friday where a large number of people were present. “Besides, the AAP submitted a memorandum to officials on Friday, where again social distancing norms were violated. Chairman of the Mullanpur market committee assumed charge in presence of a crowd and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu was the chief guest. Police should register a case against the Congress and AAP leaders as well,” he demanded, while adding he will continue to “expose private hospitals and state government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-fir-youth-akali-dal-cries-foul-says-police-going-soft-on-congress-aap/story-1jtl92A7sAud7Sw0Uf1xjK.html

The CBI court had issued notice to the investigating agency to file its response.On Friday, public prosecutor for the CBI, KP Singh, opposed both applications saying Zaidi is facing trial for a heinous crime and did not deserve any special treatment in custodyAfter hearing both parties, CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg said “There is no such provision in the Punjab jail manual, under which an undertrial prisoner can be allowed to access computers for preparing their defence. Further, no inmate is allowed to use the computer in the office for preparing his/ her defence due to security reasons.”The Burail Model Jail superintendent had informed the court that other material such a pen and paper had been provided to Zaidi and he was allowed to discuss his case with his advocate through e-mulaqat or telephone. Therefore, the court dismissed this application.With reference to the second application regarding granting B-Class status to him for being a postgraduate and income taxpayer, the judge said, “No doubt Zaidi holds a degree in bachelor of science (engineering), but he is involved in the commission of murder along with other offences, which debars him from getting B-Class facility in jail.”Stating ‘equality before law prohibits discrimination’ and ‘like should be treated alike, unlike should be treated alike’ the judge quoted Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which provides of equality before law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Dismissing the application, the judge referred to a letter issued by the Punjab government, department of home affairs and justice, which has been adopted by Chandigarh administration, as per which ‘prisoners involved in a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code are not entitled to get B-Class facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kotkhai-custodial-death-case-court-rejects-zaidi-s-plea-for-b-class-facility-computers/story-oVyDNlnMG4e1OXtGuk7TgJ.html

01-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Coronavirus dampens festive mood on Eid al-Adha||The festive spirit of Eid al-Adha was subdued in the national capital on Saturday with the coronavirus pandemic badly hitting livestock sale for the festival of sacrifice and restricting many people to their homes. Despite just around 10,000 active Covid-19 cases in Delhi -- far better than was feared -- and easing of lockdown restrictions, many faithful preferred offering ‘namaaz’ at their homes than visiting mosques.Those who offered prayers at mosques said a fewer number of people had turned up there, and the mood was not as ebullient as previous years.Outside the Jama Masjid, the Delhi Police put up signboards requesting people to wear masks and ensure physical distancing while offering namaaz.  Imtiaz Ahmad, who offered prayers at the mosque, said the turn out was way less than before when the crowd would spill on the streets too. People wore masks, carried their own mats and avoided hugging each other, he said.Yameen Ansari, a resident of Jamia Nagar who offered prayers at Jamaat e-Islami Hind Markaz in Azu Fazal Enclave, said though some people stepped out of their homes, unlike Eid Ul Fitr in May, the festive spirit was dim.“People could step out as things are under control in Delhi. Still, they were not as cheerful as before,” he said, adding friends and family have been avoiding gatherings on the festival.Abdul Noor Shibli, a journalist, who offered prayers at the Jamaat e-Islami Hind markaz, said it was the first time in four months that he went to a mosque. He said the mosque administration had deployed volunteers for thermal screening at the entry gates.“People wore masks and brought their own mats. Stickers were pasted on the floor to help them maintain distance,” he said, adding the turnout was half of what it used to be during festivals in normal times.Umar Sheikh Mohammad, the president of the Nizamuddin West Resident Welfare Association, said he offered prayers in a nearby mosque but the crowd was thin. The 51-year-old businessman, however, said offering ‘qurbani’ was not that easy as business was down.Covid-19 has hit businesses. People who could afford four goats till last year don’t have enough money to buy even one this Eid, he said, adding, “It was also not easy to purchase a goat and bring it home, as there are restrictions on the sale of livestock due to the pandemic.”  “A large number of people could not buy a sacrificial animal because the pandemic-induced economic crisis has rendered them jobless,” Mohammad said.Mohammad Izhaar, a goat seller at the famous sarpine market near Jama Masjid, said Bakr Eid has been insipid. Every year he sold around 15-20 goats on Eid al-Adha. This year, he has sold only four, that too at a loss.“It (the pandemic) has sucked the life out of us,” he said woefully. In a world without the coronavirus, sale of goats would have fetched Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000, but this year they were sold at half the price, Izhaar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-coronavirus-dampens-festive-mood-on-eid-al-adha/story-QzTpJPZ9lGWg3GrxiSXUgM.html

01-08-2020||Kolkata||Duped by fake negative Covid-19 report, Kolkata man tests positive, dies days later||A bank manager (57) was duped with a fake report that showed him coronavirus disease (Covid-19) negative, when he had contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and died of it in a government-run hospital in Kolkata on Thursday. Kolkata Police has arrested three persons on the basis of a complaint lodged by the deceased’s wife. Further investigation is on to ascertain how rampant was the racket. “The test report was fake, as it had a handwritten specimen referral form (SRF) ID that had only nine digits. While an original report comes printed and consists of 13 digits,” said a doctor of MR Bangur Hospital in Kolkata, the largest state-run Covid-19 designated hospital in the city. Police said the bank manager was suffering from a fever, cough and common cold. His family doctor referred him to a man, who runs a pathological laboratory, as he was too weak to visit a testing centre. “The owner of the laboratory sent a youth to collect his swab sample on July 25. A day later, his family members were told over the phone that he had tested Covid-19 negative. They were given a report, where the SRF ID was written in longhand and a WhatsApp message was also sent that declared the patient as Covid-19 negative,” said an official of Netaji Nagar police station in south Kolkata. However, he was rushed to a private nursing home, when his condition worsened. Later, the nursing home authorities referred him to MR Bangur Hospital, where the doctors detected the discrepancies in the test report. “The doctors told us that the report was fake. The youth took Rs 2,000 to collect the sample. My father died on July 30 (Thursday) after he had tested Covid-19 positive in the hospital. We lost valuable time for his treatment,” said the deceased’s son. Subhash Adhikary, the officer-in-charge of Netaji Nagar police station, traced the culprits on the basis of the WhatsApp number that was used to send the message to the deceased’s family members. Brothers Indrajit Sikdar (26) and Biswajit Sikdar (23) were arrested from south Kolkata. The duo was attached to two separate state-run hospitals as contractual technicians. Another person, Anit Paira, who runs a private laboratory, was also arrested. “The Sikdars told the deceased family members that they were attached to a well-known laboratory, where swab samples are tested. Preliminary investigation, however, revealed that the duo was not attached to the laboratory and no such tests were carried out in the laboratory. They made up the fake report and used the laboratory’s name to lend credibility,” said a Kolkata Police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/duped-by-fake-negative-covid-19-report-kolkata-man-tests-positive-dies-days-later/story-qeUweQH4JH97Vh5sHHoFoK.html

01-08-2020||Kolkata||Eid al-Adha celebrated in Bengal amid Covid-19 pandemic||Eid al-Adha was celebrated in West Bengal in a low-key manner this year as Muslim devotees on Saturday offered prayers at mosques and homes while maintaining social distancing norms amid surging coronavirus cases in the state.As the lockdown restrictions have been eased outside containment zones, many devotees were seen offering namaz in mosques, though the usual hustle and bustle associated with the festival was missing from the minority-dominated pockets of the city.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar extended his Eid greetings to people.“The festival inspires us to inculcate empathy, peace and universal brotherhood. Given Covid Challenge-Need to follow safety protocols-wearing masks, practising physical distancing in celebration,” the governor said in a tweet.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also wished people on the occasion in a Facebook pictorial post.Attired in traditional clothes, the young and elderly gathered in small numbers at mosques to offer morning prayers. They avoided the usual hugging and shaking hands with each other after the prayers to prevent the spread of the infection.The authorities made elaborate arrangements to sanitise the mosque premises and thermal screening of the faithful.The sight, smell and sounds of Eid were also missing from Zakaria street, next to Nakhoda Mosque in north Kolkata, which dons a festive look every year with numerous food stalls and gift shops dotting the road on the occasion.Many devotees also offered prayers with their families at home.Bengal Imams Association president Mohammed Yahia said all 26,000 mosque committees in the state have been asked to allow 25 faithful to enter their premises during morning prayers, barring a few located in containment zones.On the occasion of Bakr Eid, devotees performed the ritual of animal sacrifice with strict adherence to precautionary norms amid the coronavirus pandemic.“We have asked everyone from the community to distribute meat among the family members and close friends, and not to anyone else keeping in mind the present situation,” Yahia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/eid-al-adha-celebrated-in-bengal-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-OC5600CgB0DjEfjZQjnG0I.html
01-08-2020||Ranchi||Ex-BJP MLA booked for ‘stealing’ soil from Sarna Sthal||The district head of a tribal organization in Ranchi has lodged a criminal case against former BJP tribal legislator Gangotri Kujur and one other person, accusing them of stealing soil from a religious tribal place for Ram temple construction in Ayodhya, officials said on Friday. “An FIR has been lodged against Kujur and one Depeswar Nath Mishra at Ranchi’s Chanho police station by Kundresi Munda, Ranchi president of Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad (ABAVP), under Sections 379, 295 and 153 of the Indian Penal Code,” police said. Kujur, however, denied the allegation, terming it as a political vendetta. “It is a baseless allegation. We had requested the Pahan (tribal priest) of the Sarna Sthal to give some soil, which will be used during ‘bhoomi pujan’ of Ram temple in Ayodhya, and he accepted our request,” he said. However, officer in-charge of Chanho police station Dileshwar Kumar said that based on the allegations in the FIR, the accused collected soil clandestinely from Sarna Sthal in Chanho without taking consent from villagers or Sarna Samaj. “We have initiated investigation in the case,” he said.The complainant said the former legislator and Mishra tried to outrage religious feelings of tribal people of Sarna by stealing soil from Sarna Sthal, pious to the tribals. “In our Sarna religion, nobody is allowed to take soil from the Sarna Sthal for any purpose.” She said they are not against construction or ‘bhoomi pujan’ of the Ram temple. “It is the pride of Hindus and we respect that. But, we are not Hindus. We have a separate religion. No one has the right to distort our beliefs,” she said. She further alleged that stealing the soil was a tactic by a section of people to exhibit that tribals are a part of the Hindu religion, which is a conspiracy to weaken their demand for a separate religion code.Tribals in Jharkhand have been demanding for Sarna as separate religious code in the Census for decades. Jharkhand Congress and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) had also included the demand in their manifesto during the Assembly polls last year. Kujur said the allegation was to malign her image in the area. “A handful of people want to create division in the society,” Kujur said. On a call of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), soils from 2,100 religious places, including temples, Sarna Sthals, gurudwaras, Jain temples and Buddha Vihars and holy water from 51 small and big rivers in Jharkhand, were collected for ‘bhoomi pujan’ of the Ram temple, scheduled on August 5. VHP state secretary Birendra Sahu said, “We have not collected the soil, but it was the people from particular religions who had collected and given it to us. We transported the collected soil and holy water to Ayodhya on July 26.” However, the collection of soil from Sarna Sthal has created a rift among different tribal groups. While a section of tribal groups have protested it, other sections welcomed the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/ex-bjp-mla-one-other-booked-for-stealing-soil-from-sarna-sthal-for-ayodhya-s-ram-temple/story-26nuJlmYlgh0LpU25IzCnM.html

01-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai hospital devises ‘kavach’ to move Covid-19 patients||In a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection among its medical staff, the state-run J J Hospital here has developed a transport chamber for contactless movement of Covid-19 patients within the premises.Developed by the general surgery department of the hospital with the help of engineers of a firm named Indomed Devices, the patient transport ‘kavach’ aims to reduce the risk of infection among the hospital staff, visitors and other patients.Sanskrit word ‘kavach’ literally means an armour.“The cost-effective glass transport trolley has a HEPA filter at the head end, which filters out particles as small as 0.02 microns,” said Amol Wagh, assistant professor of surgery at J J Hospital.“Everyday thousands of health care workers test positive for the infection and have to be quarantined. This results in shortage of medical staff,” he said.Hence, innovation in protective devices is the need of the hour as medical staff has to spend long hours in PPE kits, making it difficult for them to provide required patient care and treatment, Wagh added.Speaking about the innovation, head of surgery, Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, who came up with the concept, said the trolley will not only prevent transmission of coronavirus, but it also protect Covid-19 patients with low immunity from contracting other infections from their surroundings.Patients can be incubated in the trolley and tests, such as sonography, can also be done when the patient is inside the chamber, Wagh said, adding that engineers and experts are working on ways to install the chamber in ambulances and make it compatible for CT scans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-hospital-devises-kavach-to-move-covid-19-patients/story-KFzJZJztf6t0Bi6dvBlFCL.html

The Indian Army responded strongly to the enemy fire, a defence release said. Sepoy Rohin Kumar, 24, who belongs to Galore khas village of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh, was critically injured in the exchange of fire and later succumbed to his injuries. “Sepoy Rohin Kumar was a brave, highly motivated and a sincere soldier. The nation will remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,” defence public relations officer Lt Col Devender Anand said in the release here. A pall of gloom descended on his native village as soon as the news reached the family. The sepoy was engaged to get married in November this year. His father works at a shop in Amritsar.The last rites of Rohin Kumar were performed with full military honors at a crematorium near his native village in the evening. His cousin brother lit the pyre amid slogans of ‘Pakistan Murdabad’ and ‘Shaheed Rohin Kumar amar rahe’.Earlier, Ankush Kumar of Karohta village in the district had lost his life while fighting the Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soldier-from-himachal-s-hamirpur-district-killed-in-ceasefire-violation-by-pakistan-at-loc/story-IbBLc1UfSfkOcTtykZu2PI.html
01-08-2020||Ranchi||Palamu Tiger Reserve offers Rs 5,000 for information about big cats||Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) officials on Friday announced a cash reward of Rs 5,000 for providing credible information about presence or movement of tigers inside the state’s only home for tigers. “A cash award has been announced for giving information about tigers with twin objectives. First, we have to make sure if PTR has tigers, so as to decide our next course of action. Secondly, there are reports that field staff members are not discharging their duties properly. In this case, it’s an alarm call for them,” Das pointed out.The PTR has not recorded any evidence of presence of a tiger since February this year when a tigress was found dead in the Betla National Park, the tourist zone of the reserve, spread over an area of 1,129 square km in Latehar and Garhwa districts. According to the latest tiger estimation data released by the Union ministry of environment, there was no tiger in the reserve.PTR field director YK Das said, “We have not recorded any evidence about a tiger’s presence in the PTR since the tigress was found dead in February. We found some tiger scats in May and sent them for testing but reports are awaited.”Das, however, expressed hope that the tiger population can be revived if all stakeholders come together. Das said, “One good thing about the PTR is that the habitat is still in a good condition.”The move by the forest officials assumes significance amid outcry by wildlife experts about lack of proper monitoring of wildlife in the reserve forest by the staff. Noted wildlife expert and secretary of the nature conservation society Dr DS Srivastava said, “They (the PTR officials) are not getting reports, as there has been very little monitoring of wildlife. Even the lower rung forest employees like forest guards consider themselves to be officers.”Suggesting ways out of this imbroglio, Srivastava said, “The situation has to be changed and the locals should be made a party to the management of the reserve so as to revive its lost glory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-5k-for-information-about-big-cats-in-tiger-less-palamu-reserve/story-InLHbWGO8lQq58HQJpNjOM.html

Gurmeet is among a few instructors who made the state technical education department administration to start online practical classes for ITI students amid the Covid-19 crisis.“We started online theory classes in mid-April. As the lockdown restricted outdoor movement, I thought of converting my house into an improvised workshop for the benefit of students. Since I had the basic tool kit at home, I started sharing videos with students, detailing sanitary and draining fittings etc.,” he said.Gurmeet’s daughter helps him in the technical knowhow.Similarly, Sukhwant Singh, a mechanical instructor at ITI in Bassi Pathana in Fatehgarh Sahib district, uses his tractor to teach about components of the farming machine. He is also using Google Meet and Zoom to connect with the students for online classes.“I am using my personal tractor to demonstrate various parts of the engine and servicing of a vehicle. I also visit local automobile workshops for live or for recording training sessions on servicing of other vehicles,” he said.About 28,000 students are enrolled in various ITIs across the state. Instructors who were totally unfamiliar with the digital mode of education were trained in virtual teaching.Department officials say 75-80% students are attending online classes, especially the crucial practical part.Students like Harinder Singh from Singo village near Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda said the online practical classes are proving useful. But disruption in mobile data signal causes trouble to students.But electronics instructor Pawan Kumar from Kalanaur in Gurdaspur said teachers try to take problems on WhatsApp messenger and videos are uploaded on a Youtube channel for the convenience of students.Principal secretary, technical education, Anurag Verma, said Punjab has become the first state to provide practical content of various vocational trades on the central web portal National Instructional Media Institute (NIMI).“Now, the practical video sessions prepared by our instructors are watched by students from other states as well on the central portal. As there is still no clarity on resuming classes, we wanted ITI students to get the most important aspect of practical exposure at their homes. We are working to redress the problem of a section of students who lack smartphones to access online classrooms,” said Verma.Manjinder Kaur, an instructor of stitching technology at Fatehgarh Churian in Gurdaspur, virtual classroom came as a challenge that she overcame with her family’s assistance.“Till lockdown was imposed in March, I was illiterate when it came to information technology. But as the department asked us to gear up for online classes, I took the pandemic crisis as an opportunity for skill development. My son and husband helped me in learning to prepare a PowerPoint presentation (PPT) and holding virtual classes on various aspects of stitching since April,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iti-instructors-upgrade-skills-to-impart-virtual-practical-lessons/story-Qs5jPIwKy8KcJIsUIWKX5L.html

Whereas the overall mortality rate came down to 2.3% despite increase in the spread of the virus, mortality rate remained at 2.2 %. The national mortality rate for the month was also 2.2%, according the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) figures. Medical experts say there is an overall increase in the number of deaths but since the total cases have also gone up, the mortality rate remains almost the same. In June, the state had witnessed 100 deaths. By June-end, the state’s Covid-19 positivity rate was 1.8% which has increased to 2.7%. July alone witnessed the positivity rate of 3.8%. The national positivity rate also went up from 10% to 11% in July when the state conducted nearly 2.63 lakh tests. “The main reason behind rise in positivity rate is the increased testing and the state’s strategy to test every high-risk primary contact of a patient. The positivity rate among high-risk primary contacts is 10%. As July witnessed more cases due to unlock and increase in testing, positivity rate has also gone up,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. The state health department has denied any community spread even in the three worst-hit districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar. “On Friday, we gathered feedback on chances of community spread but the spread of the diseases has remained restricted to certain clusters only,” said the nodal officer. The recovery rate of Covid-19 patients in Punjab dipped from 70% in June to 66% in July. But health officials say it not worrying since the state’s mortality rate has decreased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-adds-10-451-cases-in-july-positivity-rate-up/story-1DhN0CJDXMZC7mMRcYCIjO.html

As the 2009 Lok Sabha elections approached, the then Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government started weakening the case to get the dera votes for Harsimrat Kaur Badal. The collusion between the Badals and the dera chief led to delaying submission of challan in the case for four years,” he claimed, “Then just three days before the Vidhan Sabha elections in 2012, the then Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government filed a cancellation report in the case for electoral gains. The government did not even bother to file an appeal in the case,” he added. “What forced the Badals-led government to take a stand in favour of the dera chief in court despite having evidences? Despite the Punjab governor issued sanction orders in the case, why did not the government challenge the cancellation report in the court? ” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/badals-shielded-dera-head-in-blasphemy-case-punjab-youth-cong-chief/story-QBI6i974tmSYzdsNYgNeLL.html

Many of them face job losses with the aviation industry suffering a major hit.Hailing from Jalandhar district, Sharma, who is MP for Ealing Southall, said: “Thousands face being made redundant because of falls in revenue for many businesses and certain industries almost completely drying up. Aviation is one of the hardest hit, almost no long haul routes are open and passenger numbers are down to tiny fractions compared to the start of the year.”The MPs wrote to Sunak that airports in England and Wales are expected to pay business rates as though they are functioning normally. Airports in Scotland and Northern Ireland have received support from their local governments, but those in England and Wales have not had such relief.The MPs wrote to the chancellor: “Under the current system while a business such as Tesco which has seen growth during Covid-19 has received £585 million in business rate relief, our airports have seen not a penny”.“We call on you to provide support to all English and Welsh airports in line with that afforded by Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will allow airports to continue to employ people, pay other taxes and support the Covid recovery we all so badly need”.Passenger numbers have fallen by 99% in some cases and more than 100,000 in the industry are facing the risk of unemployment. The aviation industry lost nearly £2 billion in the four-month period between March and June, which is equivalent to around £15 million each day, Sharma noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-born-uk-mp-virendra-sharma-leads-campaign-to-save-heathrow-jobs/story-CW4BzgkThLdR9W5BzV0UtJ.html

Khap leader Rangi Ram also tried to immolate himself, but his attempt was foiled. He was detained by the police.As many as 1,983 sacked physical training instructors have been protesting against the state government and seeking reinstatement. Jind DSP Kaptan Singh said they used force as the agitators were accompanying Rangi Ram, who attempted to kill himself. “In a bid to stop any untoward incident, we resorted to lathi-charging to disperse them. We have detained the khap leader,” he added.Condemning the incident, senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, “Dictator Khattar government, give jobs to PTIs not lathis.” This comes a day after force was used to disperse people protesting against alleged police inaction in a ‘triple murder case’. The agitators had blocked the national highway 44 in Panipat on Thursday, forcing the police to resort to using water canons. Some protesters were also detained and their vehicles impounded as they pelted cops with stones.It is pertinent to mention here that bodies of three missing children were found in a drain in Panipat on July 8. An FIR was registered in the case and subsequently, an SIT was formed by Panipat superintendent of police Manisha Chaudhary. The protesters, led by members of Kashyap Samaj Sangharsh Samiti, cited police’s failure in arresting the accused and launched a stir at the Panipat mini-secretariat.SP Manisha Chaudhary had said, “Some people, including five cops, sustained minor injuries in the clash. A case was being registered against the people involved in the blocking the road and engaging in violence.”She said a probe was going on in the case and the police were waiting for forensic reports.“As of now, there is no evidence to prove charges of murder in this case, but an investigation is underway,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-physical-training-instructors-lathi-charged-in-jind/story-o68yiy6jj6jZv4v0JSNsWJ.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Pecking at trash, making a livelihood||Though it is only early morning in this market lane, it is already midday as far as Raju is concerned. “I start working by 11 or 12 in the night,” he says. In his 20s, Raju makes a living by picking up reusable stuff people throw on the streets, which he sells to recyclers. Pointing at the huge sack he is standing next to, he says, “It has all the trash I have collected today.” The waste collector lives in nearby Yamuna Bazaar, a north Delhi locality that is snuggled on the banks of the Yamuna. His house is actually a shanty — “not a home of bricks!” he repeats twice, as if his life depended on making this point clear. Gesturing towards the sack (he has briefly kept it on the pavement table of a tea stall that hasn’t opened yet), Raju says it is filled up mostly with plastic bottles, plastic bags, plastic jars, paper bags, and discarded masks. He himself is not wearing a mask.Why?He responds by not making any comment.Raju’s shirt is slightly torn on the front. He shrugs. There’s also a safety pin clipped to the shirt. “It is for emergency,” he says, without detailing the kind of situations that might warrant the emergency use of such a thing.Whatever, he agrees to give a sense of his daily life. “I’m a very busy man,” he notes, explaining that when the city starts to fall asleep late at night, and streets begin to get empty, he launches into work. “I carry the sack on my shoulder and walk along the lanes of mohallas and bazaars, picking up things from the garbage and pavements that might be recycled.” He gets into action a couple of hours after his dinner. “ I started this work some years ago.... initially I would be scared of street dogs, who always tend to bark at us kabadi wallas.” For protection he would earlier arm himself with a lathi, but has put it away. “Now I am more experienced with the streets... I scare the dogs by barking back at them, in their own language,” he says in a serious tone.Raju says he’s a Delhi native, and that his father was a tea seller. “Both my parents are dead, and my older brother has been laapata (missing) for many years.” He has a younger sister who stays at home, he says. “She’s the one who cooks for me... I would have been a free man if I didn’t have to take care of her.”Now another waste collector arrives and both men get busy talking to each other in a low voice. They seem to be discussing their lunch plans. Soon afterwards, Raju turns his attention back to the huge sack. He spreads his arms around it, as if around a tree. He lifts it up and begins to walk further along the street. Now, he informs, he shall go all the way to Yamuna Bazaar to sell the collection to a recycler. “Afterwards, I’ll spend the rest of the day at home.” He starts to walk extremely fast and disappears from view within moments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-pecking-at-trash-making-a-livelihood/story-IKcQpkcwo8Ec8h1wamHjzK.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||High court notice to Centre on Khemka’s empanelment plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday put the Centre on notice on a plea of senior IAS officer, Ashok Khemka, who has challenged the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) order, wherein his plea seeking direction to the Centre to consider his empanelment was dismissed. The high court bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh has sought response by August 24. It was on July 23 that CAT, Chandigarh, had passed the order. Khemka was seeking direction to the Centre to consider his empanelment for holding additional secretary or equivalent post at the Centre. CAT had dismissed the plea observing that appointment of a person at the Centre cannot be a matter of right. Khemka has told court that he was empanelled as joint secretary in December 2010 and applied for central deputation in 2011, 2012 and 2014, but was not appointed. The petitioner cannot be penalised and debarred for life for ‘minister’s act’ of ignoring his name sent in almost 40 panels, he has claimed. Under Article 312, an all-India service officer has a right to serve at both the Centre as well as the state. There is a 40% central deputation reserve in each state cadre, he told the court, adding that the doors to the Centre cannot be shut upon the petitioner for no fault on his part. It has also been submitted that non-empanelment at this stage would lead to cascading effect and he will not be able to serve at the Centre permanently. He had also argued that the eligibility criteria for such empanelment required minimum three years of service at the Centre at the level of deputy secretary and above. He offered himself on a number of occasions, but was not appointed without any fault on his part, he had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-notice-to-centre-on-khemka-s-empanelment-plea/story-ipjdmzNHaWkDHMgX1EYJ1I.html

01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Malpractices in property registration: Criminal proceedings initiated against 6 Gurugram officials||Initiating punitive action against six serving and one retired Gurugram revenue official for executing registration of sale deeds of properties without obtaining no objection certificates (NoC) in notified urban areas of Gurugram district, the Haryana government on Friday ordered registration of first information reports (FIRs) against them. The six serving officials have also been placed under suspension.The requirement of an NoC stating that land transfer does not contravene any provision of the act was to prevent ill-planned and haphazard construction in urban areas notified by the town and country planning (TCP) department.The state government had last week halted the registration of transfer deeds across the state for a limited period citing alleged corrupt practices.Additional chief secretary (ACS), revenue, Vijai Vardhan in a July 31 communication to principal secretary, TCP, said that FIRs be registered against Sohna tehsildar Bansi Lal; Sohna naib tehsildar Dalbir Singh; Badshahpur naib tehsildar Hari Kishan; Wazirabad naib tehsildar Jai Prakash; former Gurugram and Harsaru naib tehsildar Desh Raj Kamboj; Manesar naib tehsildar Jagdish Chand and Kadarpur naib tehsildar Om Prakash (retired) as they have been found guilty of flagrant violations of Section 7-A of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act during registration of sale deeds.These officials were indicted by Gurugram divisional commissioner.The HDRUA Act administered by the TCP department provides for criminal prosecution of the violators. “Any person who contravenes any provision of this Act or rules made thereunder or any conditions of a licence granted under section 3 shall be punishable with imprisonment of either inscription for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable for fine,” reads Section 10 the Act.Rampant corrupt practices detectedRevenue officials said registration of properties without NoC in notified urban area land under Section 7-A led to mushrooming of unauthorised settlements and corrupt practices.Gurugram divisional commissioner during an inquiry found that a number of naib tehsildars were executing sale deeds indiscriminately without the NoC.The stipulations in Section 7-A pertained to grant of an NoC by the TCP department before registration of land in notified urban areas.The government has also directed the divisional commissioner to submit a detailed inquiry report regarding the patwaris who have changed the entries of land in ‘khasra girdawari’ from agricultural land to uncultivable (gair mumkin) with malafide intent to facilitate the registration of deeds in violation of section 7-A, officials said.The revenue department which flagged the Section 7-A violations has also written to the TCP department to make appropriate changes in the law. An ordinance to amend the law again is likely to be promulgated soon, officials said.The TCP and urban local bodies departments have also been directed to conduct an internal inquiry regarding the NoCs issued by them. They have been asked to submit a report to the revenue department within two weeks to assess the extent of responsibility that can be ascribed to officers of these departments, officials said.How realtors took advantage of ‘17 amendmentHowever, following a 2017 amendment in Section 7-A, the law got watered down and real estate developers were able to circumvent the requirement of NoC by converting agricultural land into uncultivable in revenue records.Also, the reduction of size of land from less than a hectare to two kanals worked to the advantage of realtors, officials said.The revenue department which flagged the Section 7-A violations has also written to the TCP department to make appropriate changes in the law. An ordinance to amend the law again is likely to be promulgated soon, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/malpractices-in-property-registration-criminal-proceedings-initiated-against-6-gurugram-officials/story-KD6NH6mr29719H8Wxvzm1O.html

So far, 14,993 people have died due to the coronavirus disease in the state. The total number of recovered cases in Maharashtra now stands at 256,158 after 7,543 patients were discharged on Friday. “By and large, we have the outbreak under control. The doubling rate in Maharashtra is 30 days; better than the country’s, which is around 22 days. The recovery rate is over 60% now. Our stress will remain on containing the death rate. A task force has been set up for that, which is working with districts, we have tele-ICUs, where doctors from rural areas can consult with the doctors on the task force via video calls, about a critical patient,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said. Mumbai recorded 1,085 fresh infections, taking the case tally in state’s capital to 114,284. The city has registered 6,353 fatalities after 53 new deaths were reported on Friday. Tope admitted that the cases were now increasing in rural areas but added that “...the outbreak has a pattern —peak, plateau and drop — it will come down. We have seen this in the case of Mumbai… In my assessment, the numbers will go up in August as well, but we are well placed in terms of availability of beds and other equipment [to tackle the cases]”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-case-count-reaches-422k-as-toll-nears-15-000/story-YCUoPtW6oiVcQVTS8i2WmJ.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||‘Fake Covid-19 reports’: HC stays arrest of two Amritsar doctors, seeks probe report||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday restrained the Punjab police from arresting two doctors and sought a probe report in the alleged incident of preparing fake Covid-19 reports in Amritsar in June.The high court acted on the plea of Dr Robin Tuli and Dr Mohinder Singh, who had approached high court seeking anticipatory bail in the FIR registered on June 23 by Punjab vigilance bureau.The state’s counsel, GS Dhuriwala had told court that a medical board, constituted on June 18, is examining the matter. During the investigation, 72 cases were declared positive by Tuli Diagnostic Centre, Majithia Road, Amritsar, and cycle threshold values were handwritten on test requisition slips, the court was informed. It was further stated that no printout from machine was available for examination and no raw data or graph was present to know whether the figures given by the lab match those generated by the machine.On the other hand, appearing for doctors, senior advocate RS Rai had contended that the reports are in fact computer generated and there might be a noting on the side of computerised reports regarding Covid-19 Virus Qualitative PCR.The high court bench of justice Jaishree Thakur sought a report from the medical board in a sealed cover along with a photocopy of 72 positive reports purported to have been handwritten. Apart from these reports, if there is other evidence available against the petitioners, that too is to be submitted, the court said while fixing August 17 as the next date of hearing and staying the arrest of both the doctors.As per reports, these doctors in collusion with others allegedly prepared fake Covid-19 positive reports at their laboratory to fleece patients. The alleged racket had surfaced in June when at least four patients, reported to be Covid-19 positive at the accused’s lab, turned out to be negative for the disease after a retest at the lab in Government Medical College (GMC), Amritsar, the reports had claimed. On June 23, Punjab vigilance bureau registered a case against the owner of TDC, Dr Tuli, and others for attempt to murder, fraud, criminal conspiracy and corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fake-covid-19-reports-hc-stays-arrest-of-two-amritsar-doctors-seeks-probe-report/story-zOrJDR3EObpqAS8gXssnqN.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Stubble burning: ‘Toothless’ PPCB seeks powers to act against errant farmers||The Punjab pollution control board (PPCB) has decided to seek tougher directions and a policy decision from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to act against farmers who indulge in stubble burning. Like the previous kharif (paddy) harvest seasons, the state agencies are anticipating incessant stubble burning this time too, which is expected to cause smog in the northern states, particularly the National Capital Region. In 2019, 50,738 cases of stubble burning were reported in the kharif season while 2018 saw 59,684 cases. The state government is under tremendous pressure to control the menace as the NGT has asked the Punjab government to bring the cases down to zero. “How would that be possible when there is no mechanism for recovering environment compensation imposed on farmers who indulge in stubble burning,” asked a PPCB official. According to the official, errant farmers are given challan chits but the matter ends there as most of them don’t deposit the penalty. “Farmers don’t give penalty because law is silent on it, I have come to know that PPCB is moving NGT,” said secretary, agriculture, KS Pannu. PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said, “In 2018, Rs 1.37 crore penalty was imposed on at least 4,800 farmers, out of which about Rs 20 lakh was recovered. Similarly in 2019, a penalty of Rs 6 crore was imposed on 23,000 farmers but only Rs 15 lakh could be recovered.” “We have asked the department of science and technology to take up the matter with NGT so that a mechanism can be formulated in this regard,” he said. Until last year, PPCB was recovering penalty and the amount was going into the board’s account. “We want the penalty to be deducted at the level of crop payment to the farmers,” said Garg. Ahead of the harvest season, expected to begin from October 1, the PPCB and the remote sensing centre have decided to run a joint operation to check stubble burning. The Punjab remote sensing centre (PRSC) based in Ludhiana has developed an android application to provide end-to-end solution for reporting and action taken for each fire incident captured through satellite. Officials in PPCB and PRSC say during the previous kharif harvest season, the entire effort to stop stubble burning by different agencies didn’t have a common platform. What’s the penalty? NGT has asked the state government agencies to impose a penalty of Rs 2,500 on farmers who burn stubble on two acres; Rs 5,000 on 2 to 5 acres and Rs 15,000 on farmers who set ablaze stubble over more than 5 acres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stubble-burning-toothless-ppcb-seeks-powers-to-act-against-errant-farmers/story-J1Pwvk7G5TtYD2K3WGyfTJ.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||Wadala TT custodial death case: Victim died of heart attack, says crime branch in affidavit submitted to Bombay HC||The crime branch in its affidavit filed in the Bombay high court (HC) in the alleged custodial death of 27-year-old Vijay Singh at Wadala TT police station last year averred that based on the post-mortem reports of Sir JJ and King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospitals, the victim died of a heart attack and hence there is no substance in the various contentions raised by his family in their petition. The affidavit says that as there was discrepancy in the post-mortem reports of both the hospitals, a clarification was sought and is awaited. The KEM Hospital report stated that Singh suffered “acute coronary insufficient precipitated by sudden panic attack”, indicating unnatural death, while the report from Sir JJ Hospital report stated that Singh died of “myocardial infraction.”The affidavit filed by senior inspector Ninad Sawant, from crime investigation department unit 4, Antop Hill, stated on October 27 around 11pm, a woman was on her way to meet her friend at Wadala RTO. Singh, who was on a motorcycle, pulled the woman’s hand and she fell. On hearing her cry, her friend rushed to the spot, accosted Singh and held him by the collar and questioned why he pulled the woman’s hand, the affidavit said. In the meantime, Singh’s two friends, Ankit Mishra and Nirmal Singh, reached the spot and assaulted the woman’s friend and he suffered head injuries. A police van, which was passing by, took the five people to the Wadala TT police station. After hearing the incident, station house officer Sandip Kadam filed a non-cognisable complaint against Singh and his friends and the woman and her friend to Sion Hospital for medical treatment, the affidavit stated. Singh was kept in the lock-up, while his two friends were made to sit outside. Around 12.30am, Kadam left for Sion hospital and returned with the complaint filed by the woman and her friend. At the time, Singh started complaining of chest pain and was brought out of the lock-up. But he continued to feel uneasy and so was allowed to go out of the police station for fresh air, the affidavit further stated. After going out, Singh collapsed and was taken to a hospital by his relatives, where he was declared dead. The body was first sent to KEM Hospital for post-mortem and later to Sir JJ Hospital. The affidavit avers that at the time of the post-mortem at KEM Hospital, Singh’s family did not raise any objection but later when there were protests, two officers and three constables were suspended and an inquiry by a special investigation team (SIT) was directed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wadala-tt-custodial-death-case-victim-died-of-heart-attack-says-crime-branch-in-affidavit-submitted-to-bombay-hc/story-ZLy4MeUi9yzEGHu3L4ksAK.html

01-08-2020||Mumbai||1.6 crore sanitary pads sold at subsidised rates under Asmita Yojana: Maharashtra govt to HC||The Maharashtra government on Friday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that 19,78,140 packets containing more than 1.6 crore sanitary pads have been sold until now through 29,875 self-help groups at highly subsidised rates to adolescent girls studying in zilla parishad schools as well as rural women across the state since the launch of the Asmita Yojana in 2018. The government, in an affidavit, said that the Asmita Yojana has been designed and implemented through women self-help groups with the objective to ensure accessibility and availability of affordable sanitary pads across rural Maharashtra. Under the scheme, a pack of eight napkins is being sold to adolescent school girls for ₹5 and to rural women for ₹24. The affidavit was filed in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) jointly filed by law graduate Nikita Gore, who is working as a research assistant at the Aurangabad bench of the HC, and law student Vaishnavi Gholave. The duo sought an order to declare sanitary napkins as an essential commodity and start its distribution through the public distribution system, along with other essential commodities. In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar, the petitioners have highlighted the need to easy access to sanitary napkins as women cannot predict when menstruation will start. It further stated that the supply of sanitary pads should also be made accessible at schools and workplaces. The PIL has also stated that hygienic menstrual absorbents help adolescent girls and women to “manage menstruation effectively, safely, comfortably and fearlessly” and increases their attendance at school or at workplace during menstruation. The petitioners have asserted that sanitary napkins are essential requirement of every woman and women have right to get them at cheaper rate as on an average every woman spends about 3,000 days of her life menstruating and the lack of cleanliness during this period may lead to infections. Therefore, they have also sought proper implementation of the national guidelines for menstrual hygiene management issued in 2015 by the Union ministry of drinking water and sanitation. The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Sarang Kotwal on Friday adjourned the PIL for three weeks after a counsel for central government sought time to file an affidavit in response to the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-6-crore-sanitary-pads-sold-at-subsidised-rates-under-asmita-yojana-maharashtra-govt-to-hc/story-LeZzbsoLj4l8eODfgIQ3CK.html
01-08-2020||City||2 more arrested for threatening comedienne||The city cyber police on Thursday night arrested two more men, who in a video allegedly abused and issued rape threats to a city-based comedienne, from Virar. The comedienne had recently courted controversy after a video of her stand-up act performed last year went viral, in which she has been accused of insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. She had later apologised on social media and deleted the video. The police had earlier arrested Umesh Dada alias Imtiyaz Shaikh in the same case on similar charges from Nallasopara on July 13. Shaikh’s friend, YouTuber Shubham Mishra, too, was arrested on July 12 from Vadodara on charges of threatening and abusing the woman. The arrested two, Ashraf Shaikh, 28, and Virat Sharma, are Virar residents. Both are Class 10 dropouts and run auto-rickshaw for living. The two are Shaikh’s friends. Investigations have revealed that Shaikh and these two were highly influenced by Hindustani Bhau, a popular YouTuber and former Big Boss contestant. “Influenced by the style of Hindustani Bhau who abused or roasted people in his videos, the three made similar videos to gain popularity in short time. In this attempt, they made videos on the comedienne,” said a police officer requesting anonymity. Their videos, too, had gone viral. They had switched off their phones and were underground. “After hunting them for over 15 days, we arrested them on Thursday night,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber). The two have been arrested under sections 294, 354A, 354B, 505, 506, 509 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 67A of Information Technology Act. They were produced in court on Friday. After being caught, the two made a video in which they apologised for their actions. The video was later shared on social media platforms. After the comedienne’s clip went viral, a Shiv Sena leader had complained to Maharashtra’s home minister. Later, activists from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) vandalised the place in Khar where she had performed. After a video of MNS’s stunt was shared on social media, Mishra and Shaikh uploaded videos on social media, threatening to rape her for disrespecting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. They also abused her mother and sister. After many prominent personalities such as Mallika Dua, Swara Bhasker, Kunal Kamra and journalists criticised the video and sought intervention, state home minister Anil Deshmukh asked police to take action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-more-arrested-for-threatening-comedienne/story-n8xfTHyxZLoEYInFAbP58N.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||Ex-Union home secretary Ram Pradhan, who chaired 26/11 Mumbai attacks probe panel, dies at 92||Ram D Pradhan, who served as the Union home secretary in the Rajiv Gandhi government, passed away in Mumbai on Friday morning, owing to age-related ailments. He was 92 and is survived by his wife and three children. Pradhan had also served as the former chief secretary of Maharashtra and the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh. Pradhan was also instrumental in signing the Assam Accord and the Mizoram Peace Accord. After 36 years of service with the Government of India, Pradhan had also led a two-member inquiry team into the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks after his retirement, at the behest of the state government, and tabled a probe report on the incident within four months. Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and several political leaders, including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, state public works department minister and former chief minister (CM) Ashok Chavan, expressed grief over Pradhan’s demise. Koshyari, in an official note from Raj Bhavan, called Pradhan “the most experienced statesmen, brilliant thinker and an eloquent commentator on national and international issues”. Pawar said that the former bureaucrat had “extraordinary intelligence” and “integrity”. In a series of tweets, Pawar wrote, “Besides Operation Blue Star, Ram Pradhan carried out work on Punjab issues with extreme patience, sensibility and studiously… Later, Punjab Accord was inked with efforts of many, but the credit goes to Ram Pradhan.” Pradhan had also served as the private secretary to Maharashtra’s first CM Yashwantrao Chavan and shared good relations with another former CM, Shankarrao Chavan. He could have headed for a possible political career as a parliamentarian from Rajya Sabha (RS) but the trajectory did not take off.In 1998, Pradhan, a seasoned administrator, had been handpicked by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to contest the RS polls as the party candidate from Maharashtra, but he lost the election after 13 legislators violated the party whip.Many in the political circles said that this defeat was a clear indication of the then strained and fraying relationship between party’s national leadership led by Gandhi and Maratha strongman Sharad Pawar. A year later in 1999, Pawar split the Congress to form the NCP. Ashok Chavan, who appointed Pradhan to probe the 2008 terror attacks, termed his demise as a personal loss and said he had lost a guide. In a statement, the PWD minister said, “I knew him since the time of Shankarrao Chavan [Ashok Chavan’s father]. I was regularly in touch with him for the past few years. He had contributed immensely during the Mumbai terrorist attack [probe]. He had a big role in several important national-level and state-related decisions.” For the 26/11 probe report, the Pradhan committee had interviewed 50 police officers and bureaucrats, scanned police control room data and intelligence inputs before finalising the report. In its report, the committee had praised the police’s response but had pointed to lack of overt leadership, apart from lapses in intelligence gathering, briefing, threat perception, crisis management etc. It had made several recommendations to modernise the state police force, set-up CCTV cameras for better surveillance in city and improve co-ordination with centre to tackle such attacks in the future. In one of his interviews to HT on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the 2008 terror attacks in 2018, at his Colaba residence, Pradhan had candidly admitted that the 26/11 attack was largely an intelligence failure on the part of central agencies. However, at the same time, he had cautioned that similar attacks on Mumbai were possible and stressed on the need for an elite marine force to protect our coastlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ex-union-home-secretary-ram-pradhan-who-chaired-26-11-mumbai-attacks-probe-panel-dies-at-92/story-j4cFlIYlGHYyMZc189X2CO.html
01-08-2020||City||Maharashtra Congress questions appointment of chief electoral officer, he rubbishes claims||The Maharashtra Congress on Friday raised questions over the appointment of the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Maharashtra, Baldev Singh, alleging he was facing a probe over alleged irregularities in SEEPZ, when he was heading it at the direction of Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Singh has rubbished the allegations saying the case being referred to is from the period before he took charge. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Friday said Singh was facing an inquiry initiated by CVC and the ministry of industry and commerce in an alleged irregularity in SEEPZ SEZ. “The Comptroller and Auditor General of India had passed strictures in the case in its June 2018 report tabled in Parliament. The financial scam is related to an appointment of an ineligible agency for the works without having an authority. Despite the ongoing probe, the Fadnavis government appointed Singh as the CEO Maharashtra in July 2019, just ahead of the Assembly polls. This has raised serious questions about the role of the commission,” he alleged. Sawant questioned why the credentials of the CEO were not cross-checked while appointing him to the post and whether the Election Commission of India was working under pressure of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Singh said, “It is very sad, mischievous and misleading, the way facts are being tried to be presented by the Congress leader. These are absolutely false and incorrect allegations as the capital works mentioned in the letters were allotted to NFCD even before I joined SEEPZ. The allotment was done by an earlier development commissioner, who was the competent authority to do so during his tenure. All payments were released by my predecessor and the information about them has been given to the competent authorities in the government.” Singh said that the letter, dated July 3, 2020, by the ministry of industry and commerce and produced by Sawant clearly mentions the role of one IRS officer has emerged during the investigation of the case. “This clearly indicates that I had no role to play in this entire case and the allotment of works and appointment of the agency were done even before I joined SEEPZ,” he said. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan had, earlier this week, raised questions over the appointment of an agency led by BJP leader and had written a letter to the ECI for action. The ECI in the letter to Chavan has said the CEO office did not choose the agency with BJP for the voter awareness campaign. Sawant said that the reply was dissatisfactory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-congress-questions-appointment-of-chief-electoral-officer-he-rubbishes-claims/story-XIN6wxKkDYiRMWctWLU50L.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||Ram Mandir bhoomipujan should have been held later, says Raj Thackeray||Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray questioned the timing of Ram Mandir bhoomipujan at Ayodhya which is scheduled on August 5, saying it is not an opportune time considering the Covid-19 pandemic.Thackeray said the event should have been a grand one and added, “There was no need to rush through the event. If it took place two months from now, people would have celebrated the event. Currently, people are not in that mindset to celebrate. The event should have been held when the situation is stable.”“I wonder why they have chosen this time for this event,” said Thackeray. He also shot down his cousin and Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s suggestion of conducting e-bhoomipujan citing that scores of people have given their lives for this temple and hence, the construction of the temple is inevitable.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple coming Wednesday.On Thursday, Dalit parties demanded that a grand Buddha Vihar be set up at Ayodhya. Union minister Ramdas Athawale raised the demand on the grounds that before the temple and Babri Masjid, there was a Buddha Vihar in the land citing that various Buddhist artefacts were discovered while levelling the ground for the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ram-mandir-bhoomipujan-should-have-been-held-later-says-raj-thackeray/story-1nXfgQvsNsdPdLjfmGejRI.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||Relief for students in Mumbai awaiting documents for caste validity: Provisional admissions for FYJC quota seats||Providing relief to lakhs of first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants in the state, the education department has allowed provisional admissions under various quotas.In a circular issued on Thursday, the department said that students who do not have the prerequisite documents to seek admissions to FYJC under various quotas can fill out an undertaking form stating they will submit them at a later date to confirm their admission. Until then, the students will be granted provisional admission.The portal for admissions for students to fill Part 1 of the form, which includes their basic details, will open on August 1. However, schools across the state are yet to receive the Class 10 mark-sheets. “Due to the current situation, students can upload an e-copy of the SSC results, which they can download from the board website at the time of application. Original mark-sheets, passing certificate, and leaving certificate can be verified at a later date,” states the circular.Several students and parents had requested the education department to grant an extension for submission of documents like caste validity certificates. The Maharashtra Navanirman Vidyarthi Sena had also written to the government, requesting that it not deny admission to a student if he/she does not have the document at the moment.The education department has now said that students who have applied for various certificates but have still not received them, can also upload a copy of the application receipt.In 2019, the department had decided to allot provisional admissions to students who fall under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as the two reservations came in a few days before admissions. Students were asked to submit their documents within six months from the time of admission and were granted provisional admissions based on an undertaking signed by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/relief-for-students-in-mumbai-awaiting-documents-for-caste-validity-provisional-admissions-for-fyjc-quota-seats/story-SLSszx3ItmRkmZkpe7qQYJ.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh received heaviest rain since 2013||With the 302.6mm rain received in July, the total amount of rain received during the monsoon season this year in the city (till July 31) comes at 472.9mm, making 2020 the year with the heaviest rain in six years (since 2013), as per data available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Although the monsoon period was hit by a lull for a short time, it is likely to gain momentum again after the second week of August, as per the IMD officials.As per IMD, the monsoon season continues over four months, from June to September. Although there was marginally lesser rain in July this year as compared to last year (319.4mm), the total rain received during the monsoon period is still the highest since 2013 when 489.6mm of rain was recorded in the city. Normal monsoon rain for this period is 413.5mm. Of the 302.6mm precipitation received in July, only 60.5mm of it was recorded after July 15. This was mostly due to 49.9mm of rain received on July 30. Besides this instance of major downpour, the city only recorded a few drizzles here and there.Speaking about this, regional IMD director Surender Paul said, “Monsoon arrived early in the region and there were multiple western disturbances present as well. Their interaction with the north easterly winds led to an above average rainfall. However, now an anti-cyclonic movement is present over the city forming an airlock over it. Due to this, the city of Chandigarh hadn’t received rain even when stations in Punjab and Haryana had received a good amount of rainfall recently.”Paul added that the approximately 3-kilometre long airlock over the city is likely to continue till the second week of August, due to which spells of heavy rainfall will remain unlikely in the city. “Some heavy spells of rain can be expected in the city after that, but chances for light to moderate rain will continue till then,” he added.After 1.7mm of rain was recorded at the Sector 39 IMD observatory on Friday, the department has predicted light rain upto 20mm in the coming days along with cloudy weather and wind speeds up to 45 km/h.The maximum temperature in the city went up from 31.5 degree Celsius on Thursday to 34.4 degree Celsius on Friday. Minimum temperature went up from 24.9 degree Celsius on Thursday to 27 degree Celsius on Friday. In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 33 degree Celsius and 35 degree Celsius, while minimum temperature will remain between 26 and 28 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-received-heaviest-rain-since-2013/story-5X0mwPNQA9rN2CofFDyvYI.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||20% water cut across Mumbai from August 5, says civic body||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a statement issued on Friday, announced a 20% cut in the city from August 5 until further notice, owing to low rainfall in catchment areas. The civic body the step is taken to ensure that there is enough water supply until July 31, 2021. “We decided to impose 20% water cut as a precaution. There are predictions of good rainfall in catchment areas from next week and we can always roll back the cut if there is enough water. Citizens should utilise water wisely but also ensure to use sufficient water for personal hygiene as we are amid the Covid-19 outbreak,” a BMC official said. Civic commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal also plans to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar, if required. The water level in the seven water-supplying lakes – Tulsi, Tansa, Vihar, Bhatsa, Modak Sagar, Upper Vaitarna and Middle Vaitarna – was 34%, as on Friday against the 85% level in 2019 and 83% in 2018. Although the 34% of water level is sufficient for supply for the next 100 days, the BMC imposed the water cuts as a precautionary step. According to data shared by BMC, the seven lakes have 4.99 lakh million litres of water against their full capacity of around 14.47 lakh million litres. The Bhatsa dam, which caters to 55% of the city’s total water requirement, has 38.68% water. It had 84.93% water during the same time in 2019. The BMC earlier decided to impose water cuts from August 1, but later decided to postpone the decision in the wake of the festivals on the first three days of the month. The civic body appealed to citizens to use water wisely, and to avoid any wastage. In 2014, the BMC imposed a 25% water cut, followed by 20% cut in 2015 and 2016. In 2018, the BMC imposed 10% water cut. In 2017 and 2019, owing to enough water in catchment areas, the civic body did not declare any cut. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems: the Vaitarna system which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20-water-cut-across-mumbai-from-august-5-says-civic-body/story-L04hjVJppMvpd8VvnLqi4J.html

An exception, however, has been made for siblings lodged in the jail.Additional inspector general (AIG, prisons) Virat said, “Keeping in view the safety protocols, it has been decided that unlike the tradition no visitors will be allowed this year.” “The rakhis received by post will be passed on to the inmates, but only after proper sanitisation by the jail staff,” he added. However, the jail inmates will be served a special meal, or as jail authorities call it, ‘bada khana’. This meal will include sweets like halwa, kheer and a special vegetable dish, along with routine dal-chapati.Burail jail currently lodges around 750 male and 35 female prisoners. Since March, the jail authorities had suspended visits of the family members as part of the measures taken to save the inmates from being infected with coronavirus. No decision has been taken to resume the visits yet.AN EID SANS EMBRACEOn the occasion of Eid al Adha or Bakra Eid on August 1, “the inmates will not be allowed to meet and embrace each other to exchange Eid greetings. All safety protocols will be followed while celebrating the festivals in jail,” said Virat.

Following preliminary investigation, the police arrested the company’s manager for negligence on Thursday. The incident took place on Tuesday around 11am at Vishwakarma Udyog company. The victim, Rajesh Gautam, was a resident of Digha in Navi Mumbai. “The iron rings were being moved to another location using a crane. The metal rings, weighing around 400kg, were not fitted properly under the belt, causing them to fall off the crane on Gautam. He suffered severe injuries on stomach,” a police officer from Rabale MIDC said. His colleagues rushed him to the civic hospital in Vashi, where he died in the evening during treatment. After his death, the police recorded the statements of the workers at the factory and Gautam’s brother, following which a case was registered. “When we visited the factory for inspection after the worker’s death, we discovered that the labourers were not provided with any safety equipment. They alleged that the metal rings were not fixed properly and were loaded in a haphazard manner. We suspect that the belt, which was holding the iron rings, was not maintained, owing to which they fell,” said senior inspector Nitin Gite from Rabale MIDC police station. The police then arrested factory manager Preetpal Singh Saini, 25, as he looked after the daily operations at the site. He was later released on bail. The factory is owned by Saini’s father Hardip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-welder-dies-after-400-kg-iron-rings-fall-on-him/story-F9GHkPr6iAz8bykh2WOZoO.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||91% sowing in Maharashtra raises hope for bumper production||With satisfactory rainfall across Maharashtra, the sowing average for crops in the state has reached 91%. Agriculturists and officials say they are expecting bumper agriculture production this year.As per a report collated by the agriculture department on July 27, crops have been sown on 1.29 crore hectare (ha) of the 1.42 crore ha that comprises the average area under kharif crops.Last year, sowing was done on 1.15 crore ha on the corresponding day. The sowing for oilseed crops like groundnut and soybean has crossed its average area of 41.57 lakh ha to spread across 42.89 lakh ha. Pulses have reached 90%, with sowing completed on 19.98 lakh ha against its average area of 22.17 lakh ha. This year, farmers preferred urad (black gram) and tur (pigeon pea) as kharif crops and they have been sown on 101% and 94% of the land for their cultivation respectively. Sowing for cotton is at 99%. Significantly, eight districts in drought-prone Marathwada had received 128% of their average rainfall by July 31. Over the past two months, the region has already received 60.3% of its seasonal average. Marathwada’s water stock is at 36.03%, compared to 0.98% on the same day last year. Maharashtra has already recorded 51.6% of its average monsoon rainfall and water stock in its dams is at 38% of their total capacity.Agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse said that if the rest of monsoon goes well, the state can expect bumper crops this season. “Barring a few areas like parts of Nashik and Raigad, all areas are receiving good rainfall. Sowing for almost all crops has been over 90% and we expect bumper production of all the crops,” he said. Bhuse said there had been a sudden rise in the demand for urea because of the early onset of the monsoon, but his department has been able to ensure smooth supply. “We need to make certain changes in the crop loan system by making it available in May and it will be done from next season,” he said. SS Magar, former vice chancellor of Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Agriculture University, said production of food grains may go up to 18 million tonnes. “Marathwada may take a leap in agriculture production this year. There have been experiments of integrated and precision agriculture by young farmers even in Marathwada and it has resulted in good yield per acre,” he said. Farming expert Vijay Jawandhia said, “Major crops this year are cotton and soybean, which fetch farmers good prices. We can expect good agriculture production this year, but the rainfall will have to moderate throughout the season.” He added that people migrating from urban areas to rural parts during the pandemic had resulted in easy availability of agricultural labour. “However, farmers were forced to borrow money from private money lenders because sources of income dried up, owing to job losses in families. The government should implement an employment guarantee scheme for farm labourers,” Jawandhia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/91-sowing-in-maharashtra-raises-hope-for-bumper-production/story-z6fkH6iX3LRO99sUMjtIqO.html

Most of the sisters are resorting to postal services to send Rakhis as siblings are refraining from visiting each other amid the pandemic outbreak. The Ambala division caters to Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat and Sonepat districts and as per official figures, the division had disbursed nearly 1.69 lakh Rakhi posts last year to the concerned post offices. Rohtash Singh, superintendent, RMS, said due to the pandemic fewer trains and buses are operating. As most of the people are avoiding travel amid the pandemic, they are sending Rakhi via couriers. “These are challenging times and we are expecting double to triple Rakhi posts this time,” he said. Talking about the increase in the load, Ram Nath, assistant superintendent, RMS said, “The load is so high that we have to deploy additional staff to make ends meet. We have also decided to run a special set at our RMS offices in five districts of the division on Sunday so that we can send every Rakhi in time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rakshabandhan-amid-covid-19-outbreak-mail-services-to-operate-even-on-sunday-as-posts-increase-manifold/story-yhZswGIEPS9amZdXrw8b7J.html

GMCH has installed the ventilators at its south campus building in Sector 48, which is a designated facility for critically-ill patients.Earlier, PGIMER had reported faults in the ventilators provided by the UT administration under the PM Cares Fund, following which the latter had raised the issue with the Centre. However, the UT is yet to hear back from them.PGIMER had, however, alerted GMCH, citing their internal findings regarding quality of ventilators. Based on this communication, GMCH had formed a panel of its own for quality assessment.Professor BS Chavan, director and principal of GMCH, said, “I received the report on Friday afternoon and the ventilators installed at GMCH-32 have been found to be up to the mark for adult patients. The ventilators were put on trial for 10 days. The manufacturers of the ventilators installed here are different from the ones who provided the equipment to PGIMER and maybe that is the reason why PGIMER reported faults.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-gmch-32-panel-finds-new-ventilators-of-satisfactory-quality/story-IZYLylf1OHkm8SbmGRYypN.html

01-08-2020||Lucknow||UP working to turn challenges into opportunities, says Sidharth Nath Singh||Uttar Pradesh has tackled several challenges in the fight against Covid-19. A focus on deft governance during the pandemic has helped the state deal with multifarious issues skillfully .One such challenge involved providing jobs to a large population of migrant workers, who came back to the state following the nationwide lockdown. Minister for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) Sidharth Nath Singh is an active member of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s team that has been tasked with turning these challenges into an opportunity. Umesh Raghuvanshi spoke to Singh, who also holds the portfolios of khadi and village industries, sericulture industries, textile, export promotion, NRI and investment promotion, about these issues and his efforts to bring investment to the state. Excerpts:How are you facing the challenges?Many challenges are there. But the guidance to work amid these challenges is coming from chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He is leading from the front. How?The arrival of about 35 lakh migrant labourers could have turned into a crisis. But the chief minister did not think this way. He began working before the arrival of the migrant labourers. A committee was constituted to make recommendation about giving them jobs. I am a member of the committee. We have carried out skill mapping of 35 lakh migrant labourers.How far have you been able to give them employment? We have signed MoUs (memorandums of understanding) with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), Laghu Udyog Bharati, Indian Industry Association (IIA) and National Real Estate Development Council (NREDC) to provide 11 lakh jobs. About 85,000 tailors have been absorbed in Noida and Greater Noida. There was an opportunity because many garment manufacturers in countries like Bangladesh and China were not able to supply garments to buyers in Europe, the USA and Canada. The chief minister allowed export units to be opened. There was a requirement of about two lakh. But we only had 85,000 to offer. Over 1.25 crore mandays have been generated in MNREGA. What about efforts to attract investment?The chief minister wanted that we get in touch with ambassadors and high commissions. I had a personal discussion with minister for external affairs S Jaishankar. He said the best way will be to use industry or commerce forums. Ficci arranged the same through video conferencing. We have got in touch with the USA, the UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Russia. We have completed the exercise with eight countries. Two more, France and Israel, are to be done. Uttar Pradesh has inherent strengths. A new industrial climate is being created here with reforms. We have given them information. It has helped. The Canadian ambassador (high commissioner) has sent us a proposal. There are proposals from the Indian Embassy in Japan. They have sent us five to six proposals. Americans say they have proposals. They are getting the proposals vetted. These proposals will be forwarded to us after vetting. Russia says there are certain investments that can flow due to the defence corridor coming up in the state.What about the new export policy?There is a huge disturbance in the supply chain from China. This is the time to fill in the space the China is leaving. This is a great opportunity. We are working on it. I have had discussions to take this forward. We are coming out with a new export policy. For example, China exports ceramics of about 8 billion US dollars. Uttar Pradesh has units of ceramics in Khurja. They are exporting. China will not be able to supply as much as they have been doing. They have about 80% of the global market. This is going to drop now. UP has to be ready. What about Microsoft?Microsoft’s north India campus is coming up in the Noida/Greater Noida region. We have identified land for them. They have to come and inspect the land. But unfortunately due to lockdown and Microsoft’s policy for this period, nobody is allowed to travel. These people have to travel from Hyderabad and Chennai. Once they come, we will finalise the land for them. How has this affected you on the personal front?There are restrictions on travelling. I have travelled to my constituency only on a few occasions. This gives you little time for yourself. My duration of exercises has gone up from 30 minutes to over an hour now. I have hooked on to some app-based yoga programmes. I never realised that I can cook so well. I have been cooking these days. I cook not only Indian food, but continental food as well. I have tried Teriyaki food too.Do virtual rallies or video conferences work?A: It’s always good to meet people. But some time a personal meeting may not be needed. Technology has come as a great help for such situations. We as a political party (the BJP) and the state government have been making use of technology to the optimum. On a day, I had to address a press conference in Kanpur and two political rallies in Prayagraj and Kaushambi. All the three were managed comfortably and the number of those who attended the virtual rallies was as good as it may have been if I had gone there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-working-to-turn-challenges-into-opportunities-says-sidharth-nath-singh/story-jqJLbIm1Yywtevf42RuA0I.html

The counsel for the other accused, Vernon Gonsalves, informed the court that as Gonsalves had tested negative and he had spoken to his family and let them know of his well-being, his plea was satisfied and he was back in Taloja Jail, but the family of Dr Teltumbde was anxious as they had not spoken to him. The state submitted that Dr Teltumbde was tested on Thursday and his report would be available on Saturday, which would be submitted before the court on Tuesday. The court has posted the matter for hearing on August 4. A division bench of justices RD Dhanuka and justices VG Bisht while hearing the plea of Gonsalves and Dr Teltumbde, seeking directions to the jail authorities to test them for the virus, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai on Friday that Gonsalves had been tested for the infection and the results had come negative. Desai further submitted that as per the assurance given by the state, Gonsalves had been able to speak to his family over the phone and hence his plea was satisfied and he was back in the normal barracks at Taloja jail after completing the quarantine period. Desai, however, submitted that the family of Dr Teltumbde was anxious as they were unaware of his status vis-à-vis the Covid infection. He added that Dr Teltumbde had not spoken to his family as well, hence the state be directed to inform whether he had been tested for the Covid infection and its result. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, for the state, informed the court that Dr Teltumbde had been tested on Thursday and the report would be available on Saturday. Thakare further added that the report would be submitted on Tuesday. After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state to inform Dr Teltumbde’s family about the outcome of the Covid test and also let the family speak to him, thereafter which the state agreed. The court has posted the matter for hearing on August 4. Both Gonsalves and Dr Teltumbde are accused in the Elgar Parishad-Bhima-Koregaon case and have been lodged in Taloja Jail along with other accused, P Varavara Rao.

Sales have also been minuscule and the traders said they hadn’t even sold a 100 goats among them.Mohammad Rashid, one of the biggest goat traders from Manimajra, said that from selling about 200 goats a day before Eid, this year they have sold only 20 goats since Wednesday. “Goats we would have sold for ₹15,000 now sell for under ₹10,000. Many people have lost their livelihoods due to the lockdown so they are not willing to shell out money to buy goats for Eid,” he said.Another trader Shaqil Mohammad said that some traders from the city had preferred to sell their goats in other cities: “We had bought special breeds of goats from Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, but due to zero demand, many traders from the city went to Malerkotla in Sangrur district of Punjab to sell their goats as the demand is still high there.”“Teams of the administration have been visiting every couple of hours to ensure that the market doesn’t get crowded and we wear our masks,” added another trader, Ashraf Ali.‘GABBAR SINGH’ PRICED AT ₹1.5 LAKHThe costliest goat for sale this year has beaten the previous year’s record. Although goats from Rajasthan are amongst the priciest, this year a goat from Amritsar in Punjab has fetched the highest price.Owned by Pintu of Manimajra, the black goat affectionately called Gabbar Singh, after the bandit leader in the film Sholay, is around 5 feet tall and weighs over 150 kilos. Last year, Sheru, an Alwari goat, sold for ₹80,000 at the market.MASJID HEADS URGE PEOPLE TO STAY HOMEThe religious heads of the major mosques of the city have urged people to offer namaz at home and avoid visiting mosques. Maulana Ajmal Khan of the Sector 20 Jama Masjid said that all devotees were further urged to follow social distancing while celebrating the festival. Maulana Imran of the Manimajra mosque added that the mosques will remain open, but devotees had been asked to pray from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/eid-al-adha-not-even-a-100-animals-sold-at-manimajra-goat-market-this-year-due-to-covid-19/story-2aru26WhnnotJpNYU1gBSI.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||MVA scraps pension scheme meant for the prisoners booked under MISA||In another reversal of the decisions taken by the previous Fadnavis government, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Friday scrapped the pension scheme meant for the prisoners booked under Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during emergency existed between June 1975 and March 1977. The state government was spending ₹42 crore annually on 3,452 beneficiaries since July 2018. The beneficiaries were getting ₹10,000 a month as pension as their due felicitation for their imprisonment during the emergency. The prisoners were treated at par with the freedom fighters in terms of the pension amount. “The pension was granted just on the self-declarations by the beneficiaries without any verification of the documents as decided by a committee under the then revenue minister Chandrakant Patil. There were complaints received from district collectors about the bogus beneficiaries reaping the benefits. Buldhana had a large number of beneficiaries, even while the district had no history of any movement during emergency,” said an official from the general administration department. Congress, while in opposition, had alleged that the Fadnavis government had introduced the scheme to benefit the prisoners who were mostly the activists of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Senior Congress leader and energy minister NItin Raut had, immediately after three party Maharashra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government came to power, had demanded scrapping of the scheme. Hindustan Times on March 1, 2020 had reported about the MVA government’s plan to scrap the scheme. State government issued a government resolution on Friday announcing that the in its bid of reducing unwarranted expenditure amid the financial crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the scheme is being scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-scraps-pension-scheme-meant-for-the-prisoners-booked-under-misa/story-0m17HtpIWIzVfxUaIz5ejO.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Online teaching: PU teachers seek option to conduct classes from home||The teachers of Panjab University (PU) have sought an option to conduct online classes from their homes. The online classes for the ongoing batches are scheduled to start from August 3 and the varsity has issued guidelines related to online teaching for its teaching departments and affiliated colleges. As per the guidelines, the teachers have been directed to conduct online classes from their respective departments. Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA), on Friday, wrote to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar seeking an option for teachers to conduct classes either from their respective departments or from their homes. PUTA president Rajesh Gill said, “Our teachers have several apprehensions regarding holding of online classes from departments like facilities at the departments, availability of Wifi, connectivity issues, and the observance of MHA guidelines on social distancing. Teachers should be given a choice to conduct online classes either from the departments or their homes. The objective should be effective online teaching rather than a mere formality.” PU has already decided that funds will be provided to departments if there is a need to buy equipment to support online teaching. PU senator Rajat Sandhir had also written a letter to the V-C seeking an option for the teachers to conduct online classes from home. He said, “The faculty members have appreciated the decision to start the academic programme through online mode, but are concerned about how social distancing guidelines will be followed when all of them will be teaching from their respective departments. The number of Covid-19 cases is increasing at an alarming rate across the tricity and the situation demands extreme caution.” “With over 800 faculty members using the campus internet network, there is a possibility that the connectivity will be compromised thereby making teaching less effective so I think the faculty should be given an option to conduct classes from home to reduce footfall and prevent the spread of Covid,” he added. Navdeep Goyal, who is heading the special panel of PU for taking decisions on online teaching and admissions, said, “We will certainly look into the matter and take necessary steps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/online-teaching-pu-teachers-seek-option-to-conduct-classes-from-home/story-ks4nW3qI53JT3zXUEyH4bK.html

The city has so far recorded 84% of its average seasonal rainfall. However, deficient rain in catchment areas continued to be a concern. The first week of August, however, could change this as the weather bureau issued an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) for Monday and Tuesday and yellow alert (heavy rain) for Sunday. No alert has been issued for Saturday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said July was also marked by a rare occurrence, the absence of a low pressure (LP) weather systems formed either over the Arabian Sea (AS) or Bay of Bengal (BoB). The LP system is a region of lower or reduced atmospheric pressure than normal causing weather disturbances including increased precipitation and cloud formation.“These low pressure systems are crucial for maintaining active monsoon conditions over central India, which witnessed deficit rain in July. The BoB was unusually quiet and thus country-wide rain was below expectation,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union earth sciences ministry. “However, Mumbai’s performance was exceptional with the formation of smaller weather systems that ensured good rainfall.”Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said, “Factors such as offshore trough, embedded vortex (localised circulation) and a mid-tropospheric cyclonic system over Gujarat region during different intervals in July led to this performance.”Independent meteorologists had a different view. “While no monsoon depression had a genesis over the BoB, AS or adjoining land areas, two LP circulations were observed over BoB and adjoining areas (around July 5 and July 14) and three others over AS (July 2, 9 and 17). The systems had strength equivalent to at least monsoon LP areas,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.Mohapatra added that a latest LP system over BoB was expected to form over the next couple of days leading to heavy to very heavy rain for Mumbai and west coast between August 4 and 6. “Every monsoon is different. August and September should be good for entire season performance. Excess rain in July for Marathwada and parts of Vidarbha is a good indicator for farmers. The next one week, the west coast is likely to be active,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.On Friday, water stock at seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai was 34.4% against 85.6% last year. Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay said, “Heavy to very heavy rain for the coming week will be good for catchment areas, but will come with inconvenience in form of heavy waterlogging and local flooding.”In June and July, Mumbai suburbs recorded excess rain (42%), which was the highest for any Konkan district, while south Mumbai recorded 40% excess for the period. However, neighbouring districts Palghar and Thane both recorded 29% and 17% deficient rain.Maharashtra recorded 5% excess rain with 563.9mm average for June and July, against the normal for the period of 538.5mm. Marathwada recorded 42% excess rain, the highest among the four subdivisions, while central Maharashtra recorded 11% excess rain, but 12% deficiency was recorded for Vidarbha. Overall, India recorded normal rainfall for June and July with 10 states recording deficient rain and Jammu and Kashmir recording large deficiency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-502mm-rain-in-mumbai-in-july-highest-for-the-month-since-readings-began/story-qUvIGEoBZtG8UsSyWGUwHI.html

On Monday, the IIT-B racing team announced that its car E-12 had won multiple awards at FSUK, which saw 73 teams participate from around the world. The IIT-B racing team came first in the design category, third in the electronic vehicle category (domestic and internation), and fourth overall at FSUK.The IIT-B racing team is a consortium of over 80 members, who aim to conceive, design and fabricate a formula-style race car through innovation to compete in different Formula student events such as FSUK and Formula Bharat. This year, FSUK was held online between July 22 and 26, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Our car E-12 is the 12th version of the team which has been made in conjunction with industry giants such as NRB Bearings and Mahle. The car has a tubular steel chassis with carbon fibre body panels. It is a rear-view drive design and the car produces 800 Nm of torque and weighs 230 kgs. The car accelerates from 0-100 km/hr in 2.9 sec,” said Asit Karmakar, assistant team manager. “While static events such as design, cost and manufacturing, business and Formula student artificial intelligence (FS-AI) were conducted as usual, the traditional dynamic events did not take place owing to the lack of a live event. In turn, the ‘acceleration’ and ‘skid-pad’ events were replaced by lap-time simulations that used a multi-body dynamics model and recreations of the courses used at Silverstone [the venue]. Secondly, online multiplayer competitive simulation races in Assetto Corsa tested the skills of its drivers, which mirrors the current popularity of e-sports racing,” said Karmakar. “We look forward to competing in FSUK 2021 at Silverstone next year, where our sights will be fixated on a podium finish, which would better the current result achieved by us,” Aditya Shah, head of marketing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-team-first-from-india-to-win-car-design-award-in-uk-contest/story-CjqovjOpuJaeKdiij1kmDO.html

We are going through the CCTV footages of the nearby areas to nab those who dumped the kits on the road and will register a complaint with the Arnala Coastal police against them under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and other offences for spreading infection,” he said.The civic body’s cleared the kits after a resident, Prasanjeet Ingle, informed the health department about it. “There are four hospitals and also a civic Covid care centre in the vicinity. We suspect one of these medical facilities may have dumped the kits on the road,” Ingle said. Earlier this month, a rag picker from Narangi, Virar, was seen wearing a used personal protection equipment (PPE) gear, creating panic among locals. On questioning, the man said a doctor from Narangi had given the PPE to use as a raincoat, said Ingle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/200-kits-with-swab-samples-dumped-on-road-in-virar/story-7ipW8XmifSfLT6YtxhUUZL.html

Dharavi, one of the most affected areas in Mumbai, reported five new cases, taking the tally to 2,556.An analysis of the data by the state health department showed that in June alone, the state had recorded 107,106 cases and 5,569 fatalities. The cases, though more in terms of absolute numbers than the previous months, have not shown an exponential rise despite the increase in the number of tests. The state government doubled the testing count from June to July, but the positivity rate remained almost the same. In July alone, the state tested 11,63,375 samples and had a positivity rate of 21.26%. while in June, the state had tested 504,547 samples and had a positivity rate of 21.22%.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that cases were expected to rise further in August before a downward trend could be seen. He added that the state is now focusing on bringing down the number of fatalities.Tope said the various parameters were showing positive signs for the state, including doubling rate, recovery rate, among others. “By and large, we have the outbreak under control. The doubling rate in Maharashtra is 30 days; better than the country’s, which is around 22 days. The recovery rate is over 60% now. Our stress will remain on containing the death rate. A task force has been set up for that, which is working with districts, we have tele-ICUs, where doctors from rural areas can consult with the doctors on the taskforce via video calls, about a critical patient,” Tope said.Pune city recorded the highest number of cases in the state with 1,635 fresh infections taking the city’s tally to 58,559. Pune city reported 30 deaths, taking its toll to 1440. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 919 new cases and 25 fatalities.

Nashik city reported 313 new cases, taking the city’s tally closer to 10,000-mark. “The cases are going up in rural areas, but the outbreak has a pattern —peak, plateau and drop — it will come down. We have seen this in the case of Mumbai… In my assessment, the numbers will go up in August as well, but we are well placed in terms of availability of beds and other equipment [to tackle the cases],” Tope said.Meanwhile, Tope wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar asking for appointing “flying squads” on division level to ensure “effective” implementation of the state government notifications, including cashless treatment under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, capping of rates for private hospitals, and free ambulance services.“The decision on capping bills or insurance under MJPJAY was taken keeping the people in mind and therefore to see to it that they are followed completely, I have written to CM and Deputy CM. I have requested to form a flying squad on the division level to see if these schemes are followed. “Several complaints have come from people and elected representatives that they are not been followed in some cases. Another request that I have made in the letter is that district collector and municipal commissioners in cities should visit at least five Covid hospitals and the hospitals empanelled under MJPJAY to see if the schemes of the government are being implemented fully,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/58-6-of-state-s-covid-19-cases-reported-in-july-tally-422-118/story-yWsPoraFvYH0Qf7vFCVbeO.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||State categories of Covid warriors entitled to insurance, ex-gratia: HC to Govt||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed the Maharashtra government to file an affidavit by Tuesday, disclosing the precise categories of Covid-19 warriors will be entitled to the insurance cover of ₹50 lakh or an ex-gratia of ₹50 lakh for their kin in case of their death from the virus. The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Sarang Kotwal was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by former journalist Ketan Tirodkar, seeking the status of martyrs for doctors, health workers and police personnel who have died in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the compensation status. Responding to the PIL, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni pointed out that the Union home ministry clarified that such the status of martyr is not conferred upon those Covid-19 warriors who die in the line of duty. With regards to the compensation, Kumbhakoni said the Maharashtra government has covered the families of the frontline workers who died of the virus under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package to incorporate all categories of Covid-19 warriors who come directly in contact with the infected patients and their families will also get an additional amount of ₹50 lakh as ex-gratia from the state. He said such families will also be entitled to retain the service quarters allotted to them till the date of retirement of the deceased employee. Replying to a query posed by the bench, Kumbhakoni said that even the staff of private hospitals functioning as Covid centres will be covered under the central insurance scheme. The bench, however, found that the government resolutions issued by the Maharashtra public health department on the topic did not clearly spell out the precise categories of health and other workers entitled to the benefits. Therefore, it directed the government to file an affidavit, clearly stating the categories of workers entitled to the benefits. The bench said the family members of the deceased workers should not be made to run from pillar to post to get a clarification about their entitlement. The court posted the PIL for further hearing on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-categories-of-covid-warriors-entitled-to-insurance-ex-gratia-hc-to-govt/story-lFWb5dap4Yxk0CUa6g1guO.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||HC grants temporary bail to 65-year-old murder convict in view of Covid-19||The Bombay high court (HC) last week granted temporary bail to a murder convict on the grounds that he is 65 years of age and hence is at risk of contracting Covid-19 infection.The bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Surendra Tavade refused to grant regular bail to Sitaram Kamble, however, it took note of the fact that Kamble was 65 years of age and thus was “very vulnerable if he is infected with coronavirus”. “In such a condition, the applicant can be released on temporary bail for limited period,” said the bench while granting temporary bail to the Ratnagiri resident.Ratnagiri sessions court has in November 2014 convicted Kamble for murdering his neighbour on February 1, 2013 over an affair between the convict’s son and the wife of the deceased. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment.He had moved HC seeking regular bail during pendency of his appeal against the conviction. It was argued on his behalf that the conviction under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was not sustainable in law, as the convict had inflicted a single blow of scythe in a fit of rage. His lawyer, advocate Payoshi Roy, also pointed out that this showed that since the convict had no intention to cause death of the deceased, at best, it could be a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, attracting maximum punishment, and urged the court to release him on bail during pendency of his appeal, as he has already served seven years jail term.Additional public prosecutor FR Shaikh opposed the plea by pointing out that there are three eye witnesses to the incident and the trial court has rightly appreciated the evidence and recorded conviction for murder as the convict had inflicted a fatal blow with a deadly weapon on chest of the deceased.HC refused to consider the plea for regular bail on the grounds that it can be done only after scrutinising entire evidence on record. The bench, however, granted Kamble temporary bail till December 31, 2020. He has been ordered to surrender to concerned prison on Jan 1, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-grants-temporary-bail-to-65-year-old-murder-convict-in-view-of-covid-19/story-ZH2bwIyFDBP8lVU7GFcBfN.html

The patient had earlier been treated for Covid-19 and discharged from the hospital after testing negative. However, he was re-admitted after he suffered from breathlessness on July 29. Manpada police had earlier filed a missing person’s report, which was later registered as a suicide at Vishnunagar police station. The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) informed that the deceased, a resident of Motagaon Thakurli, had been admitted to the hospital the first time on July 20 and was discharged on July 27. He was re-admitted on July 29.“The deceased suffered from breathlessness after being discharged and was re-admitted on Wednesday. On Thursday around 7am, he called up his friend and left the hospital. He left the phone at the hospital. Meanwhile, his family was trying to contact him,” said an officer from Manpada police station.When the family called the hospital, the staff were clueless as to the patient’s whereabouts. “A missing person’s case was registered, and the family told us that he often visited the creek, which is near his home. We found the body along the Dombivli creek and suspect he died by suicide,” said RN Munagekar, senior inspector, Vishnunagar police station. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said, “The doctors who were on duty on Thursday realised that he was missing, and his family too was unaware of his whereabouts.

Jadhav was spotted standing outside Rajgruh, while More went inside the house and damaged glass windowpanes and pots in the compound, police said.“We have sufficient evidence to establish the role of the two accused in the crime,” Prabhu said.Jadhav and More were arrested under sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of ₹50 or more) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), based on the complaint of one of Dr Ambedkar’s three grandsons who reside in the house.The accused will be sent to jail from the quarantine facility after they recovered from Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-arrested-for-vandalising-rajgruh-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-ws9NRgOxOehi5ZcSYt9L6L.html
01-08-2020||City||Thane Mental Hospital offers place for staff to stay||After the death of two inmates at the Thane Mental Hospital due to Covid 19, the hospital has now given the staff an option to reside within the premises of the mental hospital. The two deceased, an 80-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man, tested positive for Covid-19 last week and were admitted to a Covid hospital in Thane. Hospital staffers who were in close contact have tested negative. However, hospital staffers are worried as they have to interact with each patient regularly even as some patients are not capable of maintaining basic hygiene on their own. “We are in close contact with patients; we help them with their hygiene and basic requirements. We along with the residents are constantly at high risk of contacting the infection. We are given PPE kits only in the OPD section or when we step out with inmates to visit the doctor,” said a staff member requesting anonymity.Dr Sanjay Bodade, superintendent of Thane Mental Hospital, said, “We are unsure of how they contracted the virus. More than a month ago, four staff members had tested positive. All the patients who were in touch with the infected staff were kept in isolation. Those who are newly admitted are also kept in isolation for 14 days. We have provided N-95 masks, shields and face covers to all staff for safety measures.” The hospital has claimed that they follow all ICMR rules and any patient or staff with symptoms is tested for Covid-19. “We have to be very sensitive while dealing with the inmates; wearing PPE kits and approaching them will be difficult for the inmates to accept. Making them wash their hands and wear masks at all times is also difficult, so we have to be careful while the staff interact with inmates. We have offered provision for stay and food within the premises for staff. However, some need to travel home due to personal reasons, but a few others continue to stay here,” added Bodade. On Friday, BJP leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya visited the hospital to check the situation.Currently, there are 853 patients and 713 staff in the Thane Mental Hospital. “With more than thousand people within the hospital premises at any given time, only around 35 to 40 have been tested so far. We shall complain to the human rights commission regarding the same,” Somaiya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-mental-hospital-offers-place-for-staff-to-stay/story-NpyzuoFHMfdh705DMg1GNI.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||SGNP capacity full as 5 of 9 leopards trapped in Nashik in July relocated||The Nashik forest department has trapped nine leopards this month from territorial forest areas in their attempt to address human-animal conflict in the district.Five of the nine leopards have been relocated to the leopard rescue centre in Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Borivli. The forest officers said that the centre cannot accommodate any more rescued or captured leopards. The rescue centre currently has 18 leopards across 18 cages. “An adult male leopard reached SGNP on Friday afternoon. In case of any future captures, animals need to be sent either to Junnar or Gorewada, Nagpur rescue centres. Our capacity is full,” said Vijay Barabde, superintendent of safaris and range forest officer, SGNP.Nashik forest officials said they trapped an adult male leopard on Wednesday, a nine-month-old leopard on Thursday and another three-year-old leopard from Sinnar division on Friday. “While five leopards (two male and three female), possibly involved in the conflict, were trapped and sent to SGNP. Another female was rescued from a well last Friday and released in the same area. Three more leopards were trapped in cages in the Sinnar area over the past 10 days, taking the tally to nine in July,” said Vivek Bhadane range forest officer (RFO), Nashik adding, “Another 16 trap cages are set up in this region for the possibility of more captures. It has allowed us to reduce fear psychosis among villagers and potential conflict.”Wildlife activists said it was an unplanned and reckless approach to tackle conflict that forced wild animals to be confined to captivity.A 12-km stretch along the Darna river (between Sinnar and Eklahare) where leopard numbers have risen significantly has witnessed a surge in conflict with five deaths and five serious injuries reported between December and July. Forest officials said in all 17 leopards have been trapped over eight months with nine released back to the wild, three still in trap cages at Sinnar, and five sent to SGNP.Senior forest officials said they suspect that the animal responsible for the deaths and injuries may have been caught. “Based on the report received from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, an adult male leopard was responsible for conflict cases. The adult male trapped on Wednesday fits this description. However, swab samples have been collected and sent back to the institute for confirmation,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west) adding, “Once we receive the response, a detailed plan would be prepared for the release of all other captured leopards at SGNP rescue centre. In the meantime, we are ensuring the least amount of human imprint in captivity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sgnp-capacity-full-as-5-of-9-leopards-trapped-in-nashik-in-july-relocated/story-mHZndJ1LCizShisDr7uRFM.html
01-08-2020||Mumbai||JJ hospital makes special chamber to transport Covid patients||To reduce the spread of Sars-CoV-2 among medical staff, state government-run JJ hospital has developed a first-of-its-kind dual-pressure mode transportation chamber for Covid-19 patients. It will also reduce the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) among hospital staff, the hospital claimed. More than 400 medical staff from civic and government-run hospitals in the city have contracted Covid-19 on duty. The department of surgery at JJ hospital, in association with the engineers of Kalbadevi-based Indomed Devices, has designed the chamber—Covid Kawach. “Covid-19 infected patients need to undergo CT scan, X-ray , among other diagnoses, in different departments. This increases the chances of spreading the infection to medical staff and bystanders. We have decided to use this Covid Kawach while shifting patients,” said Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, head of the surgery department at the hospital. “This indigenous transportation vehicle consists of negative and positive pressure sections, which is much safer in comparison to the traditional open stretchers,” said Dr Amol Wagh, from the surgery department. It is a cost-effective, easily assembled unit which can be made anywhere in India with readily available material, claimed the doctors. It consists of a HEPA filter (air filters) at the head-end, which filters out particles as small as 0.02 microns. The negative suction chamber helps remove the infected aerosols released by the patient. It helps release filtered air out of the chamber. Also, the sealed chamber prevents any leakage of air from the box. “We can also use the chamber to safely transport other non-Covid patients with compromised immunity to different departments,” said Dr Wagh. The hospital started the use of the prototype transportation chamber on Friday. Soon, it will be installed at the two other government-run hospitals— St George and GT Hospital. Each of them will cost around ₹50,000. “Dr Bhandarwar approached us to manufacture a portal where Covid-19 patients can be shifted safely with minimalist risk of spreading the virus. It took us around 10 days,” said Shrikant Mishra, CEO of Indomed Devices. The chamber can be upgraded further by incorporating UV-C lights which helps destroy the virus by altering the structure of its cell. HT had reported earlier how despite wearing PPE regularly, medical staffers contract the virus through hospital cross-transmission. “When patients are being taken in elevators, the enclosed environment exposes them to the virus. Even though they wear PPE, it is extremely risky for them. As this chamber doesn’t let viruses out, there is no need to wear PPE,” said Dr Bhandarwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jj-hospital-makes-special-chamber-to-transport-covid-patients/story-zAauKSrvVYkVWJjMesR1SL.html
01-08-2020||Noida||Four held for murder of teenager||Three minors were detained and another person was arrested by the Phase-2 police on Thursday in connection with a murder in Noida.Eighteen-year-old Rubaid Alam, a resident of Kakrala village, was found dead in a drain in sector 80 on July 29, five days after he had gone missing.“His family had filed a missing person’s complaint on July 26 and a search had been on for him since then,” said Farmood Ali Pundir, station house officer, Phase 2 police station.Police said the a passerby spotted the body .“The clothes matched the description of those given by Rubaid’s father, Mustaqeem who identified the body as that of his son based on the clothes, footwear and body identifiers,” said the SHO.Mustaqeem’s complaint had said that Alam was last seen with four of his friends --the three minors and a 22-year-old man identified by his first name Shahrukh-- on July 24. Police later picked them up for questioning from near Kulesra border on Thursday night.“It seems that Shahrukh was seeing a woman and he suspected that Rubaid Alam was involved with her too. He them came up with the plan to murder him. On July 24, around 11 pm, the minor boys took the victim to a secluded spot near sector 112 where Shahrukh was already present. They strangled him and threw his body in the drain nearby,” said Pundir.A case was registered at the Phase 2 police station against the four under sections 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender,) and 120B (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.They were produced before a magistrate on Friday from where they were later sent to jail and juvenile detention centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/four-held-for-murder-of-teenager/story-bA0OjBT7W8XEbarHwTfPoM.html
01-08-2020||Noida||Unlock 3.0: Ghaziabad, Noida remove Delhi border curbs||The Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad administrations on Friday have decided to open their borders with Delhi beginning Saturday. Movement in containment zones, however, will continue to be restricted.The two Uttar Pradesh border districts had restricted movement with the national capital in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. While Ghaziabad had implemented it since April 20, Gautam Budh Nagar had done so since the first phase of the lockdown in March.The latest orders were passed following the Union home minister’s announcement of further easing restrictions under its “Unlock 3.0” plan that will come into effect from August 1. The guidelines state that while states were free to prohibit certain activities based on their assessment of the situation, there would be no restriction on inter and intra state movement of persons and goods. Both districts will continue closing markets during the weekends from 10pm on Friday to 5am on Monday, as per the Uttar Pradesh government orders.“The will be no restriction on movement of commuters to Delhi but we will not allow commuters from containment zones to move out. The cops will remain deployed at the border for their routine checks. Shops and markets in Ghaziabad, outside the containment zones, will continue to operate between 9am to 9pm,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey. Gautam Budh Nagar DM Suhas LY said, “The lockdown in containment zones will continue till August 31, with only essential services allowed in such areas. All the educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and coaching centres will also remain closed till August 31. Besides, cinema halls, swimming pools, amusement parks, theatres, bars and assembly halls have been asked to remain shut till further orders.”Keeping in mind the upcoming festivals like Eid-ul-Juha and Rakshabandhan, the district administration has allowed shops selling sweets and Rakhis to open on August 1 and 2. “However, everyone going to markets on these dates will have to adhere to the health protocols while maintaining social distancing and wearing masks. The shopkeepers are also to take up required measures as directed earlier,” said the DM. Ghaziabad had earlier announced that such shops could open on Sunday.Although restrictions on movement at the border were eased, commuters will be required to follow health safety protocols. “Checking the spread of Covid-19 is the most important issue in this situation. All safety measures will be taken at the border points. Commuters will have to follow the safety protocols. There will be no inter-state or intra-state restrictions on the transport of goods, except in containment zones,” Suhas said. Independence Day programmes too will have to follow such protocols.G B Nagar on Friday declared fresh list of 486 containment zones, including 435 in category-1 (where there is only one case) and other 51 in category-2 (more than one case). Under category-1, a containment zone in urban areas will be 250 metre radius or the entire mohalla (floor, in case the patient resides in a society), while for category-2, there will be an added 250 metre buffer zone (tower and common facilities, in case of society). “In rural areas the village will be taken as containment zone if there is one case, if there is more than one case the adjoining village will be a buffer zone,” Suhas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/unlock-3-0-delhi-up-borders-open-relaxation-in-weekend-lockdown-due-to-raksha-bandhan/story-0JNVhVURtrVh6CBwp4YyQI.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Debris dumped on plains altering Yamuna’s flow||An inspection of the Yamuna floodplains earlier this week by teams of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), accompanied by NGO South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), to check for construction debris dumping has found that the violation has been going on for years and the dumped debris has been “flattened”, thereby raising the level of the plains. The sites inspected included areas underneath the bridges at Sarai Kale Khan, Mayur Vihar and the Signature Bridge. The SANDRP has made a report of its findings and has said that continuous debris dumping and levelling may affect the flooding pattern of the river. Also read: New central vista set to be expanded to Yamuna bankAccording to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order of 2015, any dumping of waste or debris on the Yamuna floodplains is banned and violators could be fined up to Rs50,000. Earlier this week, the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee had asked the DPCC to conduct an inspection after receiving complaints of debris dumping. “The floodplain patch of 8,000 square metres underneath the Mayur Vihar bridge, have been raised by two-four feet as a result of dumping of debris, which has been levelled over time by the agencies carrying out construction work along the site,” said Bhim Singh Rawat of SANDRP, who has put together the report. He added that large pieces of concrete waste, about 70 of them, can be seen on the floodplains. “The debris has been levelled in such a way that it has created a cross-sectional embankment extending up to an active river water channel and this will adversely impact the flow of the river,” he said. Similarly, at the Sarai Kale Khan site, about 20,000 square metres of the floodplains have been raised and levelled by contractors supplying concrete slabs and other construction material, it said. “We have used Google Earth images to asses the plains, which reveal significant damages to the original floodplain on account of continuous dumping of construction debris,” said Rawat. The report further said the Signature Bridge construction company is still occupying about 40,000 square metres of the floodplains for parking and storing equipment. Officials of the public works department, which is managing Signature Bridge, said some work on the bridge is still pending. “Work is still going on and once it is complete, the equipment it will be removed,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named. The Yamuna Monitoring Committee said it has asked the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which is the primary custodian of the floodplains, to give a status report on dumping activities. “We have asked the DDA to submit a response on the complaints received. We are yet to receive the DPCC inspection report,” said a committee member. A senior DPCC official, who did not wish to be named, said, “We are preparing a report based on the inspection. It will take a day or two to submit it.”A DDA spokesperson said, “Underneath Signature Bridge, used personal protective equipment kits were found dumped and were removed. At the Sarai Kale Khan site, we found no debris. In order to stop the violation, a permanent barrier has been erected at the entry of the approach road.” “So far, 190 fines have been issued to violators. CCTV cameras are being installed at different entry/exit points of floodplains from Wazirabad to Jaitpur. Thirty-four cameras have already been installed,” said a senior DDA official, not wishing to be named. According to experts, continuous dumping and levelling of debris could affect the flow of the river. A K Gosain, professor of civil engineering at IIT-Delhi, said, “Continuous dumping could have huge implications on the river. The river needs a path to flow and when more water comes during the monsoon, if the path is not available, it has a tendency to cut through wherever it finds loose soil. Hence,the path of the river should not be blocked even at a minimal level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/construction-debris-dumped-levelled-on-floodplain-raising-its-height-says-ngo-after-inspection/story-mShpu2ooVfA4DXmukCSzeJ.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Gangster on Delhi’s most wanted list arrested from Gujarat||A 31-year-old suspected gangster, who figures on the list of Delhi’s most wanted, was arrested from Surat in Gujarat, where he was being sheltered by a local liquor mafia allegedly on the directions of his counterparts in Haryana, the police said Friday. A life convict and parole jumper, Jyoti Prakash alias Baba was involved in a dozen crimes, including murder, kidnapping, and robbery in Delhi and Haryana, police said. Baba was fleeing to another city in Gujarat in an Audi Q7, allegedly provided to him by the liquor don Dhirenbhai Karia, when the Delhi Police’s counter intelligence team caught him. Karia, who had contested the 2019 Parliamentary elections from Gujarat’s Junagarh as an independent candidate and lost, is presently lodged in Surat jail in connection with bootlegging cases, said deputy commissioner of police (counter intelligence) Manishi Chandra. Originally from Delhi’s Najafgarh, Baba is the elder brother of fugitive gangster Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, who carries a ₹50,000 reward on his arrest. Together, the brothers helm the Baba-Nandu gang, which has a longstanding rivalry with another gang led by jailed gangster Manjeet Mahal. Their rivalry led to a dozen bloodbaths, including the killings of their relatives, in the south-western outskirts of Delhi and bordering areas of Haryana, the DCP said. DCP Chandra said his team had received intelligence that Baba-Nandu gang had joined ranks with liquor mafias in Haryana and Gujarat and Baba was being provided luxurious shelters in these states. The team prepared a list of major liquor mafias in these states and started infiltrating them, while also carrying out technical surveillance, he said. “Our efforts paid off when we learnt that Baba, who had fled to Nepal, had returned some three or four months ago and was hiding in Gujarat. A team was dispatched and it kept a patient watch on him for nearly a week. Baba was caught on Thursday while trying to flee to another city,” Chandra said. Baba was brought to Delhi on Friday and his interrogation led to the recovery of two pistols, including a sophisticated US Army make gun, and four rounds of ammunition from his hideout in Najafgarh. Baba was carrying a reward of ₹1 lakh on his arrest after he jumped parole in August 2019 in Haryana. He was also wanted in a case of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gangster-on-delhi-s-most-wanted-list-arrested-from-gujarat/story-CktodVUF0JRJA4FonlzUaI.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi prepares for Covid-safe Eid-ul-Zuha festivities||With a majority of the lockdown restrictions eased in the last few weeks, several mosques across the capital—including Jama Masjid and Fatehpuri Masjid —will hold prayers for Eid-ul-Adha, the second most important Islamic festival for Muslims across the world, on Saturday.Eid-ul-Zuha, more commonly known as Bakr-Eid, is the festival of sacrifice observed on the tenth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah which is the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. Most Muslims sacrifice animals—cattle, goats, or sheep—and distribute the meat among the needy and their own family members on this day.Sabiullah Khan, the public relations officer of Jama Masjid, said, “We will be following all the government guidelines for the congregation. Visitors without masks will not be allowed. They will have to carry their own prayer mats and sanitise themselves before entering the premises. The time for the congregation has also been advanced by an hour and will be held at 6.05 am to ensure there is no rush.”Due to the Covid-19 lockdown and the subsequent closure of religious places, Muslim devotees were unable to pray in mosques on Eid-ul-Fitr in May. However, as per Unlock 1 guidelines, the Centre had allowed religious places to reopen from June 8 while maintaining social distancing norms. According to Unlock 3 guidelines, religious functions and other large congregations continue to be prohibited.Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid, said they were grateful for the relaxation of norms. “People were not able to pray in mosques during Eid-ul-Fitr due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. We have made repeated announcements that people should offer their prayers at home this time as well. However, if they want to visit the mosque, they must sanitise themselves, bring their own prayer mats and maintain social distancing norms. Those with symptoms will not be allowed. If Eidgahs could be reopened across the capital, the load on mosques would reduce substantially.”Several mosques in pockets of Okhla, old Delhi, and north-east Delhi will also hold Eid prayers while maintaining social distancing norms. Mosque-goers see this as a ray of hope.“Eid feels incomplete without praying at the mosque or meeting our elders. Since there is no restriction over movement like there was in May [when Eid-ul-Fitr was celebrated], we will meet our family and friends. We have not earned much in the past few months and barely have had enough to eat. But we can’t let that dampen our spirit,” said Mohammad Imran, a street-vendor near Jama Masjid, who will not be sacrificing any animal this year due to financial constraints.On Friday afternoon, the Meena Bazaar, usually bustling with customers, wore a deserted look due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mohammad Saood, who sells women’s apparel for a living, said that unlike previous years, there has been no business this year.“The shops couldn’t open during Eid in May. But now that they have, we barely have any customers. We go days without selling even one salwar suit. Many businesses in the market shut down because shopkeepers could no longer afford the rent. We had two shops and ultimately had to let go of one,” said the 25-year-old. He also pointed out that the lack of livestock markets in the nearby Urdu Park has also added to the misery of shopkeepers. Saood, himself, bought one sacrificial animal this year, instead of three or four like previous years.Mohammad Sirajuddin, who sold 34 goats last year, has only been able to sell one this year. “Generally the rates are as high as ₹70,000-₹80,000 for one goat. But I had to sell a goat for ₹42,000 this year,” he said while waiting for customers on Friday.Many residents also expressed concerns over butchers visiting different families the same day to sacrifice the animals. “We have an arrangement with our butcher who will only come to our house this year. Besides, a substantial number of people will not be sacrificing any animal this year which means butchers may not be as busy as in previous years. It reduces the chance of infection spreading,” said Mohammad Yasir, another shopkeeper in Meena Bazaar.Elaborating on the spirit of the festival, author Rana Safvi said that the essence of sacrifice is obedience to God. “We won’t be having any guests over because of the pandemic. Praying at the cost of everything is the supreme sacrifice this festival aims to celebrate. Prayers and obedience include more than just fasting or namaaz. It also means helping others in need and this is what we are doing this year and following the spirit of the festival.”Sohail Hashmi, a heritage enthusiast, said, “Every year my siblings and some friends would come over for dinner. That’s not the case this year due to the pandemic. I don’t want to expose myself or them to the infection. So it will just be four of my family members and a quiet Eid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-prepares-for-covid-safe-eid-ul-zuha-festivities/story-e4uz3j0CKFoz4417qTzpWM.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Parenting challenges in the times of pandemic||Nidhi Jaiswal, a resident of west Delhi’s Paschim Vihar, got worried when her six-year-old son, who has been confined to home since March, started throwing (sometimes violent) tantrums every time she refused to take him to the neighbourhood park. Unable to deal with the situation, last month, the 31-year-old software professional ordered a few parenting books online but they did not help. She then started following several mommy blogs and social media accounts dedicated to parenting.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I wanted practical advice from moms with children as old as mine,” says Jaiswal. “How can you possibly explain social distancing to a six-year-old?”She is not the only one faced with the tricky question. The Covid-19 pandemic has emerged as a major challenge for parents, who are struggling to help their children adapt to the “new normal”. During the initial phases of lockdown, which continued from late March till late May, parents suddenly found themselves locked in their houses with children. Continued school closure, work-from-home protocols and social distancing norms turned homes into classrooms and playgrounds, and parents into teachers and playmates. Several parents, unable to juggle multiple roles, are turning to parenting experts and bloggers for counsel.Deepali Soam, who runs My Teeny Tot, an online parenting advice platform, is getting messages from parents struggling to figure out how to keep their children busy and deal with their mood swings. “Earlier, most queries used to be about children’s food and sleep patterns, but now most parents want to know how to keep them gainfully engaged. Children have a lot of energy, and with little to no interaction with their friends or outdoor activities, many tend to become edgy,” says Soam, who has a five-year-old son and a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. “I recommend preparing a schedule for children, dividing different activities throughout the day,” says Soam.Soam, a former school teacher, has over 52,000 followers on Instagram. She gained about 12,000 of them in the last four months.The challenge to keep children engaged, healthy and safe has been recognised by various international organisations. The United Nations Children’s Fund has also released a series of parenting tips. The agency recommends talking to children about the disease, setting aside one-on-one time with a child, doing activities together, playing, and ensuring children are safe from online risks.Vidhi Hatwal, a homemaker who lives in Noida, says, “One of my biggest worries is that my eight-year-old is becoming addicted to the iPad. Attending classes, watching movies and video calling friends might affect her eyes and personality.” Hatwal often turns to online platforms for parenting advice.Nora Bali, who offers parenting advice to over 10,000 followers on Instagram,says, “Since there has been a massive increase in the use of laptops and iPads, parents must monitor the content their children are exposed to. I ask parents to introduce digital detoxes,” says Bali, the mother of an eight-year-old.The pandemic poses a challenge to the mental well-being as well as healthy physical development of children. According to the World Obesity Federation, the pandemic makes obesity prevention more challenging due to increased sedentary time and reduced physical activity.“Children often lack the power to articulate what they are feeling. Since these are uncertain times, my four-year-old often turns to food when he is upset,” says Saru Mukherjee of Gurugram. Mukherjee has over 68,000 followers on Instagram (about 8,000 of them followed her during the lockdown). “I tell parents to involve kids in small household chores to give them some diversion and participation in physical activity.”Soam says the crisis has its positive sides too. “It has allowed children to spend more quality time with their family. It has helped many parents understand them better,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parenting-challenges-in-the-times-of-pandemic/story-2Gh01oaLYyCifHDJb1MH8L.html

Choice of advocates to argue the north-east Delhi violence cases shows misuse of power,” Sisodia told reporters.The L-G’s office did not comment on the reaction by the deputy chief minister.L-G Anil Baijal had referred the matter to the President on Thursday. Earlier this week, the Delhi Cabinet had rejected the panel of lawyers proposed by the Delhi Police, saying it would not help a “free and fair” trial of the cases related to the riots in north-east Delhi. On Thursday, Baijal also issued an interim order, saying till the matter is resolved, the panel of lawyers appointed by the Delhi Police and approved by his office will continue to argue cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lawyers-panel-l-g-misusing-power-says-sisodia/story-QigZxxusaerAVecRavcOBJ.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||Four Israeli technologies to detect Covid-19 in 30 seconds to be tested in Delhi||Four technologies to detect coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in 30 seconds developed by scientists from Israel are being evaluated at Delhi’s Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. About 10,000 people will be tested twice; once using the gold standard molecular RT-PCR test and then the four Israeli technologies to evaluate whether these innovations will work in a field setting. Unlike the swab sample collection method, for this test, people will have to blow into or speak in front of a breathalyser sort of an instrument which will collect a sample for testing.If successful, these technologies can pave the way for the safe opening of businesses and people will be able to coexist with the virus till a vaccine is developed, researchers said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The diagnostics are being tested in a collaboration between the Israeli Defence R&D, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The first technology attempts to detect the virus by a technique called terahertz spectroscopy. In this, a sample is taken, deposited on a chip and then examined in a manner that specifically detects SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. This does not involve any chemistry or reagents as it does in the current standard tests. The results will come in less than a minute,” said professor K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Raghavan said the second approach is called an isothermal test, and it amplifies the genetic material of the virus rapidly. “The third approach detects what are called poly amino acids specific to the virus. The fourth approach is to study speech samples from asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients, compare them with others and see if the tools of artificial intelligence can be used to identify those who are Covid-19 positive. All these approaches are working well in the laboratory setting, but the challenge is to see how they will work in a field setting,” he said. The final product can be a combination of two or more technologies as well. “We will see which of the four technologies works better at detecting Covid-19 afflicted people. It could be a combination of two of these technologies as well. We hope to see a very robust diagnostic test finally,” said Israeli ambassador to India Ron Malka. India’s manufacturing capacity, the ambassador said, made India a natural fit for these trials. “We are a small country and do not have the manufacturing capability like India. By combining advanced Israeli and Indian technology and India’s manufacturing prowess, we can find a way to resume our lives and exist alongside the virus till a vaccine is developed,” he said. Prof Raghavan said, “What was yesterday considered esoteric research in now being tested for implementation. Science is about such rigorous tests. If the technologies pass the test, the collaborators will roll them out in India and elsewhere.” Apart from the extremely rapid tests that the countries are collaborating on, the Israeli delegation has shared with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences some of the most innovative technologies that were developed in Israel to combat Covid-19. “The flight also carried on-board 83 hi-tech respirators for those with severe disease. The export of respirators is banned in Israel, which is now experiencing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, but these were brought to India on a special waiver,” Malka said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-israeli-technologies-to-detect-covid-19-in-30-seconds-to-be-tested-in-delhi/story-2RCpya8Pix6PViPAd1YfUL.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||L-G overturns govt decision; hotels, banquets to stay shut||Hotels, banquets and weekly markets will continue to remain closed for business in Delhi with the lieutenant governor Anil Baijal overturning the Delhi government’s Thursday’s order issued under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan, the third phase of the gradual lifting of curbs announced to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). A statement issued by the L-G’s office on Friday said, “The matter was discussed with chief minister and it was agreed that while there has been improvement, pandemic situation in the capital continues to be fragile and the threat is still far from over.”Besides hotels and banquet halls, the Delhi government had also allowed street hawkers to operate after the prolonged Covid lockdown. A decision on gymnasiums and yoga centres, however, was deferred. “A cautious and conservative approach is required. While the proposal to allow Rehari Patriwallahs (street hawkers) to operate for longer hours with effect from August 1 was approved, the proposals of the opening of hotels and hospitality services and opening of weekly bazaars are deferred for the time being and would be reviewed later by the SDMA,” it said.The L-G is the chairperson of the SDMA (State Disaster Management Authority) while chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is the vice-chairperson.However, a Delhi government spokesperson denied there was any agreement between the CM and L-G regarding the overturning of Thursday’s decision.“The statement from Raj Niwas is incorrect. Without getting into the details, we want to say that if the L-G agrees, we can send the proposal again for reconsideration. The revival of Delhi’s economy, while containing Covid-19, is the topmost priority of the Delhi government. The chief minister has always been a strong votary of reopening economy,” the spokesperson said.The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national spokesperson Raghav Chadha criticised the move.“We demand the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] change its decision and allow hotels and weekly local markets in the city to operate. The hotel industry and weekly markets are a source of employment for around two million in the city. The Delhi government’s decision was aimed at reviving the city’s economy, which would help these people. It looks like the BJP-led central government derives pleasure by undermining the democratically elected government of Delhi.”“The central government themselves allowed hotels and weekly markets to be allowed to operate since June 8 [as part of the Unlock 1.0 guidelines]. We could not allow it then, but we are in a position to do it now. So, why is the BJP taking a U-turn on the matter? Why don’t they object to hotels and weekly markets in BJP-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where the Covid situation is getting worse every day? In Delhi’s satellite towns such as Noida and Gurugram, which come under BJP-ruled states, hotels are functional. Why not Delhi then?” Chadha said.Sandeep Khandelwal, president of Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association, said, “We don’t want to get into the politics of lockdown and relaxations but want to tell the concerned governments that hotel owners in Delhi are under immense stress. The industry engages thousands of people in different roles and they are all jobless.”HT contacted several prominent hotels in the city but they refused to comment on the matter.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the Delhi government is in no position to question the central government. “The central government has helped control the spread of Covid in Delhi. The Delhi government had failed to control Covid. Economic activities are essential but they cannot be allowed at the cost of health and life of people. The AAP is making a pointless political issue out of it, which reflects frustration over their own failure in Covid management,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/l-g-overturns-govt-decision-hotels-banquets-to-stay-shut/story-EsUh4seAHffFQHmH3YkO6L.html
01-08-2020||Delhi||15k samples to form basis of Delhi’s 2nd sero survey||Around 15,000 blood samples – half of which will be from people between the ages of 18 and 49 -- will be collected from across Delhi between August 1 and 5, according to guidelines released by the state government that detail how the city’s second serological survey for Covid-19 will be carried out, setting a target that is slightly lower than the previous such study.The exercise is an epidemiological survey covering a representative population – the number of people, where they reside, their age and gender is meant to reflect the city’s demographics and who the outbreak affects. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe findings will help determine how much closer Delhi has gotten to the herd immunity threshold after the first serological survey in Delhi covering close to 21,800 people between June 27 and July 10, showed 22.86% of those tested had antibodies and we thus possibly immune to the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19. “On the first day (Aug 1), tests will be conducted in four revenue districts. From the second day (Aug 2), it will be done in all 11 revenue districts. The sample size has been set at 15,000 in adherence to recommendations of experts working with the health department,” said a spokesperson from the chief minister’s office.According to the standard operating procedures released to district-level health staff, the remaining of the samples will be collected evenly from people in two remaining age groups: those under 18 and those above 49. As per the document, a copy of which is with the HT, the highest number of samples has to be collected by the Northwest district (2,200), followed by West (2,145), and Central (1,548). The fewest has to be collected from New Delhi district, from where 885 have to be collected. Unlike the first round of the surveillance, where all of the samples had been collected door-to-door, the government has also allowed collection at selected spots and health centre. “Sample collection may be undertaken in community (through visits of teams) of at the designated spot/ health facility appropriate for public and the team. In both cases sample of only the identified persons (as per the age group) from the identified household will be collected,” said the SOP accessed by HT. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had on July 22 announced that a sero-surveillance will be undertaken in Delhi during the first week of every month will be conducted to determine the silent spread of the infection in the city. HT reported on July 29 that more than a hundred teams of three-four members each will be involved in the exercise. According to the SOP that will now be followed, households included during the first round of surveillance will be excluded in order to eliminate selection bias. The district and ward-wise sample distribution for the August survey has been planned by researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College. For the first round, this was done by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Each team, which can collect 25 to 40 samples a day, will consist of ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), a phlebotomist or a lab technician, and a community volunteer. Samples will be processed in 18 laboratories across the Capital, in Delhi government and central government hospitals, including the NCDC laboratory.“If you consider a prevalence of 23% — and I expect the number must have gone up by now — we need as few as 5,000 samples to estimate the population-level presence of antibodies statistically. A smaller sample would make analysing results quicker as well. However, a large sample size such as 15,000 would be beneficial to establish the prevalence in different groups such as children or vegetable vendors, provided it is a representative sample,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, who was also consulted by the Delhi government for the upcoming survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-outlines-sample-collection-plan-for-sero-survey-round-2/story-c5125GsIJb6C0g7AgppTqN.html
01-08-2020||Chandigarh||Illicit liquor trade booms in Majha despite crackdown||Even as the Punjab Police and the excise department launched a crackdown, illicit liquor trade continues to be rampant in Majha. The lockdown has seen a spike in trade with the excise department recovering more than 6 lakh litres of lahan (raw material used for making illicit liquor) in four districts — Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot — during the past four months. The number of cases registered have been 1,196 in 120-odd days or around 10 cases a day. “I haven’t seen such huge recoveries during my three decades with the department,” said a senior officer of the department in Amritsar, on the condition of anonymity. He added the spurt in illicit liquor trade resulted with the liquor in shops getting dearer and increase in unemployment due to the lockdown.Amritsar’s rural areas and Tarn Taran’s Mand areas, situated near the river beds of Sutlej and Beas, are major locations where illicit liquor is made. In July, an excise department team had recovered 2.5 lakh litres of lahan kept in 18 drums and 1,600 bottles of illicit liquor in the Mand area.Roshan Lal, sarpanch of Harike village, said, “There are some villages on the Sutlej and Beas riverbeds, where the mafia still produce illicit liquor. These villages include Marad, Kirian, Gharka, Chamba and Kambo.” Mohinder Singh of Chamba village said, “Mafia men stop producing illicit liquor only police conduct raids, and that too for a day or two.”Harikrishan Arora, a social activist in Tarn Taran, said, “One can purchase country-made illicit liquor from any locality of the city. Police started acting only after May, when the Punjab CM ordered a crackdown on illicit liquor mafia.” Patti deputy superintendent of police Kuljeet Singh said, “Liquor mafia men dig a pit along the riverbed, spread a tarpaulin and mix raw ingredients of illicit liquor in it. Our area is free of the menace.” 50% CASES REGISTERED IN AMRITSARData that HT has accessed from the department shows 590 cases were registered in Amritsar, with the recovery of 75,500 litres of Lahan, 7,500 bottles of illicit liquor and 1,300 bottles of PML (Punjab made liquor) and IMFL (Indian made foreign liquor).The department registered 29 cases in Tarn Taran district and recovered around 4.6 lakh litre of Lahan and 2,000 litre of illicit liquor. In Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts, the department has recovered 70,907 litres of Lahan, 9,638 litres of illicit liquor and 1,496 litres of illicit liquor.“The recovery during the lockdown this year is more than the recovery made during the last one year,” said excise and taxation officer (ETO), Gurdaspur, Lavinder Singh Brar, adding, “People were sitting idle at home and decided to produce home-made liquor than purchasing it from liquor shops. We had strict instructions to check the trade.”The cases of the excise department are different from those which have been registered by the police on its own. Joint operations are also carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-crackdown-illicit-liquor-trade-rampant-in-majha-spiked-in-lockdown/story-iT0f6GCFDH4YZljVIPBjzN.html

In the past, multiple twins have been reported born from Sassoon’s paediatric ward from infected mothers who are healthy; however, this is the first case at the civic hospital. The 29-year old woman, a resident of Bhavani peth, was pregnant for the third time with twins and was asymptomatic. Dr Madhuri Rokade, a resident medical officer at the Sonawane hospital said, “The patient was tested for Covid-19 a day before the C-section delivery for which the date was fixed earlier. She was tested using the rapid antigen test which turned positive. This was the third pregnancy of the woman. The twins are healthy and both are girls. The mother has no comorbidities and had two caesareans earlier too. The babies were born at 10:30am on Friday and will be tested for Covid-19 on the fifth day. We needed six doctors, two paediatricians, two gynaecologists and two anaesthesiologists for this delivery.” Till date the Sonawane hospital has seen about 50-60 babies delivered from Covid-19 positive mothers and none of the babies have tested positive for the infection, added Rokade. “The PMC welcomes healthy twins of Covid patient. Today, Dr Rokade operated LSCS in Sonawane Hospital helped by Dr Chopade, Dr Agarwal, Dr Arati, Dr Anita Bhosale and Dr Shrujan and SN Chaure. Thanks to the team at Sonawane hospital,” said additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sonawane-hospital-welcomes-first-twins-from-a-covid-19-positive-mother/story-aRtBxMOlgDdTa0LE4MKD0H.html

She died of old age. According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department officials, the woman was admitted along with four other members of the family in Covid Care Centre at Yerawada on July 20. “Her health deteriorated on July 24 through after subsequent treatment she showed remarkable recovery. She was responding to the treatment given by the doctors. The woman was completely on a liquid diet for eight days,” said Madhav Jagtap , deputy commissioner of PMC on Tuesday. According to Dr Sangita Bharati, one of the doctors who treated her, due to worsening of health after her saturation levels went down, there were plans to shift her to another hospital. However, the woman eventually overcame the virus. Harishchandra Ghuge, Darade’s son-in-law, said “She stopped eating or drinking for the past two days. We tried to feed her, but she was weak and would not even take fluids as she was on a liquid diet. We tried our best to save her but she couldn’t survive. Our whole family was affected by Covid-19 and we all are now cured and healthy.” Darade was admitted to the Covid centre in Yerawada though she did not show any symptoms and even the oxygen saturation was normal. At the age of 100, Darade also did not have any pre-existing infirmities apart from blood pressure. However, she had started experiencing breathing problems, and a reduction in oxygen saturation was observed. On July 28 she fully recovered from Covid-19 and hence, was discharged the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/100-year-old-who-recovered-from-covid-dies-of-old-age/story-KP6Kj0cxHNdWmJJBEqkG2I.html
01-08-2020||Pune||Government’s lucrative offers lead to staff crunch at private hospitals in Pune||The private hospitals in the city are facing a huge staff crunch not just because of extending duty hours or staff being infected with Covid-19, but also because of the high remunerations offered by the district administration. The revised salary offering by government hospitals are almost double the salary in comparison to the private hospitals. The state government hospitals are offering higher remunerations even to fresh and inexperienced doctors who are hired on contractual basis. Dr Sunil Rao group chief operating officer, Sahyadri hospitals said, “Yes it is true that most of our staff are leaving because of lucrative offers by state government hospitals not just in Pune but also in Thane. For example, nurses are offered almost Rs 45,000 per month for a contractual period of 3 or 6 months which is almost double of what we pay, a round of Rs 20,000 to 25,000 per month. These sudden recruitments by the government are leading to a huge staff crunch in private sectors. Almost 50 of our nurses have left our hospitals in just two months to join government hospitals in Pune and Thane.” While nurses are leaving in huge numbers, freshly passed MBBS, BAMS and BHMS doctors also prefer to join government hospitals because of the higher cost offered for the same job. An MBBS intern who is otherwise offered close to Rs 40,000 per month in a private hospital in a normal situation is now being offered Rs 70,000 per month. Similarly, the BAMS doctors who are paid close to Rs 20,000 per month in private hospitals are paid Rs 40,000 now by government hospitals and BHMS doctors are also paid almost double the remuneration. Dr Rao added, “Young intensivists who have freshly completed their speciality course are also offered close to Rs 2.25 lakh per month which was earlier close to Rs 1.50 lakh at private hospitals.” Along with the state government, the PMC has also hiked up its offer after it failed to get response for its previous recruitment drive and increased the offer for intensivists at par with what the state government is offering. Dr HK Sale, executive director at Noble Hospital said, “We are also losing a lot of our staff which has joined government services. New recruits are scared to join due to the Covid situation and the existing staff is leaving as the government is offering more. With capped prices and most surgeries cancelled, we are reporting losses and now we are also losing our staff.” Saurabh Rao, the new divisional commissioner who took over after Deepak Mhaisekar retired on Friday, said, “We are well aware of this problem and many private hospitals are raising this issue. What we are offering is as per the government norms, but the idea is not to poach on any of their staff. Most of the posts opened by the government are all on contractual basis and the requirement is too low and we have asked the private hospitals to brief their staff about this. We definitely need the help of private hospitals and their staff during this pandemic situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/government-s-lucrative-offers-leads-to-staff-crunch-at-private-hospitals/story-aB9V7ht0KvaFvy2eu2VmrO.html
01-08-2020||Pune||Doctors, IMA blast CM over ignoring demands||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to Pune for the first time in the past five months, since the first Covid-19 positive patient was reported in the city and the state, the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Maharashtra chapter has expressed its disappointment over the state government ignoring their demands and problems, especially those of private hospitals so much so that doctors have even expressed their willingness to go on a protest. The association has also expressed displeasure over the district administration’s decision to include small nursing homes as Covid-19 hospitals which might affect non-Covid patients. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra president Dr Avinash Bhondwe tweeted on Friday noon, “Maha CM visited Pune for supervising Corona pandemic control measures. We thought he would meet a few doctors as well. How foolish we were. As per the govt view, doctors are doing nothing. Just, extracting money. All the work is done by ministers and administrators.” Bhondwe further stated that the IMA has conveyed its objections on hospital rates which the government has, unilaterally, fixed the charges of private hospitals without taking into consideration the actual expenses. The private hospitals do not receive any grants or financial help or any concession in govt. taxes. Rather, some extra taxes are applied to the hospitals. The private hospitals do not receive any concession in electricity bills, water bills, staff salary, EMI, etc. The ICU needs 6-7 types of doctors per shift for three shifts per day. They all need a huge number of PPE kits and disposables. In addition, sanitization is a continuous process in Covid-19 hospitals. Hospitals have to bear this expense. The disposal of biomedical waste is also becoming an additional expense. He further said, “The staff has to be compulsorily quarantined for seven days after a duty of seven days. So, hospitals have to employ double the number of staff required. Also, they are paid 25 - 30 per cent more for working in Covid-19 pandemic. Sometimes, hospitals have to arrange for accommodation/travel/food for the staff. In addition to this, the government has threatened to apply ‘MESMA’ for the staff of private hospitals also.” Bhondwe further added, “Despite communicating multiple times with the government there has been no response. The members of the Indian medical association and other doctors’ associations are extremely frustrated because of all problems discussed above and the attitude of the government, media, police and public. They are expressing a willingness to go for collective protest in our meetings. But the IMA is deferring any such proposal.” The IMA’s stand has been reiterated by the association of hospitals in Pune in its letter to the new divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. The letter states, “We, private hospitals are still receiving notices on each and every day to increase our bed capacity for Covid-19 patients but no one is looking at the main reason for not being able to increase the patient base. Also, accommodation through the hostel is a major requirement which you had agreed to give us from colleges which are closed and hotels to accommodate staffs who go on periodical quarantine.” The letter also complains about the dashboard which is not reflecting all hospitals and also does not provide timely updates as it takes a lot of time of the staff which is otherwise busy treating patients wearing PPE kits. Dr Sanjay Patil, who chairs the hospital board of India’s Pune chapter said, “The decision to include small nursing hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients will leave the non-Covid19 patients with no medical help. Also, it takes a lot of staff to continuously sanitize the hospital premises. The hospital must have separate entry and exit for covid19 and non-Covid patients and also for the staff treating those patients. Rather the administration can include hotels into isolating asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms and the smaller hospitals can provide medical assistance when needed.” Saurabh Rao, the divisional commissioner said, “Maharashtra is probably the first state in the country which devised a task force for every district which includes representatives from private hospitals too. The meeting on Thursday with the CM was purely for administrative purposes; however, the CM is in constant touch with the medical fraternity through video calls too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/doctors-ima-blast-cm-over-ignoring-demands/story-2V2OcwSJcZ7szhmzEKKYyH.html

Under the “‘My Education in My Village” initiative, the varsity students have started teaching their youngsters, from nursery to Class 9 goers, of their hometown villages, in batches since the past one month. “When we came to know that schools in our villages were closed due to the virus situation, we decided to teach the students for free. We started the initiative from July 20 and follow all precautions laid by authorities regarding virus prevention,” said Kamlakar Shete, SPPU student from Khednagaar village, Karjat taluka, Ahmednagar district. “We give classroom lectures on all subjects, including English, Marathi and Hindi, and also conduct sports activities. The students’ parents have also appreciated our efforts.” added Shete. Another SPPU student Vinod Pawar from Pimpalgav village in Washim district said, “We use the Diksha- Balbharati mobile application and also educational videos sent by schools. We teach the concepts behind each chapter in simple language. Our initiative is getting good response from students across the state.” Prabhakar Desai, director, SPPU National Service Scheme (NSS), said, “Students have started this project on their own.

01-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s public transport use shifts to better gear: ESR draft||Though the total number of vehicles in Pune city is increasing per annum, since the last two years, 2018-2020, the number of private vehicles is decreasing and use of public transport in the city is on the rise. This was the main draw from the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) draft Environment status report (ESR) for 2019-20, published on Friday. The PMC’s environment department collects data from various agencies in the city to collate the city’s present environment status. PMC environment officer Mangesh Dighe said, “The important finding of the ESR is, public transport service is improving. The registration of private vehicles, mainly two-wheelers and cars, has been dropping for the last two years. PMC obtained this data from the RTO office.” Dighe said, “Till March 2020, Pune city has a total of 41,35,915 vehicles. The vehicle number is more than the population in the city.” Though two-wheelers still form the largest number of vehicles, its registration has been dropping. As per the ESR, in 2017-18, the total number of two-wheelers sold in the city are 2,05,804. Total sale dropped in 2018-19 to 1,76,314 and in 2019-20 it is at 1,67,406. For cars, in 2018, 56,401 cars were sold in the city. But in 2019 the number is at 47,617, and in 2019 it is 46,150. One of the observations of the ESR is that as cab services increase, more taxi-cabs are getting registered, with residents preferring to hire a cab instead of purchasing a car. Dighe said, “During the lockdown, the city’s overall environment improved drastically. River water quality, air pollution and noise pollution all are near the standard norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-s-public-transport-use-shifts-to-better-gear-esr/story-VLn0hYwMOAh6SoFUoKIviK.html
01-08-2020||Pune||Tenants return to hometowns leaving commercial property owners count losses in Pimpri-Chinchwad||Pune: Three months of restrictions imposed due to Covid situation have left many sellers who run shops on rent to return to their hometowns leaving the commercial property owners to put “on rent” boards again. Many of those who run ice-creams parlours, sweet marts and small hotels in Pimpri-Chinchwad hail from Rajasthan. “I had rented out two shops to run a hotel, but the lockdowns have left my tenants to keep it closed for three months. They left for their hometown in Rajasthan and have not given rent since the past two months. After they informed me of not reopening the hotel, I placed a “on rent” notice at the shop last week,” said Dattaray Chinchwade, owner of two shops in Tanajinagar in Chinchwad. “Profit has gone down by 50 per cent as only parcel service is allowed. I am finding it difficult to pay the rent and have decided to return to my native place in Rajasthan,” said Omprakash Jangid who runs Om Sai Snacks centre at Kalewadi Phata. Cloth shop merchants have also not seen many customers. “The recent 10-day lockdown left me with no choice but to shut shop as my business was badly hit by four months of restrictions. I could only be able to pay rent to my owner till July,” said the owner of Shivam Collection, Thergaon, on condition of anonymity. Pratik Pol, who had given his shop to run an ice cream parlour, has not found a tenant in the last 15 days. “It was my source of income. I am unable to get a tenant after the previous one left,” said Pol, who owns a shop at Link Road, Chinchwad. Federation of Traders Association, Pune, secretary, Mahendra Pitaliya, said that closing shops and returning to hometowns will affect the business and earnings of both owners and tenants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tenants-return-to-hometowns-leaving-commercial-property-owners-count-losses-in-pimpri-chinchwad/story-DCFlCALLXoQNyn5BmiABKJ.html

The days of thriving festivities have come and gone by in a state of lacklustre haze. Eid-ul-adha, which begins on July 31 this year, and culminates on August 1 in India as per moon sighting, is a day that will also go by without the usual daawats and family feasts. Eid-ul-adha marks some important rituals in Islam, but this year, due to the Covid19 scare, celebrations will be low-key for many. Some have chosen to donate money in place of distributing meat of the sacrificial lamb, while others will let go of family gatherings.Author Sadia Dehlvi, known for her lavish lunches and soirees, says, “We used to have nice lunches, but this year, it will be very quiet. My brother and his wife will come over and we will have dinner, but that’s about it.”Any festival is an excuse for extended family and friends to get together. People you might not otherwise see all year round visit and partake in the celebrations. Author Rakhshanda Jalil, who would make elaborate meals consisting of sewaiyan, biryani, kebabs and kaleji, will be letting go of this tradition. “We would usually have an open house, but this year, there will be no gathering. The whole point of a feast is that you cook for family and friends, and all of you celebrate together,” she says.Another aspect of Eid-ul-adha is charity. In case a practising Muslim is unable to distribute meat to the needy, then they donate money. Author Rana Safvi has also been doing that. “This year, we will be celebrating it in spirit. Even my daughter, who lives in Delhi, won’t be able to visit as I live in Greater NOIDA and there are restrictions on movement,” she says.Read: Eid al-Adah 2020: Traditional and unconventional recipes for BakridVisiting relatives and exchanging gifts is an intrinsic part of festivals, but with the current impositions, this ritual has also been compromised for some. “Our family has this rule: No meeting, no Eidi. So that’s a bit sad,” says chef Sadaf Hussain, adding, “We would go to our mama’s (maternal uncle) house in Ghaziabad and the day would begin with eating kaleji. For the first time in nine years we would not be visiting his house.” There were some problems with getting a goat this year, he says. “We have now asked our neighbour to buy some kaleji so that a part of our tradition remains intact. At home, we will be making biryani and kebabs. Iss baar ek khaalipan toh hai, but we are getting used to this way of life now,” he says.Here are some easy to make, traditional recipes you can make at home. Bihari Kebab Masala by chef Sadaf HussainDry roast 2 tbsp chanal dal, 1 tbsp each of cumin seeds, poppy seeds and black pepper, ½ tbsp kabab cheni powder, 2 black cardamoms, ½ inch cinnamon stick and 8-10 cloves. Once the spices release their aroma, transfer to a mortar-pestle or a grinder and grind it to a fine powder. In another bowl, mix 2 tbsp raw papaya paste, 1 ½ tbsp salt, 1 ½ tsp red chilli powder and 1 tsp degi mirch. Mix these two masalas and your marinade is ready. This masala can be used to make any kind meat dishes.

Altaf Hussain called people to come forward to foil this conspiracy of Army and Pakistan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-isi-planning-to-declare-karachi-federal-territory-with-china-s-support-mqm-leader-altaf-hussain/story-SU5qMnWkCKR3qWRO8piGRM.html

I can do it with an executive order or that,” he said referring to emergency economic powers.Earlier in the day, he had said he was weighing other “options”. ByteDance, the parent company could be forced to divest TikTok by the powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the New York Times reported Friday. Negotiations are under way.The president could also issue an executive order invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which he referred to, to bar certain apps, such as TikTok, from American apps stores.Or, he could add TikTok’s parent company to an “entity list” barring it from buying Americans products without a license.The decision is expected over the weekend.The Trump administration has been weighing some kind on action against Chinese apps, as stated earlier by the president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a part of administration’s broader effort to force the Chinese government to “change their behavior”.Among other thing, the Trump administration has led a growing international boycott of Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE, calling them a national security threat. It has also announced a slew of sanctions and trade restrictions over Tibet, Hong Kong and Uighurs of Xinjiang province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-weighing-tiktok-ban-and-couple-of-options/story-YrbsB8hbTRevg9AhAsFQ4J.html
01-08-2020||World||Mexico third worst-hit in coronavirus deaths; storm could hinder US response||Mexico now has the third most Covid-19 deaths in the world, behind Brazil and the United States, where a hurricane bearing down on the East Coast on Saturday is threatening to complicate efforts to contain the virus.Hurricane Isaias’ imminent arrival forced the closure of some outdoor testing sites even as Florida reached a new daily high in deaths, and other states in the path of the storm prepared emergency shelters that comply with social-distancing measures.“We had to put safety first,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Friday.Meanwhile, Mexican health officials on Friday reported 688 new deaths, pushing the country’s confirmed total to over 46,600. That put Mexico just ahead of the United Kingdom, which has more than 46,100, according to the tally by Johns Hopkins University.Some countries are seeing hopeful signs: China reported a more than 50% drop in newly confirmed cases in a possible indication that its latest major outbreak in the northwestern region of Xinjiang may have run its course.However, in Hong Kong and elsewhere, infections continue to surge. Hong Kong reported more than 100 new cases as of Saturday among the population of 7.5 million. Officials have reimposed dining restrictions and mask requirements.Tokyo on Saturday saw its third day straight of record case numbers, the metropolitan government said. Nationwide, Japan’s daily count of cases totaled a record 1,579 people Friday, the health ministry said. The growing numbers have alarmed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as well as other regional leaders.And Vietnam, a former success story, is struggling to control an outbreak spreading in its most famous beach resort. A third person died there of coronavirus complications, officials said Saturday, a day after it recorded its first-ever death as it wrestles with a renewed outbreak after 99 days with no local cases.All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week. Thousands of visitors had been in the city for summer vacation and are now being tested in Hanoi and elsewhere.Twelve additional cases were confirmed on Saturday, all linked to Da Nang Hospital. Officials tightened security and set up more checkpoints to prevent people from leaving or entering the city, which has been in lockdown since Tuesday.A makeshift hospital was set up, and doctors have been mobilized from other cities to help.“I want to be tested, so I can stop worrying if I have the virus or not,” said Pham Thuy Hoa, a banking official who returned to the capital from Da Nang.In South Korea, prosecutors arrested the elderly leader of a secretive religious sect linked to more than 5,200 of the country’s approximately 14,300 confirmed cases. He has denied charges of hiding members and underreporting gatherings to avoid broader quarantines.The global pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of this year’s Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, with as few as 1,000 pilgrims already residing in Saudi Arabia taking part, down from 2.5 million last year.Poverty brought on by the pandemic is also making it harder for many to join in the four-day Eid al-Adha, or “Feast of Sacrifice,” in which Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.“I could hardly buy food for my family,” Somali civil servant Abdishakur Dahir said. “We are just surviving for now. Life is getting tougher by the day.”The Saudi Health Ministry said there have been no cases of Covid-19 among this year’s pilgrims. All were tested, their movements monitored with electronic wristbands and required to be quarantined before and after.Meanwhile, India recorded its steepest spike of 57,118 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking its coronavirus caseload close to 1.7 million, with July alone accounting for nearly 1.1 million infections.The country’s Civil Aviation Ministry delayed resumption of international flights by another month until Aug. 31. But it will continue to allow several international carriers from the United States, Europe and the Middle East to operate special flights to evacuate stranded nationals.In France, travelers entering from 16 countries where the virus is circulating widely now must undergo virus tests upon arrival at airports and ports. The country is not permitting general travel to and from the countries, which include the United States and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances, including French citizens who live in these countries. Those who test positive as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days.As autumn approaches, nations around the world are grappling with how to safely reopen schools.A scientist advising the British government on the coronavirus pandemic says pubs in England may have to be closed to allow schools to reopen in September. Graham Medley, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC that there may have to be a “trade off.”In Utah, the Salt Lake City School District Board of Education announced that its schools will start the year with all online-only classes in response to an increasing number of confirmed cases in the city. Just days after public schools around Indiana reopened their doors, at least one student and one school staff member in districts around Indianapolis have tested positive for the virus.The debate over school openings came as Dr. Anthony Fauci dismissed a tweet by President Donald Trump claiming the US global lead in coronavirus cases is because of increased testing.Fauci said the scale of the US outbreak is the result of multiple factors, including some states opening up too quickly and disregarding federal guidelines.On Friday, the head of the World Health Organization predicted the effects of the pandemic will be felt for “decades to come.”“Most of the world’s people remain susceptible to this virus, even in areas that have experienced severe outbreaks,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in London. “Although vaccine development is happening at record speed, we must learn to live with this virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-third-worst-hit-in-coronavirus-deaths-storm-could-hinder-us-response/story-mDZYf8Ypu95WXbhXCME0TL.html
01-08-2020||World||Fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest surge in July, worst in recent days||The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.Brazil’s space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019. Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August – a 12-year high for that month.Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August. Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO’s fire tracking project.The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said.Criminals generally extract valuable wood from the jungle before setting fire to the land to increase its value for farming and ranching. Natural fires are very rare in the Amazon.Deforestation hit an 11-year high in 2019 and has soared a further 25% in the first half of 2020.Earlier this month, scientists with U.S. space agency NASA said higher surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean in 2020 were drawing moisture away from the southern Amazon.“As a result, the southern Amazon landscape becomes dry and flammable, making human-set fires used for agriculture and land clearing more prone to growing out of control and spreading,” NASA said on its website.Fires are also worsening in the Pantanal, the world’s largest wetlands, adjacent to the southern Amazon. In July, the number of blazes there more than tripled to 1,684 compared to the same month a year ago, according to INPE data, the most for that month since records began in 1998.

01-08-2020||World||Hurricane Isaias moves toward Covid-stricken Florida coast||Hurricane Isaias edged closer to Florida on Saturday, adding to woes for a state grappling with record cases of Covid-19, and potentially causing $3 billion in economic losses if it rakes the eastern seaboard.With winds rising to 85 miles (137 kilometers) per hour as it pushed through the Bahamas, Isaias has triggered a hurricane warning along Florida’s coast and spurred the governor to declare a state of emergency. Covid testing sites will be shut until Aug. 5, while NASA may have to delay the return flight of two astronauts from the International Space Station planned for Sunday.After wringing out heavy rains across the Bahamas through Saturday, Isaias’s eye could clip Florida overnight into Sunday.“For those living on the East Coast, prepare now,” Governor Ron DeSantis said in a tweet. “Have 7 days of food, water, medicine & other supplies in case you lose power.”Florida’s daily Covid-19 death toll rose to a record earlier this week. Officials in Florida’s coastal counties are distributing sandbags and telling residents to shelter in place.Isaias’s eye will make its closest approach to Florida’s coast on Sunday and “it’s still very worrisome that it can brush or move inland anywhere from West Palm Beach to Daytona,” said Rob Miller, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. The eye wall, with some of the storm’s strongest winds, could actually buffet the coast without Isaias ever officially making landfall.Isaias probably won’t get much stronger than it is now, but it could still cause financial hardship to the U.S. East Coast.“If it does a sweep by Florida and deposits tropical-storm-force winds inland, hits North Carolina and Massachusetts on the way to Nova Scotia, it could hit $3 billion in total economic impacts,” said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.Flooding is likely to spread through North Carolina and into Virginia as the storm moves north, the center said. That could have an impact on cotton crops in North Carolina, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with Maxar.Isaias could weaken to a tropical storm by the time it comes ashore near Cape Fear, North Carolina, late Monday, Miller said. It will likely then emerge back into the Atlantic to make a second landfall in New England.Nine storms have formed across the Atlantic in 2020, the National Hurricane Center said. It’s the fastest start to any season in records going back to 1851, Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said in a tweet.A tropical depression off Africa briefly looked like it could become the 10th storm, but it has since fallen apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-isaias-moves-toward-covid-stricken-florida-coast/story-Mg0bNhydg8Ogr2JqlUOW2M.html
01-08-2020||World||Iran says it detains leader of California-based exile group||Iran on Saturday said it had detained a leader of a little-known California-based opposition group for allegedly planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people and wounded over 200 others.Iran’s Intelligence Ministry also alleged Jamshid Sharmahd of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran planned other attacks around the Islamic Republic amid heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. over its collapsing 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.It remains unclear how Sharmahd, whom Iran accused of running the opposition group’s Tondar militant wing, ended up detained by intelligence officials. Requests for comment sent by email to the Glendora-based Kingdom Assembly of Iran were not immediately answered and a telephone number for the group no longer worked.Iranian state television broadcast a report on Sharmahd’s arrest, linking him to the 2008 bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada Mosque in Shiraz. It also said his group was behind a 2010 bombing at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s mausoleum in Tehran that wounded several people.The report also alleged without providing evidence that Tondar, or “Thunder” in Farsi, also plotted attacks on a dam and planned to use cyanide bombs at Tehran’s annual book fair.The Kingdom Assembly of Iran, known in Farsi as Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran, and Tondar seek to restore Iran’s monarchy, which ended when the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country in 1979 just before its Islamic Revolution. The group’s founder disappeared in the mid-2000s.Authorities did not elaborate on how they apprehended Sharmahd, though Iranian intelligence operatives in the past have used family members and other tricks to lure targets back to Iran or friendly countries to be captured. An alleged Iranian government operative who allegedly tried to hire a hitman to kill Sharmahd disappeared in 2010 before facing trial in California, likely having returned to Iran.While overshadowed by other exiled opposition groups, Iran reportedly brought up the Kingdom Assembly multiple times while negotiating the terms of the 2015 deal, which saw Tehran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.A statement attributed to Tondar claimed the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist in 2010 by a remote-control bomb, though it later said it wasn’t responsible. Suspicion long has fallen on Israel for a string of assassinations targeting scientists amid concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, which the West fears could be used to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran long has maintained its program is for peaceful purposes.Sharmahd’s reported arrest comes as tensions remain inflamed by President Donald Trump’s 2018 decision to unilaterally withdraw America from the nuclear deal. A series of incidents last year were capped by a U.S. drone strike in January killing a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Iran responded by launching a ballistic missile attack on U.S. soldiers in Iraq that injured dozens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-detains-leader-of-california-based-exile-group/story-W4gn1Tg6bbKEumRQWvWEbK.html

I would have never thought it would have made such a powerful impact,” he said.Gupta has run Bhangracise for over 15 years, holding regular dance fitness classes in Manchester, Birmingham and Reading, and has also performed at the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. He also taught professional dancers about bhangra on BBC’s popular ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ show.With lockdown shutting down physical classes, the dance enthusiast decided to post an online video, which attracted over 100,000 views, and he has since been running free dance workouts three times a week for thousands of people across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-honours-indian-origin-dancer-for-online-bhangra-classes-during-lockdown/story-CO0xradh1zm6ttk3YI34hK.html
01-08-2020||World||Want to push for continued advancement of China-Nepal ties: Xi Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday said he wants to push for a continued advancement of ties with Nepal amidst Beijing’s sustained forays to shore up pro-China Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli’s grip on power in the backdrop of intra-party feud in the ruling communist party. In an exchange of congratulatory messages with his Nepalese counterpart Bidhya Devi Bhandari on the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, Xi asserted that he was ready to work to bring greater benefits to the two peoples of the two neighbouring countries. The Chinese President said that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Nepal relations and is willing to work with his Nepali counterpart Bhandari to push for the continued advancement of the bilateral relationship. Xi, also General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China, said that since the establishment of the diplomatic ties, the two countries have always respected each other, treated each other as equals, enhanced political mutual trust and deepened mutually beneficial cooperation. Noting that he and Bhandari exchanged visits last year and elevated the bilateral ties to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity, Xi said the two sides have stood together through thick and thin in the fight against the Covid-19 and have written a new chapter of friendship between China and Nepal, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and his Nepalese counterpart Oli too exchanged greetings. China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. Besides the investments, China’s ambassador to Kathmandu Hou Yanqi has made open efforts to garner support for Oli, who faced a massive rebellion in his party headed by co-chair of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’. Hou met Prachanda and other leaders seeking their backing for Oli but the rebellion against the prime minister has not subsided. China attaches high importance to Oli continuing in power as during his brief tenure in 2016, he widened China-Nepal ties by signing the transit trade treaty with Beijing to reduce the dependence of his land-locked country on India. Nepal’s ambassador to China Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, in an article published in the state-run China Daily on Friday, said that the “cooperation under the BRI is of great significance for both Nepal and China. “Our leaders stressed the need to intensify implementation of the memorandum of understanding on cooperation under the BRI under the framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network”. The construction of tunnels from Jilong in Tibet to Kathmandu, development of the three North-South corridors in Nepal-Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali - and the Nepal-China electric power cooperation plan are some of the landmark projects in the areas of infrastructure and industry that were agreed to be initiated in Nepal during President Xi’s state visit to Nepal” last year, he said. Last month, Oli alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power. The internal feud in the NCP intensified after Prachanda and senior leader Madhav Nepal asked for Oli’s resignation following his controversial remarks against India as well as his autocratic style of functioning. Oli and Prachanda factions are currently engaged in holding internal consultations, though the date for the formal meeting of the powerful Standing Committee is yet to be fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/want-to-push-for-continued-advancement-of-china-nepal-ties-xi-jinping/story-yg5xvjah3xW3UzAyLqSjkI.html

Further, the Indian Consulate in Dubai can now accept passport applications from expatriates living across the UAE, the Gulf News reported. Earlier, each emirate had its individual centre for verification. The passport renewal forms will be processed on the same day as it is received, Consul General of India in Dubai Dr Aman Puri told the newspaper. Puri said some applications could take longer to process. “It would take a longer time, an average of two weeks, if there is any need for special approvals like police verification or any other clearance from India,” he explained. Last year, the Indian mission here issued over 2 lakh passports, the highest count for an Indian mission across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-indian-expats-in-uae-can-renew-passport-in-just-two-days-report/story-kfUnstaflTI88j5SYvMDIJ.html

The country’s watchdog had given the go-ahead to run the plant in February.“Teams succeeded in loading nuclear fuel, carrying out comprehensive tests and successfully completing the operation,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the ruler of Dubai, said in a tweet. “The goal is to operate four nuclear power plants that will provide a quarter of the country’s need for electricity in a safe, reliable and emission-free way.”Built and run by a joint venture with Korea Electric Power Corp., the Barakah plant can now move toward full commercial operation over the next several months. Other Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt are also moving toward adopting nuclear power despite questions about cost and safety.The UAE is aiming to have the four civilian reactors in operation by 2023. The plants, located along a sparsely populated strip of desert on the Persian Gulf coast, are estimated to cost a total $25 billion. The government expects them to produce as much as 5.6 gigawatts of energy once they’re fully commissioned, or about a fifth of the country’s current installed generating capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-starts-operation-of-arab-world-s-first-nuclear-power-reactor/story-W7PVK7L507fDxA4SV6OVbN.html
01-08-2020||World||China condemns Germany’s Hong Kong extradition suspension||China has condemned Germany’s decision to suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong, accusing Berlin of a “serious breach of international law.”Germany’s foreign minister announced the suspension Friday following the disqualification of 12 pro-democracy candidates from legislative elections and a subsequent decision to postpone the elections. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam cited a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory in postponing the vote.The Chinese Embassy in Berlin expressed “strong indignation and firm opposition to the wrong remarks of German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas” in a statement posted on its website and dated Friday.Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States also have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong last month after the central government in Beijing imposed a new national security law on the city. The move raised fears that Hong Kong’s freedoms and local autonomy are being taken away.Germany’s Maas described the election decisions as “a further infringement of the rights of Hong Kong’s citizens.”The Chinese Embassy said the actions were justified and consistent with the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Chinese control in 1997.“The German side’s erroneous remarks on Hong Kong and the suspension of the extradition treaty with Hong Kong are a serious breach of international law and basic norms governing international relations and gross violation of China’s internal affairs,” the embassy statement said. “We firmly oppose them and reserve the right to react further.”Germany currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-condemns-germany-s-hong-kong-extradition-suspension/story-Ooqf5LDx6lFSiwo4lqlkBI.html

A 13-year-old boy, who is a permanent resident here, and a 28-year-old woman on a dependant’s pass arrived from India on July 19, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. They were asymptomatic and were tested while on stay-home notice.The third case is a six-year-old Singaporean girl who arrived from India on July 3.The three imported cases were reported on Friday.Singapore on Saturday reported 307 new coronavirus cases, taking the country’s total count to 52,512. The new cases include one community case, who is a Singaporean, said the MOH. The rest 306 were foreign workers living in dormitories. There were also five imported cases who had been placed on stay-home notices upon arrival in Singapore.There are currently 136 confirmed patients hospitalized while 5,551 are isolated and cared for at community facilities for mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for Covid-19.

01-08-2020||World||Russia preparing mass vaccination against coronavirus for October||Russia’s health minister is preparing a mass vaccination campaign against the novel coronavirus for October, local news agencies reported on Saturday, after a vaccine completed clinical trials.Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the Gamaleya Institute, a state research facility in Moscow, had completed clinical trials of the vaccine and paperwork is being prepared to register it, Interfax news agency reported.He said doctors and teachers would be the first to be vaccinated. “We plan wider vaccinations for October,” Murashko was quoted as saying.A source told Reuters this week that Russia’s first potential Covid-19 vaccine would secure local regulatory approval in August and be administered to health workers soon thereafter.The Gamaleya Institute has been working on an adenovirus-based vaccine.Yet the speed at which Russia is moving to roll it out has prompted some Western media to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before science and safety.The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has likened what he said was Russia’s success in developing a vaccine to the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the world’s first satellite.On Saturday, Russia reported 95 additional deaths from the novel coronavirus, taking its total to 14,058.Officials reported 5,462 new cases, raising the total to 845,443.More than 100 possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the Covid-19 pandemic. At least four are in final Phase III human trials, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data, including three developed in China and another in Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-preparing-mass-vaccination-against-coronavirus-for-october/story-clLqJlwapo7t3ExAHE6dxL.html
01-08-2020||World||US says unlikely to use China, Russia coronavirus vaccine as race heats up||America’s top infectious diseases official has raised concerns over the safety of Covid-19 vaccines being developed by China and Russia as the world scrambles for answers to a pandemic the WHO warned will be felt for decades.Six months after the World Health Organization declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 679,000 people and infected at least 17.9 million, according to an AFP tally.As countries across Western Europe announced new lockdowns and reported historic economic slumps, the UN health body said the pandemic was a “once-in-a-century” crisis and its fallout would be felt for decades.Several Chinese companies are at the forefront of the race to develop an immunity to the disease and Russia has set a target date of September to roll out its own vaccine.But US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said it was unlikely his country would use any vaccine developed in either country, where regulatory systems are far more opaque than they are in the West.“I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone,” he told a US Congressional hearing on Friday.“Claims of having a vaccine ready to distribute before you do testing, I think, is problematic, at best.”As part of its own “Operation Warp Speed,” the US government will pay pharma giants Sanofi and GSK up to $2.1 billion for the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, the companies said.In east Asia, territories which saw success in tackling the early wave of the coronavirus are now confronting worrying new spikes. Japan’s Okinawa declared a state of emergency Saturday after a record jump in cases on the island -- many linked to US military forces stationed there -- while Hong Kong opened a new makeshift hospital to house Covid-19 patients.The finance hub had been a poster child for tackling the coronavirus, with local transmissions all but ended by early summer. But since July daily cases have risen to record highs, partly brought in by the tens of thousands of people who were exempted from a mandatory quarantine imposed on most arrivals.- Fresh lockdowns -France, Spain, Portugal and Italy all reported huge contractions in their economies for the April-June quarter, while Europe as a whole saw gross domestic product fall by 12.1 percent. In a sign of the trade-offs being forced on European governments, Britain imposed new lockdowns Friday on millions of households in northern England.With large Muslim populations in those areas, the ban was painfully timed, on the eve of the Eid-al-Adha festival. Meanwhile, in the United States -- the world’s biggest economy and hardest-hit nation -- jobless Americans were bracing for an end to extra unemployment payments after Congress failed to reach a deal on extending benefits.It came just a day after the US posted a second-quarter GDP drop of 9.5 percent from the same period a year ago, the worst it had ever recorded.- Sect leader arrested -Fresh off a bout of Covid-19, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday nearly everyone will probably end up catching the new coronavirus, urging Brazilians to “face up to it” and saying there was nothing to fear.His comments came as Brazil’s death toll closes on 100,000 and as Latin America’s biggest airline LATAM said it was laying off at least 2,700 crew over the coronavirus.In South Korea the elderly leader of a secretive sect at the center of the country’s early coronavirus outbreak was arrested Saturday for allegedly hindering the government’s effort to contain the epidemic.People linked to Lee Man-hee’s Shincheonji Church of Jesus accounted for more than half of the South’s coronavirus cases in February and March, when the country was enduring one of the worst early outbreaks in the world.The South has since been returning largely to normal, appearing to have brought the outbreak under control with an extensive “trace, test and treat” program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-unlikely-to-use-china-russia-virus-vaccine-as-race-heats-up/story-20kMO6JMO9CzU8WpHeWdpK.html
01-08-2020||World||Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate||As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.The campaign hasn’t finalized a date for naming a running mate, but three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans said a public announcement likely wouldn’t happen before the week of Aug. 10. That’s one week before Democrats will hold their convention to officially nominate Biden as their presidential nominee.Biden said in May that he hoped to name his pick around August 1 and told reporters this week that he would “have a choice in the first week of August.” He notably stopped short of saying when he would announce that choice.Running mates are often announced on the eve of a convention. As he prepares to make his choice, a committee established to vet possible running mates has provided Biden with briefing materials. Biden will likely soon begin one-on-one conversations with those under consideration, which could be the most consequential part of the process for a presidential candidate who values personal connections.The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice. The deliberations remain fluid, however, and the campaign has reviewed nearly a dozen possible running mates.“For Joe Biden, this is crunch time. After all the vetting, all the investigations into the prospective nominees, it’s now up to Joe. It’s personal,” said former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted for vice president in 2008. “It’s now about his gut feeling.”Representatives for Biden declined to comment for this story.The selection amounts to the most significant choice Biden has confronted in his nearly five-decade political career. He has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.Given the historic significance of the moment, some are urging Biden not to let the announcement linger too long.“My sense is that the VP himself, having been through this process, is aware of and mindful of not letting people hang out there too long,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “There certainly seems to be a bit of a media frenzy, and I think we have to be aware that at a point, it becomes unfair to the candidates being considered.”As a decision looms, the camps are jockeying for position.Harris’ allies mobilized this week after Politico reported that the co-chair of the vetting committee, former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, was concerned about Harris’ tough debate stage performance and that she hasn’t expressed regret.Several California elected officials and labor leaders initiated a call with the vetting team to emphasize that Harris has strong support among labor and political leaders in her home state. The call was organized by Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and included the mayors of Oakland, Long Beach and Stockton and former Gov. Gray Davis.“A group of us really felt we needed to organize and speak out and correct the record because she has tremendous support,” Kounalakis said.Beyond emphasizing their strong relationships with Harris, they also pushed back against the idea that Harris wouldn’t be a loyal partner.Harris, while not directly addressing her vice presidential prospects, told a group of young Black women Friday that it’s common for Black women to face resistance when they exercise their power.“There will be a resistance to your ambition. There will be people who say to you: ‘You are out of your lane,’“ she said during the digital summit. “They are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be. ... I’ve had that experience my entire career.”Biden has sought feedback on his pick from former President Barack Obama, who has provided advice but has insisted the choice is his to make, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.Biden allies say his wife, Jill, and sister, Valerie Biden Owens, are likely to play a key role in the decision, as they have with many of Biden’s biggest political decisions throughout his career. Jill has held online campaign events and fundraisers with virtually all the potential contenders in recent weeks, as has Biden himself, effectively offering the contenders a try-out opportunity with the presumptive Democratic nominee.On Thursday night, Bass joined Biden for a virtual fundraiser that raked in $2.2 million. She has also taken steps to build her national profile, including providing interviews to multiple outlets over the past week.On Friday night, Biden held a virtual fundraiser with Elizabeth Warren, who has also been considered as a running mate. Biden said the event raised more than $1.7 million from over 50,000 grassroots donors. That’s about a quarter of the $6 million the Massachusetts senator brought in during her first online fundraiser for the former vice president last month that appealed to higher-dollar donors.“We’ve known each other a long time. Her fearless work for a just America has transformed lives and inspired millions, including me,” Biden said. “She is something else. You all know her.”Warren said, “This is a time of unprecedented crisis.”“But I wake up every single day with a heart full of hope and here is why: Vice President Biden is meeting the moment,” she added. The two talked for nearly an hour but did not mention the vice presidential selection process.Some Biden donors have already begun to plan prospective fundraising events ahead of the formal announcement. Biden’s team expects his running mate to contribute immediately to his fundraising operation. Of the finalists, Harris is thought to be the most formidable traditional fundraiser, while Warren’s ability to attract small-dollar donations from the party’s progressive base is also viewed as a major asset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-nears-final-decision-on-running-mate/story-oCKlHPblSpyXbButYXlkoN.html
01-08-2020||World||Vietnam reports third death, more cases linked to hospital||A third person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, officials said Saturday, a day after it recorded its first-ever death as it struggles with a renewed outbreak after 99 days with no local cases.All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients.The Health Ministry said the latest fatalities included a 68-year old woman who was treated for blood cancer and a 61 year-old man who suffered septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first Covid1-19 death was a 70-year-old who was admitted with a kidney illness.Da Nang is Vietnam’s most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city.Fifteen other patients with Covid-19 are in critical condition, officials said. All have other underlying illnesses. On Saturday morning, the Health Ministry confirmed 12 more cases, all linked to the hospital.Vietnam had been seen as a global success story in combating the coronavirus with zero deaths and no confirmed cases of local transmission for 99 days. But a week ago an outbreak began at Da Nang Hospital. It has spread to six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, forcing authorities to reimpose virus restrictions.Experts worry the actual number of cases could be far higher. Before the latest outbreak it had a total of only 416 cases.In Hanoi, where two people have tested positive after returning from Da Nang, over 100 clinics have been set up with test kits to detect the virus. Hanoi has tested a third of the 54,000 people returning from Da Nang.“I want to be tested so I can stop worrying if I have the virus or not. It is for me and for the community,” said Pham Thuy Hoa, a banking official who recently went to Da Nang for a family vacation. “Since coming back, my family and I have quarantined ourselves at home. I did not go to work or see others. We must be responsible for the entire community.”In Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s southern hub, five people who returned from Da Nang have tested positive for the virus. The city is testing some 20,000 other returnees.As the number of case continues to increase, Da Nang has tightened security and set up more checkpoints to prevent people from leaving or entering the city, which has been in lockdown since Tuesday.The city on Friday began setting up a makeshift hospital in a sports auditorium and doctors have been mobilized from other cities to help.Hoi An, an ancient town and top tourist destination known for its charming old houses 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Da Nang, stopped allowing visitors on Thursday because of the outbreak. Its pedestrian streets, adorned with lanterns, were empty and nonessential services and gatherings were banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-reports-third-death-more-cases-linked-to-hospital/story-cA4LbHurrmaG9gp0KGZo3O.html

01-08-2020||World||Foreign threats loom ahead of US presidential election||As the November 3 presidential vote nears, there are fresh signs that the nation’s electoral system is again under attack from foreign adversaries.Intelligence officials confirmed in recent days that foreign actors are actively seeking to compromise the private communications of “US political campaigns, candidates and other political targets” while working to compromise the nation’s election infrastructure. Foreign entities are also aggressively spreading disinformation intended to sow voter confusion heading into the fall.There is no evidence that America’s enemies have yet succeeded in penetrating campaigns or state election systems, but Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential campaign confirmed this week that it has faced multiple related threats.The former vice president’s team was reluctant to reveal specifics for fear of giving adversaries useful intelligence.Because of such secrecy, at least in part, foreign interference largely remains an afterthought in the 2020 contest, even as Republicans and Democrats alike concede it poses a serious threat that could fundamentally reshape the election at any moment. Biden’s campaign is increasingly concerned that pro-Russian sources have already shared disinformation about Biden’s family with President Donald Trump’s campaign and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill designed to hurt the Democratic candidate in the days leading up to the election.When asked directly, the Trump campaign refused to say whether it had accepted materials from any foreign nationals related to Biden. Trump was impeached last year after being caught pressuring Ukrainian leaders to produce damaging information about work Biden’s son did in the region, even though repeated allegations of corruption against the Bidens have been widely discredited.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a key Trump ally and chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, denied having accepted any damaging materials on Biden from foreign nationals even after at least one Ukranian national, Oleksandr Onyshchenko, told The Washington Post he had shared tapes and transcripts with Johnson’s committee and Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. House Democrats announced Friday they have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents he turned over to Johnson’s panel.“It does a disservice to our election security efforts when Democrats use the threat of Russian disinformation as a weapon to cast doubt on investigations they don’t like,” Johnson spokesperson Austin Altenburg said.The 2020 campaigns and party committees have been receiving regular briefings from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, whose director, Bill Evanina, released a rare public statement last week confirming Russia’s continued work to meddle in the US election.Evanina said that Russia, as part of an effort to weaken the US and its global standing, has been spreading disinformation to undermine confidence in American democracy and “to denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment’ in America.”The threat is not limited to Russia. China, a target of escalating condemnation across the Trump administration in recent weeks, has been looking for ways to affect American policy, counter criticism of Beijing and pressure political figures it views as opposed to Chinese interests, Evanina said, while Iran has been involved in circulating disinformation and anti-American content online.Trump’s team reported no specific foreign threats against the president’s campaign, but campaign general counsel Matthew Morgan highlighted the Republican Party’s years long effort to install various voter ID requirements across the country — including photo verification, signature matching and witness requirements — as an important tool to block foreign interference.“Contrary to their narrative, the Democrats’ efforts to tear these safeguards apart — as they sue in 18 states across the nation — would open our election system up to foreign interference,” Morgan said. “That’s why we’re fighting back — to protect the sanctity of our election system.”Despite Morgan’s argument, there is no evidence of significant voter fraud in US politics, whether by American voters or foreign nationals.And there is no evidence, as Trump repeatedly charges, that an increased reliance on mail balloting this fall leaves the electoral system particularly vulnerable to outside meddling. The president pointed to those baseless claims this week to suggest delaying the election, something that can’t be done without support in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans alike rejected the notion.There is ample evidence, however, that foreign powers are trying to sow confusion by spreading misinformation in addition to seeking to hack into political campaigns, as Evanina said last week.Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, a Republican, described Trump’s warnings about mail voting “absurd” and “ridiculous.”“He should be far more forceful and far more direct in condemning foreign interference,” Ridge said in an interview. “The enemy is not within.”Foreign interference played a significant role in the 2016 election, of course.US intelligence agencies determined that Russian operatives seeking to boost Trump’s campaign hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s servers and later shared damaging messages with WikiLeaks while running a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord among American voters.All told, the Justice Department charged 25 Russian nationals in a covert effort to spread disinformation on social media and in the hacking of Democratic emails. While Trump has downplayed the threat of Russian meddling, he authorized a 2018 cyberattack against the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency.Lest there be any doubt about continued foreign interference in 2020, US officials confirmed this week that Russian intelligence services have been using a trio of English-language websites to spread disinformation about the politically charged coronavirus pandemic.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that foreign adversaries “never stopped trying to interfere with our election process.”He noted that the foreign meddling includes some new tactics compared to 2016. He noted, for example, that the Internet Research Agency is operating under a different name.Warner declined to be more specific about 2020 interference, which has been discussed in classified briefings. He said he has a “huge concern” that voters don’t appreciate the true nature of the threat.“The idea that we could be headed into Labor Day without the American public being officially put on notice seems grossly inappropriate,” Warner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-threats-loom-ahead-of-us-presidential-election/story-wWgOmM8IUUtYHzS6SlcJmI.html

However, the government has maintained that India’s recovery rate, around 64 percent, in coronavirus patients is among the best in the world and continues to improve. So far, over 10 lakh patients in India have recovered or been discharged from hospitals. At present, India has over five lakh active cases of Covid-19 across the country.

01-08-2020||World||As Democrat Biden’s running mate search nears end, contenders jockey for position||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is expected to interview the finalists to be his running mate in the coming days, according to a person familiar with the process, as allies of the top contenders redoubled their efforts to push Biden toward their favored choice.The announcement is not likely to come next week, according to two other people familiar with the matter. Biden and his vice presidential selection will formally accept the party’s nomination at the Democrats’ national convention, scheduled for Aug. 17-20, and he is expected to announce his pick before it begins.US Representative Karen Bass, a Black lawmaker from California who was not seen as a candidate early on, has risen to the top tier alongside two other Black women, Senator Kamala Harris and former national security adviser Susan Rice, according to Democratic officials and Biden allies.A half dozen other women also remain under consideration, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth, US Representative Val Demings, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.A campaign spokesman declined to comment on the search.Biden’s choice, the most weighty of his political career, has drawn an unusual amount of attention given his age. If he defeats Republican President Donald Trump in November’s election, he would be 78 on inauguration day next January, the oldest US president in history, and it is possible he may only seek one four-year term.Supporters of each candidate have privately lobbied Biden. Just this week, more than a dozen California officials, labor leaders and business officials spoke with the people leading Biden’s vetting committee to back Harris, according to a person familiar with the matter.The call was set up by the state’s lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, after she saw reports questioning whether Harris’ presidential ambitions made her less suited for the No. 2 role.Harris, for her part, used a Friday appearance at Black Girls 2020, an online conference for young Black women, to seemingly push back against that complaint, which some critics saw as misogynistic.“There will be resistance to your ambition,” she said. “But don’t you let that burden you.”The controversy prompted Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, to write on Twitter this week, “Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win.”Biden himself was prepared to defend Harris at a campaign event on Tuesday, where a photograph captured a notecard in his hand listing talking points praising her talents.Bass has emerged as an alternative to her fellow Californian Harris, which has led to numerous comparisons between the two.In an interview on “The Breakfast Club” radio show on Friday, Bass expressed frustration at that trend.“Why don’t you compare Whitmer with Warren?” she said. Both Whitmer and Warren are white. In a preview of the intense scrutiny that awaits Biden’s eventual pick, Bass was the subject of numerous news stories on Friday noting her rising prospects.While some highlighted her popularity among party leaders, others focused on her 2016 comments about the late Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro, which some critics felt were too respectful, and her visits to Cuba in the 1970s with a leftist group to build homes.Bass has said she would not use the same words again today.A top donor to Harris’s erstwhile presidential campaign, who spoke anonymously to discuss the issue candidly, said Bass’ history could be a problem for Biden in Florida, where Cuban-Americans are a key demographic, and suggested Trump would seek to exploit it.Rice, meanwhile, was seen to have acquitted herself well during television appearances in recent days despite having little experience of retail politics, and her time in the White House with Biden is an advantage for a candidate who values personal relationships, according to one Biden ally.In a televised interview on Wednesday, Rice castigated Trump for failing to question Russian President Vladimir Putin about reports that Moscow paid bounties for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.Warren hosted a grassroots fundraiser with Biden on Friday that raised over $1.7 million from more than 50,000 people, a reminder of her strong small-dollar fundraising prowess.“America is crying out for leadership,” she said. “What has Donald Trump done in response? He’s ignored science, he’s fanned the flames of racism and he has employed tactics from the playbooks of fascists and dictators.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-democrat-biden-s-running-mate-search-nears-end-contenders-jockey-for-position/story-U9DFMpKA6447gqIFNNRAYO.html

Now it grounds them: ReportNepal welcomes the “China-proposed vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and actively participates in the cooperation on the co-building of the Belt and Road,” she said.Separately, Premier Li Keqiang talked about enhanced “mutual trust and friendship” between China and Nepal with his counterpart, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.China is willing to work with Nepal to strengthen all-round cooperation in various fields and high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Inititiave, and lift bilateral relations to new levels, Li said.Oli, in his congratulatory message, said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, bilateral relations have seen a sustained, stable and sound development.The exchange of gushing pleasantries between Nepal and China comes amid Kathmandu finding itself right in the middle of the broader Sino-India rivalry in the region.In June, Nepal revised map of the country, including three areas it disputes with India within its own boundary.The two countries dispute the Lipulekh pass, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas at the India-Nepal border.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had recently opened the 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass.It was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.The understanding in New Delhi is that Kathmandu’s new belligerence over an old dispute was at the tacit behest of China.Indian Army chief Gen. MM Naravane had remarked that Kathmandu was objecting to the newly built road by India near the disputed area at the behest of “someone else”.In June, a politically embattled Oli had alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power.Oli stoked another controversy recently by claiming that the “real” Ayodhya is not in India but in Nepal.Last Monday, in its latest effort to strengthen partnership with south Asian countries, China urged Nepal besides Pakistan and Afghanistan to carry a “four-party cooperation” in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and continue to build projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) including the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) and the trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity project with Kathmandu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-treats-nepal-as-an-equal-in-gushing-exchange-on-65th-year-of-ties/story-c5XTFPVlIllXUrwNQMuX7L.html

State Rep. Gary Knopp, who represented the area, was alone in one of the planes. The other plane was carrying four tourists from South Carolina, a guide from Kansas and a pilot from Soldotna, the troopers said.All seven victims were pronounced dead at the site except for one person who died while being transported to a hospital, according to the troopers.Crash debris fell on a highway, which was shut down briefly out of safety concerns.The Federal Aviation Administration identified one of the planes as a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.Knopp, 67, was a Republican and a member of the state House bipartisan majority. Several colleagues expressed condolences.“I’m devastated and shocked to learn of the crash that claimed Gary Knopp’s life,” House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent, said in a statement. “Gary was a one-of-a-kind leader and a true Alaskan who worked tirelessly for his district in the Legislature. He will be missed by many.”The other victims were identified as pilot Gregory Bell, 67, guide David Rogers, 40, and the South Carolina visitors: Caleb Hulsey, 26; Heather Hulsey, 25; Mackay Hulsey, 24; and Kirstin Wright, 23.The last fatal midair collision in Alaska happened in May of 2019 near Ketchikan. Six people were killed when two planes ferrying cruise ship passengers on sightseeing expeditions struck each other. Ten survivors of that collision were rescued from the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-killed-including-state-lawmaker-as-two-planes-collide-in-alaska/story-wnxpaZVMm0ZBYzRpWCgWbI.html

However, Canada’s economic struggles are far from over, as StatCan noted in a release, “While May’s gains offset some of the March and April declines, economic activity remained 15% below February’s pre-pandemic level.”It also put out a flash estimate of a 12 percent decline in real GDP in the second quarter of 2020, which if it holds, will be a historic fall for the country. Real GDP is the gross domestic product corrected for inflation.Also read: Mexico now has third highest Covid-19 death toll in the worldOverall, 17 out of 20 industrial sectors posted increases in May and both goods-producing and service-producing industries rose. These economic difficulties are also reflected in the number of people utilising government rescue programmes introduced due to the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Approximately 8.5 million people have taken advantage of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or CERB, which allows for those rendered unemployed or underemployed by the coronavirus crisis to claim CA $2,000 per four week period spanning six months.Also read: Japan acted like Covid-19 had gone.

At his hotel at the Old Post Office near the White House, revenue was $40.5 million, down from $40.8 million.The 78-page report, which Trump filed after getting an extension on its due date, provides a partial view of the president’s assets and debts, including revenue from his golf properties, bank accounts and investment transactions.The disclosure covers a period of time before the coronavirus pandemic prompted his properties to shut down or lose business.Another major Trump property, Trump’s Doral golf course in Florida, fared better, with revenue rising to $77.2 million from $76 million. Trump backed away from a plan to host the 2020 Group of Seven meeting at the resort after facing heavy criticism for the plan.Trump also reported at the request of the Office of Government Ethics that his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani provided free counsel in 2018 and 2019, a time when he was facing the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.“Mr. Giuliani is not able to estimate the value of that pro bono publico counsel; therefore, the value is unascertainable,” the report said.Trump’s report contends Giuliani’s legal help, however, is not a reportable gift, and Trump reported no other gifts.Trump also reported $13.5 million from the sale of a mansion in Beverly Hills, California. The Washington Post reported last year the house was sold to a firm linked to an Indonesian billionaire for nearly double what Trump paid for it.Trump’s disclosure forms mostly reflect the revenue from properties and royalties he receives on real estate around the world.But he also has other sources of income, including more than $100,000 a year in royalties from the book “The Art of the Deal.” He also has a pension from the Screen Actors Guild that paid him nearly $78,000 last year and another from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists that paid him more then $8,700.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-releases-his-2019-financial-disclosure/story-IFQWPJv9DcSKdP9C8wfnnO.html

The company has denied allegations that it shares user data with the Chinese government.The move comes as Trump has ratcheted up tensions with China during the coronavirus pandemic and stalled trade negotiations between the two nations.The company’s operations in the US has been under review by the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to enforce the action, insisting, “I have that authority.”___Miller reported from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-ll-act-to-ban-tiktok-in-us-as-soon-as-saturday/story-a051T6GXlQ6ADPV36LYYLM.html
01-08-2020||World||Report says Microsoft in talks to acquire TikTok’s US ops, Donald Trump considers ‘banning’ app||Technology giant Microsoft is in advance talks to acquire TikTok’s US operations, according to a media report Friday, even as President Donald Trump said his administration is considering to ban the popular Chinese-owned video app. “We’re looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House. India has banned as many as 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, a move welcomed by both the administration and the lawmakers. “We may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we’ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot alternatives with respect to TikTok,” Trump said in response to a question. The Wall Street Journal Friday night reported that Microsoft, headed by Indian-American Satya Nadella, is in advanced talks to acquire the US operations of TikTok. The deal could run into billions of dollars. “A deal could be completed by Monday, according to people familiar with the matter, and the talks involve representatives from Microsoft, Bytedance and the White House. Talks are fluid, and a deal may not come together,” The Wall Street Journal reported. China-based Bytedance is the parent company of TikTok. In recent weeks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused TikTok of collecting personal information of Americans. “India has banned 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security,” he told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. Media reports also said the Trump administration will soon order ByteDance to divest of its ownership of TikTok’s US operations. “In its current form, TikTok represents a potential threat to personal privacy and our national security. I applaud the Trump Administration for taking this critical step, but we must do more than simply remove ByteDance from the equation,” Senator Marco Rubio said. “Moving forward, we must establish a framework of standards that must be met before a high-risk, foreign-based app is allowed to operate on American telecommunications networks and devices,” Rubio said, adding he is preparing legislation to do just that. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers calling for the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Zoom and TikTok for reported violations of Americans’ civil liberties and of their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). “Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about Americans to the PRC and engaged in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government,” the Senators said. “As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the Covid-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression is under threat due to the relationship of these companies to the Chinese government,” they wrote. “Of particular concern, both Zoom and TikTok have sought to conceal and distract from their meaningful ties to China, holding themselves out as American companies. This concealment is alarming – Chinese tech firms are notoriously bound to draconian intelligence laws, media regulations, and extrajudicial pressure that compels them to censor and spy for China’s state security services,” the Senators said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-says-microsoft-in-talks-to-acquire-tiktok-s-us-ops-donald-trump-considers-banning-app/story-ZzGWPweTdG3ceTjpnfDc9K.html

01-08-2020||World||Japan acted like Covid-19 had gone. Now it’s spread everywhere||After initial success, Japan is facing a reality check on the coronavirus.The country garnered global attention after containing the first wave of Covid-19 with what it referred to as the “Japan Model” -- limited testing and no lockdown, nor any legal means to force businesses to close. The country’s finance minister even suggested a higher “cultural standard” helped contain the disease.But now the island nation is facing a formidable resurgence, with Covid-19 cases hitting records nationwide day after day. Infections first concentrated in the capital have spread to other urban areas, while regions without cases for months have become new hotspots. And the patient demographic -- originally younger people less likely to fall seriously ill -- is expanding to the elderly, a concern given that Japan is home to the world’s oldest population.Experts say that Japan’s focus on the economy may have been its undoing. As other countries in Asia, which experienced the coronavirus earlier than those in the West, wrestle with new flare ups of Covid-19, Japan now risks becoming a warning for what happens when a country moves too fast to normalize -- and doesn’t adjust its strategy when the outbreak changes.While Japan declared a state of emergency to contain the first wave of the virus, it didn’t compel people to stay home or businesses to shut. That was ended in late May and officials quickly pivoted to a full reopening in an attempt to get the country’s recessionary economy back on track. By June, restaurants and bars were fully open while events like baseball and sumo-wrestling were back on -- a stark contrast to other places in the region like Singapore which were re-opening only in cautious phases.Japan’s haste may have been premature, say experts.“This is the result of the government prioritizing economic activity by getting people to move around again over infection control,” said Yoshihito Niki, a professor of infectious diseases at Showa University’s School of Medicine.A panel of experts, praised for showing leadership during the first wave, was dissolved in a political mix-up, while a much-derided campaign to encourage domestic travel began just as infections started to surge.Proper StrategyCountries throughout the Asia-Pacific are experiencing second waves, many -- like Hong Kong, Australia and Vietnam -- after being standard bearers for virus containment the first time around. They’re providing a window into the future for places just emerging from their first outbreaks, or continuing to battle through them, like the USA number of factors contributed to Japan’s resurgence, according to public health experts. The state of emergency may have been lifted too early, before infections had sufficiently slowed. That also resulted in an ill-defined reopening plan -- leaving officials slow to take steps when new infection hotspots first emerged in nightclubs late in June. As cases increased, officials continued to talk down the dangers and insist they were mainly confined to nightlife spots.“The government should have had a proper strategy to contain the transmission as promptly as possible,” said Kenji Shibuya, a professor at King’s College London and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization. “Both Hong Kong and Australia acted very quickly and are trying to contain it as fast as possible, with expanded testing and aggressive social distancing including local lockdowns. Japan is making things worse by just waiting and seeing.”Although Japan understood earlier than many Western countries that the virus was more likely to spread through droplets in the air, and warned residents to avoid crowded, unventilated conditions, it wasn’t enough to change individual behavior as the restrictions were lifted. While people have continued to wear masks throughout the pandemic, the current infections have largely occurred in situations where face coverings aren’t typically worn, like group dining and drinking events.Unlike New Zealand, Japan never spoke of eliminating the pathogen. Experts tried to encourage a “new way of living” and spoke of an era in which people lived with the virus. But the messaging from central and regional governments was mixed, with local officials in Tokyo warning against travel even as the national government encouraged it, and both sides bickering over who was to blame.The national government continues to argue that the situation this time is different. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reiterated Friday that another state of emergency isn’t required. The death rate in Japan remains low by almost any standards, and the medical system isn’t over-burdened -- a key factor public health officials use to judge success of virus containment. The country has fewer than 100 people in critical care due to Covid-19.But treatment won’t bring the current spread to a halt.“Hospitals can treat the infected,” said Koji Wada, a public health professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. “But only the government, through public health measures, can reduce the number of infected people.”When Shigeru Omi, the head of the current panel of experts advising the government, told officials to delay the domestic tourism push, he was ignored. The “Go To Travel” campaign then turned into a public relations nightmare, as Japan’s rural residents grew angry over the potential of infections being brought to the countryside by city-dwellers. Eventually, Tokyo was excluded from the campaign in a last-minute about-face.‘Last Chance’What impact the tourism campaign had on spreading the virus won’t be known for weeks. Experts are now more concerned over the upcoming traditional Obon holiday period in mid-August, when many young Japanese return home to pay respect to the dead and spend time with often-elderly relatives.In a sign that the situation can no longer be ignored, local officials are starting to backtrack on economic re-opening. Osaka has asked people to refrain from dining in groups of five or more. In Tokyo, restaurants, bars and karaoke shops have been asked to shorten operating hours. Governor Yuriko Koike has threatened to declare another state of emergency for the capital. Okinawa has already done so.“The central government hasn’t shown clear guidance and a clear strategy on what to do about Covid-19, and is pushing the responsibility to the local government,” said Haruka Sakamoto, a public health researcher at the University of Tokyo. “In ordinary times, the government is very centralized, and usually prefectures don’t have strong opinions.”Some think the steps don’t go far enough. Haruo Ozaki, the head of the Tokyo Medical Association, called on Thursday for the government to revise legislation so it can legally force businesses to close.“This is our last chance to mitigate the spread of infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-acted-like-the-virus-had-gone-now-it-s-spread-everywhere/story-0Pma2p4sNETbBfLybUhnSO.html

Eight countries were featured in the festival - Canada, India, USA, UK, France, Brazil, Russia, China and Italy.The Drive In Film Festival came into existence out of a sense of “disappointment”, said its Director of Programming Carlo Coen. It is backed by the organisers of the annual Italian Contemporary Film Festival, held each June. This year, of course, that was impossible. “We could not leave such a gap,” Coen said, and thought of the option of the drive in. “It is a safe situation to be in your own car,” Coen said.The venue selected was Ontario Place, in Toronto as it could accommodate up to 185 vehicles at a time. While the organisers have put together the Italian festival each year, Coen said they agreed that “This had to be international because of the very nature of the need we had, to gather Torontonians together. We Wanted to emphasize this recovery from a health emergency, by representing the countries hit worst.”The response, Coen said, was “wonderful, amazing”, with most of the screenings selling out in advance, evidencing the appetite filmgoers had to watch movies on a large screen rather than on their devices, or TVs, as they had done for nearly four months. Coen said, “People really want to go out, want to go beyond this idea of watching films at home. Cinema is meant to enjoyed by many people together rather than at home.”The Indian film selected was the 2019 comedy Bala, directed by Amar Kaushik and starring Ayushmann Khurrana.Obviously, the festival came with its own operating restrictions given the time in which it was being held: Physical distancing had to be observed at all times, with a minimum of two metres between individuals when outside their vehicles, vehicles had to be parked two metres apart, people were told not to leave their vehicles unless absolutely necessary, and only individuals from the same household could occupy the same vehicle. Refreshments could be offered using the festival app and delivered to the car.As ICFF starts preparing for its regular Italian festival, which has been postponed to November, the Drive In version could witness a repeat performance by becoming an annual event in itself, as Coen said, “We would love to do that, if the circumstances allow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-drive-in-movie-fest-features-films-from-8-nations-worst-hit-by-covid-19/story-cHKrQQBcqATqP5dj5UHF5J.html

01-08-2020||World||Trump says he’ll sign order cutting drug prices ‘very soon’||President Donald Trump said he plans to sign a “very inclusive” health-care plan “very soon” -- perhaps as soon as Sunday -- that will result in Americans paying significantly less for pharmaceutical drugs.“I want what’s right for the people,” he said at a press briefing in Florida on Friday. “We’re going to bring our drug prices down to levels that nobody ever thought possible.”Trump described on Friday a “favored nations” plan under which his administration would take the country that has the lowest drug prices as the yardstick for what Americans should be charged.While he provided few other details, on July 24, Trump announced plans for executive orders to lower prescription drug prices under Medicare by linking them to rates paid in other countries and allowing Americans to buy medication imported from Canada.He’s been seeking to repair his standing on health-care issues, particularly with senior voters. Polls have shown sentiment is souring over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act without having a ready replacement.‘Winning Solution’McLaughlin & Associates, a consulting and polling firm, produced a memo on July 29 for Republican leaders saying that “price transparency is a winning issue in key battleground states.”The memo, coauthored by the firm’s chief executive officer, John McLaughlin, said Republicans need to show what they stand for on health care. Voters got the message that the Republicans want to repeal Obamacare but they don’t know what the party supports, according to the memo.“You can’t beat something with nothing,” according to the memo. “We now have an alternative that is a winning solution -- one that received broader and deeper public support than Medicare for All.”Republicans in “tough races” are backing transparency legislation and it’s popular with voters, according to the McLaughlin memo, whose second author is David Kochel of Redwave Communications, a consulting firm in Des Moines, Iowa.“As veterans of dozens of local, state and national campaigns, we’ve rarely seen an issue with such compelling numbers across partisan lines,” the memo says.The memo says the measure can be passed into law under legislation whose authors include Republican Senators Mike Braun of Indiana and Chuck Grassley of Iowa. There’s a companion bill in the House.Trump Ties Medicare Drug Cost to Rates Paid by Other NationsThe pharmaceutical industry was sharply critical of Trump’s orders on drug prices. Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said he was “disappointed” by them, especially given the industry’s focus on finding treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus.“They pose enormous distraction at a time when the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential Covid-19 vaccine or treatment,” Bourla said on a July 28 earning call with investors. “The international price index is radical. Not only is it imposing socialized medicine to America, it also will create uncertainty and could lead to job losses.”Trump agreed that his plan had upset the industry, saying at the Florida briefing, “the pharmaceutical companies aren’t exactly in love with Donald Trump and they’ll advertise.”The order tying prescription-drug prices to international benchmarks won’t go into effect until Aug. 24 to give drugmakers time to come up with alternative measures for lowering costs, Trump said in the July 24 announcement.(Updates with McLaughlin memo from fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-ll-sign-order-cutting-drug-prices-very-soon/story-onhOdFG5qyjBF0VgLvOSRM.html
01-08-2020||World||Teenager among 3 charged for hacking prominent Twitter accounts, Bitcoin scam||A British man, a Florida man and a Florida teen were identified by authorities Friday as the hackers who earlier this month took over Twitter accounts of prominent politicians, celebrities and technology moguls to scam people around the globe out of more than $100,000 in Bitcoin.Graham Ivan Clark, 17, was arrested Friday in Tampa, where the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office will prosecute him as adult. He faces 30 felony charges, according to a news release. Mason Sheppard, 19, of Bognor Regis, UK, and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, were charged in California federal court.In one of the most high-profile security breaches in recent years, hackers sent out bogus tweets on July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.The tweets offered to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.“There is a false belief within the criminal hacker community that attacks like the Twitter hack can be perpetrated anonymously and without consequence,” U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California said in a news release. “Today’s charging announcement demonstrates that the elation of nefarious hacking into a secure environment for fun or profit will be short-lived.”Although the case against the teen was also investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren explained that his office is prosecuting Clark in Florida state court because Florida law allows minors to be charged as adults in financial fraud cases such as this when appropriate. He added that Clark was the leader of the hacking scam.“This defendant lives here in Tampa, he committed the crime here, and he’ll be prosecuted here,” Warren said.Security experts were not surprised that the alleged mastermind of the hack is a 17-year-old, given the relative amateur nature both of the operation and the hackers’ willingness afterward to discuss the hack with reporters online.“I think this is a great case study showing how technology democratizes the ability to commit serious criminal acts,” said Jake Williams, founder of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec. “I’m not terribly surprised that at least one of the suspects is a minor. There wasn’t a ton of development that went into this attack.”Williams said the hackers were “extremely sloppy” in how they moved the Bitcoin around.Williams said it did not appear that the three used any services that make cryptocurrency difficult to trace by “tumbling” transactions of multiple users, a technique akin to money laundering.He also said he was conflicted about whether Clark should be charged as an adult.“He definitely deserves to pay (for jumping on the opportunity) but potentially serving decades in prison doesn’t seem like justice in this case,” Williams said.Twitter previously said hackers used the phone to fool the social media company’s employees into giving them access. It said hackers targeted “a small number of employees through a phone spear-phishing attack.”“This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems,” the company tweeted.After stealing employee credentials and getting into Twitter’s systems, the hackers were able to target other employees who had access to account support tools, the company said.The hackers targeted 130 accounts. They managed to tweet from 45 accounts, access the direct message inboxes of 36, and download the Twitter data from seven. Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders has said his inbox was among those accessed.Internal Revenue Service investigators in Washington, D.C., were able to identify two of the hackers by analyzing Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain — the ledger where transactions are recorded — including ones the hackers attempted to keep anonymous, federal prosecutors said.Spear-phishing is a more targeted version of phishing, an impersonation scam that uses email or other electronic communications to deceive recipients into handing over sensitive information.Twitter said it would provide a more detailed report later “given the ongoing law enforcement investigation.”The company has previously said the incident was a “coordinated social engineering attack” that targeted some of its employees with access to internal systems and tools. It didn’t provide any more information about how the attack was carried out, but the details released so far suggest the hackers started by using the old-fashioned method of talking their way past security.British cybersecurity analyst Graham Cluley said his guess was that a targeted Twitter employee or contractor received a message by phone asking them to call a number.“When the worker called the number they might have been taken to a convincing (but fake) helpdesk operator, who was then able to use social engineering techniques to trick the intended victim into handing over their credentials,” Clulely wrote Friday on his blog.It’s also possible the hackers pretended to call from the company’s legitimate help line by spoofing the number, he said.Fazeli’s father said Friday he hasn’t been able to talk to his son since Thursday.“I’m 100% sure my son is innocent,” Mohamad Fazeli said. “He’s a very good person, very honest, very smart and loyal.”“We are as shocked as everybody else,” he said by phone. “I’m sure this is a mix up.”Attempts to reach relatives of the other two weren’t immediately successful. Hillsborough County court records didn’t list an attorney for Clark, and federal court records didn’t list attorneys for Sheppard or Fazeli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenager-among-3-charged-for-hacking-prominent-twitter-accounts-bitcoin-scam/story-QTHhmKESWOPTRJdkdjYDMK.html
01-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says US ‘may be banning’ China-owned video app TikTok||President Donald Trump said Friday that his administration is weighing action against TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national-security and censorship concerns. Trump’s comments came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok. There were also reports Friday that software giant Microsoft is in talks to buy the app. “We are looking at TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We may be banning TikTok. We may be doing some other things. There a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening. So we’ll see what happens.” Reports by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources said the administration could soon announce a decision ordering ByteDance to divest its ownership in TikTok.Also read: After Chinese apps and contractors, India puts restrictions on colour TV imports There have been reports of US tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, reported Friday that Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok. Microsoft declined to comment. TikTok issued a statement Friday saying that, “While we do not comment on rumours or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok.” ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the US and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users. TikTok’s fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and US tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. It has said it has tens of millions of US users and hundreds of millions globally. But its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about the censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government, and the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials.Also read: Pompeo tells US senators ‘tide is turning’ against China, cites India’s actions TikTok maintains it doesn’t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to US user data even if asked. The company has hired a US CEO, a former top Disney executive, in an attempt to distance itself from its Chinese ownership. US national-security officials have been reviewing the Musical.ly acquisition in recent months, while US armed forces have banned their employees from installing TikTok on government-issued phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the US was considering banning TikTok. These national-security worries parallel a broader US security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the US stop funding equipment from those providers in US networks. It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government’s access to data, which the companies have denied it has. The Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore’s Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain US leadership in the telecom space. It also told China’s Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr. Other countries are also taking action against TikTok. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-may-be-banning-china-owned-video-app-tiktok/story-GKHkPIGWQjylfxg006Tr9H.html

Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died. “I rise to condemn action taken by the People’s Republic of China, or PRC in Ladakh region of India that led to deadly clashes between the two countries on June 15,” Congressman Frank Pallone said on the floor of the US House of Representatives on Friday.Today, I condemned the recent Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control in the Ladakh region of India. I call on China to end its military aggression. This conflict should only be settled through peaceful means. pic.twitter.com/kqxciAHKX1 “Since -- the truth is -- 1962, the PRC and India have been divided by a 2,100-mile-long Line of Actual Control. In the months leading to this clash, the PRC military reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers along this boundary... that clearly meant to re-draw long standing settled borders by force and aggression,” Pallone said. This intention of encroachment and escalatory tactics used by the PRC are consistent with the other provocative actions its forces have taken throughout south and southeast Asia, the Democratic Congressman from New Jersey said. To counter this, the House of Representatives has passed an amendment that calls on China to cease the military aggression and urges immediate diplomatic action to prevent further escalation of conflict, Pallone said. “I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Congress to help bolster our vital relationship with India,” the Congressman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-condemns-chinese-aggression-in-ladakh/story-GEosYrmC0FgH8W6ZSlXl7N.html

01-08-2020||World||Nepal PM Oli’s ‘irritating’ remarks against India ‘undiplomatic’, says CPN leader||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has committed three “mistakes” with his recent “undiplomatic” and “irritating” anti-India statements, a senior leader of the ruling communist party has said, amidst mounting pressure on the embattled premier who is facing calls for resignation. Last month, prime minister Oli alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power. His remark came over a week after Nepal approved a bill to redraw the country’s map demarcating the Lipulekh mountain pass, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura – the area at the centre of the dispute between India and Nepal – under its territory. The embattled prime minister stoked another controversy this month by claiming that the “real” Ayodhya lies not in India but in Nepal and that Lord Ram was born in Thori in southern Nepal. Reacting to Oli’s remarks, Spokesperson of Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) and member of the powerful Central Secretariat Narayankaji Shrestha described the prime minister’s statements as “undiplomatic. “Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has committed a blunder by making irritating remarks against India, at a time when there is a need for resolving the border issue through dialogue(with the southern neighbour,” he said. “It was a mistake on the part of Prime Minister Oli to make irritating remarks by mentioning India’s national symbol while claiming the disputed lands of Kalapani and Lipulekh,” the spokesperson told Himalayan TV in an interview. Prime minister Oli has committed three blunders in dealing with India, though the claim made by the government on Kalapani and other territories by issuing a new map was commendable, he said. The first mistake was speaking about India’s symbol Satyamev Jayate in an irritant manner, the second mistake is to blame India for hatching conspiracy to topple his government, which is baseless, and thirdly he committed a mistake by claiming that Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram lies near Birgunj of Nepal, Shrestha said. The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory and warned the country to not resort to any “artificial enlargement of territorial claims”. Differences have also emerged between Oli and Nepal Communist Party’s Executive Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” over the party’s leadership. The internal feud in the CPN intensified after Prachanda and senior leader Madhav Nepal asked for Oli’s resignation following his controversial remarks against India. Oli had accused Prachanda and Nepal of hatching a conspiracy to topple his government after the new map of Nepal was issued by the government with the inclusion of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh areas. Senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, have criticised Oli for his baseless anti-India remarks. Oli and Prachanda factions are currently engaged in holding internal consultations, though the date for the formal meeting is yet to be fixed. Oli has turned down the dissident group’s demand for resignation. The growing differences between the two factions have led to ideological polarisation in the party, which many observers believe may result in a split in the largest communist party, which was united just one and a half years ago with the merging of CPN-Maoist Centre merging and CPN-UML. Meanwhile, 201 members of the Central Committee of the CPN, close to executive “Prachanda”, have asked the leadership to convene the 441-member Central Committee meeting to resolve the internal feud gripping the ruling party, senior leader of the party Ganesh Shah said. The Standing Committee meeting of the party has been repeatedly postponed due to the prime minister’s absence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-s-irritating-remarks-against-india-undiplomatic-cpn-leader/story-TckiprleuYlYrXyfIKAi3L.html
01-08-2020||World||Australia to make Facebook, Google pay for news to protect independent journalism||Australia will force US tech giants Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to pay Australian media outlets for news content in a landmark move to protect independent journalism that will be watched around the world. Australia will become the first country to require Facebook and Google to pay for news content provided by media companies under a royalty-style system that will become law this year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said. “It’s about a fair go for Australian news media businesses. It’s about ensuring that we have increased competition, increased consumer protection, and a sustainable media landscape,” Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne.“Nothing less than the future of the Australian media landscape is at stake.” The move comes as the tech giants fend off calls around the world for greater regulation, and a day after Google and Facebook took a battering for alleged abuse of market power from US lawmakers in a congressional hearing.Following an inquiry into the state of the media market and the power of the US platforms, the Australian government late last year told Facebook and Google to negotiate a voluntary deal with media companies to use their content. Those talks went nowhere and Canberra now says if an agreement cannot reached through arbitration within 45 days the Australian Communications and Media Authority would set legally binding terms on behalf of the government.Google said the regulation ignores “billions of clicks” that it sends to Australian news publishers each year.“It sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian government will intervene instead of letting the market work,” Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement.“It does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age.”Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.UNFAIR AND DAMAGINGMedia companies including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, lobbied hard for the government to force the US companies to the negotiating table amid a long decline in advertising revenue. “While other countries are talking about the tech giants’ unfair and damaging behaviour, the Australian government ... (is) taking world-first action,” News Corp Australia Executive Chairman Michael Miller said in a statement.A 2019 study estimated about 3,000 journalism jobs have been lost in Australia in the past 10 years, as traditional media companies bled advertising revenue to Google and Facebook which paid nothing for news content.For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, according to Frydenberg. Other countries have tried and failed to force the hands of the tech giants.Publishers in Germany, France and Spain have pushed to pass national copyright laws that force Google pay licensing fees when it publishes snippets of their news articles.In 2019, Google stopped showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, while Germany’s biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, allowed the search engine to run snippets of its articles after traffic to its sites to plunged.($1 = 1.3887 Australian dollars)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-for-news-in-world-first/story-PO28u4cxF7b0M5S7U0RpKI.html
01-08-2020||World||Fury as Conservative MP blames non-whites for UK coronavirus surge||An MP of the ruling Conservative Party on Friday blamed Muslims and non-white communities for allegedly not obeying lockdown rules that led to a surge in cases and curbs being reimposed in north England, sparking fury among many who demanded an apology.Craig Whittaker, MP for the Calder Valley in west Yorkshire, one of the areas affected by the recent surge, told LBC radio that Muslim and non-white communities referred to as BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) have not been obeying lockdown rules.He said: “What I have seen in my constituency is that there are sections of the community that are not taking the pandemic seriously.” Asked if he was referring to the Muslim community, he responded: “Of course”.“If you look at the areas where we’ve seen rises and cases, the vast majority - but not by any stretch of the imagination all areas - it is the BAME communities that are not taking this seriously enough.“We have areas of high multiple occupancy - when you have multiple families living in one household. It doesn’t specifically have to be in the Asian community, but that is the largest proportion”.“Look at the areas. You’ve got Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees. Bradford and Kirklees have two of the largest populations in West Yorkshire.” Asked to clarify if he was referring to immigrants, he said: “Immigrant and Asian population.”The remarks prompted a flood of criticism as well as some praise on social media for Whittaker “for saying what needs to be said.” Many pointed out that several non-white doctors and nurses had passed away after being infected while treating patients. Some posted images of large crowds on beaches in Bournemouth and elsewhere, violating lockdown rules, and of events with gatherings without social distancing.Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy remarked after Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a briefing on delaying lockdown easing due to a rise in cases: “Absolutely grim to hear the PM failing to correct these stupid, divisive remarks”.“We’ve just had a huge rise in cases in Greater Manchester in a borough with one of the lowest BAME populations. Time to stop the blame game and give us all proper advice to follow”, she tweeted.Nadia Whittome, another Labour MP of Indian heritage, added: “Can’t you people take a day off from scapegoating us for your own mistakes? This made up nonsense is designed to make us angry with each other instead of a government that did too little, too late”.Areas under local lockdowns and new curbs include cities with large non-white populations, such as Leicester and towns in north England. The Johnson government has set up inquiries to explore the disproportionate ways in which non-whites have been affected by the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fury-as-conservative-mp-blames-non-whites-for-uk-coronavirus-surge/story-aagZq9BRrOYpdG7dVpsUBL.html
01-08-2020||World||Facebook, Google told they must pay Australian media for news||Australia’s government has ordered Facebook and Google to share revenue generated from news articles in what it says is a world-first move -- opening up another front in the regulatory and political pushback against the digital giants.The two companies will have to negotiate with traditional media on remuneration in good faith, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Friday. If no agreement is reached there will be a binding arbitration process and penalties for breaching the code will be up to A$10 million ($7 million), he said.The move is about ensuring a “level playing field” for Australian media companies, Frydenberg said. The draft code, which is open to consultation until Aug. 28 before being legislated later this year, will initially only apply to Google and Facebook but could be extended to other digital companies in the future.Traditional media firms have long complained their content is being exploited by digital platforms without due compensation. As newspapers and broadcasters hemorrhage jobs, their complaints have garnered more political support.Regulators in other jurisdictions -- as well as investors -- are watching closely to see how the code works in practice. Should watchdogs in other markets follow Australia, it would chip away at two of the most wildly successful business models of the 21st century, built largely on content free-for-alls.“There is a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and the major digital platforms,” Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which drafted the code, said in a statement. “We wanted a model that would address this bargaining power imbalance and result in fair payment for content, which avoided unproductive and drawn-out negotiations, and wouldn’t reduce the availability of Australian news on Google and Facebook.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-google-told-they-must-pay-australian-media-for-news/story-ictGnqJqurkKDyyV6uyJkJ.html
01-08-2020||India||Muted Eid celebrations grim reminder of 2019 in Srinagar||Gulzar Ahmad Rather spent Eid-al-Adha like any other Saturday, mostly indoors. There were no mass prayers, no congregation in the local mosque, no visiting homes of relatives or ritual sacrifice of a goat. The morning prayers were offered in a small batch, the noon meal was simple and shorn of delicacies, and afternoon tea was without any cake or cookies. In the evening, his three children decided to not go out to meet friends and stay indoors. It was an early night for the family.For Rather, a 48-year-old vegetable vendor in Srinagar, the muted celebration was a reminder of Eid-Ul-Adha on August 12 last year, when an unprecedented lockdown and a communications blackout was clamped on the Valley in the wake of the government’s decision to strip the region of its special status and bifurcate it. But unlike last time, when passions ran high and tension was palpable in old Srinagar, the coronavirus pandemic and a depressed economy forced people to scale down celebrations this year. “That time, we, as a community, were emotionally hurt. There was anger and frustration. This time it is universal and there is an understanding that it is from God. Everyone is involved this time,” he said.With infection surging in the Valley – there are 2,700 cases in the 1.2 million-strong Srinagar alone – roads, markets and local shops were deserted on Saturday as no Eid prayers were offered in major mosques and shrines. To keep the virus at bay, people preferred to offer prayers at home -- either individually or in small groups of family members only. The barricades were lower than last year, the barbed wire fencing cordoned off fewer roads and there were no troops marching through city streets, but fear of the virus kept most people indoors. Asim Jan, a 21-year-old engineering student, said he was confined to his room for the first time on Eid. “I am reading a book on Eid because there is nothing to do. We can’t even move out,” he said.Eid, not a grand event anymoreIn a city with no cinemas and few avenues for entertainment, Eid-al-Adha is easily the most grand event. Known locally as big or Badi Eid, the celebration involves the traditional Qurbani, or sacrifice of goat, people buy jewellery, clothes and an assortment of baked goods. Even the peak of the militancy in the 90s didn’t ebb the enthusiasm and long queues at overcrowded bakeries were a common sight. But the turmoil of the past year has denied local residents any cheer. Last year, Eid-ul-Adha fell just a week after the effective nullification of Article 370, which accorded special status to Kashmir. Then Eid-ul-Fitr this year was in May when the pandemic was fast spreading across the country. With Eid-ul-Adha celebrated a week before the one-year anniversary of the Article 370 move on Saturday, local residents said the anger over politics from last year was replaced by fear and hopelessness about the state of the economy and health care system. “We took limited orders for Eid. The pandemic has changed everything. And for us, this is the third Eid when we are making below-average sales,” said Arshid Ahmad, manager of a prominent bakery at city’s Residency Road.On the road, coils of barbed wire and iron barricades have been replaced by colorful road blocks. “I am in the city centre Lal chowk after a month only to get medicines. Who will celebrate Eid?” asked Saqib Mansoor, a local resident.Even home kitchens are without the usual delicacies like Yakhni, Rogan Josh, Methimaaz.”This time we didn’t purchase anything because of the situation. We are taking precautions and have not ordered anything,” said Suhail Ahmad, a Srinagar resident.Travel restrictions imposed to break the chain of infection stopped sheep traders from neighbouring states and the lack of tourism meant that people had no money to buy animals for the traditional qurbani. “This time, animals are not visible in the markets due to pandemic,” said Zahoor Ahmad, a resident of Lal Bazar. Local authorities threw open all markets three days before Eid but quickly rescinded the decision as cases piled up – only shops selling essential supplies were allowed. Many residents said they felt trapped throughout the past year – first by political tensions, then the lockdown and communications blackout, and when finally some normalcy was returning to the streets, the pandemic. “It feels like for one year, I have been doing nothing. We have virtually been in the lockdown for the past one year,” said Danish Ahmad, a local school teacher.Local economy hit hardThe virtual year-long lockdown has ravaged the local economy, hurt small traders and ensured that ordinary people have little money to spend. “Jobs have been lost in every sector. On Eid, sales used to go 200 to 300 percent up but from last three Eids, the situation is going from bad to worse,” said Sheikh Ashiq, president of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce. A major generator of jobs – tourism – has been shuttered. Manzoor Ahmad Bhat, 35, a cab driver, hasn’t made a single trip to any tourist spot since August 5, 2019. “Before the restrictions last year, there were many tourists here and I used to make multiple trips in a month but since then I have not made a single penny for the whole year. How will I celebrate Eid when I don’t have anything to feed my wife?” Bhat asked.Javaid Ahmad Mir, who owns a laundry business, said that mood among locals had shifted from anger about the political situation to despair about personal finance. “Article 370 was on the minds of people last year and every heart was bleeding, this time people are more worried about the economy,” he said.“It will take another 10 years for us to recover”.Every Eid, Kashmir would welcome a large number of expatriates from West Asian countries who travelled home to celebrate the festival with their families. Bilal Ahmad, who works in a logistics firm in Dubai, travelled to old Srinagar with his wife and two young children last year, only to get trapped in the lockdown for months. This year, he decided to not come – but regretted spending the festival in a foreign country without family. “Last year, Eid was very tense but was still better than this one in the UAE. But there were no flights and uncertainty is still prevalent in Kashmir, so I decided to not come,” he said over phone. The uncertainty around the region’s political future, economy and the pandemic has left the local population drained. Mohammad Ramzan, 58, said that as a result of these three factors, people just fulfilled their religious obligations on Eid-Ul-Adha on Saturday, instead of a grand celebration. “Khushi kaha hai (Where is happiness?)” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muted-eid-celebrations-grim-reminder-of-2019-in-srinagar/story-meh03BTBwvcfnlHYvvOZbK.html
01-08-2020||India||Team of 88 Jaipur cops sent to Jaisalmer hotel to guard Congress MLAs loyal to Gehlot||A team of 88 policemen from Jaipur city police including three IPS, nine RPS (state services) officers and 17 inspectors who were sent to Jaisalmer yesterday are looking after the security of the hotel, where the Congress MLAs are staying. The Congress on Friday shifted legislators loyal to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to a luxury hotel near Jaisalmer, alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was attempting to poach its MLAs. “The team of police officials from the city includes Additional Commissioner of Police Rahul Prakash, deputy commissioner of police, North, Rajeev Pachar, additional deputy commissioners of police Sunita Sharma, Satveer Singh and Rajendra Prasad; assistant commissioners of police Shankar Lal Chaba, Ranveer Singh and Vikram Singh, 17 inspectors and other subordinates have been sent to Jaisalmer,” a top police official said. The official added that the city police team had been sent to ensure that they along with Jaisalmer and Jodhpur range police ensure that there were no loopholes in the security of the legislators staying in the hotel. “A 360 degree multi-level security system has been established in the outer and inner periphery of the hotel. Barricading has been done in multiple areas of Jaisalmer especially connecting Bikaner, Barmer, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer,” the official said. The legislators had been camping in a hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur since July 13 in the aftermath of a rebellion by now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who has the support of 18 Congress MLAs in the 200-member House. “The government needs to be saved as you can see the way the Centre and its departments are after us. The pressure will be less there [Jaisalmer]. Most of the ministers and I will stay here and the rest will keep coming. There will be no compromise on governance,” chief minister Gehlot said before boarding his flight to Jaisalmer. BJP state president Satish Poonia wondered if the Congress MLAs would cross over to Pakistan next. “The CM talks of democracy and the Constitution, but if there is unity, why are the MLAs being shifted?

They can carry the auto generated e-pass along with a valid id proof to get entry at the border check post. This system is to ensure a record of the people coming to AP such that local health staff can keep a watch on the health of the concerned,” Krishna Babu said.

Proposals for temple tourism, including packages for Tirupati, Simhachalam, Dwaraka Tirumala, Kanipakam and Sri Kalahasti were sent to the Centre. These tourism packages would be resumed in the first week of August. He said star hotels would also be started next week under public-private partnership after getting a nod from the chief minister.

Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president and former chief minister Kamal Nath held a meeting on Saturday in Bhopal and asked all the party leaders and MLAs to celebrate the occasion by performing prayers for two days. “It was former Prime Minister late Rajeev Gandhi who opened the lock of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. He was the first person who coined the term Ramrajya and saw the dream of construction of the temple. Now, the Supreme Court has paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple, we will celebrate it,” Nath told Congress leaders, according to a party leader who attended the meeting.Also Read: Tight security arrangements, Covid-19 protocols in Ayodhya ahead of Ram temple evenMPCC spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “MPCC chief Kamal Nath asked us to organize poojas including the recital of Sunderkand, Ramayan and yajna at our residences and post videos of it on social media to inspire others to do so. Nath will organize a special pooja at his official residence in Bhopal on August 4.” Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee also posted a message on social media on Saturday, presenting Kamal Nath as a devotee of lord Hanuman, while listing religion-linked decisions taken during his 15 month tenure as the MP chief minister. Former chief minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh also tweeted and said, “Lord Ram is a matter of faith for us. It’s our aspiration that a huge temple of lord Ram should be constructed soon in Ayodhya for Ramlala. It was a will of late Rajeev Gandhi too.” Also Read: Proud of denying permission to fire on kar sewaks in Ayodhya, says former Uttar Pradesh CM Kalyan SinghHowever, he repeated his questioning of the timing of the Bhumi Pujan ceremony in Ayodhya. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the Congress initiative was a political gimmick. “Senior Congress leaders like Kapil Sibbal questioned the existence of lord Ram and now the same party is trying to change their image as Ram bhakts (devotes). These are political gimmick as they realized that lord Ram is a matter of faith for Indians and they can’t oppose it,” said BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal. The BJP further alleged that this was mere posturing aimed at winning the by polls due in the state.“If Congress leaders really have faith in lord Ram, what is the need for publicizing it on social media to declare themselves as bhakts? They are doing all these things to win the by-election but people are wise enough to understand the difference between real and reel,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-congress-leaders-to-hold-special-prayers-before-ram-temple-s-bhumi-pujan-ceremony/story-RRfIGU4RDRflJZUmJKI1iK.html

The minister said these proposals under the government’s Rs 41,000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for mobile phone manufacturing are expected to create around 12 lakh jobs, 3 lakh direct and 9 lakh indirect employment opportunities, in the country.  “There will be huge (mobile phone) production of around Rs 11 lakh crore, huge export of around Rs 7 lakh crore and great employment opportunity for 3 lakh direct and 9 lakh indirect people. I personally thank all the companies that have applied,” Prasad told reporters.He said that a total of 22 companies have filed applications under the PLI scheme from various countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Germany, Austria, etc.  “The benchmark for international companies was that they make mobile phones priced at or above Rs 15,000. International companies that have applied are Samsung, Foxconn Hon Hai, Rising Star, Wistron and Pegatron,” Prasad said.  Foxconn Hon Hai, Wistron and Pegatron are contract manufacturers for Apple iPhones. There is no price limit for Indian companies under the scheme. In terms of revenue, Apple accounts for 37 per cent and Samsung 22 per cent for global sales of mobile phones and the PLI scheme is expected to increase their manufacturing base manifold in the country, an official statement issued by the Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity) said.

01-08-2020||India||Kerala reports 1,129 fresh cases; tally at 24,741||There is a big spurt in locally-transmitted coronavirus cases in Kerala as the state reported 1,129 fresh cases and eight deaths on Saturday, said state health minister K K Shailaja. Among the dead is a police officer, first in the state. A close look at the state’s tally in last one week shows its aggressive strategy of isolating, contract tracing and treating patients is under deep stress due to increase in caseloads. With 1,129 Covid-19 cases, the total tally went up to 24,741 with 10,862 active cases and 13,779 have recovered . With eight casualties, highest since the outbreak began, death toll went up to 83. But there are allegations that at least 20 deaths failed to find a place in the list but the government maintained that it was going by the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The first coronavirus case in the country was reported in the state on January 30, a China-returned medical student from Thrissur. Coronavirus cases started increasing in March first week but by April the state was on the verge of flattening the curve. But after lockdown norms were eased in May, there was a big surge of expatriates and people stranded in other states which vitiated the coronavirus scene again. Till June, imported Covid-19 cases formed a lion’s share but in July locally-transmitted cases went up, which is now more than 70%. It took five months to reach 10,000 but in 20 days it crossed 24,000. But there is some relief too as the recovery rate is also going up steadily. The government is now trying to enhance health system capacity and keep the transmission rate down. “Our effective management and planning helped contain the spread of the virus. If we continue the strategy well we can check a massive surge in cases,” said the health minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-1-129-fresh-cases-tally-at-24-741/story-SygWQ7hOOqIyVZOA1AVgjI.html
01-08-2020||India||Amar Singh and the Bharatiya Janata Party - so near and yet so far||Shortly after demonetization in November 2016, a video purportedly showing him smiling at a derogatory comment against Prime Minister Narendra Modi by an unidentified person fetched Amar Singh an FIR at the City Kotwali police station in Uttar Pradesh’s Azamgarh. The Samajwadi party leader wasted no time to file a counter complaint against the person uttering the comments and went on to dub demonetization as a courageous move. Contrary to his party’s stand, Singh who had been re-elected to the Rajya Sabha in May that year, went ahead to praise the policy decision, although with a footnote about the weakness in its implementation. While his party colleagues trained their guns on the PM, Singh went around declaiming how “proud” he was to have Narendra Modi as Prime Minister.These statements marked the beginning of Amar Singh’s outreach towards the PM and the Bharatiya Janata Party with which he had a turbulent past. In 2008, Singh was accused of conspiring and masterminding the cash-for-vote scam to bribe some MPs to cross vote ahead of a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha. The politically expedient Singh was unperturbed when he breached the Samajwadi Party line to support the BJP on a host of issues from the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to the abrogation of Article 370 that gave Jammu and Kashmir its special status. By 2017, when signs of estrangement between him and his mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav were evident, he seemed to make the most of the speculation about his joining the BJP. Singh’s warming up to the BJP was visible after the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017, when he lashed out at Akhilesh Yadav for aligning with the Congress, accusing him of corruption and failing to offer development in the state. His public outburst against the Yadav scion led to a second expulsion from the party, which was announced at the national convention. He was earlier expelled for anti-party activities in 2010. In 2018, a period of exile from the public eye, partly on account of his failing health, ended when his presence at PM Modi’s event became the talking point. While lashing out at his political opponents for secretly kowtowing with industrialists, PM Modi referred to Singh and how he could disclose the details of those meetings. Basking in the attention, Singh later told mediapersons that he will give out the names when the time is ripe. “Lab khulenge to utar jayegen chehre saare…” (Masks will slip when I open my mouth), he said to a television channel. The PM’s comment reignited speculation of Singh’s entry into the party fold. But Singh kept up the guessing game, neither denying nor giving cues about his next move. In 2019, a BJP ally, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) even offered him a ticket to contest from Azamgarh, a borough of the Yadavs and a seat then represented in the Lok Sabha by Mulayam Singh. Singh, declined. He would reply to posers about his joining date by claiming he was only a “supporter of PM Modi”. “There was a lot of speculation about him joining the BJP and it was usually triggered by his presence at BJP events. When he was seen at the three-day lecture series by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, the rumour gained strength,” said a BJP functionary not wishing to be quoted. When asked if his role in the 2008 cash for votes scandal was a reason for the party to keep a distance, the functionary said, “There are many reasons …” but did not elucidate. Singh also found a way to worm his way into the good books of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh; not only did he support the demand for a Ram Temple at Ayodhya, but also donated his ancestral house in Azamgarh to the RSS. Aware of the many sobriquets he earned during his political innings, Singh while speaking during the debate on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in Rajya Sabha on August 5 last year said, he could not be called a “dal badloo” or a party hopper. “I did not leave the party, though I was expelled twice,” he said on the floor of the House and proceeded to support to the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amar-singh-and-the-bharatiya-janata-party-so-near-and-yet-so-far/story-Tgq2Me2191xD5AK13gXWcI.html

The RSS leader said the construction of the Ram Temple marks the completion of one part of the struggle. Joshi’s remarks come days ahead of the foundation stone-laying ceremony at Ayodhya on August 5, following which the construction of the Ram temple will begin. “It is the new beginning of a new era. The Hindu samaj (society) wants to give a message of human welfare to the world. We should not remain meek, but powerful and the construction of temple will mark the beginning of that,” Joshi said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Joshi and a host of other RSS leaders are expected to attend the ground breaking ceremony.Also read: Ayodhya priest, 15 policemen test Covid-19 positive ahead of Ram temple eventThe RSS and its frontal organisation, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad were at the forefront of Ram Janmabhoomi movement that pushed for construction of a temple at the site where the Babri Masjid stood before its demolition in 1992. The RSS functionary said the struggle was not for the construction of just another place of worship as there are hundreds of temples across India but also imparting inspiration through the principles of Lord Ram. “Our ambition was not to add one more temple in the list. It is not completely true to see it only as a centre for religious faith…When we think of this temple, there are other things that have to be taken into account. Lord Ram lived life as a man of principles and he was considered Maryada Purushottam. Therefore, his ideals and principles and his administration as a ruler will serve as an inspiration,” he said. Also read: Ram Mandir bhoomipujan should have been held later, says Raj ThackerayJoshi also associated the issue of national pride with the temple. “All those who attacked India left something behind and it pains us to see monuments and other buildings left behind by them,” he said. Countering statements by political leaders about the existence of the Babri Masjid for over 400 years, the RSS leader said, “For any self-respecting nation, it is not good to be reminded of relics of their attackers, therefore the building that was left at the site for 400 years kept reminding the Hindu Samaj of their defeat. That is why it’s removal and creation of a temple in its place was raised by late Ashok Singhal,” Joshi said. The central joint general secretary of VHP, Dr. Surendra Jain, said the history of Ram Janmabhoomi movement is a” journey of pride of the country which went from self-guilt to clear conscience”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-marks-the-beginning-of-a-new-india-says-rss-bhaiyyaji-joshi/story-QElhUDAMId2aN9YOChcwOI.html
01-08-2020||India||Thackeray under pressure from Bollywood ‘mafia’ to derail Sushant probe: Sushil Modi||Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi has accused Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray of attempting to save people allegedly responsible for actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death under pressure from ally Congress, a party he claims has been patronizing the Bollywood ‘mafia’.Sushil Modi also repeated his allegation that the Mumbai police was not cooperating with the Bihar police team in the city to investigate Rajput’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty’s alleged role in his death. “ Uddhav Thackeray is under pressure from the Bollywood mafia patronised by the Congress, therefore he is bent on saving all those responsible in Sushant’s (death) case. How will Congress show its face to people in Bihar,” Modi said in his tweet.Modi’s comments assume significance since Bihar is slated for assembly elections later this year and the Congress party is part of the opposition alliance in Bihar. Modi’s reference to ‘Bollywood mafia’ also reflects the popular sentiment associated with a campaign started after Rajput’s death against alleged culture of nepotism in the Mumbai film industry, which purportedly blocks outsiders like Rajput from progressing in their careers.On Friday, Uddhav had defended Mumbai police’s investigations and asked anyone with evidence in Sushant case to come forward. He also urged against using this case as an “excuse” to create friction between Maharashtra and Bihar. “Mumbai Police is not inefficient. If anyone has any evidence they can bring it to us and we will interrogate and punish the guilty. Please do not use this case (Sushant Singh Rajput death case) as an excuse to create friction between Maharashtra and Bihar,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by ANI.However, Sushil Modi has said that Rajput’s case is not the first instance of alleged discrimination against Bihar. He tweeted to say that there were attempts to block the return of migrant workers from the state from Maharashtra during the lockdown.“Complaints of ill-treatment of people from Bihar also used to be received earlier but the current Uddhav government, surviving on the crutches of Congress and NCP support, has crossed all limits. During lockdown, attempts were made to stall the return of labourers from Bihar,” Modi alleged in another tweet.Quite tellingly, Modi also described Sushant SIngh Rajput as a “son of Bihar” while accusing Mumbai police of not cooperating with Bihar police. Modi said that almost all parties are in favour of a CBI probe in the case, which has been opposed by Maharashtra government. A budding actor, Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. It was suggested to be a case of death by suicide but soon allegations started to surface indicating he could have been driven to take his life due to circumstances including stalling of his movies by big production houses in Bollywood. While Mumbai police has been questioning film personalities in its probe, Sushant’s family in Patna filed a case of abetment of suicide against Sushant’s live-in-partner and actor Rhea Chakraborty, accusing her of mentally harassing Sushant and of diverting Sushant’s money among other allegations. The family has also accused Mumbai police of attempting to derail the probe by focusing on Bollywood biggies instead of Rhea. The family is also opposing Rhea Chakraborty’s plea to transfer case filed against her in Bihar to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushil-modi-alleges-uddhav-under-pressure-from-bollywood-mafia-to-derail-sushant-probe/story-tl2IdKotiqEzvpHuVxBhJO.html
01-08-2020||India||GST collection fell 14% to Rs 87,422 crore in July: Govt||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in the month of July fell 3.8% at Rs 87,422 crore compared to Rs 90,917 crore collected in the previous month, while the revenue mop up in July this year saw a 14.3% year-on-year decline due to the coronavirus pandemic that has had a devastating impact on the economy.“The revenues for the last month [June 2020] were higher than the current month. However, it is important to note that during the previous month, a large number of taxpayers also paid taxes pertaining to February, March and April 2020 on account of the relief provided due to Covid-19,” a finance ministry statement said on Saturday. The taxpayers with turnover less than Rs 5 core still enjoy relaxation in filing of returns till September 2020, it added.Experts said the GST collection, which is a weathervane of economic health, is increasingly improving and the trend is positive. Pratik Jain, partner and leader, indirect tax at consultancy firm PwC India said, “June and July data reveal that broadly the collections are stabilising between 85-90% of corresponding period last year. This is also corroborated with number of E-way bills being generated on a daily basis, which indicates that supply chain is getting back to normal.”GST collection was badly hit in the current financial year due to the 68-day nationwide lockdown since March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19. The collection in April 2020 plunged 72% at Rs 32,172 crore compared to the same month last year. It fell 38% in May 2020 at Rs 62,151 crore due to over same month previous year. The year-on-year fall in June this year had come down to 9%.The gross GST revenue collected in the month of July, 2020 is Rs 87,422 crore of which the central GST (CGST) is Rs 16,147crore, the state GST (SGST) is Rs 21,418 crore and integrated GST (IGST) is Rs 42,592 crore. The cess collection in the month is Rs 7,265 crore, the finance ministry statement said.“The government has settled Rs 23,320 crore to CGST and Rs 18,838 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement. The total revenue earned by Central Government and the State Governments after regular settlement in the month of July,2020 is Rs 39,467 crore for CGST and Rs 40,256 crore for the SGST,” it added.Jain said, “This augurs well for the government and collections are likely to improve further as lockdown is eased progressively. Industry can perhaps hope for some more GST relief, particularly in form of liquidity support as they navigate through the slowdown.”“While the overall GST collections for the month is heartening , the collections in many of the major states coming close to last year’s collections indicates that the recovery process has slowly started with the unlockdown process underway in these states,” MS Mani, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India said.“The progressive unlockdown steps taken by various states in June are reflected in the improvement in GST collections for July although the figures also include some transactions in respect of earlier months,” Mani added.Rajat Bose, partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas and Co said, “While the collections in July are less than the collections in June, however, one must keep in mind that collections in June also included collections for the month of March, April and May. Hopefully, this trend should continue in the coming months, especially since festive season has started in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-collection-fell-14-to-rs-87-422-crore-in-july-govt/story-UDytToCGQgGkbVJps1zu8J.html

On Saturday, the state government appointed a high-level committee to look into the development of security infrastructure in Visakhapatnam. The committee is headed by Visakhapatnam Commissioner of Police R K Meena and would comprise of eight senior officials. An officer on special duty (security planning) would be its convenor. The committee will study the infrastructure required for strengthening the security and policing in Visakhapatnam in the wake of it being developed into the executive capital. It would also look into the requirement of additional police forces in the capital city. Director General of Police Gautam Sawang directed that the committee submit its report within two weeks. Soon after the issuance of gazette notifications on the two bills -- the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, and the AP Capital Region Development Authority (Repeal) Bill, 2020 – declaring them as Acts on Friday evening, minister for urban development and municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayana announced that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy would soon lay the foundation for the executive capital at Visakhapatnam. An official in the chief minister’s office familiar with the development said the chief minister is likely to lay the foundation stone for the executive capital at Visakhapatnam on August 15, soon after the Independence Day celebrations, which would also be held in the port city. Jagan reportedly deputed his CMO staff to make arrangements for the foundation stone laying ceremony. “The shifting of the government offices would commence shortly in a phased manner and if everything goes as per plan, the state secretariat and other administrative offices would be shifted to Visakhapatnam by October 25, coinciding with Dusshera festival,” the official said. The farmers of Amaravati who had given away nearly 34,000 acres of land to the state government for development of the state capital during the Chandrababu Naidu regime, have vowed to fight against the shifting of the administrative capital to Visakhapatnam. Hundreds of farmers from Tulluru, Mandadam, Venkatayapalem and Velagapaudi staged protests in their respective villages, maintaining social distance as per Covid-19 norms, to express their dissent against the Governor’s approval for the three capitals. “We are completely shattered. The state government is least bothered about the sacrifices made by thousands of farmers hoping that there would be a capital at Amaravati. We are pinning our hopes on the judiciary now,” Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi Joint Action Committee (JAC) leader A Siva Reddy said. The farmers are now planning to move a petition in the high court on Tuesday seeking a stay on the implementation of the three capitals Act. A petition filed by former Telugu Desam Party MLA from Tadikonda Sravan Kumar earlier this week is pending in the high court, which posted it to August 6 for hearing. “We are questioning on what basis the state government had taken the decision to form three capitals. The so-called expert committee by G N Rao was formed only to suggest measures for the all-round development of the state and not for trifurcation of the capital city. We are ready to face a long-drawn legal battle in this regard,” Anil Karumanchi, a farmer from Venkatayapalem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-begins-process-to-shift-capital-to-vizag-farmers-plan-to-move-court/story-Rh5VYk0Ro7RsvjLOdih0IN.html

In a statement issued by the Raj Bhavan, the governor has said that “at a time when the state is battling Covid-19 and reeling under financial crises, the idea to construct a new Raj Bhavan is irrational and imprudent.” “Any new capital work would entail unnecessary additional financial burden on the state exchequer thereby exacerbating the economic distress of the state,” the governor said. Malik who had addressed a letter to the chief minister has clarified that his requirement for functioning as the governor is very limited and that he does not require a new Raj Bhavan building per se. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn July 24, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant announced the decision to construct new premises for the Raj Bhavan and suggested related work like identifying land for the building and finalizing its design could be tendered before April 2021.The Goa governors’ residence is housed in an erstwhile Portuguese fort that was used to accommodate Portuguese governors prior to being converted into a governor’s residence after liberation. Speaking after a review meeting of the ongoing maintenance work of Raj Bhavan and its restoration at his residence Altinho Panaji, CM proposed the idea for the new building saying the existing centuries-old building has been declared a heritage building by the archaeological survey of India and could be put to heritage or tourism use. The chief minister stressed on to sustain the originality and uniqueness of the building of the existing building.Also Read: Bengal governor raises questions over funding of state’s Global Business SummitHowever, the announcement didn’t go down well with the governor, who shot off a letter to the chief minister pointing out that “a lot of negativities and controversies are being generated” and asked him to defer the proposal till the state finances improve. Opposition parties had questioned the government’s decision to announce a new Raj Bhavan amid a severe financial crisis which has seen the state resort to unprecedented borrowing to keep the engine running. The Goa government has also announced austerity measures including a ban on recruitment, a ban on new capital works in a bid to cut costs and shore up the balance sheet. The governor and the CM have had several run-ins most recently over the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the governor accusing Sawant of putting words in his mouth that he was happy with the handling but disappointed with the coverage in the media.The chief Minister later met the governor and clarified his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-governor-cm-spar-again-this-time-over-new-raj-bhavan/story-Hm6h9ViOhApob8iLpEAfFM.html

It has already examined and recorded the statement of Rajput’s close friend Mahesh Shetty. It also recorded the statement of his ex- girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, his sister Mitu Singh, cook Ashok, Niraj, and Dr Chavda (Dr Kersi Chavda), who treated Sushant for depression,” Pandey said.Some more persons will be examined in connection with the alleged suicide, he added.Pandey said the Bihar Police wants all medico-legal evidence related to the case handed over to it, asserting that it will bring out the truth at the earliest.A four-member team of the state police is in Mumbai to probe the suicide after it registered an FIR at the Rajiv Nagar police station here on July 25 based on a complaint lodged by Rajput’s father KK Singh.“Our team had a meeting with Mumbai’s Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) on Friday evening. The DCP assured of cooperation... Initially, there was some confusion and non-cooperation,” Pandey told reporters here.Stating that the allegations of Mumbai Police’s misbehaviour with the Bihar Police personnel were “rumours”, Pandey said the local police there helped the sleuths from the eastern state reach its destinations.He said that the Mumbai Police did so as probably it did not want the Bihar Police to encounter the media.Pandey said the Bihar Police wants the forensic science laboratory reports, inquest report, post-mortem report and relevant CCTV footage in order to facilitate the probe.The Bihar Police also wants details of those who were examined by the Mumbai Police and what they have said in their statements, the top police chief said.Replying to a question, he said, “Why would we ask for a CBI probe? Bihar Police is capable enough of probing the case. If needed, an IPS-rank officer may be sent to Mumbai to lead the investigation.”The chorus for a CBI inquiry into the death, which happened on June 14, is growing with parties cutting across the political lines in Bihar, demanding that the central investigating agency take up the case for a fair probe.The Bihar Police team reached Mumbai on July 27 and began its probe.The FIR was lodged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including those pertaining to abetment of suicide and fraud.In his FIR, the father accused actor Rhea Chakraborty, who is said to have been in a relationship with Rajput, of having used his sons standing in Bollywood to promote her own career, trying to drive a wedge between him and his family, getting him fed with medicines for mental illness with the help of conniving doctors and blackmailing him with threats of making his medical history public to tarnish his public reputation.The bereaved father has also alleged that at least Rs 15 crore was withdrawn from his sons bank account to which Chakraborty and her family members had gained access and that barely a week before Rajput hung himself to death at his Bandra residence, the actress had visited his house and stolen his laptop, ATM card and other important documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-cooperating-with-our-team-in-sushant-probe-bihar-dgp/story-e8gxOZUFWquMGZwX7UR31M.html

01-08-2020||India||Will welcome rebels back if Cong high command forgives them: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to get the alleged attempt to topple his government stopped and said he is open to welcoming back the Congress rebels led by Sachin Pilot. Answering queries from reporters, Gehlot said if the Congress high command forgives the dissidents, he will embrace them. Since the power tussle between him and Sachin Pilot resurfaced this month, the Congress veteran has used harsh words against his former deputy, once even referring to him as “nikamma” or useless. Gehlot said he will do whatever the Congress leadership wants and gave the party the credit for becoming the Rajasthan chief minister thrice. The chief minister was on his way back to Jaipur after an overnight stay at Jaisalmer’s Suryagarh resort, where loyalist MLAs have been shifted ahead of the assembly session from August 14. The Congress has accused the BJP of playing a major role in the rebellion by the now sacked deputy chief minister and 18 other Congress MLAs who are threatening his government. “We have no quarrel with anyone. In a democracy, fights happen over ideology, policies and programmes and not for toppling a government. “Modi should get stopped whatever is going on in Rajasthan,” the chief minister said outside the hotel where the MLAs were shifted Friday. Gehlot and the ministers are likely to spend most of their time in the state capital as the Congress tries to keep its numbers intact in Jaisalmer. He claimed that democracy is under threat in the country is and the Union Home Ministry is after his government in the state. He repeated the charge that the “rate” for trying to lure MLAs away has gone up after the announcement of the assembly session. Reacting to BJP state president Satish Poonia’s statement over the shifting of Congress MLAs to Jaisalmer, Gehlot called him a new leader who wants to take on former chief minister Vasundhara Raje. He commented that Raje has “disappeared” from the scene. Poonia had mocked the Congress, asking if the Gehlot loyalists will next move further westward across the border into Pakistan. MLAs from the Congress and its allies had remained confined to Fairmont hotel in Jaipur since July 13 before being flown to Jaisalmer on chartered flights.

The decision has not gone down well among the subordinates in the 1.40 lakh strong paramilitary force, which guards airports, metro, nuclear and space facilities apart from several sensitive government installations, who feel that the policy is unjust as social media keeps them entertained after long duty hours.The latest social media policy, issued by CISF headquarters in Delhi, say that, “Inspite of clear guidelines, there have been instances where social media platforms were used by the force personnel to share sensitive information about the nation/organization and to criticize the policies of the government.” HT has reviewed the copy of guidelines. Asserting that social media platforms pose a threat to the national security and the general discipline of the force, CISF has asked its men to “disclose their user ID of all social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc) being used by them to the department, through respective units/formations”. The personnel have also been asked to inform the department in case of any change of the User ID or creation of new User ID. The CISF men have been strictly asked “not to create and use anonymous or pseudonymous User ID”. Further, the directive says that the “personnel should not use any social media platform to criticize the policies of the government on any matter”. The jawans have been informed that social media platforms shouldn’t be used as a tool to by-pass the chain of command and proper channel to air the grievances, according to the directive.“In case of any violation, strict legal and disciplinary action should be initiated against the defaulters as per existing laws and rules,” it added. The CISF top brass didn’t respond to HT’s calls or text. The PRO was also not available for comments. HT spoke to several serving officers in the CISF who said that the policy is “arbitrary”. “Better they should give us a basic phone and a 2G connection otherwise smartphone has no use for us if such policies are implemented,” said a company commander in CISF, who didn’t wish to be identified. Another commandant rank officer said that “we are mostly away from our families for months and social media is the only source to keep us entertained or express our opinions, which should not be taken away”. The government has lately expressed concerns over central paramilitary forces jawans’ and Group-A officers extensively using the social media platforms and also criticising government policies or seniors. For example, the direct recruit officers of the paramilitary forces, also called CAPFs (central armed police forces), have been campaigning on Twitter and Facebook for over two years now for parity in promotion and pay benefits at par with IPS officers. Last month, Indian army banned asked its personnel to delete 89 apps from their smartphones including Facebook, TikTok, Tinder, PUBG and Instagram to plug leakage of information. The decision was taken after the Centre banned around 59 apps, mostly Chinese, including Tik Tok. Earlier, in January 2017, when a Border Security Force (BSF) Constable Tej Bahadur Yadav posted a video on social media showing sub-standard food provided to the jawans at the border, the government had issued guidelines asking all personnel to not upload any content which may jeoparadise national security or follow the chain of command to address their concerns. Yadav was dismissed from the force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cisf-issues-new-social-media-policy-asks-personnel-to-refrain-from-criticizing-govt/story-DSRfegLXBW1H5F2JdzPQeP.html

01-08-2020||India||‘Stop the tamasha’: Gehlot appeals to PM Modi, cites increased horse trading ‘rate’||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has again made a public appeal for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in the ongoing political tussle for power in Rajasthan. Gehlot had earlier made similar appeals to the PM and also written to him complaining about Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and other developments in the state.In his latest public appeal, Gehlot alleged that the ‘rate’ for allegedly buying out MLAs had increased in the state. He and his party colleagues have directly accused the BJP of involvement in alleged horse-trading attempts to uproot his government. “Prime Minister should stop the ‘tamasha’ going on in Rajasthan. The rate for horse-trading has increased here. What ‘tamasha’ is this,” ANI quoted Ashok Gehlot as saying in Jaisalmer.Gehlot had made a similar claim on Thursday saying the going rates for MLAs had increased from Rs 25 crore to “unlimited” amount ever since the governor agreed to call the assembly session on August 14. Gehlot has indicated that he will call for a trust vote to prove his government’s majority on the floor of the house during the session.Also Read: Rajasthan Congress goes to SC on disqualification, shifts MLAsThe embattled chief minister has shifted his flock to Jaisalmer alleging increased attempts by the BJP to buyout and threaten MLAs in his camp. He and around 100 other MLAs are now camping in a hotel in Jaisalmer. One of the ministers in his camp had yesterday claimed that the chief minister believed MLAs will be safer there till the beginning of the assembly session on August 14. Gehlot also reiterated his demand for resignation of Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat today saying Shekhawat had no moral authority to continue since he has been named in an alleged scam related to a cooperative society.“Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s name has come up in Sanjivini Cooperative Society. Court has also directed in the matter. He should resign on moral grounds,” Gehlot was quoted by ANI as saying in Jaisalmer.Also Read: Rajasthan police told Sachin Pilot and other MLAs never stayed at Manesar hotelsCongress leaders in Gehlot’s camp claim that Shekhawat’s role in alleged horse trading attempts had been exposed by investigations conducted by the special operations group of the state. They also claim that he can be heard plotting Gehlot government’s downfall in one of the three audio clips that are being cited as proof of his guilt by the Congress. Gehlot’s government appears to have a wafer-thin majority with the support of around 101 MLAs excluding the speaker but with the inclusion of allies in the 200-member assembly. His former deputy and Congress rebel Sachin Pilot appears to have the support of 22 MLAs including 18 legislators from the Congress, who are said to be camping with him. The BJP has 74 MLAs in the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-the-tamasha-gehlot-appeals-to-pm-modi-cites-increased-horse-trading-rate/story-xNxiMuBZrYDch0W31GZYwI.html
01-08-2020||India||Boiler blast at Dahej: NGT junks plea seeking review of payment of compensation for displacement||The National Green Tribunal has junked a plea filed by a company seeking review of its order directing payment of compensation for displacing people, after a huge fire caused by a boiler blast at Dahej in Bharuch district of Gujarat on June 3 resulted in the death of eight workers.The NGT had on June 8 slapped a penalty of Rs 25 crore on Yashashvi Rasayan Pvt Ltd and asked it to pay Rs 25,000 per person for displacement.It said there is no merit in the prayer of the company seeking review and that its order was passed after hearing the parties, and not based on media reports alone. “The facts mentioned in the order remained undisputed after opportunity to the applicant before passing interim order, pending giving further opportunity in due course. The order is not based on media report alone, as wrongly submitted. The order was passed after preliminary verification of facts and after notice to the present applicant. “Even now, neither the incident is disputed nor lack of adequate safeguards as per statutory mandate are disputed. Statutory onsite and offsite plans and their compliance are not shown. Liability of the applicant is absolute and compensation payable has to be deterrent,” the bench said.The tribunal said it is wrong to assume that there is no liability for displacement for 10-12 hours. “It is also wrongly assumed that nothing is to be spent for restoration of the environment. The applicant has filed a certificate from Panchayat that the displaced persons were brought back to their residence late night. “While authenticity of the certificate is yet to be examined, the affected persons certainly faced trauma, stress and inconvenience in being displaced from their respective houses on account of hazardous activities of the unit in question for which liability cannot be disowned,” the bench said.The green panel said the incident took place at 12 noon and displacement at least till late night for at least 10-12 hours, even as per the company. “During this period, the affected persons faced trauma, displacement from their houses and all consequential problems. It is too much to contend that they are not to be paid any compensation and such displacement does not cause any physical or mental harm to a person.“In our view, such displacement is certainly actionable wrong and any commercial establishment engaged in hazardous activity for commercial purpose is certainly liable to compensate such displaced persons. Displacement was at large-scale creating anxiety, fear, trauma, and misery,” the tribunal said.It said some families may have minor children or senior citizens, females who certainly are bound to greatly suffer by such large scale and sudden displacement from their houses. “Exact damage is to be fully ascertained but even as per conservative estimate, the amount of compensation of Rs 25,000 to each displaced person cannot, be held to be excessive, even on further consideration,” the tribunal said.“There is no golden scale to measure such loss and a reasonable estimate has to be the basis. Moreover, the applicant does not deserve any indulgence as it has not moved this Tribunal with clean hands,” the NGT said. It said the plea filed by the company is patently absurd as the order clearly and specifically required deposit even if the amount was not to be disbursed. The green panel said it has gone by conservative estimate and liability of the applicant is expected to be more than the said amount. It is against the interest of justice to further delay deposit and disbursement of the amount to the victims of the tragedy as almost two months have passed from the date of the incident, the NGT said.The NGT also constituted a six-member committee headed by former High Court judge Justice B C Patel and sought a report in a month. The committee also comprises representatives of environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, National Institute of Disaster Management and Head of the Chemical Engineering Department of IIT Gandhinagar.The tribunal’s order came on a plea filed by NGO Aryavart Foundation through its president alleging that the company failed to follow requisite precautions and safety protocols.The NGO said the company is strictly and absolutely liable for the damage caused to the human lives, human health, property and the environment in violation of environmental norms. At least 50 workers of the chemical factory were injured while eight died on June 3 in the fire caused by a blast in the boiler at Dahej in Bharuch district of Gujarat.About 4,800 inhabitants of the nearby villages had to be moved to safer places on account of the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boiler-blast-at-dahej-ngt-junks-plea-seeking-review-of-payment-of-compensation-for-displacement/story-UHo1c3jbHrdQdMiDSRTpbI.html

There are 5,65,103 active cases in the country at present, according to health ministry data updated at 8 am on Saturday.“The recovery rate stands at 64.53 per cent,” the ministry said.“Emphasis on early detection through aggressive testing and effective clinical management of the hospitalised cases have resulted in the continuously falling case fatality rate (CFR), indicating that India has been able to successfully contain the fatality rate of Covid-19,” it said.While the CFR has been kept low, successful implementation of effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on a comprehensive standard of care approach have resulted in a consistent addition of more than 30,000 recoveries daily, the health ministry said.It also said that three-tier hospital infrastructure with seamless patient management has ensured prompt triaging and treatment.As on Saturday, there are 1,488 dedicated Covid hospitals with 2,49,358 isolation beds, 31,639 ICU beds, 1,09,119 with oxygen support and 16,678 ventilators. Also, 3,231 dedicated Covid Health Centres with 2,07,239 isolation beds, 18,613 ICU beds and 74,130 oxygen-supported beds and 6,668 ventilators have been made operational.

01-08-2020||India||In a first, river-landscape based approach used to rejuvenate 50-km-long Heval river in Uttarakhand||Uttarakhand is conducting the country’s first river-landscape based approach to rejuvenate the 50-kilometre (km)-long Heval river in Narendra Nagar forest division in Tehri Garhwal district, which has over one lakh people across 167 villages dependent on it. The project is the brainchild of Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Dharm Singh Meena, divisional forest officer (DFO), Narendra Nagar forest division. Meena said the maiden river rejuvenation project not just focuses on the water body but the entire landscape. Heval river, one of the many tributaries of the Ganges, originates as Khuret Gaad from the forests, near Surkanda Devi and Nagdevta temple in Tehri Garhwal district. It is a perennial river in the Chamba block that is used for both drinking water and irrigation. “This is for the first time in the country that any river is being studied from its origin until its mouth for rejuvenation. So far, we have identified 38 springs that flow into the river. We found that water from maximum springs is being tapped and used as drinking water. This is the primary reason behind groundwater depletion. We are trying to work on the treatment of the entire river landscape in a bid to encourage locals to enjoy the benefits of sustainable living,” said Meena. Officials have identified 38 and 15 springs and streams, respectively, of the river in a 30-km stretch from its origin during their geological and hydro-geological studies. The work is in progress for the remaining 20-km stretch.Raw water pond, trenches, check dams, and afforestation have been proposed along with erosion control as part of the stream-shed treatment activities. “Recharge pits, staggered contour trenches, pine-needle check dams, brushwood check-dams, random rubber walls check dam, crate wire check dams, among other initiatives, have been undertaken. The aim is to gradually reduce water’s velocity and then store the water naturally along with checking soil erosion. Over the years, these engineering structures will be replaced by vegetative measures, as part of the comprehensive eco-friendly initiative,” the official added. Young brushwood was used for making check dams, as it has fibrous roots that will grow into trees and gradually help prevent soil erosion and also naturally recharge the groundwater level. Plans are afoot to rope in 18 van panchayats for afforestation activities in river landscape and workers will be deployed under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005, scheme. The official said that the main indicator of the project showing results is the increase in water level in six springs during summer. “Earlier, the water used to be very less in these springs during summer, but now villagers are requesting us to install a pumping system to ensure that water reaches their villages. This shows that we are succeeding in the rejuvenation work, whose results will become apparent in a year or two,” said Meena. Officials have noticed the increase in the water table at certain springs, as the water discharge has risen from one litre per minute to 1.85 litre per minute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-river-landscape-based-approach-used-to-rejuvenate-50-km-long-heval-river-in-uttarakhand/story-YbX2JYyvc00kJEOdEoxJYL.html

Singh had been undergoing treatment at the hospital for several months and had lately been admitted to its intensive care unit. He was 64.Leaders across the political spectrum condoled Amar Singh’s death and said he was one of those politicians who had friends in all partiesThe flamboyant businessman-politician, who once counted India’s most influential icons from industry, politics and Bollywood among his closest friends, had been a key player in the cut and thrust of Indian politics till about a decade ago. Back in 2008, he also helped the then Manmohan Singh government survive a crucial trust vote that eventually led to his arrest three years later. He was accused of offering bribes to three BJP MPs to get them to support the UPA.WATCH | Amar Singh passes away in Singapore; tributes pour in from political worldIt was a chance encounter with Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on a flight back in 1996 that led him to enter politics. He joined as its general secretary and soon became Mulayam Singh Yadav’s crisis manager and the face of SP in Delhi’s power circles.Back in Lucknow, there were other power centres in the SP that he didn’t get along with. Amar Singh was expelled from the party in 2010 after being blamed by Akhilesh Yadav for the defeat of his wife Dimple from Firozabad.Amar Singh spoke about his retirement from politics later but ended up launching his political party but it did not work out.

The patient from Muhuripur village in South District was admitted at the state-run hospital on Friday with poisoning symptoms. During his admission, he underwent a mandatory rapid antigen test in the hospital and he was detected Covid-19 positive, the police said. “After taking statements from the hospital staff and knowing the patient’s recent history of suicide attempts, it appears that he was suffering from depression due to some reasons. So far, we have not got any evidence of harassment at the hospital. Our investigation is on,” said officer in-charge of GB Police Outpost Rakesh Patoari. A nurse in the hospital, on condition of anonymity, said that the patient was shifted to the Covid-19 ward at around 11.00 pm. Late at night, the man jumped off the building’s third floor. The doctors and paramedical staff who were on duty, started treatment as he was alive when he was found. During treatment, he died in the early hours of Saturday.Earlier in June, an elderly woman, a Covid-19 patient died by suicide in the GBP hospital.

01-08-2020||India||New Education Policy drops Chinese, after listing it in draft version||Chinese has been given a miss in the list of foreign languages offered to students at the secondary school level in the National Education Policy (NEP), which was launched earlier this week.The list has French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Thai as electives that students can take up to “learn about cultures of the world and enrich global knowledge... according to their own interests and aspirations”.However, a draft version of the NEP, released last year, did list Chinese, along with French, German, Japanese and Spanish as examples of languages to be “offered and available to interested students” as electives.The approved NEP released by Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Ramesh Pokhriyal on Wednesday omitted Chinese. The step has come amid a stand-off with China after the brutal brawl in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 during which 20 Indian Army soldiers were killed by Chinese troops. Tensions between the two countries escalated following the Galwan Valley face-off.India had banned 59 Chinese-origin mobile phone apps, including social media platforms such as TikTok and WeChat, in June in view of the information available that they are engaged in activities which are “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity and defence” of the country. After that, 47 other Chinese apps, which were variants and cloned copies of the 59 apps banned earlier.After the fresh ban on 47 clones of prohibited Chinese apps, Beijing said it will take “necessary measures” to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement that India’s June 29 ban on 59 mobile apps with Chinese background “severely damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies”, “The Indian government has the responsibility to protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors in India, including Chinese businesses, in accordance with market principles,” she added.The ban orders for the Chinese apps and their clones are among a string of economic measures unveiled by India in the wake of the months-old border standoff with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-education-policy-drops-chinese-after-listing-it-in-draft-version/story-qy6C8aRi8zpqEeaE2RidGK.html

People of the country were expecting and wishing for this since long. The construction of the temple is being carried out with the consent of every Indian. It’s possible only in India,” Nath said in a video message.Singh said Lord Ram is at the centre of everybody’s faith.“The centre of our faith is Lord Ram!And today, the country is being run with trust in the Lord Ram. That’s why we all wish that a grand temple should be built at the birthplace of Ram in Ayodhya. (late PM) Rajiv Gandhiji also wanted the same,” he tweeted.Singh, however, questionned “muhurt” (auspicious time) for the ground breaking ceremony for the construction of temple, slated to be held on August, 5 in the likely presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“If we talk about ‘muhurt’, then more than 90 per cent of Hindus in this country will be those who believe in religious science like ‘muhurt’, ‘grihdasha’, ‘astrology’, ‘choghadiya’ etc. (sic),” he said.“I am neutral to the fact that there is no ‘muhurt’ for the foundation laying on August 5. This is playing with the religious sentiments and beliefs (sic),” the Congress leader said.When asked about Singh’s tweets, MP Home Minister and senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra said, “Some people have a habit of criticising, and whenever they speak, they seek to find evil in the good. (Unknowingly) even in their criticism, they have at least taken the name of Lord Ram”.Mishra said it was the Congress which had tried to delay the construction of the temple.“Kapil Sibal and other big leaders of Congress stood against the (construction) of Ram temple in court and kept saying in the supreme court that Lord Ram was an imaginary character.“They said there was no ‘Ram Setu’. They should think now. Lord Ram is everywhere in this country,” Mishra told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-coming-up-with-consent-of-every-indian-says-congress-leader-kamal-nath/story-02lhI5LFbYCAbjEb942z1K.html

Visakhapatnam District Collector V Vinay Chand told reporters that the accident happened when the workers were testing the load capability of the crane weighing 70 tonnes. The base portion and the overhead cabin got separated, resulting in the collapse of the crane on the ground with loud thud, he said.  #WATCH A crane collapses at Hindustan Shipyard Limited in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. 10 dead and 1 injured in the incident, says DCP Suresh Babu. pic.twitter.com/BOuz1PdJu3Also read: Vizag is a wake-up call to ensure industrial safety | HT EditorialAll the 11 workers were crushed to death on the spot as they came under the massive iron structure. There were 10 persons in the cabin of the crane including three employees of Greenfield company, two of Lead Engineers and one from Squad7, apart from four permanent employees of Hindustan Shipyard Limited. “All of them died when the cabin crashed. The bodies of the victims have been retrieved and sent for post-mortem,” he said, adding that no one was injured in the mishap. While one victim could not be identified immediately, the other 10 deceased were identified as R Venkat Rao, Chaitanya, Ramu, P V Ratnam, P Naga Demudu, Satyaraj, Shiva Kumar, P Bhaskar, K Jagan and K Prasad. The collector, who inspected the mishap site, said that jetty crane was originally erected by Anupam Cranes of Mumbai two years ago, but had not been commissioned for regular operations as the company backed out. Later, the HSL outsourced the operations of the crane to Greenfield Company, which co-opted Lead Engineers and Squad7 Company for maintenance operations. “These contractors have commenced the full load trials now and the testing was being done when the tragedy occurred,” Vinay Chand added.

01-08-2020||India||Mask, social distancing will be crucial even after Covid-19 vaccine: Scientist||People will have to keep wearing masks and follow social distancing protocols even after a vaccine against the coronavirus comes along, a top US vaccine developer has said.Maria Elena Bottazzi, the associate dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, has said in an interview that the vaccine will probably reduce but not completely eliminate the chance of an inoculated person contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), caused by Sars-Cov-2. “They automatically are going to say, ‘Oh great, I’m just going to get my little vaccine, and I can go back and do exactly the things I was doing last year’. That is absolutely not true,” Bottazzi said in the interview to Business Insider. More than 150 vaccine candidates in different stages of clinical trials across the world and 26 of them have reached the human trial phase. And out of these 26, five potential vaccines candidates have reached the Phase III or last stage of clinical trials.Under the last phase, thousands of volunteers from different age groups are being injected with the vaccine candidate to test its safety and efficacy.Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca are among the companies developing coronavirus vaccines that could be ready for emergency use soon. In India, two vaccine candidates are being tested on humans.Volunteers across the country are being administered the indigenous vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease developed by Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) and Zydus Cadila.Bharat Biotech and Zydus were granted permission for Phase I and II clinical trials of Covaxin and ZyCoV-D respectively and the pharmaceutical companies have said the first doses of their vaccine candidates were administered to volunteers in July.A third vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and backed by AstraZeneca Plc will soon be tested in India. Serum Institute of India is in a manufacturing partnership with the UK’s AstraZeneca. The Pune-based Serum Institute has said it will be starting trials of the Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods and launch it by June next year if all goes well.According to Moderna, it began a pivotal trial called a phase 3 study on Monday which will show how well its vaccine works. The other companies have said they plan to begin similar research within weeks. Bottazzi, the Texas-based scientist, said in the Business Insider interview that these first vaccines won’t be a magic solution for the coronavirus pandemic that even if they are successful.“The moment you get a vaccine doesn’t mean you’re going to put your mask in the trash, she said. That is not going to happen. I hope people don’t think that is going to be the magic solution for all,” she said.It all boils down to how effective these vaccines are going to be and Bottazzi said the first Covid-19 vaccines may reduce the disease but may not prevent infection. She said in the interview that she expects these vaccines are unlikely to be perfect. More than 17.5 million people have been infected by Sars-Cov-2 and 678,775 have died across the world, according to the coronavirus tracker of Johns Hopkins University. India, the third worst-hit country, has seen nearly 1.7 million infections and 36,511 fatalities till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-social-distancing-will-be-crucial-even-after-covid-19-vaccine-scientist/story-RzEKADAQU4wNR4H10iWgUL.html
01-08-2020||India||Bihar citizens can now register for Covid-19 test, check info on disease management on ‘Sanjivan’ app||The Bihar health department has developed ‘Sanjivan’, a mobile phone application (app) that facilitates coronavirus disease (Covid-19) test and also provides updated information put out by the state government about the raging viral outbreak. The user-friendly app helps an individual to register for Covid-19 test, apply for self-quarantine at home and also gives elaborate details about nearest testing and Covid Care Centres, hospitals and availability of beds in those healthcare facilities. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here It also contains district-wise emergency helpline numbers, a chatbot option on FAQs (frequently asked questions), IEC (information education and counselling) material on SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease. The app, which became operational on Saturday morning, has an option to requisition an ambulance. It can be downloaded via the health department’s portal at http://health.bih.nic.in/31-07-2020/sanjivan.apk. The department also has district helpline numbers for those who don’t have access to the mobile app. The helpline numbers have a back-up of 10 available lines in case the primary number comes engaged because of congestion due to high volume of calls. The department is also working towards providing the testing facility at an individual’s doorstep in collaboration with private laboratories. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We will fix rates for collecting swab samples from home in a bid to avoid crowding at test centres,” said Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, health, Bihar and the brain behind launching the app. Amrit took charge of the health department on Tuesday (July 28) amid the state’s battle to fight the pandemic The state government has capped Rs 2,500 as the maximum cost to conduct the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at a private laboratory. While an additional Rs 300 is likely to be added for the collection of swab samples from home. A user, who will register for the rapid antigen detection (RAD) test, will get a registration number and an OTP (one-time-password). The user can then visit the nearest testing centre and share the OTP, which will substantially lessen the time that takes for the elaborate registration process. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The test report will be available through an SMS (short message service) on the registered mobile number. “We are building a module, where test result will be available on the app within the next couple of days,” said Amrit. The app has done away with the concept of making a visit to the district magistrate’s (DM) office and stand in a queue to physically apply for self-quarantine at home. The SMS on test result will also have another OTP, which will enable a user to apply for self-quarantine at home. The app also allows a user to see the availability of beds in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. “Now, Covid-19 patients don’t need to run from pillar to post in search of hospital beds. We will closely monitor the availability of beds that will cause a lot of convenience for those suffering from the viral infection,” Amrit added. Bihar, which has been drawing flak for the poor count of daily tests, conducted 22,742 tests on Friday, an 8,000 plus jump, following the change of guard in the health department earlier this week. On Saturday, the daily test figure was 28,624, almost double since Amrit took charge, and it would be further ramped up to 30,000 in the coming week, officials said. Bihar reported the biggest spike in Covid-19 cases with 3,521 new infections on Saturday, taking its overall case tally to 54,508. The 14 Covid-19 deaths on Friday took the state’s death toll to 312.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-citizens-can-now-register-for-covid-19-test-check-info-on-disease-management-on-sanjivan-app/story-v4Rbygqy4Oje52qJneyyFI.html

01-08-2020||India||Prashant Bhushan, Arun Shourie and N Ram challenge Contempt of Courts Act in SC||Senior journalist N Ram, former Union minister Arun Shourie and advocate Prashant Bhushan moved the Supreme Court (SC) on Friday challenging the validity of section 2(c)(i) of Contempt of Courts Act, which criminalises publication of any matter that could scandalise or lower the authority of courts. The petitioners contended that the provision is violative of freedom of speech under Article 19 of the Constitution and effectively gags discourse on matters of public importance. “It violates right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a). It is unconstitutional as it is incompatible with the preambular values and basic features of the constitution,” the plea said. The SC had recently invoked the provision to issue notice to Bhushan for his tweets against Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde and the apex court. It was submitted that the provision raises a prior restraint on speech on matters of public and political importance by criminalising criticism of court in sweeping and absolute terms. “The offences of scandalising the court is rooted in colonial assumptions and objects and have no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionalism,” the petition said. The Contempt of Court at provides for civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt is defined under Section 2(b) as wilful disobedience to any judgment, order or direction of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court. Section 2(c) deals with criminal contempt and attempts to punish publication of any material or commission of any act against courts. This provision has three sub-clauses, which explain when such a publication or act could amount to criminal contempt. First, if such publication or act scandalises or lowers the authority of any court (sub –clause i), second, if it prejudices or interferes with any judicial proceeding (sub-clause ii) and third, if it interferes with or obstructs administration of justice (sub-clause iii). The petitioners have challenged only sub-clause (i), which criminalises any publication or act on the ground that it scandalises or lowers the authority of the court. The provision, it was contended, has an extremely wide import and is incapable of objective interpretation. “For example, an interrogation by a traffic constable about whether the red beacon on the hood of a judge’s car was held to be contempt on the ground of scandalising the court,” the petition stated. It was argued that the provision uses vague terminology, whose scope and limits are impossible to demarcate. “In particular, the terminology ‘scandalises or tends to scandalise’ invites subjective and greatly differing readings and applications. It violates Article 14, which demands equal treatment and non –arbitrariness,” the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-bhushan-arun-shourie-and-n-ram-challenge-contempt-of-courts-act-in-sc/story-SonUaEOL5K7wMVGMSqqanN.html

These two big cats were seen from various locations of the core area of the forest. So, at least two tigers are there already and we need to raise the number,” Sinha said.The six tigers are being relocated from Kaziranga to Buxa as these two reserve forests have similar habitats, the official said.The BTR, which is spread over the plains and foothills, has about 390 sq-km of core area and is home of 73 mammal species including leopard, chital deer and wild boar.The forest department had recently launched a short film about the BTR, the official said.The film was handed over to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to create a buzz about the reserve forest nationally, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-buxa-reserve-to-get-6-royal-bengal-tigers-from-kaziranga/story-KDObJ8RKOV75reiRD0WwaL.html

Swati S Bhadauria, district magistrate (DM), Chamoli, explained the reason behind the digital initiative. “The aim of making the prasad available online is to reach Lord Badrinath’s devotees across the length and breadth of the country. It will also provide a livelihood to women, who are associated with self-help groups (SHGs) amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic,” the DM said. She said about 90 women from 18 SHGs are involved in making the prasad that is being delivered online for devotees, whose visits to the shrine have appreciably gone down because of Covid-19 that has hit the livelihood of a section of Chamoli residents hard.“We are making the prasad available in two forms -- in an attractive jute bag and a beautiful box. Each packet will contain five items, including a coin of Lord Badrinath, holy water of river Saraswati, herbal dhoop (incense stick), Himalayan Damask rose water, and fragrant Badri Tulsi, which is offered to Lord Badrinath. The cost of prasad for the jute bag is Rs 372 and the one in the box is for Rs 322,” said the DM.She said the prasad is available from an outlet near the shrine since last year. “However, the district administration thought of making it available online this year because of the pandemic. The initiative will also help the SHGs to earn a livelihood amid these hard times,” she added. Earlier, the administration of Rudraprayag district, which hosts the Kedarnath shrine, also started the online delivery of Lord Kedarnath’s prasad from July 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/badrinath-shrine-s-prasad-can-now-be-ordered-online-on-amazon/story-fwFfPaluFXn2KQP6wpVmoJ.html

It is also alleged that the above mentioned accused company persons have diverted the funds as per their convenience instead of utilizing them for the purpose for which the credit facilities were obtained,” it said.The document said that the forensic audit of the company’s account showed round-tripping and diversion of funds, opaque functioning and misrepresentation of facts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-son-of-gaursons-chairperson-in-bank-fraud-worth-rs-80-crore/story-kVnBFglLDBpWvljXTANI4O.html

Mufti, the Peoples Democratic Party’s chief, has been held in detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA) since August 5, 2019. The Union territory’s administration has extended her detention by another three months.In a series of tweets, the former Union finance minister questioned how the 61-year-old former chief minister, who he said is a “protected person under security guard round the clock”, can be a threat to public safety.“The extension of the detention of Ms Mehbooba Mufti under PSA is an abuse of law and an assault on the Constitutional rights guaranteed to every citizen,” the former Union minister tweeted.“She rightly rejected the offer to release her on conditions which any self-respecting political leader would refuse. One of the reasons given for her detention — the colour of her party’s flag — was laughable,” he said.He also asked why Mufti cannot speak against the abrogation of Article 370 and whether it was not a “part of the right to free speech”.“I am one of the Counsel appearing in a case in the SC challenging the abrogation of Art 370. If I speak against Art 370 — as I must — is that a threat to public safety? We must collectively raise our voices and demand “FREE MEHBOOBA MUFTI IMMEDIATELY,” he added.The detention order of the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister was scheduled to lapse on August 5. Mufti is among 20-odd political leaders in the Valley who continue to remain under detention.She will continue to remain under detention at her official residence, which had earlier been declared a subsidiary jail, according to the order issued by the home department. A person can be kept under detention for up to two years under PSA.However, People’s Conference chief Sajjad Gani Lone was released in Srinagar.A number of other prominent politicians, including two former chief ministers, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, have also been released from detention. They were arrested in August last year, hours after the Centre proposed the revocation of Article 370, which granted special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and proposed the bifurcation of the state into two Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chidambaram-terms-extension-of-mehbooba-mufti-s-detention-abuse-of-law-calls-for-immediate-release/story-Fzj8w6sWG8OeUPL7UmZ3rM.html

01-08-2020||India||‘No coal mining in Hasdeo Arand’: Coal ministry accepts Chhattisgarh govt proposal||Pralhad Joshi, Union minister for coal and mines, on Friday said the ministry has accepted the proposal of the Chhattisgarh government to exclude five coal blocks in Hasdeo Arand, one of country’s most pristine forest areas, and other bio-diversity-rich areas from commercial mining, but has also acceded to include three new ones in a bid to reduce the country’s coal import bill. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced on June 17 the auction of 41 coal mines for commercial mining by private players following which the Jharkhand government had moved the Supreme Court objecting to the bidding process because the state governments were not consulted. Chhattisgarh government had also objected and asked the coal ministry not to allow the auction of coal blocks which fall under Hasdeo Arand, Lemru elephant reserve and the Mand river catchment area that is a part of the biodiversity-rich forests. On Thursday, Joshi had met Jharkhand government officials and discussed the sticking point about the bidding process. Later, he told media persons that he had requested Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren to reconsider his government’s stand on commercial mining. “We are importing 250 million tonnes of coal every year because of the shortage. The Centre wants to compensate the shortage by opening up coal blocks for commercial mining,” Joshi had said. Soren, however, stuck to his stand and insisted that the Centre should have discussed the issue with state governments. On Friday, Joshi met Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and said that the latter has agreed to replace the five contentious coal blocks with three new ones, which would be added to the list for auction as per the state government’s suggestion. “At present, the total number of coal blocks put on auction in Chhattisgarh for commercial mining shall be seven (instead of nine earlier). Three new coal blocks will also be added to the list,” the minister said. Of the nine coal blocks, five fall under Hasdeo Arand, including Morga -2, Morga (South), Madanpur north, Shyang, and Fathehpur (east). The other four coal blocks are Gare Palema (4/1), Gare Palema (4/7), Shankarpur Bhatgaon (second extension) and Sondhia. On June 20, in a letter to Joshi, Chhattisgarh forest minister Mohammad Akbar had said, “Coal block between Hasdeo Arand and Mand river area also proposed for auction by the Union government … However, recently, there has been an increase in the numbers of wild elephants in the state, which has led to a spike in human-elephant conflict. For providing habitat for wild elephants, 1,995 square kilometres of forest area around Hasdeo river has been declared as Lemru elephant reserve. The process of issuing notification has started,” the state forest minister had said in the letter. Akbar said commercial mining in the area had to be stopped in a bid to ensure human lives are not lost due to man-elephant conflict. Joshi said the meeting with CM Baghel was positive and the commencement of commercial coal mining would usher in a new era of growth and development in Chhattisgarh. “Under commercial coal mining, the state will fetch a minimum of Rs 4,400 crore revenue in one year. It will also create around 60,000 additional employment. Additionally, commercial coal mining will contribute around Rs 25 crore to the various district Mineral Foundation (DMF) funds of the state that can be used for inclusive development of regions surrounding coalfield areas,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-coal-mining-in-hasdeo-arand-coal-ministry-accepts-chhattisgarh-govt-proposal/story-VlyluqQtbv0OPd6hK01h3H.html

And he has zeroed in on India for comparison to make him look good.“Testing wise, we’ve tested almost 60 million people throughout the country, which is about six times more than any other country -- close to six times more than any other country,” Trump said in Florida on Friday, and added for comparison, “If you look at India, they’re at 11 million.”It was not a chance reference, but a part of a concerted narrative from the administration.Follow latest updates om coronavirus here White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany set it up at a briefing earlier in the day: “Indeed, we’ve done more than five- -- 59 million tests; with India at number two, with just about 14 million tests. So quite a difference there.”India has conducted 18,190,382 Covid-19 tests, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research.But the White House pressed ahead with the India comparison. It released a statement just hours before Trump’s remarks, claiming Trump had created “the best Covid-19 testing system in the world”.“We are now averaging 810,000 tests per day, and during July, more than 930,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted in a single day,” the White House statement said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “India has a population more than four times as large as the United States, but has only conducted around one-third of the number of tests.”South Korea is the country cited most often as the gold standard for others to follow the world over, including in the United States, for its aggressive testing and contact tracing that helped it prevent a raging epidemic despite a scary early flare-up. It’s a touch act to follow. As Italy, Spain and France.But President Trump prefers comparisons with India.“As countries go, it is -- as an example, India is up to 11 million tests,” he told reporters at the daily White House briefing on the Covid-19 outbreak that he resumed recently under mounting criticism of his response to the epidemic. “We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people.”Also read: Another one-day spike of over 57,000 Covid-19 cases pushes India’s tally to nearly 1.7 millionLast week on July 23, Trump told reporters at the briefing, “Second in the world is India, which has 1.4 billion people, and they had 12 million tests.” The US, he had said moments before, “broke the 50 million-test mark”.It was India again the day before, on July 22: “Today, we surpassed -- first time -- we surpassed 50 million tests. That’s far more than any country in the world. India is second, we believe. We think -- 1.4 billion people; that’s about 12 million tests. We have 50 million tests.”And then the day before again: “We’re leading the world. And I think the second country at 12 million. We’re -- we’re going to be over 50 million tests. Second country is India with 12 million.”President Trump’s on-and-off engagement with the country’s worst health crisis in 100 years has become a key liability for him as he seeks a second term. Approval for his handling of the epidemic plunged to a new low in an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released Sunday.

The gap between active cases, at 565,103, and recovered cases now stands at 529,271.The surge in numbers came as the country entered the third phase of Unlock from Saturday. Unlock 2.0, in which the government had eased some restrictions after the 68-day hard lockdown, ended on Friday. It was the second of a three-phase plan aimed at lifting restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the infection.The Centre had issued guidelines for the third phase of lifting curbs imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease on Wednesday, announcing that gyms and yoga centres can reopen from August 5, while also removing a night curfew that restricted movement of people outside containment zones.The new guidelines, which came into effect from Saturday, said that a strict lockdown will continue in containment zones – areas that report clusters of the disease – till August 31 and asked authorities to maintain strict perimeter control in such zones.The latest guidelines said that schools, colleges, theatres, swimming pools, metro rail, cinema halls and bars will continue to remain closed. Social, political, religious, sports and entertainment functions and other large congregations will also not be allowed.Data has shown that new hotspots are emerging in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, away from the previous hotbeds of Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu.As on one of the strategies to contain the spread of the pandemic, authorities will start the second serological survey for Covid-19 in Delhi and around 15,000 blood samples—half of which will be from people between the ages of 18 and 49 —will be collected till August 5.The exercise is an epidemiological survey covering a representative population – the number of people, where they reside, their age and gender is meant to reflect the city’s demographics and who the outbreak affects.Globally, there are more than 17.5 million people who have been infected and 678,775 have died so far, according to the coronavirus tracker of Johns Hopkins University.

I pray to God to get him well soon,” the chief minister tweeted. विधायक श्री @pcsharmainc जी के अस्वस्थ होने का समाचार मिला। मैं ईश्वर से उन्हें शीघ्र पूर्ण स्वस्थ करने की प्रार्थना करता हूं।In a series of tweets last week, CM Chouhan urged people not to be afraid of Covid-19. “We should fight it with full confidence,” he said, emphasising the importance of social distancing and other preventive measures like washing hands and wearing masks. He asked people to come forward for testing and report their symptoms at the earliest for timely treatment. “If you have contracted the infected, there is no need to fear, if you show symptoms, do not hide them, report immediately so that the treatment can be started on time. Timely treatment will make you healthy,” he tweeted.Chouhan tested positive for the coronavirus disease last Saturday and has been working remotely, conducting meetings via video conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-pc-sharma-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-C2c5YPScwPUqai2RHckAeN.html

01-08-2020||India||MP govt talks about ban on political programmes, Congress says it wants to target opposition||Congress leaders in Madhya Pradesh said on Friday the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government’s ban on political activities in the state till August 14 was to prevent them from campaigning for the by-polls to the 27 legislative assembly seats.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan directed, according to the state government’s official spokesperson, ministers not to undertake any public tour till August 14. He also asked them to hold meetings only through video conferencing and virtual rallies and at the same time they should not meet more than five people at a time at their homes too. “Saving people’s life is more important than the election. Hence, any public programme should not be organised by public representatives. In case of violation of the guidelines, action will be taken to impose fine and register cases against the violators,” Chouhan said during a review meeting on Thursday night over the coronavirus pandemic through a video conferencing from the hospital, where he is being treated.Narendra Saluja , Congress’ state unit president’s media coordinator, questioned the chief minister’s decision.“Why should the CM talk of a ban on political programmes and action in this regard when there is already a ban on social, religious and political gatherings in the state? Did the CM and other BJP leaders not violate it on many occasions during the Covid situation? Why is he serious about a ban on political functions only after he, three of his ministers and two top BJP leaders were affected by Covid?” Saluja asked.Saluja said the fact was that Chouhan knows that there are by-elections to the 27 assembly constituencies and being a Covid-19 patient he, his three ministerial colleagues and some other BJP leaders including the state BJP president VD Sharma can’t move around as they had been doing before.“Hence, his message to the authorities in the state is to target the Congress if it wants to organise any kind of programme while following all kinds of safety norms against Corona,” he said. Vivek Tankha, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member, said the chief minister’s announcement “was funny”. “In fact, it’s the CM and other BJP leaders who made a mockery of safety norms in all these months. If the government really wants action on violations action must be taken against all those BJP leaders who violated norms in all these months,” Tankha said. “I have been saying from day one that there should be no gathering of any kind in the interest of people of the state. But there have been repeated violations of safety norms through political programmes by the BJP leaders. It not only invited problem for them but it is also responsible for the present alarming Covid situation in the state,” Tankha added. Dr Hitesh Bajpai, a BJP leader, said the Congress was “playing a petty politics over Covid situation”. “It shows their apathy that they see the government’s concern over the situation and its instructions as a means to target the Opposition. Those in the government and the organisation were affected because they have been in the forefront in fighting Covid and protecting people of the state unlike the state Congress president Kamal Nath who has been conspicuous by his absence in his party and in public both,” Bajpai said.The Election Commission is yet to announce the date for the by-polls in the state. Twenty-five of the 27 seats fell vacant following the resignation of Congress legislators, who later joined the BJP.By-polls for 24 assembly constituencies are to be held by September 22 as the law provides for filling the vacancies in the assembly within six months of the seats falling vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-talks-about-ban-on-political-programmes-congress-says-it-wants-to-target-opposition/story-MXalC3tXkwNNd9VxgzEiqO.html
01-08-2020||India||Army won’t take eyes off Ladakh, preps to shop for Siachen-like gear for troops||With Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) dragging its feet on restoring the status quo ante along the 1,597km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh sector, the Indian Army has started preparing for a long winter as it does not want a repeat of April 2020 next year.Top government officials confirmed that the Indian Army has asked its defence attaches posted in embassies in the US, Russia and Europe to identify warm clothes and snow tent manufacturers in case there is a need for emergency purchases.Also read: After Chinese apps and contractors, India puts restrictions on colour TV importsAfter Operation Meghdoot in Siachen in 1984, the Indian Army gets all its requirements fulfilled by local manufacturers with regard to igloos, semi-hemispherical domes, Down parkas, snow goggles, boots and gloves for troops guarding the heights in the western sector.While the Indian Army has matched the Chinese PLA in terms of troop strength and support elements in the Ladakh sector, its commanders totally dismiss reports of induction of over 35,000 troops recently. However, the military commanders are clear that they will have to man positions along the LAC in specific areas to prevent any PLA aggression next year. “After the PLA aggression, we don’t trust the Chinese and fear that they will come back again north of Pangong Tso as summer arrives in 2021,” said a military commander.Although the PLA has disengaged from patrolling points 14 (Galwan), 15-16 (Hot Springs), a smattering of adversary troops are still on forward location at patrolling point 17 A (Gogra) and withdrawal from all contested finger features is a distance away at the Pangong Tso.Also read: ‘Disengagement process along LAC not yet complete’: India rebuts ChinaWith the cold and arid claimate of Ladakh, not much snow is expected in the general area of patrolling points 15, 16 or 17, but the over 17,000 feet Chang La (pass) gets filled with snow and lies en route to defences at Pangong Tso. “In order to cater for winter clothing requirements, we have not only placed orders with domestic manufacturers but also asked troops other than those stationed on Saltoro ridge and Siachen glacier to give up extreme snow clothing. For instance, even troops at Partapur and Thoise are allowed Siachen clothing but the height of the two bases is same as Leh. So in the worst case scenario we will ask Partapur and Thoise troops to give up their down jackets, trousers, gloves, boots and goggles to their fellow jawans being posted up on the occupied Aksai Chin front,” said a second Army commander.The PLA aggression in the Ladakh sector has created so much of mistrust between the two armies that both will keep troops on select locations all along the 3488 km LAC. “The Chinese aggression came despite all talks of peace and tranquility. It is very important on part of both sides to settle the border issue soon as the number of friction points are increasing on the LAC and even a small spark can cause a flare-up, as unlike in the past, the Indian Army is regularly mounting patrols to earmark Indian territory and defend it to the last inch,” said a former Army chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-won-t-take-eyes-off-ladakh-preps-to-shop-for-siachen-like-gear-for-troops/story-Nzb7XPJWsJ2dRqax1A7CQN.html
01-08-2020||India||Will welcome back rebels if party brass forgives them, says Gehlot||Jaipur: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said on Saturday that he would welcome back former deputy chief minister Sachin pilot and other dissident Congress legislators if the party’s high command forgave them. “If the high command forgives them (dissident MLAs), I will hug them. I have no prestige point,” Gehlot said while talking to media outside a Jaisalmer hotel, where the MLAs loyal to him were shifted ahead of the assembly session from August 14. The fissures in the state Congress leadership came to the fore when Pilot and 18 other MLAs rebelled against the Gehlot government in July. The chief minister has accused Pilot of trying to topple the government and alleged that he did nothing substantial as the Rajasthan Congress president in a seven-year tenure. Gehlot, however, has now said that he would do as the party’s brass decides. “The party has given me so much. I have been on many posts -- three times chief minister, state party chief… What all I am doing is to serve people. Whatever the high command decides, I have no objections to it,” the 69-year-old leader said. Stating that the democracy in the country was “under threat”, Gehlot said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was playing a “big game of horse trading”. He urged Prime Minister Nraendra Modi to stop all attempts to topple his elected government. “We have no quarrel with anyone. In a democracy, fights happen over ideology, policies and programmes and not for toppling a government. Modi should get stopped whatever is going on in Rajasthan,” he said. Gehlot said Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat should resign on moral grounds, stating that his involvement in a “conspiracy” to topple the Rajasthan government was now known. Shekhawat’s name was linked to the audio tapes, purportedly of conversations detailing the plot to topple the Gehlot government. The Union minister has denied it was his voice on the audio clips and said he was ready to face any investigation. State BJP chief Satish Poonia rejected Gehlot’s charges and asked him to focuss on his party instead of attacking the BJP. “If they had the numbers [number of MLAs needed to prove majority], this situation would not have arisen and the MLAs would not have been confined to a hotel. They have lost the mandate mentally,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-welcome-back-rebels-if-party-brass-forgives-them-says-gehlot/story-v4Zp1FRYIaz4OoH2IkQ7kN.html
01-08-2020||India||Mapping education inequalities||Earlier this week, the government released the New Education Policy after a gap of 34 years. Among other things the NEP seeks to encourage school education in mother tongue, do away with a Chinese wall between professional and non-professional education and promote an inter-disciplinary approach. An HT analysis of unit level data from a recently released National Statistical Office (NSO) survey on education, which was conducted in 2017-18 shows that these are exactly the fields where India’s education landscape has massive inequalities has been undergoing a lot of churning. This two-part data journalism series seeks to highlight some of these aspects. The first part will highlight that there is a deep aspiration for imparting English medium education to children, access to which continues to remain unequal. It will also highlight how socio-economic hierarchies determine access to professional education. The second part will discuss how share of students getting into professional courses, especially engineering, has fallen in this decade. This according to experts could be a result of their falling utility in the job market. Students from the richest 20% of the society are seventeen times more likely to be studying law than those from the poorest 20%. And a student who does not belong to an other backward class (OBC), scheduled class (SC) or scheduled tribe (ST) is six times more likely to be studying management than a Scheduled Tribe (ST) student in India. Girls are less likely to be getting English medium education than boys, and more women take up humanities than men in India. India’s education landscape is extremely unequal. These inequalities manifest themselves in the form of differences based on caste, class and, in some cases, gender. Those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are more likely to be studying humanities than a professional course. They are also much less likely to have access to English medium education. Differences in geographical location can increase or decrease these inequalities. Stereotyping, however, is of little help in understanding India’s education landscape. For example, the commonly held belief that most Muslims send their children to Madrasas (religious seminaries) and not proper schools is a myth which is not supported by data. These findings are based on an HT analysis of unit level data of a nationally representative survey conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) in 2017-18 and released in July. The data points cited above are in keeping with the larger trend of students from privileged sections of the society, who are more likely to be studying professional courses. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();The socio-economic have-nots also have a much lower likelihood of receiving English medium education. A student who does not belong to an other backward class (OBC), scheduled class (SC) or scheduled tribe (ST) is almost three times more likely to getting English medium education than a Scheduled Caste (SC) student. A student from the top 20% of society is ten times more likely to be studying in an English medium school than someone who belongs to the bottom 20%.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();To be sure, both humanities and non-English medium education are the most common among Indian students. Interestingly, even India’s poorest and socially most deprived parents are doing all they can, including spending beyond their means, to send their children to English-medium schools. The inequality in English-medium education is the lowest at the pre-primary level. For example, the share of students who do not belong to an other backward class (OBC), scheduled class (SC) or scheduled tribe (ST) receiving English-medium education at the pre-primary level is 1.4 times more than the share of SC students. This gap increases to 2.7, 2.9, 2.8 and 2.4 at the primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary level. Similarly, a student from the top 20% of the society is 5.4 times more likely to study in an English-medium school than a student from the bottom 20% at the pre-primary level. At the primary and upper-primary levels, this number increases to 11.6; and to 12.1. At the secondary and higher-secondary levels this ratio is 6.1. Experts describe this as a precarious aspiration. There is a very high aspiration for English-medium education, even among the poorest. This often leads to parents sending their children to low-cost private schools which claim to impart English-medium education. While some government schools such as Kendriya Vidyalayas offer quality education at very low cost, they are difficult to get into. Local government schools are often understaffed and the teachers poorly paid, said Vidya Subramanian, assistant professor at the Centre for Education, Innovation and Research at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. This aspiration is precarious because interruption of incomes often forces poor parents to withdraw their children and put them in government schools, Subramanian added. Overall access to English-medium varies drastically across states. Just 6% students were receiving English medium education in Bihar. This number is 63% in Telangana and 95% in Jammu and Kashmir. Because the survey was done in 2017-18, the report looks at the undivided state of Jammu and Kashmir, which also includes Ladakh. Hindi belt states fare badly on both overall share of English-medium education as well as inter-caste inequality.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Dalit ideologue Chandrabhan Prasad blames the Congress’s politics of “plates over slates” and socialist baggage of anti-English politics for the poor state of English education among Dalits in Hindi belt states. Dalit children are attracted by mid-day meals to go to government schools and miss out on English-medium education, he said. North India’s Dalit and OBC (other backward class) politicians did not pursue right-based politics and only indulged in empty rhetoric off capturing state power. This has not helped the cause of education among Dalits, Prasad added. The NSO data also busts an entrenched stereotype. In 10 out of 20 large states, the number of Muslims attending English-medium schools, expressed as a proportion of all Muslims attending schools is higher than the corresponding proportion for Hindus.The erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim majority state, has the highest prevalence of English medium education in the country. This goes against the popular notion that Muslims primarily send their children to Madrasas rather than modern schools. If a Muslim child is shown as receiving English medium education, he cannot be going to a Madrasa, as they offer education in either Arabic or regional language, said Ather Farouqui, General Secretary of Anjuman Taraqqi Urdu. (This is the first of a two-part data journalism series on inequalities, aspirations and ongoing changes in India’s education landscape. The second part will look at fall in share of students getting into professional courses.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mapping-education-inequalities/story-xhTIlYty7kF7MNqxnOyGtO.html
01-08-2020||India||Spurious liquor kills 41 in Punjab||At least 41 people have died in three districts in Punjab after reportedly drinking spurious liquor over two days, prompting chief minister Amarinder Singh to order a magisterial probe, officials said on Friday.The deaths took place in Punjab’s Amritsar, Batala and Tarn Taran districts since Wednesday night, according to a statement by the government. The youngest of the victims was believed to be in his early twenties and the oldest 80 years old. Among the dead was the husband of a woman who has been arrested for selling the suspect liquor.Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta said the first five fatalities were reported from Mucchal and Tangra villages in Amritsar’s Tarsikka on July 29 night.On Thursday evening, two more people died under suspicious circumstances at Amritsar’s Muchhal village. One person died at Sri Guru Ram Das Hospital in Amritsar after being shifted from Tangra. Later, two more deaths were reported from Mucchal village while another two people died in Batala, also due to the consumption of spurious liquor.On Friday, five people died in Batala, taking the death toll in the city to seven, the DGP said, adding that four fatalities were reported from Tarn Taran.Chief minister Amarinder Singh ordered a magisterial inquiry by the divisional commissioner, Jalandhar, into the deaths.Police have arrested Balwinder Kaur, a resident of Muchhal village, under Section 304 of the IPC (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and under provisions of the Excise Act, the DGP said.The CM has promised strict action against anyone found complicit in the case and directed police to launch a search operation to crack down on any spurious liquor manufacturing unit operating in the state.Gurpreet Singh, 25, of Sach Khand road area in Tarn Taran said, “My father Pyara Singh had gone to drink liquor on Thursday night, but he didn’t return. On Friday morning, we found him lying dead in the ground situated at the Sarhali road. He had drunk illicit liquor due to which he died.”Talking to HT, Rahul, a resident of Kazimori locality said that on Thursday night around 9pm, his uncle Buta Ram came to the house under the influence of liquor. “When we questioned him, my uncle told us that he had taken liquor from a woman and after drinking that liquor his condition is unstable. Within half an hour, my uncle started vomiting and faded. We rushed him to civil hospital, where he died late night,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spurious-liquor-kills-41-in-punjab/story-DyHEddwTsKI6hEsPTgbAJO.html
01-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The numbers are coming in and they are not looking pretty – not that anyone expected them to.The US economy shrank 9.5% in the three months ended June, from the previous three months. On a year-on-year basis, the fall was even sharper – 33%.Germany, the most important country in Europe, saw its economy shrink 10.1% sequentially and 35% year-on-year. For France, the numbers were 13.8% and 19%; and for Spain 18.5% and 22.1%. Italy, which was ravaged by the coronavirus disease (the cause of the fall in all these economies – in case that wasn’t clear), saw its GDP fall by 12.4% in the quarter on a sequential basis, and 17.3% on a year-on-year basis. Overall, the eurozone economy contracted 12.1% sequentially and 15% year-on-year.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe fall has been brutal for some countries – Spain, for instance, finds its economy exactly where it was (in terms of size) in 2002.The US numbers, which show the sharpest fall in 70 years, are the most worrying. They have come against the backdrop of hundreds of billions of dollars of direct fiscal stimulus in the form of payments to individuals and businesses. Without those, the fall would have been sharper. The US is the world’s largest economy and the ripple effect of its poor performance will be felt everywhere. It is unlikely the US economy will recover in the third quarter (the April-June period was the second quarter for the country, as it was for many others that follow the calendar year), given the spike in Covid-19 cases in the country where things seemed to be getting better in May, even June. Since then, though, there has been a spike, with cases rising in states that weren’t badly affected in March and April, and also in those which were among the first to open up after lockdowns. Germany is better off, simply because it seems to have managed the pandemic better (it, too, announced generous fiscal support) and analysts expect the country to stage a so-called V-shaped recovery.All of this was expected – the economic numbers may have not met estimations (which themselves have become very difficult at this time) – and that the coronavirus disease, and the disruption it has wrought on life and work (and not only from lockdowns), would take a toll on the economy was a given. The question is, how soon can an economy get back to its pre-pandemic levels? And the question is, how can a country protect itself from further coronavirus disruptions, which are inevitable?The second is easier to answer: by aggressive testing, tracing, and isolation; by ensuring that everyone wears a mask and practises social distancing; and by prohibiting large gatherings.With adequate fiscal and regulatory support, a country that does this can hope to grow its economy back to pre-pandemic levels soon.Quoting analysts at JP Morgan, The Wall Street Journal reported that Germany’s economy will get there (its pre-pandemic size) by the end of 2021. The US economy, the report added, would still be “around 2.5% smaller at the end of 2021”.India’s GDP numbers for the April-June quarter, its first (the country follows the April-March financial year), are expected at the end of August (although there’s no certainty that the numbers will be released). For two of these months, India was in a hard lockdown, albeit with some exemptions which came progressively through this period. According to the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (100 signifies pre-lockdown level business activity), India ended June with business activity around 30 percentage points below the March-level. And for April and much of May, this gap was actually at least 50 percentage points. That doesn’t bode well for the first quarter GDP.The consensus of economists is that the Indian economy could shrink by at least 5% this year. At constant prices, that will take the economy to pre-2018-19 levels – and the country can ill afford to lose two years (assuming that the economy rebounds sharply in 2021-22, which will be a challenge). The government has announced a plan; it now needs to follow up with direct fiscal support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-qz8qF2n2PDlTvGhg22mE5O.html
01-08-2020||India||SC freezes registration on BS-IV vehicles after noting abnormally high sales during lockdown||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered a freeze on registration of all BS-IV vehicles sold before March 31, after it saw abnormally high sale of vehicles in the days leading up to March 31 when business across the country came to a standstill on account of a nationwide lockdown announced in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federation of Automobile Dealers (FADA) informed the Court that the bulk of purchases were through online sale. Suspecting manipulation of figures, the bench of Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai, and Krishna Murari said, “Sales during lockdown is abnormally high. It appears under the guise of our March 27 order (permitting sale of BS-IV vehicles beyond March 31 to compensate for the lockdown) some fraudulent action has been adopted.” The bench ordered FADA to supply full details of vehicles sold online as well as through showrooms. The matter will now be taken up on August 13. An affidavit filed by the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) added to the Court’s suspicion. The Court had asked the Centre to verify on its E-Vaahan portal, the number of BS-IV vehicles that were sold and registered in the period from March 12-31, 2020. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati informed the Court that as per the figures provided by FADA, a total of 2,25,257 vehicles were sold. On verification it was found 1,45,152 were granted permanent registration while 29,834 vehicles are still awaiting registration. Following the Court’s order, vehicles falling in this category will have to await registration till the next date of Court hearing. Interestingly, data concerning 50,261 vehicles could not be located on the e-Vaahan portal. The Centre contacted the states which are yet to connect on e-Vaahan. These states/UTs include Andhra Pradesh, and few regional transport offices (RTO) in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Andaman Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. Out of the missing data of 50,261, the Centre located the data of 10,324 vehicles in these states/UTs, but there is still no clue about 39,937 vehicles which have been shown as sold by FADA. FADA counsel senior advocate KV Vishwanathan said, “We have received the government affidavit late on Thursday evening. We are still in the process of reconciling figures for which we need time. The members and non-members of FADA had complained that they were unable to log in the data on e-Vaahan on the relevant dates.” The Court was surprised to find a huge volume of BS-IV vehicles sale and registration as recorded in the Centre’s affidavit. According to the MoRTH, between March 12 and March 31, the Vaahan portal recorded sale of 9,56,015 vehicles which included two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial and passenger vehicles. The maximum sale occurred on March 29 (78,525), March 30 (94,054) and March 31 (55,334). The bench observed, “We are worried how sales could be so high during lockdown. How could this be….It appears they have manipulated the data. How could showrooms be open during lockdown?” FADA will have to answer these queries posed by the Court before August 13. Already, the apex court has recalled that part of its March 27 order which allowed sale of BS-IV vehicles beyond March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-freezes-registration-on-bs-iv-vehicles-after-noting-abnormally-high-sales-during-lockdown/story-IwLImWLx5keRbJlWQcDobK.html
01-08-2020||India||At 650k, India closes in on 1 million daily tests target||There were close to 650,000 tests for Covid-19 across India on Thursday and the average number of daily tests in the last week of July is more than twice of what it was in beginning of the month, according to government data and an analysis by HT, suggesting the country was on track to reach the million-tests-a-day threshold. As on Friday, India has had 1.69 million cases of the coronavirus disease that has led to 36,549 deaths, making it the third hardest-hit nation after the United States and Brazil, where 155,000 and 91,000 fatalities have respectively taken place. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia has till now carried out close to 19 million tests but will need to ramp up this process further in order to better detect and head off new outbreaks. India’s per million tests as on July 30 comes to about 14,129, a number that has improved from 6,794 on July 1 but is still among the lowest in the world since it has the world’s second-largest population. The roughly 19 million tests is equivalent to 1.5% of the population. Ramping up testing was among the issues discussed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday during the meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19. “The measures to be taken include revamping the strategy for effective management of containment zones through stricter perimeter control; widespread rapid antigen tests; intensive and rapid door-to-door search…,” said the health minister. Also read: Four Israeli technologies to detect Covid-19 in 30 seconds to be tested in DelhiThe antigen tests the minister referred to has emerged as key to India’s disease surveillance efforts – the test takes at most 30 minutes and costs nearly a fifth of the lab tests, which can take at least a day for results to show but is largely seen to be more reliable. The strategy will be crucial to detect new hot spots that are now believed to be emerging in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh – away from the previous infection hotbeds of Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Sikkim, Telangana, Gujarat, UP and Kerala are among states that have recorded the biggest improvement in weekly testing numbers. Arunachal’s numbers were up 622% while UP’s rose by 257%. On the other hand, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka recorded some of the slowest growth in daily testing. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data suggests the increase has largely been due to antigen tests, which were rolled out on June 14 and now account for 10% of all tests conducted. In the past one month, antigen tests have increased to account for about 25% of the tests performed per day across India.These tests are the only other option besides the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test, which is considered the gold standard to diagnose Covid-19.An antigen is a protein (in this case present on the virus) that induces an immune response in the body in the form of production of antibodies against a disease, and detecting its presence through an antigen-based test determines a present infection.This sort of test has been seen as key to the turnaround in Delhi, where the positivity rate of tests -- the proportion of people who are found positive for the disease from among those tested – dropped from 37% a month ago to about 6%. Changes in positivity rate can indicate whether a city or a state is able to identify all of its cases. But in case of antigen tests, ICMR guidelines say, all symptomatic negative cases have to be confirmed through an rRT-PCR test to rule out a false negative. Virologists and microbiologists say mass testing is the key to identify and isolate those infected so that the disease doesn’t spread. “The way ahead is to test as many people as possible, to be able to track and isolate those people who are infected so that the disease spread is contained. If you isolate them in time, the spread in the community will be curtailed,” said Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, said: “Since positive results are confirmed positives, it will work in picking up cases, even if it is not able to pick up all cases. In areas where the viral load is very high it should work well, and that’s what we want -- that cases are tracked early. RT-PCR is a better test but can’t be deployed on mass scale as it’s not only cumbersome and expensive but also takes much longer. It’s ok to conduct confirmatory negative tests through RT-PCR.”Delhi was the first state to start antigen based Covid-19 testing last month, and other states that have deployed antigen testing in a significant way include Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and some north-eastern states. Antigen testing, however, has not picked up in the private sector. Officials in several hospitals said they do not use it as a first choice because of the need for an rRT-PCR to confirm a negative result.“Might as well do an rRT-PCR test to diagnose a case rather than do a rapid antigen test and confirm it with using an rRT-PCR. It will also mean double the cost for a patient when we can know their Covid status with a single test,” said an administrative official in a prominent private hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-650k-india-closes-in-on-1mn-daily-tests-target/story-ca3yiDCb8Vlept1ffzUNSK.html
01-08-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty booked by ED as politics heats up in Sushant Singh Rajput death case||Politicians across party lines, the police and governments of two states, and a former girlfriend -- all waded into the mystery and controversy surrounding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput on June 14 which has moved on from theories and investigations into how nepotism in Bollywood may have claimed the life of the talented actor to allegations of a criminal conspiracy involving his girlfriend at the time of his death. The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which investigates money laundering and foreign exchange violations, on Friday registered a case against Rhea Chakraborty and some members of her family in connection with the death of Rajput, 34, people familiar with the development said.  The ED case, registered under the prevention of money laundering act (PMLA), is based on a Bihar police FIR filed Tuesday on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father KK Rajput. The officials said that Chakraborty, Rajput’s girlfriend and an actress herself, is likely to be summoned for questioning next week by the ED. Reacting to allegations against her, Chakraborty, 28, issued a video statement on Friday saying: “I have immense faith in God and the judiciary. I believe that I will get justice. Even though a lot of horrible things are being said about me…I refrain from commenting on the advice of my lawyers as the matter is sub-judice. Satyamev Jayate. The truth shall prevail.” The involvement of the ED brings a federal agency into an investigation where the Mumbai and Bihar police are involved. On July 16, Chakraborty demanded that the Central Bureau of Investiation look into the matter, but the Maharashtra government has said there is no need for a CBI probe. In his complaint on Tuesday, Rajput’s father alleged that Chakraborty and her family developed an acquaintance with his son as part of a deliberate conspiracy so that Rhea could establish herself in the film industry, and with an eye on his son’s money. He claimed there were unexplained transfers from his son’s account including a Rs 15 crore transaction. He also alleged that on June 6, less than a week before Rajput was found dead in his house, Chakraborty left with many of his belongings, including his laptop, ATM card and some documents. In his complaint, Rajput’s father also sought to invoke the provisions of the Mental Health Care Act, alleging that the machinations of Chakraborty and her family members caused his son to break down, despite a successful career in films, and ultimately drove him to suicide. Legal experts said that the ED probe is different from that of the police because under PMLA, a person is presumed guilty until he proves his innocence. Dr Sujay Kantawala, senior lawyer who specialises in PMLA cases, said: “When the Bihar police lodged the FIR, the provisions were of Indian Penal Code. Here you are presumed innocent and burden of proof is on prosecution to prove the charge. However, when ED comes in the picture, there is reverse burden of proof.” Kantawala further explained that the accused person is entitled to get a copy of FIR registered by police or CBI, but ED’s ECIR (equivalent to FIR) is not given to the accused. The Mumbai Police is already investigating Rajput’s death. After the Patna police filed its FIR, Chakraborty’s legal team said it would challenge their jurisdiction and filed a plea in the Supreme Court on Wednesday to the effect. The Bihar government said on Friday that it will oppose the petition filed by Chakraborty. Advocate General Lalit Kishore said the state would be represented before the apex court by former Attorney General of India Mukul Rohatgi.He asserted that the matter fell very much within the jurisdiction of the state as the FIR was lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by Rajput’s father who resides in Patna.Kishore also dismissed Chakraborty’s contention that all cases in the matter be shifted to Mumbai and pointed out that the police in the western metropolis has not even lodged an FIR. .“It is the Patna Police which lodged the first FIR in the matter. I wonder how the Mumbai Police intends to investigate a matter without registering a proper case,” he said.On reports of non-cooperation from the Mumbai police with a four-member police team from Patna which is in the metropolis to probe the matter, the advocate general said, “If it is so, it is very unfortunate. It is normal practice for law enforcers to cooperate with visiting police teams from other states.” Among other politicians who jumped into the issue were Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The Lok Janshakti Party founder told PTI that Rajput’s alleged suicide is shrouded in mystery and expressed his anguish at the “lack of progress” in the case and sought a CBI probe. Fadnavis sought an ED probe before the agency said it would investigate the matter. “There is a huge sentiment among the people in the Sushant Singh Rajput case. They feel something is being hidden, new revelations are being made. Hence, people are demanding a CBI probe into it,” he said.The Mumbai police are investigating the Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case and it is expected they will arrive at a conclusion soon, Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil said . The Water Resources Minister also advised everyone against speaking about the private life of the actor. He specifically asked political “leaders from Maharashtra” to stop “tweeting and expressing their opinions about it”.“The (Mumbai) police will investigate the matter on the basis of evidence. We are expecting they will complete the investigation and arrive at a conclusion soon,” Patil said.Asked about the Bihar police conducting a probe in Mumbai in connection with a separate FIR registered in Patna, Patil, a former Maharashtra home minister, said: “The thing is since an FIR was registered there, it will be probed. The Mumbai police will give the information Bihar police want. They (Bihar police) will proceed further if they get any evidence.”Mumbai police have recorded statements of Bollywood personalities including Sanjay Leela Bhansali, film critic Rajeev Masand, actress Sanjana Sanghi, Rhea Chakraborty, casting director Shanoo Sharma, filmmaker Mukesh Chhabra, and Aditya Chopra of Yash Raj Films.The police have so far recorded statements of around 40 people, including those of Rajput’s family and his cook.Rajput’s former girlfriend, TV actor Ankita Lokhande, said the actor had an admirable zest for life and that she cannot believe that he died by suicide.“I can’t comment on Sushant and Rhea’s relationship. I was not there. As for Sushant’s family, I want to take a stand for them. They must have something to prove and show people,” she said in an interview with India Today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-booked-by-ed-as-politics-heats-up-in-sushant-death-case/story-mk6zfMFSZJuxlh4HOjPdhI.html

The penalty amount was Rs 500 for the first-time offence and Rs 1,000 for the subsequent ones.Tripathy, however, did not clarify how the government would keep track of the second and subsequent violations.The government also announced lifting of lockdown in four Covid hotspot districts of Ganjam, Khurda, Cuttack, Japur and Rourkela Municipal Corporation. However, the chief secretary said that congregation at public places will be strictly prohibited. In case of closed spaces, if offices, establishments, market complexes and shops are found violating physical distancing norms, a fine of Rs 10,000 will be imposed and the establishment will be sealed for a week. For further offences, a fine of Rs 10,000 and sealing for one month will be imposed, he said.In marriage functions where social distancing is violated and more than 50 persons are found attending the function, a fine of Rs 10,000 will be imposed.The state’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 31,000-mark on Friday with 1,499 new cases reported in 24 hours. Eight more deaths from the disease took the toll to 177, news agency PTI reported quoting a health department official.The total number of novel coronavirus patients in the state now stands at 31,877.The government said sample collection, isolation and testing would be the norm as the cases continued to increase. The state would add 6 more testing labs at Angul, Puri, Kalahandi, Jharsuguda, Keonjhar and Sundergarh districts from August 1 and at least 20,000 Covid tests will be conducted everyday, Institute of Life Sciences director Ajay Parida said.Of the 20,000 tests, 8,000 will be RT-PCR tests and the remaining 12,000 will be antigen tests, he added. Currently, all the districts have more than 3,000 antigen kits each.However, Odisha Congress chief Niranjan Patnaik on Friday demanded that the state should test at least 25, 000 samples every day to bring the situation under control. “If the government fails to take quick steps to tackle the situation, there is a likelihood of the state witnessing community transmission of novel coronavirus. The Covid-19 situation is really grim in the state,” the PCC chief said. “Discussions should be held with political parties, social organisations and experts to strengthen the battle against the pandemic,” he said.Meanwhile, chief minister Naveen Patnaik inaugurated the third plasma bank at Rourkela on Friday and said the state has collected 70 units of plasma in a fortnight for the treatment of critically ill Covid-19 patients.Patnaik, who inaugurated the plasma bank at Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela through video conferencing, said eight patients have so far been discharged from hospitals in the state after being cured of coronavirus through plasma therapy, PTI reported.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-hikes-fines-for-violation-of-covid-19-guidelines-as-tally-crosses-31-000-mark/story-KfigU5tEjqKHUoxU7Ir3ZL.html
01-08-2020||India||Ensure dues of health staff cleared within a week: SC to govt||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to take steps to ensure that pending salaries of doctors and healthcare workers engaged in Covid-19 duties are cleared within a week. The court’s direction came while hearing an application filed by the United Residents and Doctors Association (URDA) that pointed out instances of healthcare staff being denied wages for coronavirus disease-related relief work in Maharashtra, Punjab, Tripura, Karnataka and Delhi. The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah said, “Appropriate steps in this regard shall be taken by the Central Government to ensure that salaries of doctors and health workers are released.” The court gave Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre, a week’s time to make sure the necessary steps were taken. On June 17, the top court had directed the Centre to issue orders to all states and Union Territories for payment of salaries to doctors and healthcare workers as also for providing suitable quarantine facilities for those who are directly engaged in treatment of Covid-19 patients. Advocate Mithu Jain who filed the application on behalf of the URDA also pointed out that several hospitals were forcing doctors to apply for casual leave against the days they were in mandatory quarantine.“How can that be done. It is compulsory quarantine. It should not be considered as leave,” the apex court bench said. Solicitor General Mehta assured that necessary instruction would be conveyed in this regard and they would be reported to the court by August 10, the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-dues-of-health-staff-cleared-within-a-week-sc-to-govt/story-EIseYKm8a3Rxqm8bL05X2L.html
01-08-2020||India||Differences between Congress young guns, UPA-era ministers widen||The rift between young Congress leaders and UPA-era ministers intensified a day after the former urged the latter to introspect and claimed at a virtual meeting that the UPA government ruined the grand old party’s fortunes, with former minister Manish Tewari alleging sabotage from within and demanding an analysis of the 2019 election, by which time the party had been out of power for five years, but did as badly as it had done in 2014. Tewari, Union information and broadcasting minister in the last two years of the UPA government, said on Twitter: “Was UPA responsible for decline in Fortunes of the Congress in 2014” is a valid question and must be gone into.” Also read: Rajasthan HC sends notices to Speaker, 6 BSP MLAs who joined Congress“Equally valid is was UPA sabotaged from within?” he asked and demanded that “2019 defeat must also be analysed”. The former minister pointed out, that “no charge against the UPA has stood the test of law—6 years on,” referring to the closure and acquittal of all accused in the 2G spectrum allocation case. In another tweet, he emphasised that sabotage started with the CAG’s “fraudulent” report on the so-called 2G scam which pegged a notional loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore and said, “What would be interesting to find out someday is not that the report was fake but who set him (then CAG Vinod Rai) to it?” When contacted, Tewari told HT, “There should be a frank assessment of the UPA years but was finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman lying when she said during her last budget speech that 271 million people had been lifted out of poverty between 2006 and 2016 – eight of which were UPA years?.” Underlining UPA-era schemes such as the RTI, MGNREGA , Right To Education, the Food Security Act and other social security programmes, Tewari said the schemes are used in the present day and are providing food support to 800 million people. “If the young MP doesn’t know all this, then he needs a primer. There is now empirical if not unimpeachable evidence that the UPA was sabotaged from within -- the Vinod Rai 2G report being a classical example,” Tewari added. The “young versus old” debate that has blighted the Congress for long has now acquired larger proportions. A year after the Congress’s second Lok Sabha defeat in a row and marginalisation of two prominent young leaders — Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sachin Pilot — the issue erupted at Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s marathon virtual meeting with the party’s Rajya Sabha MPs on Thursday. Rajiv Satav, a former youth Congress chief, led the charge against the senior leaders such as Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram after they spoke about the need for introspection. According to two leaders present in the meeting, Sibal called for introspection on “why we are not succeeding to send our message” across to the people. Sibal also counted the reasons: inadequate articulation, everybody is on their own, lack of team work, no concentration on particular issues, no ideological depth,and organizational mismatch. He concluded saying, “We are not doing right things.” Satav, next to speak, lashed out at Sibal. “People who are asking for introspect should have introspected much earlier. UPA 2 brought Congress down to 44 MPs,” he said, referring to the party’s tally in the 2014 election. The next attack was launched by the party’s general secretary KC Venugopal, who took on both Sibal and Chidambaram. According to leaders present in the meeting, Venugopal said when Rahul Gandhi says something, some senior leaders dilute it. “If Rahul Gandhi is not the leader, who else is the leader?” he asked, arguing that Rahul always stood up against Narendra Modi on all issues. “But when Rahul Gandhi faces attack, no one backs him.” Chidambaram was the fourth speaker after Sonia Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh and AK Antony. While he criticised the government on all three key issues — Covid management, economic distress and the India-China border standoff — he added that despite the Modi government’s failures, public mood was not turning against it Chidambaram also drew a north versus south India divide and said in southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, people understood and opposed Modi but “our political messaging is not right in the north”. A senior leader claimed that both Sibal and Chidambaram’s intent was not to attack the young leaders but demand more space in the party’s decision-making process. This was reflected in Ahmed Patel’s remarks, when he spoke about giving more chances to leaders who are not members of the Congress Working Committee, to speak on party affairs and national issues. Neither leader is a member of CWC although Chidambaram is a permanent invitee. Sonia started the meeting with a brief reference to Covid, India-China clashes and the economic situation. Manmohan and Antony, too, spoke briefly on general issues before other MPs were asked to speak. Shaktisinh Gohil started the clamour to bring back Rahul Gandhi as the party chief, a sentiment echoed by others. Digvijaya Singh said, “The entire country wants Rahul Gandhi as Congress president.” Abhishek Manu Singhvi endorsed Gohil’s demand and spoke about how the BJP murdered democratic institutions and suggested that pro-Modi media be “named and shamed”. While Sibal, Chidambaram and Satav refused to comment, a senior party leader who heard them at the meeting said the resentment was a reflection of UPA-era ministers feeling left out of decision-making. “They want to be involved and Mrs Gandhi acknowledged that.” However, another MP felt that the rift between the two factions was now too wide to bridge. Chidambaram insisted that due to weaknesses in the organisational structure, the party was unable to highlight the failures of the Modi government in handling the pandemic, economy and China. On the record, the Congress accused the BJP of “unleashing propaganda” to divert attention from its alleged failures in tackling Covid-19 and China. “We only reply to facts and not fiction. The stories about internal rumblings in the Congress and of a fight between old and new guard are a figment of imagination, fiction and a product of BJP’s propaganda factory, merely unleashed in the market to cover their failures in health infrastructure and national security,” party spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill told a virtual news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/differences-between-cong-young-guns-upa-era-ministers-widen/story-csMCz1SvdAdYHLf9Y7PXGP.html
01-08-2020||India||Mehbooba Mufti to stay in detention for 3 months; Lone freed||The Jammu and Kashmir administration extended the detention of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti by three months even as it released People’s Conference chief Sajjad Gani Lone in Srinagar on Friday, a week ahead of the one-year anniversary of the revocation of the troubled region’s special status and its bifurcation.Mufti, who has been held under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) since the early hours of August 5, 2019, is among 20-odd political leaders in the Valley who continue to remain under detention. Two other former chief ministers – Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar – were released on March 13 and March 24.Mufti’s party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), ran a coalition government in the undivided state with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) until the alliance collapsed in June 2018 that prompted the imposition of Governor’s Rule.Principal secretary to J&K home department, Shaleen Kabra, issued an order announcing the extension of Mufti’s detention.‘’In exercise of powers conferred by section 8 (1) a read with clause a of sub section (1) of section 18 of JKPSA 1978, the government hereby directs that the period of detention of Mehbooba Mufti, D/O Mufti Mohammad Sayeed R/O Bijbhera A/P Nowgam Srinagar be extended for further period of three months and she may be lodged in subsidiary jail Fairview Gupkar Road Srinagar,’’ read the order issued on Friday. This is the second time that PSA has been extended in Mufti’s case.Under the PSA, a person can be kept under detention for up to two years.The former CM was arrested on August 5 from her official residence and lodged at Chesmashahi huts. She was moved to a government building close to the MLA hostel, where other detainees were held, in November. In April this year, Mufti was shifted to her official residence at Fairview on Gupkar Road.The PDP condemned the extension of Mufti’s detention. ‘It’s high time the BJP realizes that we as Kashmiris refuse to be trivialized,” the party said.Lone, who was a minister in the PDP-BJP government, was also arrested hours before the Centre stripped J&K of its special status on August 5, 2019 and held at the government house in Church Lane, Sonwar. ‘’Finally 5 days short of a year I have been officially informed that I am a free man. So much has changed. So have I,” Lone tweeted shortly after his release. “Jail was not a new experience. Earlier ones were harsh with usual doses of physical torture. But this was psychologically draining. Much to share hopefully soon,’’ he added.The developments came a week after Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari said he was told by lieutenant governor GC Murmu that the political detainees would be released soon.Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders were detained hours before the central government nullified Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the region, and bifurcated the state into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one.Lone was initially kept at a makeshift jail at Centaur hotel on the banks of the Dal Lake along with several other mainstream leaders before they all were moved to MLA hostel in Srinagar. In February, Lone and PDP leader Waheed Parra were moved to their residences and put under house arrest.Omar Abdullah welcomed Lone’s release. ‘’Good to hear that Sajjad Lone has been released from illegal house arrest. I hope others under similar illegal detention will also be released without any delay,’’ Omar Abdullah tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mufti-to-stay-in-detention-for-3-months-lone-freed/story-BLOHykYZoqGrOcVPvFGjcN.html
01-08-2020||India||Punjab spurious liquor death toll rises to 38, eight bootleggers arrested||The death toll in Punjab’s suspected hooch tragedy has risen to 38 by late Friday evening and the Punjab Police has arrested seven more bootleggers from Amritsar Rural, Batala and Tarn Taran districts in over 40 raids conducted by five teams led by senior officers on Friday.With these arrests, the total number of persons apprehended so far in the spurious liquor deaths case has gone up to eight, including Balwinder Kaur, who was arrested last night from Muchhal village.DGP Dinkar Gupta said a huge quantity of spurious liquor, drums, storage cans etc have been recovered from the accused and the same have been sent for chemical analysis to check for constituents of spurious liquor. More arrests are likely, he said, adding that raids were continuing and the police teams would continue to crack down on all those involved in the case to unravel the extend of the spurious liquor mafia operating in the region.While Balwinder Kaur and Mithu were arrested from Amritsar Rural district, two persons identified as Darshan Rani and Rajan were nabbed from Batala district. Four others, namely Kashmir Singh, Angrez Singh, Amarjit and Baljit, have been arrested from Tarn Taran.Also Read: Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh orders probe into 21 suspected spurious liquor deathsAn FIR has been registered under sections 304/307/120 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Police Station Sadar Tarn Taran against the four accused arrested from the district, said the DGP, adding that the bootleggers had admitted to supplying spurious liquor in village Norangabad. Mithu, who was arrested from village Jasso Nangal today, has also admitted to his role in the supply of spurious liquor, said the DGP.As of Friday evening, 10 persons had died of spurious liquor consumption in Amritsar Rural, nine in Batala and 19 in Tarn Taran. The death toll could rise further as the spurious liquor network was evidently spread across many areas, said the DGP, adding that questioning of the arrested accused was expected to lead to further arrests in the case.Also Read: RMOs on covid duty, pharmacy officers’ strike hit healthcare services in rural PunjabPunjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has already ordered a magisterial inquiry by divisional commissioner Jalandhar into the hooch tragedy.

01-08-2020||India||India showed will, capability to stand up to China: US official||India showed “will and capability to stand up to China” in the recent border conflict, Lisa Curtis, senior director for South and Central Asia, US National Security Council, has said. The rest of the Indo-Pacific countries are “watching this carefully” and have been “encouraged by India’s resolve”. Curtis said this during a Brookings Institution webinar on Wednesday assessing China’s growing regional influence. India, she noted, “played the economic card” by banning Chinese apps and putting a hold on Chinese investments.“Thankfully,” she said, we are “beginning to see disengagement of forces. But the “pressure that China put on India on the Line of Actual Control” will have a long-term impact on how India views China and will “change the dynamics between the two.” An experienced South Asia hand who has served the US government in both India and Pakistan, Curtis said, “Few countries are more familiar with China’s malign influence than India.”China’s “recent aggressive stance [in Ladakh] fits with the larger pattern of Chinese aggressiveness in other parts of the world”, she said. Twenty-five years ago China did not take India seriously, she said. India was seen as “inward-looking and lagging in its economic indicators.” Fifteen years ago, as India’s growth and military capabilities began taking off, there was a line of thinking that India and China would work together and “usher in a new Asian century.” From about 2010 or so, differences over the long standing border dispute re-emerged and each side became “uncomfortable” with the rise of the other. China’s influence in India’s neighbourhood, such as in Sri Lanka and Nepal, moved from economic to “more and more interference in domestic politics.” Curtis said China’s influence in South Asia had grown significantly over the past 20 years. And Beijing’s actions were causing blowback. The Maldivian people had “pushed back” attempts by former president, Mohammed Yameen, to make his country dependent on Chinese debt by voting him out of office. Yameen had “awarded construction contracts to Chinese companies at inflated prices and without transparent bidding, leaving the Maldivian people with enormous debt.” After discussing US attempts to roll back Chinese influence in Central Asia, Curtis mentioned Pakistan at the end of her written comments. “Nowhere in South and Central Asia has Chinese influence been more invasive than in Pakistan.” The $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was neither aid nor an equity investment of the kind that had propelled China’s own growth. CPEC is being financed through sovereign debt — which means the “risks are borne by the Pakistani people and the benefits accrue to China.” However, she cited Beijing and Washington’s common support for an end to violence in Afghanistan as evidence the two countries could work together and stressed the US had “deep and abiding respect for the Chinese people.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-showed-will-capability-to-stand-up-to-china-us-official/story-sIOu9esntDyLEThewPybkM.html
01-08-2020||India||Rafale jets touch down amid fanfare in Ambala||Ending the Indian Air Force’s wait for new fighter jets to sharpen its combat potential, five Rafales of the 36 ordered by the IAF landed at the Ambala airbase on Wednesday, with their pilots arriving home to a heroes’ welcome after completing a two-leg flight covering 8,500km from France with a stopover at the Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi.The jets have come at a time when India and China are locked in border tensions in eastern Ladakh. Shortly after they landed, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the new fighters would enhance the IAF’s capabilities and deter any threat to the country. He also said those who want to threaten India’s territorial integrity should be worried about the new capability.Also read: Moments after Rafale fighter jets land, Rajnath Singh’s veiled warning to China“This aircraft has very good flying performance and its weapons, radar and other sensors and electronic warfare capabilities are amongst the best in the world. Its arrival in India will make the IAF much stronger to deter any threat that may be posed to our country,” Singh said in series of tweets on the Rafale jets.The Rafales will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the air force and prove to be a game changer with their advanced weaponry, high-tech sensors, superior radar for detection and tracking of targets and ability to carry an impressive payload, experts previously told Hindustan Times.The arrival of the Rafales is just the beginning of their operational journey, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “The IAF will now accelerate bringing the Rafale into its offensive architecture in the shortest possible time,” he said.Two IAF Sukhoi-30s joined the arrow formation of the five Rafales after they entered Indian airspace in the western sector and escorted the fighter jets to their home base where the planes were given a water salute in time-honoured aviation tradition.In another tweet that possibly targeted China and internal critics of the Rafale deal, Singh said if anyone should be worried or be critical about the IAF’s new capability, it should be those who want to threaten India’s territorial integrity. Singh said the jets would revolutionise the capabilities of the IAF.The deal for the warplanes became controversial over allegations of corruption levelled by the Congress in the run up to the 2019 general elections, though the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government rejected the charge. The NDA government’s decision to buy 36 Rafales was announced in April 2015, with the deal signed a little more than a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited using parts imported from France. A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit tabled in February last year concluded that the new deal was 2.86% cheaper than the price negotiated by the UPA government. It did not disclose pricing details.The Rafales will be a part of the IAF’s No. 17 Squadron, which is also known as the “Golden Arrows”. The aircrew that brought the Rafales to India was headed by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, a decorated fighter pilot, who is the commanding officer of the No. 17 Squadron. Indian destroyer INS Kolkata, deployed in the Western Arabian Sea, made radio contact with Singh (Arrow leader), with the captain of the warship welcoming the Rafales to Indian Ocean. Singh responded by saying, “Many thanks. Most reassuring to have an Indian warship guarding the seas.”In the brief conversation, the commanding officer of INS Kolkata said: “May you touch the sky with glory. Happy landings.” Singh replied: “Wish you fair winds. Happy hunting. Over and out.”The aircraft covered a distance of nearly 8,500km from France to India. “The first stage of the flight covered a distance of 5,800km in seven and a half hours (from Merignac to Al Dhafra). The second stage of the flight covering over 2,700km was carried out with air-to-air refuelling by IAF tanker,” the IAF said in a statement.While the French air force refuelled the fighters — three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft — using its Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft on their way to Al Dhafra, aerial refuelling support was provided by the IAF’s Russian Ilyushin-78 refuellers for the second leg of the journey from Al Dhafra to Ambala.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and senior air force officials welcomed the Rafales and the pilots at Ambala. The first Rafale’s RB-001 tail number denotes the initials of the IAF chief: Rakesh Bhadauria. He led the complex negotiations for the Rafale deal.The new fighters — the first imported jets to be inducted into the IAF in 23 years after the Russian Sukhoi-30 jets entered service in June 1997 — will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of IAF, which has for long planned to update its fighter jet force. The jets -- the first of the 36 Rafale jets purchased from French firm Dassault in a government-to-government deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 -- have been specially tailored for IAF.The Rafale will be armed with Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles and Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles --- weapons that will allow fighter pilots to attack air and ground targets from standoff ranges and fill a significant capability gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-jets-touch-down-amid-fanfare-in-ambala/story-9tNUyTJbjlghbGKx06lAVK.html
01-08-2020||Today's||For WTO, it is now or never | Opinion||It is no secret that this is crunch time for the World Trade Organization (WTO). Those of us who were closely associated with the Uruguay round negotiations and were fortunate enough to be present in Marrakesh in 1994, knew we were involved in a remarkable diplomatic endeavour. A truly multilateral organisation based on the universally acclaimed principle of non-discrimination (MFN) was borne with a balance of rights and obligations for all its members, regardless of whether it was the omnipotent United States of America or indeed the tiny state of Antigua and Barbuda. Most importantly, a robust dispute settlement mechanism was built into WTO whereby the powerful and the weak, in substantially equal measure, could get redress.How then did the WTO come to such a pass today? Well, for one thing, it became a victim of its own success. With a whopping near-universal membership of 164 countries, big, small and all sizes in-between, the organisation simply turned unwieldy. It became increasingly impossible to negotiate one common trade rule on the basis of the consensus that applied equally to all WTO members. Second, crucial mistakes were made by all concerned, especially the more powerful players. Some wanted an ever-expanding negotiating agenda; others wanted to bury the Doha round of negotiations so painstakingly agreed by the WTO membership in the post-9/11 scenario. Even developing and least developed countries cannot be absolved of all blame; they resisted, sometimes illogically, all forward movement in negotiations and were obsessively consumed by the injustice (both perceived and real) meted out to them in the Uruguay round. All in all, it was a recipe for collective disaster. And when the US, the most powerful player of them all, felt aggrieved and decided to act out, it was pretty much game over for WTO.There is little doubt that WTO is needed more than ever now when the Covid-19 has wrought havoc with global trade. So, how does WTO reinvent itself? The following is a broad road map and maybe worth a try.(1) The WTO membership must decide expeditiously on the new director general. There are times in the past when this issue has dragged on indefinitely, debilitating the organisation. The main function of the director general is “consensus-building” on the basis of equity towards all members. The main quality required is “political gravitas” since she can be sure to get as much technical expertise as necessary once in the job. Fortunately, the chairperson of the General Council is New Zealand ambassador David Walker, a highly respected trade diplomat with integrity who can be expected to do the job of selecting a DG with efficiency.(2) The US simply has to be brought on board WTO, for it makes no sense to keep the most powerful player out. This does not mean giving in to all American demands, but some of them do make sense. If this means waiting till the American elections are over, so be it, but this judgement call must be made by the main players of WTO.(3) WTO has three primary functions: one, to act as a forum for negotiations; two, to administer and monitor existing trade agreements; and three, to provide an effective mechanism for resolving trade disputes. There is simply no way the first two functions be performed if the third one is ineffective. Today, the dispute settlement mechanism, previously considered the jewel in the crown of WTO, is dysfunctional. This needs to be set right. Again, the US has to be co-opted, since it nursed the main grievance with respect to the erstwhile Appellate Body.(4) The next ministerial conference is scheduled to take place in June 2021 and it would be okay if the main aim was to conclude the negotiations on fisheries subsidies by then. That would give enough time for the new DG and the membership to deliver on time.(5) It is clear that WTO, one way or the other, has to reckon with China and its trade practices. This is not just because China is one of the most important players in WTO today, but also because a number of countries do want the body to clarify issues such as the role of state-owned enterprises, forced tech transfer and non-market economies. Sooner rather than later, WTO has to address these issues.(6) The real challenge for WTO is the future negotiating agenda in the medium term. What will the agenda comprise of e commerce, investment and services, of course? But what about some other subjects of interest from the Doha agenda to developing and least developed countries, including agriculture, S&D and rules.(7) A final issue: should WTO house plurilateral trade agreements at all? If yes, should they not be open for all countries to join at a later stage and should not the negotiating outcome be made applicable to all on an MFN basis?The above strategy is not infallible, but it would be a good beginning. The post-Covid-19 world needs WTO more than ever if only to provide security and predictability to international trade. But for that to happen, the WTO members must get their act together.(Dr Mohan Kumar is a former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer and retired as the Indian ambassador to France.

01-08-2020||Editorials||A contrasting tale of aid assistance | HT Editorial||India gives assistance but does not take advantage is the message Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to convey at the inauguration of the Mauritius Supreme Court building. Mr Modi underlined that Indian development assistance comes without conditions and is not influenced by political or commercial considerations. While this is a mild exaggeration, there is nonetheless a sharp contrast between the nature of Indian aid and the more rapacious assistance provided by China. This difference, whose core element is transparency regarding the aid project’s finances, is something New Delhi needs to propagate as international aid becomes increasingly strategic in nature.China’s international assistance programme has a black box at its centre. Bribing governments, imposing debt levels that constrain sovereignty, and attaching strings that include military access are par for the course when it comes to Beijing’s assistance. There is also evidence that Beijing’s supposed price advantage is largely mythical, especially if one includes life cycle costs. China has already taken things to the next level. Its Digital Silk Road and similar projects demand the alignment of a recipient country’s standards and rules for data or infrastructure with those of Beijing’s. This gives China a long-term hammerlock on that country’s future.India’s response has to be manifold. One, India needs to introduce an element of rules-setting in its own aid programmes, though legitimate ones drawn from multilateral agencies. Two, it needs to become more cooperative about aid. China does not lack money power. But its aid programmes are no match for the combined funding provided by Japan, the United States, India and other like-minded countries. Three, assistance protocols have become infected by the agendas of non-governmental organisations. This has made projects by multilateral financial institutions nightmarishly difficult to implement. As one African leader noted, it takes five years to do the World Bank’s paperwork to build a road, more time than the Chinese take to survey and build the road. India needs to take the lead in propagating a more streamlined aid process. Finally, New Delhi has made its own assistance increasingly more structured and transparent than it was done in the past. However, it needs to go beyond the normal and begin to hard sell its unique accomplishments such as using biometric identity to better target welfare systems or promoting digital payments through smartphones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-contrasting-tale-of-aid-assistance/story-u671mOPaE93rf4EVff7M1K.html
