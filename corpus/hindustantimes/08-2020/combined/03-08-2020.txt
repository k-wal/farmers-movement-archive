It is the third policy on education after 1968 and 1986, and paves the way for transformational reform. It comes at an opportune time for the country to be able to reap the benefits of its demographic dividend by 2030 and aligns with the move towards a knowledge-based economy.There are five major aspects of the policy that can potentially transform school education: Focus on foundational learning, universal access to pre-primary education, key-stage assessments to measure learning outcomes, integration of technology in education, and an enabling environment for the private school sector.Prioritising foundational learning by Class 3 is a huge step towards addressing a critical gap in children’s ability to read with meaning and solve basic arithmetic problems. These critical gateway skills help students learn more meaningfully in higher classes and enable critical thinking and problem-solving. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in May that a national mission on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) will be launched later this year. This will give an impetus to the policy’s vision of universal acquisition of foundational skills by 2025.To ensure that we are set up for success on achieving FLN, a few things must be taken into account. There has to be clear goal-setting — a common understanding of well-defined indicators to measure foundational skills such as word recognition and oral reading fluency (ORF). For instance, Peru uses ORF as a learning indicator for literacy, and it is clearly understood by all stakeholders: Students have to fluently read 60 words-per-minute by the end of Class 2 and 90 words-per-minute by the end of Class 3. The government should consider adopting a similar model. Spreading awareness about the importance of FLN such that the community, especially parents, are mobilised to proactively participate in their children’s learning journey too will be a key contributing factor to the mission’s success. Here, it is important to ask how the government intends to ensure that private school students do not get left behind in pursuing the FLN mission.Pre-primary schooling in the early years of a child is the building block to acquiring FLN skills. The policy’s emphasis on ensuring school readiness and making pre-primary education accessible to every child is welcome. The curricular and pedagogical structure has been reconfigured from 10+2 to 5+3+3+4 to take young children into the schooling fold. Children between three-eight years of age will be part of the foundational stage, eight-11 years will undertake preparatory schooling, 11-14 years will attend middle school, and 14-18 will attend secondary classes. The new framework accounts for a child’s growth trajectory in terms of her cognitive and psycho-social development.The policy also calls for the creation of a Performance Assessment Review and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development (PARAKH), a national-level assessment centre that will set the standards, norms and guidelines for student evaluations across school boards. This is an important provision given that large-scale learning assessments are increasingly being used as an important marker for progress made by India’s education system. While Niti Aayog and the ministry of human resource development use it to rank states based on learning outcomes, multilateral organisations like the World Bank and Unesco use it for global benchmarking.Another win is that key-stage assessments will be held for students in Classes 3, 5, and 8 with a focus on learning outcomes. This encourages analytical thinking, moves away from rote learning, and opens up a window for remediation for students who might need additional help. These key-stage assessments will also become an indicator for parents to measure and compare learning across schools. This is an especially important move since in the absence of such an indicator, parents wanting to enrol children in private schools have thus far chosen schools based on proxies for learning such as “school infrastructure” or “English medium”. Reformed board examinations for Classes 10 and 12 with low stakes, and based on conceptual understanding and experiential learning is also an important reform. Education Technology (EdTech) can help children learn at their own pace, a compelling factor given that learning levels of students vary significantly within each class. Establishing the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), as suggested in the policy, can drive the adoption, implementation, and use of EdTech in schools and homes alike. The key to driving the uptake of EdTech will lie in developing contextually appropriate solutions in vernacular languages that are also cost-effective.Another important provision in the policy is the assessment and accreditation of private schools. Nearly one in two children attends private schools in India because their parents believe that these will provide a better learning environment. But learning levels require urgent attention. This particular provision will perhaps help in easing regulations and create an enabling environment for private schools so that they can focus on improving student learning. We should consider bringing the private school sector into the formal economy; with 120 million enrolled students, it deserves more support.Today’s primary school students will join India’s workforce in 2030, and the policy can play a huge role in making them productive and empowered citizens. Successful implementation of the FLN mission has the potential to make India an economic powerhouse. But efficient implementation in states will be crucial to achieving the goals and targets. The Centre, state governments, philanthropists, non-profit as well as for-profit organisations working in the sector, educators, and parents must all work together.

03-08-2020||News||It is time to strengthen the anti-defection law | Opinion||The pell-mell in the Congress’ legislative arm in Rajasthan has again brought into focus the vulnerabilities of the anti-defection law. There have been suggestions that the 1985 amendment, which inducted the 10th Schedule in the Constitution, has ceased to be the antidote to the malaise for which it was designed. The past decades have seen numerous circumventions of its provisions to topple regimes through desertions from elected legislatures.As opposed to copybook defections — which are punishable with the loss of House membership — desertions have become the norm. Riding allegedly on the exchange of monies and promises of official positions, they are typified by resignations to bring down the effective strength of the House. That gives ascendance to parties with the wherewithal to lure turncoats. The slipway serves well the legislators willing to be poached. It saves them the ignominy of being divested of membership which inevitably would be their fate for defying the party whip under the 10th Schedule. Such desertions-resignations are also useful because there’s no bar on the deserters returning to the same legislature in the bypolls to vacancies caused by their exit.Such manoeuvrings can only be stalled legislatively. If the stakeholders, especially political parties represented in Parliament, are serious about stemming the rot, they should bring about a consensual amendment to the law to block all routes for the renegade members’ re-election to the same House. A six-year time-bar for contesting elections, as is the case with those guilty of corrupt electoral practices, could be a good deterrent to end circuitous horse-trading.The proffered moratorium may appear too harsh. But it won’t be disproportionate to the magnitude of the offence. Ethically speaking, defections aren’t merely a betrayal of a party or an ideology. They’re a breach of the people’s trust which should be inviolable when the poll-time promise, or pretence, is to serve the electorate.If allowed unhindered, the frequent hijacking of popular mandates could denude our multi-party democracy of its representative character and credibility. The act of the big fish gobbling up the small fish might ensure durable regimes, but not necessarily a diverse society predicated on variegated thought and aspirations. In addition to bolstering the anti-defection law, it will be in order also to read down the omnibus party whips to allow intra-party disagreements on matters other than votes impinging on the viability of regimes. A compact where justice belongs to the stronger is antithetical to all principles of democratic equity. It’s true especially of states with small, easy-to-fracture legislatures. Their record of aaya ram, gaya rams makes them easily malleable entities where tail wags the dog. The point is proved by past instances of defections/desertions in the Northeast, Goa and Haryana. A prime example of it perhaps is the 2006 elevation of an independent legislator, Madhu Koda, as the chief minister of Jharkhand. The tenuous legislative construct of small assemblies is compounded by the preponderance of minuscule parties/pressure groups canvassing ethnic, socio-cultural and sub-regional aspirations. Their obliteration at the altar of political expediency involves the risk of communities losing their voice, getting alienated and dropping out of the national mainstream.In the unitary versus federal tussle, the winner has to be decentralisation of power. A key achievement of the coalition era (1989-2014) at the Centre was the regional parties’ share in governance that helped subdue sub-nationalist, separatist and secessionist tendencies. A testimony to that is the relative peace in the Northeast, Tamil Nadu and Punjab which saw violent movements threatening the country’s integrity.It’s evident then that only a maximal democracy can be optimally interactive. The rule is valid for dispensations at the Centre and in the states; the best platforms for such interactions being the assemblies and Parliament. These sanctum sanctorums that make governments accountable must be preserved the way they are willed by the people.The anti-defection law, as it exists today, permits legislators with two-third strength of their legislature party to break free without losing memberships. It’s this leeway that’s exploited to alter the House arithmetic by balkanising smaller political outfits. The Constitution’s 10th Schedule says: “...the merger of the original political party of a member of a House shall be deemed to have taken place if, and only if, not less than two-thirds of the members of the legislature party concerned have agreed to such merger.” The Schedule’s Para 4 (2) relating to exemption from disqualification only mentions the legislative wing, not the party organisation as a whole.In Rajasthan, the Bahujan Samaj Party has challenged in the high court the “merger” with the Congress of its six legislators constituting more than two-thirds of the party’s strength in the House. It’s for the judiciary now to apply the ratio of the 10th schedule to decide the case — the next hearing of which is scheduled for August 11.Regardless of the court verdict, Parliament must do its bit to buttress the law. For a democracy without Opposition is but a part democracy without choices. vinodsharma@hindustantimes.com The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-is-time-to-strengthen-the-anti-defection-law/story-gEG6DbsWmHpbo8KLtjzUNJ.html
03-08-2020||City||Nearly 82% Covid-19 positive cases covered under contact tracing in Gurugram||Gurugram: The district health department has achieved contact tracing of nearly 82% of Covid-19 positive cases in the city, up from 50% about two weeks ago, according to state government data. Health officials said investigation of positive cases improved in the last two weeks in the district, increasing from 50% to more than the desirable limit of 80%. The overall contact tracing percentage for Haryana is 88%. By August 2, contacts of 7,559 Covid-19 patients were traced in Gurugram while that of 1,700 is yet to be located, the data shows. “Contact tracing has remarkably improved in the last two weeks. It was nearly 50%, which has now exceeded to 82%. It is above the desirable limit of 80%. Thorough contact tracing and testing is a part of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guideline,” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said. The official said the curve had flattened in Gurugram due to aggressive testing and contact tracing. The city on Monday reported 43 positive cases. The total count of confirmed cases is now 9,288, out of which 826 are active and 8,338 have recovered. The Covid-19 death toll stands at 124.Contact tracing, a crucial public health strategy, involves health staff interviewing confirmed Covid-19 positive patients and find out others who have been in contact with them.In case there is a possibility of exposure, the health team asks the contacts to quarantine for almost a week. “In case the patient has symptoms or is a high-risk contact with underlining health conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, then their nasal swabs are taken for the antigen detection test or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Our ASHAs and ANMs reach out to the contacts who have been exposed and give them instructions about the possible symptoms and the measures to be adopted for safety,” said Dr Hardeep Kaur Saluja, medical officer, Primary Health Care Centre, Tigra. According to the district epidemiologist, the situation improved after the team switched from paper forms to mobile applications for collecting details for contact tracing. “The process is streamlined as details of contacts are collected through a mobile application for the department’s internal use. The ground team can directly upload the details of the person who has been in contact with an already infected person. It makes verification process easy as suspected cases can be easily contacted and isolated. It saves time,” said Ram Prakash, epidemiologist, district health department. COMPLETE CONTACT TRACING Others districts such as Sonepat, Fatehabad and Kurukshetra are also conducting more than 80% contact tracing of positive cases. Districts such as Palwal, Panchkula, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sirsa are conducting investigation in nearly 71% -77% of positive Covid-19 cases. Faridabad, Charkhi Dadri and Faridaba are doing 100% contact tracing, according to the state data. Experts, however, question this claim. “Contact tracing helps in early detection of cases. But it is not possible to have 100% contact tracing because there are chances of wrong addresses or delayed sampling. It can maximum exceed up to 95%. Complete contact tracing is possible if there cases are on the lower side,” said Ram Prakash. Lalit Kant, scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, said, “Theoretically, 100% contact tracing is possible but it depends upon the infrastructure available, workforce and the way it is being conducted. It is seen that an infected person can transmit the virus to at least 10 people. If all the suspected cases are covered, then the infectivity curve should flatten. The case load should show stagnation and decline.”Faridabad has the highest number of active cases and Covid-19 death toll. Out of the 9,002 cases there, 1174 are active while 7,694 have recovered. The death count stands at 134. Health officials of Faridabad were unavailable for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nearly-82-covid-19-positive-cases-covered-under-contact-tracing-in-gurugram/story-ONVl1CvwQD9brL6JmtNKhP.html
03-08-2020||Gurugram||25 Bhondsi inmates under scanner for connection with tainted jail official||The police have identified 25 drug peddlers lodged inside Bhondsi Jail to verify their connection with the deputy jail superintendent(DJS) and his son, who were earlier arrested for allegedly smuggling drugs and mobile phones to the jail inmates. The station house officer(SHO) of Bhondsi Jail was also sent to police lines on administrative grounds on Sunday, said the police. The police said that they will start questioning the 25 inmates as they suspect that some of them were regularly in touch with DJS Dharambir Chautala and his son Ravi Chautala. The police said Dharambir was allegedly friendly with the some of the gangsters and was often spotted with them in their barracks. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that their arrest may have scared the criminals as he used to provide support to them. Sangwan said they have received the call details of Chautala’s phone to verify the names to whom calls were made. However, most of the calls were made from WhatsApp, due to which they could not be traced, said the police. Dharambir Chautala was arrested on July 23 for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards to inmates for over the last two years. According to officers, 240 grams of a narcotics substance, called Sulfa, and 11 SIM cards were recovered from his government accommodation inside the jail premises. His son, Ravi Chautala, was arrested from Sirsa on Saturday and charged with sedition for allegedly threatening prison officials. Hewas arrested after he allegedly threatened to “blast Bhondsi Jail” in a purported audio clip, which was widely shared across social media. Earlier, on July 23, the police had also arrested drug peddler Ravi Kumar for supplying Chautala with drugs and mobile phones. While questioning Kumar, it was revealed that drugs and mobile phones were easily available inside Bhondsi Jail at a high price. He also allegedly told the police that an inmate could use a smartphone inside a jail by paying at least ₹50,000 a month. However, no one was allowed to click any pictures or make a video inside the premises to ensure that the identity of the place was not leaked in the public domain, said the police. According to police officials, privy to the matter, there are four barracks inside Bhondsi Jail, where only hardcore criminals are lodged. Access to these barracks have been denied to all the staff. They all are under scanner and the movement of these criminals is being closely monitored. Regular updates are being shared with the superintendent of the jail, said the police. Sangwan said they have also deployed a team of the crime investigation unit at the outskirts of Bhondsi Jail in plain clothes since the arrest of Ravi Chautala. “The safety of officials and inmates are of great importance to us. We are in touch with the jail officials and a PCR van along with three riders have been deployed outside the jail premises for safety and security of the officials. No one is being allowed to loiter in the area outside the jail,” he said. The police said more arrests are likely to take place once they have completed questioning all the suspects involved in the case||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/25-bhondsi-inmates-under-scanner-for-connection-with-tainted-jail-official/story-KdYCNYuDDwZ8Kfm63aZyPM.html

The bands have been distributed on an experimental basis. Officials said the hand bands will be enabled with GPS to help MCG track the movement of its workers. It will also enable workers to log the total number of hours they have worked for, and the locations they covered. If the pilot project is successful, MCG officials said they will distribute hand bands among all its 2,200 sanitation workers, and around 6,000 contractual workers.“Similar trials have been held by various municipal corporations across the country recently. For example, Municipal Corporations in Chandigarh and Nagpur have introduced hand bands in the form of smartwatches to track their sanitation workers. Inspired by them, we wanted to see if hand bands would work in in Gurugram as well. If the pilot project succeeds, then we will distribute the same to all sanitation workers,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The official further said that the tracking system will ensure that all sanitation employees report to work and also carry out the necessary cleaning and sanitizing measures at their designated areas.As per MCG officials, a hand band costs less than Rs 500 and due to its low cost, it can be mass-produced and distributed at a short-notice.The bands were distributed to sanitation workers on the direction of Ashish Singla, medical officer, health wing of MCG. Singla is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 for the MCG.“We are looking at various ways to improve our efficiency, especially as the Covid-19 crisis rages on. We realise that waste collection and proper sanitisation is of utmost importance during this period and hence, we are looking at ways to ensure proper monitoring that can be carried out,” said Singla.Singla added that the first batch of nearly 10 bands have been distributed to sanitation workers engaged in containment zones.“We are prioritising sanitisation and cleaning in those areas where cases of Covid are high in number or have been recently detected. Hence, bands have been accordingly distributed to those workers that are deployed in such areas,” said Singla.Currently, there are 64 containment zones in the city.“There have been instances when MCG sanitation workers have been found to be absent. As a result sanitation and cleaning work have been affected. We have had to call up officials to bring in sanitation workers. Having hand bands will keep workers on their toes and ensure that they arrive for work and execute it properly. Such an initiative was very much needed,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, DLF Phase-1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-municipality-distributes-gps-hand-bands-among-its-sanitation-employees/story-AqRcMlgtAFGKRUDvsyRnwN.html
03-08-2020||Gurugram||Revenue officials booked for illegal registration of properties||Six revenue department officials, who were earlier suspended by the state government for alleged irregularities in registration of property deeds in the Gurugram district, were booked by the police on Saturday for cheating and violating rules of the Haryana Urban Development Act, said the police on Monday. A case has also been registered against a retired revenue department official in connection with the same offence, said the police. The cases against the seven accused were registered under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 10 and 11 of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act 1975 at different police stations of the city on the basis of a complaint filed by the district town planner (enforcement). The officials against whom cases have been registered are Bansi Lal (tehsildar), Sohna; Dalbir Singh Duggal (naib tehsildar), Sohna; Hari Krishan (naib tehsildar), Badshahpur; Jai Prakash (naib tehsildar) Wazirabad; Deshraj Kamboj (naib tehsildar), Gurugram, and Jagdish (naib tehsildar), Manesar, said the police. Additionally, the retired revenue official, who has also been booked in the same case is Om Prakash (naib tehsildar), Qadipur. The cases have been registered at various police stations across the city, namely Sohna city, Sector 10, Shivaji Nagar police station, Sector 56 police station, Badshahpur police station and the Manesar police station, said the police. As per the department of town and country planning (DTCP), an inquiry conducted by the divisional commissioner of Gurugram found that these officials were allegedly engaged in registering property deeds without obtaining no-objection certificates from the town planning body. The complaint submitted to the city police commissioner by district town planner (enforcement), states that as per the letter/email received from financial commissioner of Haryana, the above-mentioned officials have been found to be guilty of violating Section 7A of the Haryana Urban Development Act of 1975 while registering property documents.RS Bhath, district town planner, in-charge of the enforcement wing, said that the complaint was filed after directions were received from the headquarters in Chandigarh. “A complaint was lodged with the police as per the directions received from the headquarters. The DTCP has been raising the issue of illegal registration of properties in Gurugram for the last one year,” said Bhath. Meanwhile, Ramesh Yadav, an RTI activist, who had application regarding these illegal deeds, alleged that over 1,000 such registrations have been carried out during the lockdown. “The police probe will further reveal the violations,” he said. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The cases have been registered and a probe has been initiated as per the law.” Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has also taken a keen interest in the matter. Last Thurday, he had said that officials involved in such illegal registries would not only be suspended but criminal action would also be taken against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/revenue-officials-booked-for-illegal-registration-of-properties/story-oYWwYBOFtNnnp2S6sT93lJ.html

When my son died on June 14, I requested them to take action against named persons. Nothing came of it even after 40 days. Left with no other option, I lodged a case here in Patna,” he said.Patna police swung into action immediately, Singh said. He thanked chief minister Nitish Kumar and state minister Sanjay Jha who came forward to “stand for the truth”.Rejecting Singh’s claim, the Mumbai Police said they did not receive any written complaint about threat to the actor’s life. Shahji Umap, deputy commissioner of police (operations), in a statement said, “KK Singh, father of late Sushant Singh Rajput has released a statement saying that the family had made written complaint to the Bandra police station on February 25. It must be clarified that no written complaint has been addressed to Bandra police station on that date. However, one IPS OP Singh, the brother-in-law of late Sushant Singh Rajput had sent some WhatsApp messages to the then deputy commissioner of police Paramjit Singh Dahiya of zone 9 regarding this matter. The then DCP zone 9 had called OP Singh and requested him that a written complaint is mandatory for any enquiry or action. However, Singh wanted this to be resolved informally, to which the then DCP Zone 9 clearly told him that it was not possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/had-complained-to-mum-cops-in-feb-says-actor-s-father/story-MENXuBv8EOVhQblovJN3ML.html

The college had earlier announced a similar decision for admission to undergraduate courses, along with doing away with the written test component for this year.In a notification issued on Monday, the college said that admissions in postgraduate courses will be “entirely online”.“In order to be considered at St. Stephen’s College the candidate must register using the official St Stephen’s College online application form, clearly indicating their DU Registration Number. At the time of admission and registration, St Stephen’s College will only consider applications of those candidates who have been shortlisted on the basis of merit or entrance exam of the University of Delhi,” the notification read.Explaining the procedure for postgraduation admissions to St Stephen’s, the college’s admission tutor Mahesh Gopalan said, “The candidates are first selected by Delhi University based on merit or the entrance exam results. Then the college conducts interviews of those who applied for admission to St Stephen’s. They are eligible for admission to St Stephen’s only after clearing the interview.”“Given the prevailing situation, the college has decided to switch to online mode for postgraduate admissions as well. The interviews for admissions in all masters courses will be held online. All details will be outlined in the prospectus that will be released in a day or two,” he said.The College offers nine postgraduate courses —MA in Economics, English, History, Philosophy and Sanskrit; and MSc in Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Operational Research.St Stephen’s College is a religious minority institute, has its own process for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses and reserves 50% seats for Christian students.While the college has already started registrations for undergraduate admissions, the application forms for postgraduate courses are yet to be made available on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/st-stephen-s-to-take-online-interviews-for-postgraduate-admissions/story-0UFM4KEA8VGxMRhinBfs8N.html
03-08-2020||Noida||Call centre owner nabbed for routing international calls illegally||The Noida police on Monday arrested the owner of a call centre in Sector 2 for allegedly routing international calls illegally. The police said the 30-year-old suspect had bypassed international subscriber dialling (ISD) licences and the illegal operations at the call centre were causing revenue losses to the department of telecommunications(DoT).The suspect was identified as Sumit Kumar Bisdah, a native of Banda who was living in Laxmi Nagar, Delhi.According to Noida police, DoT officials had given inputs to the Sector 20 police alleging an illegal telecom setup was being operated by the suspect from Sector 2. “The suspect was using a false gateway to route international voice calls to mobile phones directly bypassing ISD licences, thus leading to major revenue losses to the DoT, as he made profits himself. These licenses are issued after following several compliance and the fees can go up to crores,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.The additional DCP added that the suspects was placing calls through voice over internet protocol (VOIP), and these are harder to trace and in turn can become a major national security threat as the callers can’t be identified at all. The call centre was also using more calling channels than they were authorized to, and there were several lapses in their licensing documents, the police said.A raid was conducted at the call centre in a joint operation of the DoT and Noida police on Monday afternoon following which the suspect was arrested. “The employees were unaware the call centre operations were running illegally. So far, role of any other accomplices has not come to the fore, but a probe in the matter is underway and it appears that a huge network was involved,” said Singh.Police officers said the suspect had previously worked with a national telecom service provider and was familiar with the technical know-how of international calling processes. He was also planning to set another unit in Sector 8.The suspect was booked under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Indian Telegraph Act 1885. Multiple laptops, phones, session initiation protocol (SIP) servers and trunks, routers and other electronics were recovered from the spot.Police officers said they are verifying the total revenue losses that might have been incurred in the seven months for which the illegal operation had been going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/call-centre-owner-nabbed-for-routing-international-calls-illegally/story-avZQmwBGbDwoWvigQVhrdI.html
03-08-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad gets ₹5 crore, Noida ₹3 crore as state grant to check Covid-19 spread||The Uttar Pradesh government has issued an order according to which all 75 districts will be provided contingency funds in order to meet the Covid-19 expenses. For the purpose, the districts have been divided into two categories -- A (having population more than 2.5 million) and B (those having population less than 2.5 million). The state finance commission has allotted ₹5 crore for category A districts, while category B districts will get ₹3 crore to check the spread of Covid-19. The Ghaziabad district has been categorised under category A and will receive ₹5 crore, while Gautam Budh Nagar will be given ₹3 crore. The government order mentions that a district level committee, headed by the district magistrate, will take decision about the expenses. The committee will have five other members, including chief medical officer and chief development officer. While Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey could not be reached for comments on the issue, GB Nagar DM Suhas LY said surveillance and sample collection drives in the district will be intensified with the allotment of the additional fund. “This fund can also be used in an emergency if we face a financial crunch with the normal budget. It can also be used for contractual appointments,” he said.The government order has clarified that with the grant, category A district can hire a maximum of 15 vehicles while category B district can hire a maximum of 10 vehicles for the purpose of ferrying staff engaged in surveillance, testing and rapid response, among others. The funds can also be used for purchase of required consumables as well as hiring of manpower on contractual basis, said the government order that was issued on August 1.Overall, the state government has given nod for ₹299 crore to different districts under categories A and B. As many as 37 districts have been put under category A and 38 others under category B.

03-08-2020||City||Decision on syllabus of four courses in DU likely on Thursday||New Delhi: Delhi University (DU) teachers and students will have to wait for a few more days for the third and fifth semester syllabus of four undergraduate courses as the varsity’s syllabi committee could not reach a conclusion on Monday. The university had last year revised the syllabi of 54 undergraduate courses. While the syllabi of other courses were approved by DU’s academic council (AC), that of four courses -- English, Political Science, History and Sociology -- were sent back to their departments for a review after a section of teachers and students raised objections over some topics and termed them as “pro-Left”. The university administration had in July last year formed an oversight committee to address matters related to the revision of courses. While the committee had passed the syllabi of other semesters of these four courses, it is yet to take a call on that of the third and fifth semesters. Maharaj K Pandit, chairperson of the committee said, “During Monday meeting, some members of the committee had some queries and said they needed more time to go through the revised syllabus sent by the departments. So, it was decided to adjourn the meeting till Thursday. We are hoping to take a final call on Thursday.”Teachers and students raised concerns over the further delay as online classes for all continuing year students are scheduled to begin from August 10.Officials in the English, Political Science, History and Sociology departments said it will be difficult for them to chalk out the plan for online classes if the syllabus does not reach the colleges beforehand. A senior official in the English Department said, “We have been constantly writing to the university, requesting them to approve the syllabus so that we can send it to colleges and they can plan their schedule for online classes. Just a few days are left for the session to begin and we are still waiting.”Balaram Pani, dean of colleges and a member of the oversight committee, said, “The committee will approve the syllabus before the session begins.”Sakshi Mishra, a third semester BA (Hons in English) student at Lakshmibai College said, “Our semester had already been delayed by over a month now and if the university takes more time to approve the syllabus, it will get further delayed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/decision-on-syllabus-of-four-courses-in-du-likely-on-thursday/story-kQv27asr5cVeUsMv6CSDtK.html
03-08-2020||Noida||40-year-old man poses as doctor in Greater Noida, arrested||A 40-year-old man was arrested by Noida police Sunday night from a private hospital in Greater Noida for allegedly working as a doctor without a license and issuing fake medical certificates.The suspect was identified as Rakesh Kumar Thakur, a resident of Crossing Republik, who had been posing as a doctor without a license and running the private hospital illegally for the past few years, the police said. The matter had come to light when a complaint was filed against the suspect by a retired colonel.“My son and daughter-in-law were involved in a domestic dispute in 2017. My daughter-in-law had produced a medical certificate signed by Thakur from a private hospital in Sector 68 alleging that she had been assaulted and suffered injuries. My son even went to prison for four months because of the assault allegations as well. However, when we checked with the health department at that time, we found that there was no such registered hospital in that area,” said Colonel (retd) JR Sharma, in his complaint to the police.Sharma said that his family then registered a complaint with the Medical Council of India (MCI), and it was later found that the medico-legal certificate produced in the case was forged.A complaint was then lodged with the police and based on Sharma’s complaint a case was registered at the Phase 3 police station on Sunday against the suspect and his compounder (who worked with him in 2017) under sections 419 (impersonation), 465 (punishment for forgery), 195 (giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment), 196 (using evidence known to be false), 197 (Issuing or signing false certificate) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Indian Medical Council Act.Police officers said that their initial probe found Thakur to be a quack. “ He is not a registered doctor and was arrested from a hospital in Greater Noida which he was running illegally. We checked with the MCI and he was not registered with them. He had also issued a fake medical certificate in an ongoing case,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Ankur Aggarwal.The police said they are identifying other cases wherein the suspect may have issued fake medical certificates. A police officer, who did not wish to be identified, also said that action will also be taken against the woman who used the fake medical documents, and any other persons involved in the issuing of forged certificates.The suspect was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/40-year-old-man-poses-as-doctor-in-greater-noida-arrested/story-sQxwuUYrbrZOGrAZpIzOMO.html
03-08-2020||City||DTU students in a fix as fee deadline ends on Aug 5||New Delhi: Students of Delhi Technological University (DTU) are in a fix as their fee submission deadline for the upcoming academic session ends in just two days, forcing many to appeal for an extension or some kind of relaxation in payment. The students had got a week’s notice on July 29 to submit fees or pay a hefty late charge for any delay.According to the university’s directives, if students are not able to pay their fee by August 5, they will be charged a fine in a staggered way, ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000 for a delay of one week.B.Tech students have to pay their annual fee of Rs 1,90,000 by August 5 while BBA and BA students have to pay Rs 90,000. If they fail to pay up by August 27, they may have their names struck off the university’s rolls.Maheep Bhardwaj, general secretary of DTU students’ association, said, “We got a fee submission notice on July 29, asking us to submit the money by August 5. Out of the five days, three were bank holidays. While the notice is the same as previous years, this year is not the same due to the Covid-19 crisis. So many families lost their jobs or suffered pay cuts. This is why we asked for some concession or at least let students pay their fee in installments. We have also appealed to the government to form a viable solution.”Ram Kumar, a fourth-year student, said he would not be able to pay the fee since his father’s business had “collapsed” during the pandemic. “My family is entirely dependent on the agricultural income of less than Rs 10,000 per month. There should be some extension to help students like me or concession in tuition fees since we are not even using the college infrastructure.”Deepak Pal, a first-generation learner whose father is a gardener, said his family had no source of income for five months since his father wasn’t allowed to enter residential societies. “All our savings were used up in these months and it is not possible for me to pay the fee by August 5. The university should understand this and allow us to pay in installments at least,” said the second-year student.Anup Lather, public relations officer of the university, said that the deadline won’t be extended. “The fee structure was mentioned in the prospectus at the time of the admission and students were aware of the amount as well as the time frame for the payment. While the deadline won’t be extended, the university has always helped students in need. Even last year, we provided assistance through various schemes to marginalised students and around Rs 5 crore was allotted for this purpose. Deserving students can sent an application this year, explaining their circumstances and we will forward it to the committee, which can recommend making some consideration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dtu-students-in-a-fix-as-fee-deadline-ends-on-aug-5/story-kwrQZUgaCkdUfT4ja77JOM.html

The police identified the arrested suspects as Alam Salaam, Razzak Halim, Mohammad Raees, Rubel Sheikh, Sonia Khan, Nazma and Mukta (both single names). Razzak and Rubel are from Bangladesh and their documents will be verified, the police said.The police added the arrested suspects were staying in different areas of Delhi and Loni in Ghaziabad and many of them have criminal records.“About six months ago, some of the gang members were lodged in a jail at Palwal, Haryana where they came in touch with an inmate who tipped them about the Ghaziabad house. The identity of the inmate is being kept secret pending investigation. The suspects then roped in their women relatives for conducting recces of the house and then robbed the house on July 27,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police (SSP).The gang had held 11 family members, including children, hostage at gunpoint for three-and-a-half hours. The family later gave a complaint to the police and also mentioned the suspected role of one of their relatives.“As of now, we have not established any role of their relative. The gang performed the robbery and some of their members are still on the run. We had traced them with the help of information gathered locally, electronic surveillance and other means. The suspect had come to Ghaziabad again on the night of August 2 and their movement came under the radar of the police teams near Lal Kuan,” the SSP added.The police said the gang members gave them a chase, and some of them fled in an autorickshaw and others on a scooty. One of them had opened fire and was hit on the leg in retaliatory fire near Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Park in Kavi Nagar Industrial Area late Sunday night. The man was identified as Alam Salaam who was nabbed along with others, later on, the police said.“We have recovered around 70% of the valuables looted on July 27. The family has also identified some of the robbers who were in the house that day,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).The family said that the recovered jewellery will be identified later on as the owner of the house, Kanchan Sharma, was not in town. “After the arrests were made, we went to the police station and identified one of the robbers. My cousin Kanchan is not in Ghaziabad, and once she comes back will identify the jewellery,” said Rohit Sharma, relative of Kanchan whose house was looted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-foreign-nationals-among-seven-of-gang-arrested-for-armed-robbery-in-ghaziabad/story-antYI4CL8WOMKCnuzRJvoO.html

A countrymade pistol and two cartridges were recovered from him, they said. Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said the volunteer, Devender Kumar Verma, was arrested on Sunday following investigation into a case filed on the businessman’s complaint. The businessman alleged that on July 29 noon, he was at his shop with four-five customers when a man arrived and gave him a white envelope. The man said a bike-borne man had asked him to hand over the envelope. “The businessman found a letter along with a route map inside. The letter said he and his family members will be killed if R5 lakh was not paid within 20-25 minutes at the place mentioned in the map. The businessman informed the police and a case was registered,” the DCP said. Sharma said CCTV footage of areas around the businessman’s shop were examined. “Our efforts led to the identification and arrest of the suspect, Devender Kumar Verma, with a pistol and two bullets,” he said. Verma was arrested on Sunday near the Budhpur drain in outer Delhi after a tip-off regarding his presence in the area, the DCP said.Police said Verma told them he was a close aide and a local informer of Jitender alias Gogi. Since Gogi is in jail, Verma wanted to prove his loyalty by arranging money for him through extortions by using his name to scare victims, the officer said. The Civil Defence is under the Delhi government and Kumar was stationed at the Rohini Sector-18 cluster bus depot.The Delhi government did not respond the queries regarding Verma’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-defence-volunteer-held-for-extortion-bid/story-ahIX6pWfsOhUEzPakphreP.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||Man files fake case to settle a score, held||To settle a score with four men with whom he allegedly fought over giving right of way, a 25-year-old private tutor filed a false complaint at the Alipur police station on Saturday. The tutor alleged that the four men robbed him of ₹5 lakh, and diamond and gold jewellery worth several lakhs of rupees, after involving him in an altercation to make to look like a road rage incident.However, his plan failed and the tutor, identified as Pankaj Lakra, was arrested as his story fell flat when the police checked his movements of that day. They found that he mortgaged the jewellery he claimed the four men stole to a bank the same day. The police also identified and questioned the four men, who told them that it was actually the complainant who impersonated a Delhi Police inspector and thrashed two of them.“We have arrested Lakra on charges of impersonation and filing a fake complaint, and registered a first information report (FIR). Lakra, while driving on the wrong side of the road, fought with the four men and assaulted two of them after claiming to be a police inspector. Lakra filed the false complaint only to take revenge from the four men, whom he did not even know,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma. On Saturday evening, DCP Sharma said the Alipur police received a call regarding a robbery at a traffic signal near Singhola village in Alipur. A police team went there and met the caller, Lakra, who alleged that he was driving his i10 car when four occupants of a Santro car came driving from the wrong side and asked him to stop. Lakra said that when he did not stop and continued driving, the four men took a U-turn and intercepted his car, forcing him to stop.“They fought over giving each other the right of way. Lakra alleged that two of them overpowered him from behind while the other two picked up his bag containing jewellery and ₹5 lakh from the rear seat. They also snatched his gold chain before fleeing,” a police officer said, quoting Lakra’s complaint.A robbery case was registered and the police initially suspected the role of a gang that deliberately picks up a fight with commuters and them robs them. However, when Lakra’s allegations were verified, his cellphone details checked and his movements of the day examined, the police found some contradictions.“His cellphone details revealed that he had already mortgaged the jewellery in a bank before the alleged robbery. Through the Santro’s registration number, we also found the four men whose statement confirmed that they were indeed victims. Accordingly, we interrogated Lakra who broke down and confessed to filing a false case. We arrested him,” said DCP said.Lakra’s car, empty jewellery boxes and two receipts of the mortgaged jewellery were seized, the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-files-fake-case-to-settle-a-score-held/story-caymIud2Uw4tgyUlgrV6vO.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||Provide man accused of being Khalistan sympathiser with copy of FIR: Delhi court||A Delhi court has directed the city police to provide a man with a copy of an FIR registered against him. The man is accused of being a Khalistan sympathiser who, along with others, was planning to execute people and extort others for money in various north Indian states on the directions of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-sponsored Khalistan leaders.On July 30, additional sessions judge Dharmendra Rana said that an accused person is entitled to a copy of the FIR at an earlier stage, even before (s)he moves the court under Section 207 of the CrPC.The court’s order came while hearing a plea moved by Rajkumar alias Lovepreet Singh, also known as Lovely, who was arrested in June for being a Khalistan sympathiser. The police had claimed that he was planning to kill one person who works for Saamna, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, because he had allegedly disrespected the Guru Granth Sahib. The police had also said that he planned to target a Shiv Sena leader in Punjab for similar reasons as well as the Sarpanch of his village.While directing the police to supply the soft copy of the document, the judge cited an earlier Supreme Court judgment and said that a copy of any FIR, unless of a sensitive nature (like a sexual offence), pertaining to insurgency, terrorism, etc is to be uploaded on the police website within 24 hours of registration, and within 48 hours in case of connectivity problems or any other unavoidable difficulty.On June 27, the police’s Special Cell claimed to have busted a module of Sikh separatist group Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF) and arrested three sympathisers. According to the police, at least four persons in Punjab, including a politician, a follower of the jailed chief of a religious cult, and a person who had once slapped jailed Babbar Khalsa militant Jagtar Singh Hawara, were the prime targets of the arrested men.The police had said that Lovely, one of the three arrested persons, worked at a computer repair shop and became inclined towards the Khalistan movement three or four years ago. It said that, in 2017, he met two persons who were part of the 21-member Hawara Committee.“They called him to pro-Khalistan rallies where he met Gurtez Singh of Mansa, Punjab. Gurtez Singh enticed him to join the Khalistan movement under the guidance of Jagtar Singh Hawara and promised to send him to Pakistan for weapons training. Together, they added a few more men to their group,” DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav said.The Special Cell had also said that Lovely was very active on social media and had created a Facebook Page under the name ‘Khalsa Bhindrewalaji’. On this page, he called himself ‘Lovepreet Singh 1984’, and ‘Lovepreet Singh Khalistani’ while sharing several incriminating videos with posters/photos and songs supporting Khalistan leaders and the Khalistan movement, it added.Appearing for the police, additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed opposed the application seeking a copy of the FIR, arguing that the investigation in the matter was at an initial stage and was yet to be completed. He had also contended that the matter required a high level of secrecy in investigation due to which the FIR was not shown in the public domain by the orders of DCP (Special Cell).A senior police officer, who preferred anonymity, said that in cases like these, FIRS are not made public. “However, now that the court has ordered us to, we will give the copy,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/provide-man-accused-of-being-khalistan-sympathiser-with-copy-of-fir-delhi-court/story-mZFz7zYshvZmVjTdQ5L2eP.html

03-08-2020||City||‘Denatured spirit most likely culprit behind killer brew’||Due to curbs during the lockdown and extra vigil on stocks of extra neutral alcohol (ENA), bootleggers seems to have opted for denatured spirit which led to the recent hooch tragedy, excise officials say. The death toll in the hooch tragedy that unfolded last Thursday has gone up to 110. According to an excise official, denatured spirit contains 70-99% ethanol and most often denatured with at least 5-10% methanol and additives. Police said it was still being investigated how the bootleggers were diluting the methanol from the denatured spirit. The liquor available in shops contains only 50-70% of alcohol.Excise officials say despite their best efforts to check smuggling of extra neutral alcohol (ENA), pilferage in small quantity does take place. A top official in the excise department said as the operations of the distilleries came to halt during the lockdown, bootleggers were short of raw material and they seem to have opted for denatured spirit to fill the gap. “Due to fall in quantity of ENA pilferage, bootleggers started using denatured spirit which is used in paint industry and is poisonous,” said an excise department officer who didn’t want to be quoted. The official, however, refused to divulge more saying police investigations were on. There are 14 distilleries in Punjab which produce extra neutral alcohol and ethanol and sell it to liquor manufacturers and petroleum companies. Financial commissioner taxation A Venu Prasad accepted that the administration stepped up the vigil on distilleries and denatured spirit could have led to deaths. “The operations at the distilleries are air tight, our excise inspectors locks every facility in the evening daily and opens the next morning. Even the owners and top managers are not allowed to go inside without permission,” said an officer in the excise department. RECORD SOUGHT FROM DISTILLERIES To rule out possibility of pilferage of ENA from distilleries, the state excise department has summoned record of the two previous months. “We want to make sure that there is no foul play at the level of distilleries,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/denatured-spirit-most-likely-culprit-behind-killer-brew/story-Gb88Plh2055sw9JuiFKRvO.html
03-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad receives ‘missing’ 20,000 RT-PCR test reports from private labs||Ghaziabad The district health department is now in possession of 20,000 ‘missing’ Covid-19 test reports which, officials say, were held up by different private laboratories in Delhi since March. The health officials said that the reports were finally received after they had sent notices for initiating action. According to the officials, all the reports are negative, and the tests were taken up with the help of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. The reports are now being compiled which will be uploaded on the state portal. “The absence of reports came to fore about a fortnight ago when we were searching our records and found that tests conducted by the private labs were low in numbers. Upon inquiring, we found that the specified labs had uploaded only the positive reports of patients. They are supposed to upload all the reports, positive as well as negative, as soon as the test results are received,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “After this we sent notices for lodging FIRs against the erring labs. Thereafter the labs in Delhi who collected samples in Ghaziabad for Covid-19 test started sending the reports which were pending since March. Once the reports get fully uploaded, they will bring up the number of tests conducted through RT-PCR and will also help us reduce our positivity rate by almost 1%,” Dr Gupta added. Till July 31, the Ghaziabad district conducted 105,099 tests for Covid-19. Of these, 61,258 tests were done using the rapid antigen kits. The district’s test positivity rate till July 31 was about 4.69% based on 4,937 Covid-19 cases. The officials said if the pending reports had been timely updated, the positivity rate would have stood at about 3.94% till July 31 and the RT-PCR testing would have gone up to 63,841. According to official records, since June 26 when the district started with rapid antigen test, the health department also conducted about 21,177 RT-PCR tests of patients (till August 1) who were initially detected negative with the rapid test. As per guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research, the testing of symptomatic patients who are found negative in rapid antigen test should be done through RT-PCR. Out of the 16,755 subsequent RT-PCR tests, 933 persons have tested positive while reports of 4,422 are awaited, the officials said. The positivity rate of tests through rapid kits (from June 26 to August 1) is about 2.44% while the positivity rate through RT-PCR during the same period is about 5.56%, the records show. At present, the testing in Ghaziabad is primarily done though rapid antigen kits. “We have decided to ramp up rapid antigen testing, and have given about 400-500 kits each to 10 private hospitals in the district. The hospitals will conduct the rapid tests on their premises, but such tests will be free of cost . In case the hospitals are found charging anything for rapid tests, we will initiate action,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-receives-missing-20-000-rt-pcr-test-reports-from-private-labs/story-oEGfCDcu2QqQzudaIPGcKO.html

However, work on the project has picked pace so that the project can be completed before the deadline, said officials.The underpass is being built at a distance of 19.4 km from the zero-point at Mahamaya flyover in Noida. As per the survey conducted by the Noida authority, around 30,000 motorists will use this underpass once it is ready. The project will benefit the thousands of motorists, who travel between sectors 148 and 150 which are located on two sides of the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.Sector 150 is home to newly-built group housing complexes and dozens of new condominiums are being built in there and neighbouring Sector 151. In the next three or four years, at least 3.5 lakh new families are expected to move into the upcoming housing projects in the two sectors. The authority wants to build this underpass well before its deadline so that the motorists using this stretch do not face any congestion in the future, said officials.Apart from these sectors 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, and other adjoining areas can bring huge traffic inflow in the future in Kondli making the underpass’s utility more important. “This underpass will benefit the thousands of commuters in these sectors. We aim to finish it as early as possible,” Tyagi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-expedites-underpass-work-in-kondli/story-C7FG1I8F550nCp95Vr9VTI.html
03-08-2020||City||Greater Noida: All households will have water meters by March next year||GREATER NOIDA The Greater Noida authority has decided to install water meters at each household by the end of March next year. The move is aimed at checking the wastage of drinking water and collecting the charges on the basis of consumption, officials said, adding that the installation cost will be borne by the consumers.Once the water meters are installed at each house, the authority will change the way it collects charges for the water supply. At present, it collects the water supply charges in fixed rates. After the new system comes into effect, the authority will collect the charges in two components -- fixed and variable. Once the plan is put into effect, it is likely to end up increasing the water supply charges. However, the exact hike in rates will only be decided next year once the meters are installed, the officials said.“We wanted to start collecting water supply charges in fixed and variable beginning April 1 this year, but the project could not be executed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, we plan to start this practice from April 1, 2021, as we will be able to install water meters by then at each household,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.The authority said that in most of the big cities, the water supply charges are collected in the two components.“We want to implement the system, which is common in almost all cities. It will help us contain the leakages and also collect the charges on the basis of consumption of the water supply. The cost of installation of water meter will also be borne by the consumer,” said Bhooshan.In its 117th board meeting held in February this year, the authority had approved a proposal seeking installation of water meters at each household with an aim to stop wastage and also increase revenue. According to the officials, the authority has planned to install ‘smart’ water meters in households, industrial units, schools, colleges and government or private offices in the next two years. The installation work will be done in a phased manner.At present, Greater Noida needs 210 million litres daily (MLD) water for its around 12 lakh population. The Greater Noida authority charges ₹1,284 per year for plots up to 60 square metre (sqm), ₹2,124 for plots from 61 to 120 sqm, ₹3,840 for plots from 120 to 200 sqm, ₹6,372 for plots from 200 sqm to 350 sqm, ₹8,496 for plots from 350 to 500 sqm, ₹12,768 for plots from 500 to 1,000 sqm and ₹14,892 for plots from 1000 to 1100 sqm. Besides, it charges ₹6,372 to ₹13.39 lakh per annum from consumers, who have industrial, institutional, commercial or group housing plots from 1000 sqm to 10 acres. After the 10% hike effective from April 1, 2020, the authority will charge an additional amount of ₹250 to ₹1,500 annually for residential plot size of 120 sqm to 500 sqm. The authority will charge ₹52,500 additional annually from the bulk consumers, who have plot sizes above the 10000 square metres. This annual charge will be divided among consumers living in group housing societies.“We increase water charges annually as per an old order approved in 2013,” said Bhooshan.According to the officials, the authority spends ₹50 crore annually on supplying drinking water, but recovers only ₹10 crore in charges. It has 40,000 consumers in residential areas and 5,000 in industrial, institutional and commercial areas.However, residents are not happy with the 10% hike this year amid the pandemic.“We have demanded that the authority should not increase the water supply charges because many people have lost jobs and suffered a lot due to the pandemic. We have registered our protest against the annual hike,” said Alok Singh, founder member of Active Citizen Team and former vice-president of Sector Alpha-I residents’ welfare association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-all-households-will-have-water-meters-by-march-next-year/story-4w41vIq7GJTVbnpn9Q7A1L.html

Nearly 3,100 litres of lahan (raw material used for making liquor) was recovered on Sunday from Achral Khurd and Marouri villages, notorious for bootlegging, in the Patiala district’s Samana sub-division. On Monday also, the police confiscated 900 litre of lahan and booked five persons with no arrest. The locals alleged that the bootleggers got information about the raids from nearby police stations. “This has become a routine affair. The bootleggers left their houses well before the police conducted raids in the villages. Even as the recoveries are made, the culprits roam freely due to lack of action,” said Marouri sarpanch Gurmeet Singh,.His son Palwinder said the bootleggers openly threatened even panchayat members with dire consequences if they informed police about manufacturing of illicit liquor.Ranjit Singh, a resident of Achral Khurd, said same is the case with their village as the business goes on unabated as the bootleggers enjoy patronage of influential people.Mavi Kala police station in-charge Swaran Singh, under whose jurisdiction Marouri falls, said the accused manage to flee when police conduct raids near the Ghaggar banks every time.“Even their residences were found locked. Even on Sunday, they were present at the spot, but gave the slip to the police team taking advantage of the river,” he said.Superintendent of police Harmeet Singh Hundal said they are keeping close tabs on these villages. “We will not let anyone carry out the illegal activity. The police officers concerned have been directed to take strict action against the accused,” he said.NOT THE FIRST TIMEIn January 2019, two cops posted at the Samana and Mavi Kalan police stations were suspended for allegedly working in connivance with bootleggers.The then SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu had ordered a departmental inquiry against then Samana and Mavi Kalan police station in-charges Narayan Singh and Chhaju Singh for being hand in glove with those into illegal business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bootleggers-operating-on-ghaggar-banks-got-tip-of-raids-beforehand-claim-locals/story-CFMH0kTR8IyMsFrPpytpwN.html

Ministers Balbir Singh Sidhu (health), Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi (sports and youth affairs), Bharat Bhushan Ashu (food and civil supplies) and Sunder Sham Arora (industries) reacted to the criticism by the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and demand of resignation of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who also holds the excise and taxation minister portfolio. “Did you step down when the Guru Granth Sahib was desecrated. The then deputy CM (Sukhbir Badal) didn’t sack his brother-in-law Bikram Singh Majithia from the cabinet despite being in full knowledge of the latter’s dealings with drug peddlers,” said Sidhu in a press release. Rana Sodhi said hooch incidents occurred in 2012 and 2016 in Gurdaspur and Batala during the SAD-BJP tenure. “A recent statement by Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal accusing the Congress government of cover-up to save the skin of the ruling party MLAs is in bad taste and smacks of the eagerness of the Akalis to settle political scores to regain their lost ground,” said Arora. “How come the Akalis developed sudden love for the people of Punjab when they themselves were involved in drug trade,” asked Ashu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-ministers-defend-their-govt-over-hooch-tragedy/story-UQLiGIvS122H3MOKfzcTTL.html

In a statement, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the parroting of old lies indicated that CM Amarinder Singh had become jittery given the scale of the tragedy and only an independent inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court or the CBI would nail the culprits. “The Akali Dal would not rest till justice was done to the victims of the state’s biggest hooch tragedy. No amount of damage control by even the entire cabinet can save the Congressmen who have played with the lives of innocent people by supplying poisonous liquor to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-govt-in-panic-mode-over-hooch-tragedy-sad/story-evmnPd2bQZ8jmSwemf6ScM.html

The Kapurbawdi police had detained Jadhav and two other party members on Friday for staging a protest over non-payment of dues to the nursing staff at Thane’s Covid hospital.“Jadhav’s bail application was rejected; we shall now appeal to the session’s court,” said Rajendra Shirodkar, Jadhav’s lawyer. There was heavy police security outside the court premises as MNS party workers and supporters had gathered in huge numbers in the vicinity. On Friday, he was given two days of police custody, now he has been given judicial custody and hence taken to Taloja prison.Moreover, Jadhav has been given an externment show cause notice for two years on Friday; this is for alleged constant protests during the pandemic. He was given externment notice from five districts including Thane, Palghar, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Raigad.MNS had made allegations against the Thane Municipal Corporation on Sunday. Abhijit Panse, MNS, said, “The company that has been given the responsibility of the Balkum Covid centre is Chembur-based and relatively new. Despite having a rule that three years’ experience in the medical field is mandatory this was not ensured while hiring this company. The PPE kits used within Thane are discarded ones from Mumbai.” They also made allegations that the nursing staff were given transfer orders without payment of dues.Thane Municipal Commissioner responded to these allegations on Monday in a press conference, “We have hired services of a company that is already associated with 20 other hospitals in Mumbai. Covid is a novel virus and it would be difficult to get a company with three years of experience in this field. The PPE kits are freshly made and have been tested by the medical staff at Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa before it was finalized for use. Moreover the nurses were recruited only for Covid duties and hence when their duties were finished they were transferred to other places,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, Commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-mns-chief-avinash-jadhav-s-bail-plea-rejected/story-M0pbtKWdcazcwdzJ9UsxeN.html

With Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh asking the police not to spare anyone, the state police have launched a departmental inquiry against two DSPs and four SHOs suspended for negligence. The magisterial inquiry ordered by the CM is also probing the involvement of all suspects, as well as six police and seven excise and taxation officers who were already suspended. Among the arrests made is Ravinder Singh Anand of Moga.

03-08-2020||City||HC dismisses bail plea of man accused of distilling illicit liquor at home||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed the bail plea of a Tarn Taran resident, accused of distillation of illicit liquor at his home. The FIR against accused Balwinder Singh was registered on July 14 at Khalra police station of the district. Police said they raided his home on a tip-off, but Singh fled away from the scene. The police had recovered nine can-fills of illicit liquor, which is around 535 bottles. Police had also told court that he was habitual of these kind of offences. The petitioner is having five more cases of the same nature against him. The last case before the present FIR was in May 2020 only, the police had told court adding that they required custodial interrogation to unearth the dimensions of the trade and also wanted to recover distillation equipment and other material. Hence, anticipatory bail not be granted to him.The high court dismissed the bail plea taking note of the submission he had fled away from the spot and the police are yet to recover the distillation equipment . If granted protection against arrest, free and fair investigation by the police would be hampered, the court observed also taking note of the fact that there are five more cases of similar nature against him. He had argued that the case against him was fabricated and that nothing was recovered from his premise. He had alleged that illicit liquor was planted as no local resident was joined as a witness during the recovery.The court observed that an accused as a citizen also has a right to life and liberty. However, this right can very well be curtailed in accordance with the procedure established by law. In case of criminal investigation, the normal procedure prescribed for curtailing the right to life and liberty, is that the investigating officer can arrest the accused even without warrant. The court has extraordinary power to protect an innocent person. However, this power has to be exercised by the courts with due circumspection, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-man-accused-of-distilling-illicit-liquor-at-home/story-yvnAUiwqyHhOKpeD5kOpON.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||Festive sales in Old Delhi’s Sadar Bazar get hit by Covid-19 too||No one thought that there would be a time when shops in Asia’s biggest wholesale market would be empty amid the festive time! But that’s what pandemic has done to us - made us experience the unbelievable. The business in Old Delhi’s Sadar Bazar has certainly affected. During Raksha Bandhan, a market that used to be overcrowded had a different look this year. A dip in the sales have been reported by the shopkeepers, who took different routes to manage their losses. Ansh from Ansh Rakhi Bhandar says, “We used to get rakhi from Rajkot and Gujarat every year, but this time neither could we go there nor they came here aur upar se Chinese samaan pe ban lag gaya tha. So, I decided to not sell rakhis this year. Based on the situation in 2021, I will decide my future plans, but right now, we are not focusing on our main business. Our entire focus is on Diwali and we are busy in manufacturing items for it right now.”There are some who were selling rakhis like every year and even managed to convince their customers to visit their shops by assuring that they were taking all the necessary safety precautions. Mahavir Gupta, from a rakhi store in Sadar, says, “We had thought of taking virtual route but it’s not possible. If we made a PDF of rakhis to help our customers choose from home, the PDF would be a never-ending one! If one rakhi costs ₹30, then there are about 40 designs in it; and we sell rakhis from ₹30 to ₹300! That’s why we advised our regular customers to come to the shop taking a cab, and we helped them in every way we could so that they don’t face difficulty in finding a transport back home since Delhi Metro is still not operating.”A lot of shops that were completely shut in Old Delhi. “It’s hard to say who sold rakhi this year and who didn’t because half of the market was shut and half was open. Those who came here, I suggested them to check with the shopkeeper once if they came to shop from a particular shop,” adds Ansh.The whole situation slowed down the sale of rakhi this year and affected the wholesale business badly. Anuj Gupta, a shopkeeper, says, “Due to the pandemic, we didn’t have many new items this year. Also, the number of customers reduced drastically. Most of the people took to buying rakhis online as they were trying to avoid visiting the market, no matter how much we tried to ensure them that we are taking all precautions at our end.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/festive-sales-in-old-delhi-s-sadar-bazar-get-hit-by-covid-19-too/story-sBOnmtp9SkoUgQGSB4lJDN.html

03-08-2020||City||Man dies of suspected overdose, 2 friends booked||A 35-year-old man died of suspected drug overdose in Bhajeri village of Kharar following which his family members lodged a complaint against two of his friends -- Babloo and Guggu. The deceased was identified as Gurdarshan Singh, 35. His wife and five-year-old daughter stay in Australia. Neighbours had taken Gurdarshan to the hospital on Sunday after finding him in an unconscious state but he was declared brought dead. His brother, Gurpreet Singh, who stays in Ambala, said the accused had administered drugs to Gurdarshan and then beaten him to death. He alleged that injury marks were found on Gurdarshan’s legs, which seemed to suggest that he was dragged around on the road.

03-08-2020||Chandigarh||Six more die due to spurious liquor in Punjab; death toll 110||The death toll in the Punjab hooch tragedy rose to 110 with six more people reported dead after drinking spurious liquor, officials said on Monday. Three fatalities were reported from Tarn Taran, two from Gurdaspur’s Batala and one from Amritsar, they said. So far, the maximum 83 deaths have taken place in Tarn Taran district, followed by 14 in Batala and 13 in Amritsar. The tragedy has been unfolding since Wednesday evening in the three districts. Tarn Taran Deputy Commissioner Kulwant Singh said two people are critical while the condition of eight others is stable. Gurdaspur Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ishfaq said one person died on Monday afternoon while another on Sunday. Amritsar Deputy Commissioner G S Khaira said the death toll in Amritsar reached 13 as one more person died on Sunday night. Meanwhile, the Punjab Police arrested 12 more people, including two businessmen, in a crackdown against the illegal liquor trade. So far, police have arrested 37 people in this regard. A manhunt has been launched for eight more accused, including a Ludhiana-based paint shop owner, believed to be a key player in the illegal liquor trade, said Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta. Two Congress MPs on Monday met Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore, seeking a probe by the CBI and ED into the alleged illegal liquor in the state. Attacking their own government in Punjab, Rajya Sabha members Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo claimed that the “liquor mafia” existed in the state and sought immediate action against them. Both MPs said the tragedy was “bound to happen” in the “absence” of timely action by the Congress government against illegal liquor racket. Meanwhile, BJP’s national secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the Congress government in the state, holding it responsible for the tragedy. Chugh sought a probe by a sitting judge of the high court while rejecting the magisterial inquiry ordered by the state government. He also met families of the victims in Batala. Lambasting the state government, the BJP leader said the tragedy has “exposed” the anti-drug drive of the state government. “The government waited for the tragedy to happen rather than taking timely acting against culprits,” he told mediapersons in Batala. Activists of the SAD’s Youth Akali Dal also staged a dharna in Tarn Taran against the government. Led by YAD chief Parambans Singh Romana, they alleged that some Congress MLAs were “patronising the illicit liquor trade”. Romana sought the registration of an FIR against them and said the Shiromani Akali Dal will continue its protest till action was taken against the culprits. “We request the government to take heed or we will be forced to launch an agitation against the legislators as well as the chief minister,” he said. The protesters demanded a compensation of Rs 25 lakh for each of the families of the deceased. Meanwhile, Punjab Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said some “bad elements” got a chance to start the illegal trade of spurious liquor as the attention of police was on the coronavirus situation. However, he said the culprits won’t be spared. Punjab Sports Minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi too ridiculed the SAD for blaming the state government for the hooch tragedy. “It was nothing but pot calling the kettle black as similar incidents had occurred in 2012 and 2016 in Gurdaspur and Batala, respectively, during their regime,” said Sodhi in an official statement. Sodhi said in the Batala case, neither a FIR was registered nor any action taken against the main accused. Sensing the gravity of the matter, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh immediately ordered a magisterial inquiry by a divisional commissioner, who has been asked to submit his report within a month, the minister said. The chief minister had earlier suspended seven excise officials and six policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/six-more-die-due-to-spurious-liquor-in-punjab-death-toll-110/story-s893A45AKnwkLAK5JDIJtI.html
03-08-2020||City||Covid cases mount in Haryana’s Panchkula district||The count of Covid-19 infections has crossed the 700 mark in Haryana’s Panchkula district, with 60 fresh cases surfacing on Monday, in one of the biggest single-day spike yet.The total has reached 710, with 382 (54%) cases still active. The first case in the district was reported on March 20 and the numbers remained low during the lockdown period. It was during the Unlock phase in June that there was a sudden surge in cases with interstate travellers testing positive in large numbers. In fact, within 122 days from March 20 to July 20, only 280 cases were reported. Since July 21, when the biggest surge of 65 was recorded, 430 cases (60%) have been added to the tally in just 14 days, leading to over 150% spike.REASONS APLENTYThe recent spike is being attributed to the spread of the disease in rural belts of the district. On Monday, 19 of the cases were reported from Raipur Rani, 10 from Kalka, four from Hangola village and three from Pinjore. Within Panchkula city, Sector 21 accounted for nine cases, followed by five in Sector 20. The remaining cases were spread across Sectors 9, 10 and 15 besides Mansa Devi Complex, Chandimandir and Maheshpur.“The surge was expected owing to regular influx of people from red zones,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula. “Being a state headquarters for many department offices, Panchkula sees many regular commuters from outside. The district also has training centres of paramilitary forces, which are getting recruits from all states.” It was in the beginning of July that the first positive case was reported among paramilitary forces stationed in Panchkula. Since then, at least 40 personnel of the ITBP and CRPF have tested positive.The Baddi industrial area in Himachal Pradesh which shares border with Panchkula is another hot spot, said Kaur, adding that regular influx of migrants across the border also adds to the number of infections.On initiatives being taken by the health department, she said: “The capacity and number of Covid care centres are being increased. Contact tracing and screening in containment zones has been enhanced. Senior doctors have been given areas to monitor activities on the ground.”Meanwhile, with 326 patients cured so far and two succumbing to the disease, recovery rate and case fatality rate stand at 46% and 0.3%, respectively, in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-cases-mount-in-haryana-s-panchkula-district/story-GTMEsE166qNDrrtdkvJJ8M.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||These corona warriors didn’t celebrate Rakhi with their families, so that we could||While most of us had a blast celebrating Raksha Bandhan, the cops in the city couldn’t get their share of joy. Engaged in their duties all day long, they only focussed on work to ensure that the festival doesn’t end up becoming a bummer for the still prevalent rule of social distancing, and too many people don’t gather in one place. Though most of them havd e received their rakhis via courier and were able to tie the threads from their sisters, but still missed the joy of being with their families. “The festival is virtual this year,” laughs Sanjeev Kumar Vohra, Delhi Police, Head Constable (HC) whose family lives in Himachal Pradesh. “It’s not new for us, we are quite habitual of not celebrating festivals with our families. But, this year we were also scared to visit them. Bas subah WhatsApp call kar lenge aur sabse baat karke waise hi celebrate ho jayega. In fact I haven’t been able to visit my family since past five months, and I miss my kids the most,” adds Vohra.Some of the cops who used to get rakhis tied by their colleagues’ families, feel nostalgic about the sweet gesture that has enabled them to extend their family. “We either tie rakhi to each other and eat sweets together or some school students visit us every year. But this year due to the corona virus, there weren’t any visitors. Families of other policemen who lives in Delhi are also like family to us... Last year one of my colleagues’ daughter tied rakhi on my wrist, and it strengthened my bond with my colleague,” says HC Dharanveer whose family lives in Uttar Pradesh. Another reason that many couldn’t celebrate this festival with their families is the shortage of staff. “Many of my colleagues were corona positive, and we are also prone to the virus since we had maximum exposure to it while on the job. So, since there was less staff on ground, it was difficult to get an off. And to be honest, it gave us immense joy to see others being able to celebrate happily. It felt that we are a part of their celebrations, and so we didn’t mind being away from our families. Duty sabse pehle hai nai ji,” says constable Rajeev Saroha whose family lives in Uttar Pradesh.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/these-corona-warriors-didn-t-celebrate-rakhi-with-their-families-so-that-we-could/story-GmV8bMiNKgPRZe3Yb9FRfI.html

03-08-2020||City||Stricter curbs imposed in Kashmir, markets shut||Restrictions were imposed in the Kashmir valley on Monday, with officials saying that the curbs have been enforced as part of efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. The restrictions come two days ahead of the first anniversary of the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. While officials maintained that restrictions were in view of the pandemic, residents say it has more to do with the completion of one year of the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, last year.Business establishments, markets and shops were closed while public transport remained off the roads in the Valley. The movement of people was strictly regulated and there was heavy development of security forces on roads.Concertina wires and road blocks sealed roads at many places and police were seen asking people in private cars to return. However, government employees and banks have been exempted from the restrictions on producing valid identity cards or movement passes. Construction and developmental activities have also been exempted, officials added. District magistrates said strict implementation of the lockdown restrictions was ordered in view of the spike in the number of coronavirus cases. Security forces have been deployed in strength at several places across the valley to enforce the lockdown, the officials said, adding any violation will invite strict action. Shaeena Akhtar, 42, a resident of Old City, said the severity of restrictions which used to be associated with Covid-19 pandemic suddenly intensified from Monday. She said the security forces on roads were harsher and even manhandled people.“My young daughter who was pillion riding behind a close relative was chased by baton-wielding security men at Hawal. They were really scared,” Akhtar said. “Since August 5 is coming, they are forcing people to stay indoors,” she added.The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Saturday informed that it was extending its Covid-19 lockdown restrictions till August 5. The earlier order had stated that the lockdown will continue till July 31. The administration noted that in the light of escalating virus infections, it was safest to extend lockdown restrictions till August 5. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti said the heightened security arrangements in the valley were being undertaken to ensure that “anger and frustration felt by people” against the Centre’s decision “remain hidden”. She tweeted: “Not like non-discriminatory Covid virus will be more active in the days approaching August 5, so clearly this is being done to ensure that anger and frustration felt by people here remain hidden.”Javaid Khaliq, a netizen said: “Preparations of August 5 and nothing else. It is their only option to hide the situation on ground and pretend everything is ok.”Political analyst Noor Ahmad Baba said the lockdown in Kashmir was different from the rest of the country. “There is an element of politics here. In the name of lockdown due to coronavirus, it is also conveniently used for political motives,” he said.He said there were smarter ways of enforcing lockdown without impacting the economy, which the authorities were not attempting to give a try. “I am certain the lockdown is going to continue because August 5 and August 15 is coming,” he said.Curfew in Srinagar Fearing protests by separatists on August 5, the Srinagar administration on Monday decided to impose a curfew till Wednesday with immediate effect. The Covid-19 restrictions, which were imposed from July 31 till August 5, have been extended upto August 8.Srinagar district magistrate Shahid Chaudhary, in an order, while quoting a report of SSP, stated that Separatists and Pakistan-sponsored groups are planning to observe August 5 as a black day, thereby raising apprehensions of violence. “There are specific inputs about violent protests endangering public life and property,” he said, adding that such gatherings will also be detrimental to the efforts of containing the spread of virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stricter-curbs-imposed-in-kashmir-markets-shut/story-4210BhzQMGVJkcN9oOOadO.html

A team of Bihar Police is in Mumbai to probe the matter.However, the Patna Superintendent of Police (SP) Vinay Tiwari, who is heading a police team from Patna in the case, was quarantined under what the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said was state government guidelines to prevent Covid-19 spread.Earlier today, Bihar Minister Sanjay Jha termed the “forced quarantine” of Tiwari in Mumbai as “shameful and absolutely wrong” and added that the state government will look into the matter and take action in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bjp-mla-raises-sushant-s-death-matter-in-bihar-assembly-demands-cbi-probe/story-w23gtkRfh5bQR0mAhINRQJ.html

Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, the Sikh wing of pro-Hindutva organisation, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), delivered the invitation to the Takht secretariat. The jathedar’s assistants received it from Sanjeev Singh, general secretary of the wing, and his colleagues. The trust plans to ensure the presence of jathedars of all five Sikh Takhts at the event. The invitation carries the name of Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust, and requests the jathedar to reach Ayodhya on August 4 evening. Sanjeev said, “The jathedar is among select personalities from Punjab, who have been invited. We are also organising an Akhand Path of the Guru Granth Sahib at a gurdwara in Ayodhya to offer thanks for the construction of the temple. Its bhog ceremony is on August 7. We want the jathedar sahib to be present on the occasion and address the sangat.”“This temple is a big symbol of Hindu-Sikh unity. We are also taking the holy water of five sarovars (holy tanks of gurdwaras) to Ayodhya for the event,” he added.The jathedar, who is known for his anti-RSS stance, has refused comment. Sources, however, said he would not attend the event in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be present. ENSURE NO SIKH ATTENDS AS COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVE: DAL KHALSA TO JATHEDARSeparatist Sikh body Dal Khalsa has written a letter to the Akal Takht jathedar saying that no Sikh must attend the event as a community representative. The letter from general secretary Parmjit Singh Tanda says, “Sikhs are a third religio-political entity in this sub-continent. They should not become part of any celebrations of one religion at the cost of other’s sentiments, especially in an event that has a history of controversy. For us, keeping cordial relations with both the communities (Hindus and Muslims) on equal grounds is in our quami (community) interests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akal-takht-jathedar-invited-to-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-in-ayodhya/story-MsDaw8DijJ2GCnzkqsiwDM.html

During interrogation, the duo told the police that they had gone to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) for the check-up of their son, when they met a man who asked them to kidnap a child. He allegedly promised to pay them Rs 1 lakh for the job. They claimed that the man did not provide them any number or address but told them that he would meet them at PGIMER.

The man, identified as Sunil Kumar, questioned the couple, who told him that they were taking the child to her father. But since Kumar was familiar with the girl, who lived in the same locality, he got suspicious and raised an alarm.

The success of the farmers in their diversification efforts, even amid the covid-19 pandemic, has also been recognised by the Union ministry of agriculture, the CM said, while reviewing the sowing activities in the state on Monday. This diversification will help save nearly 2.7 billion cubic metre of ground water and about Rs 200 crore in power consumption, thus supporting the Punjab government’s efforts to preserve scarce water resources, added Amarinder Despite migratory labour shortage in the ongoing kharif season, the state has not only completed its sowing but has also continued to fulfil its objective of diversification even in these difficult times, he added. Additional chief secretary (development) Anirudh Tiwari informed the CM that basmati sowing had been completed across 6.5 lakh hectares (16 lakh acre). “It is expected that acreage under basmati will touch about 17.5 lakh acre in Punjab this year. The state government’s concerted push to use Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technology is expected to save both ground water and power consumption,” Tiwari said, adding that the acreage under maize and cotton had also increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/laud-state-s-farmers-for-increased-diversification-capt/story-oCVbJGpmUXcoLjgENldbcM.html

In some cases it was observed that patients needing level-one medical care were also rushing to the private hospital for treatment. So, it was decided to set up a helpdesk at DMCH to direct such patients to government facilities and reserve the ICU beds for patients with severe symptoms.”He added that similar helpdesks will be established at other private hospitals, including Christian Medical College and Hospital and SPS Hospital.The administration came under sharp criticism after the death of a 49-year-old Covid-19 patient Sanjeev Nagapal. Nagpal had died on July 24 after DMCH had referred him to the civil hospital, citing unavailability of beds there.Similar complaints were made by the kin of other Covid-19 patients.The duty roster for the rural medical officers — Dr Manpreet Kaur, Dr Basant Ram, Dr Harpreet Kaur and Dr Dipika Goyal — was also prepared on Monday.As per the orders, these doctors will remain in touch with the DC through telephone and WhatsApp. The rural medical officer will collect all the details of patients and update the officials about the same every day.The district administration has also developed a mobile application that will show the availability of beds at the hospital and the information provided by the doctors will help in updating the app data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-admin-deploys-medical-officers-to-set-up-helpdesk-for-covid-19-patients-at-dmch/story-4q1BFAsJ9SSnIEwdHwjaKI.html

Students who wanted to travel abroad are stuck here due to suspension of commercial international flights. Those who could make it to their destinations abroad are facing various challenges; though US President Donald Trump fortunately withdrew planned visa restrictions that would have forced international students to leave the country if their schools held classes online.In fact, the behaviour of the virus is highly unpredictable, impacting our ability to put effective measures in place to control it. Someone predicted its peak during July-August; but there are others who say the month of September would be crucial. Scientists of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have warned that India will be the worst affected country with 2.87 lakh cases per day by February 2021.With such gloomy predictions of the pandemic, one could question the rationale behind the University Grants Commission (UGC) fixing the final year examination in universities by September end this year.The UGC defended the decision by quoting that top ranking institutes of the world such as University of Cambridge, Princeton, MIT and Imperial College of London have adopted the online mode of examination. But in India the situation is quite different; access to internet connectivity in every part of the country is not the same with many not having the required electronic gadgets to facilitate access to affordable and uninterrupted internet connectivity.This is likely to make situation more complicated instead of solving it. Further, delayed conduct of examination till the end of September will delay the commencement of the following semester, may be till October or November, even if the situation is conducive to conduct the examination. Would that not mean that an academic semester will have to be scrapped? This would be a serious academic deficiency that will delay degrees of the students at least by another six months with an academic year likely to be dropped in some instances.Moreover, the decision of conduct of the examination by September end has not gone well with any section of the society. Students and their patents have protested; several state governments have opposed it and educationists term it a hasty decision given to the unpredictable behaviour of the virus.The chief minister of Punjab has rightly termed the situation in the state totally non-conducive to the conduct of examinations. There are many other states where the situation is worse than Punjab; how could they afford the conduct of any sort of examination?There is another dimension to the current situation in our education system which has not received the required attention of the education providers. Though private institutes had charged full semester fee till May-June from the students, many of these institutes curtailed salaries drastically. Others have not paid salaries since implementation of the lockdown till date. The faculty and staff of these institutes are under great financial stress apart from facing the uncertainty over retaining their jobs. Delaying conduct of the examination till September end and subsequent delayed commencement of the next semester is likely to keep them deprived of their salaries.This is the time when politicians, bureaucrats and technocrats need to put their heads together to find an indigenous solution suited to our requirements, feasibilities and capabilities rather than following the institutes in advanced countries which are far ahead of India in effective curricula delivery and students’ academic evaluation system.The best option in the given situation seems to be promotion of the students based on their previous academic performance. This would end the uncertainty and students who are passing out will be able to focus on future academic endeavours. Further, those continuing education in various teaching programmes should be facilitated to commence the new semester through electronic mode of curricula delivery. Online classes could be continued till the situation improves for on-campus education; something is better than nothing.This is a very unusual situation and sometimes difficult decisions have to be taken. The government should also ensure that no faculty is deprived of salary, particularly by private education providers, for the work done by them from home during the pandemic.The writer is former dean of postgraduate studies at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.

Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said a three-tier surveillance system had been put in place to keep a vigil on people in home-quarantine.He said a 14-day home quarantine was mandatory for people returning from other states. “Those coming from high case load cities are being kept in institutional quarantine,” he said. “However, several incidents of quarantine jumping have been reported from across the district necessitating the new surveillance system,” Prajapati said.At the first level, the sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) will ensure proper identification of people returning from outside the state. A notice will be placed outside the residence of such returnees.Anganwadi workers will pay a visit to ensure that they don’t violate quarantine.In case quarantined persons show flu-like symptoms, the Anganwadi worker will inform the authority concerned.In the second tier, a panel comprising panchayat president, vice-president and ward members will ensure the enforcement of home quarantine.In urban areas the task has been entrusted to panel comprising the tehsildar of the area, an officer nominated by municipal commissioner or executive officers of Municipal Council and Nagar panchayats and the ward members concerned.These committees will submit a daily report to the block development officer or the district revenue officer about the status of quarantined persons.The third level of the surveillance system includes flying squads, which have been formed at block and sub-divisional level to keep vigil on quarantined persons.These squads will carry out surprise checks to ensure that no one jumps the quarantine. If someone is found jumping quarantine, an FIR will be lodged against the offender under different sections of the (IPC) and Disaster Management Act.He said surveillance committees may also face action if they fail to report people returning in their area or the quarantine violators.Members of surveillance committees will follow social distancing norms, use facemasks and sanitisers and avoid touching hard surface or any other object that may cause infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kangra-authorities-tighten-home-quarantine-norms/story-uzGeinlS7wyUq6abIv91FJ.html
03-08-2020||Chandigarh||Denatured spirit mixed with water without following process could have led to Punjab’s worst hooch tragedy||At least 104 people have died after consuming hooch or country-made illicit liquor in the three Majha districts of Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur since July 29. While 80 deaths have been reported from Tarn Taran city and its adjoining villages, Amritsar’s Muchhal village and Gurdaspur’s Batala town have seen 12 deaths each so far. WHAT IS HOOCHHooch is a spurious alcoholic preparation that can be harmful and fatal. Cases of hooch poisoning are common and have been reported from time to time in different parts of India. HOW IT’S MADEIllicit liquor made by adding denatured alcohol is an unauthorised preparation, which is meant for industrial use not human consumption. Though the chemical analysis report of the material seized in raids from Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts is awaited, a check by the police and excise department shows denatured spirit used in the paint and hardware industry went into the making of the hooch. Denatured spirit is ethanol that has additives to make it poisonous, bad-tasting, foul-smelling, or nauseating to discourage recreational consumption. Ethanol is a clear, colourless liquid and the principal ingredient in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine or brandy. Denatured spirit is also called methylated spirit (alcohol for general use that is unfit for drinking by the addition of 10% methanol). Due to the diversity of industrial use for denatured alcohol, hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used. Denatured spirit is also used as a solvent and as fuel for alcohol burners and camping stoves. A senior police official said the accused were mixing equal amounts of water and denatured spirit to produce illicit liquor. The spirit was being smuggled by them from Patiala and Zirakpur. Normally, the spirit is sent to factories and there is a proper way to prepare liquor by heating it at 150 degrees Celsius. The accused were not following the process and making illicit liquor by sitting in a room. WHAT WENT WRONG Preliminary probe suggests that the amount of water used was in lesser quantity than the denatured spirit, which may have proved fatal. Improper dilution of methanol from the spirit and the use of the drums for storing the spirit could have led to fatalities. It is reported that the drums were earlier used for storing pesticide. CONTENT OF THE SPIRIT Denatured spirit contains 70% to 99% ethanol and is most often denatured with at least 5% to 10% methanol, besides additives. Police are investigating how the accused were diluting the methanol from denatured spirit. However, the illicit liquor sold at wine shops contains only 50 to 70 degrees of alcohol strength. Most government-approved distilleries use extra neutral alcohol (ENA), the primary raw material for making alcoholic beverages. ENA contains 168 degrees of alcohol strength, but its strength is diluted to 50 to 75 degrees, according to the requirement in distilleries, by heating it at a certain temperature and adding water. WHY PEOPLE BUY HOOCH Illicit liquor or countrymade liquor or ‘ghar di kadi sharaab’ is cheaper than liquor sold at shops. Country-made liquor is also made in distilleries. It is considered illicit when the makers sell it without paying excise duty. The poor prefer countrymade liquor as a bottle of two litres of illicit liquor can be bought for Rs 200 to Rs 250. However, the price of the cheapest brand of a liquor bottle (750ml) being sold in shops costs Rs 230. Moreover, one can buy a small glass or a peg for Rs 10 to Rs 30. HOW IT KILLS Denatured spirit is unfit for human consumption. Experts suspect less water was used while diluting the strength of denatured spirit. A senior police official said investigation suggested the presence of methanol in the liquor consumed by the victims. Many victims complained of blurring of vision before breathing their last. This is a key symptom of methanol consumption. Ranbir Singh of Rataul village, who became blind after consuming illicit liquor, says he lost his sight within hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/denatured-spirit-mixed-with-water-without-following-process-could-have-led-to-punjab-s-worst-hooch-tragedy/story-2zIyjV2yJZZNao02zXVYyH.html

03-08-2020||Chandigarh||Excommunicated by Akal Takht, Langah pardoned by panj pyaras at Gurdaspur gurdwara||Amritsar: Excommunicated by Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal seat, after a video allegedly showing him in an objectionable position with a woman was widely shared on social media in 2017, former Akali minister Sucha Singh Langah was pardoned by the panj pyaras (five beloved ones of the Guru) at Gurdwara Baba Banda Singh Bahadar in Gurdaspur district on Monday. Langah, who also served as a member of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), was excommunicated in October 2017 as the Sikh clergy found him guilty of misconduct and violation of the Sikh tenets on the basis of the video. After being acquitted by the court, he pleaded for pardon before the Takht thrice but was not entertained. TO SWEEP FLOOR OF GURDWARA FOR 21 DAYS On Monday, he along with other family appeared before panj pyaras to apologise for the immoral act. Considering his request, the panj pyaras awarded him tankhah (religious punishment) under which he was asked to sweep floors of the gurdwara for 21 days for an hour daily. After Langah accepted this punishment, the panj pyaras granted him ‘amrit’ (nectar) to re-include him into the community. “After completing the tankhah, I will do ardas to offer thanks at the gurdwara for correcting my act”, Langah said. The amrit sanchar (a Sikh ceremony meant to grant amrit to aspirants) was organised by a nihang singh organization led by Baba Tarsem Singh, considered close to Langah. SIKH OUTFITS OPPOSED TO PARDON When contacted, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said, “By doing so, he (Langah) cannot be acquitted by Akal Takht Sahib. The order against him remains intact.” In his last apology letter on March 13, Langah sought “forgiveness” for his “misconduct” even as he claimed that the court had absolved him of rape charges. However, Sikh organisations are opposed to the revocation of the excommunication of the former Akali leader. Acting on the complaint of the woman, who is a Punjab Police constable, a case was registered against Langah under Sections 376 (rape), 384 (extortion), 420 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. In 2018, Langah was acquitted by a Gurdaspur court after the woman said that she had filed the complaint under pressure. Sources said Langah is keen to rejoin politics and has organised public gatherings in Dera Baba Nanak assembly constituency. However, the Akal Takht order remains his biggest hurdle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/excommunicated-by-akal-takht-langah-pardoned-by-panj-pyaras-at-gurdaspur-gurdwara/story-exZU1PCfxDnIue6j20PiEJ.html

One should not panic as the monsoon will be very good in the coming days. After the second week of August it is forecast to rain heavily,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, superintending engineer, water supply and pumping department. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said he will conduct a meeting with the PMC water department to know the details about water storage on Tuesday. “Every year in June and July, catchment areas are expected to receive good rains, but this time, rains were not as heavy as compared to the past couple of years. Good rains are expected in August,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of India Meteorological Department, Pune. On Sunday as well, Pune did received sporadic rains with the maximum temperature at 31.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature at 21.6 degrees Celsius. “In case it does not rain for one more month then there can be a discussion on water cuts, but the India Meteorological Department has confirmed there is nothing to worry about,” added Pawaskar. Since the last few days, the maximum temperature has been above 30 degrees Celsius giving people a pinch of summer in the monsoon season. The IMD has forecast moderate to isolated heavy rains in the city from August 3-5. The ghat regions will continue to receive heavy rains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-water-cuts-in-the-city-for-now-dams-at-31-27-capacity/story-UNrnVnR5mayawB9Exn1A0O.html

Every year, Nivedita Bicchu, a business professional from Kothrud makes it a point to travel to Goa for Rakhi Pournima. “It is one of the occasions I get to meet not just my brothers, cousins but my entire family, but this year with the ongoing pandemic, Raksha Bandhan is on Zoom call. I have sent Rakhis and gifts through courier,” she said. Rajesh Ranawade, owner of Shree general stores in Aundh said that the market was closed and Rakhis came in late hence we bought less stock, however a lot of women bought the do-it-yourself kits for making homemade Rakhis. “We sold a lot of lace, silk threads and colourful patches which are easy to stick to make Rakhis. On Sunday, we had a lot of buyers for Rakhi, but we’re unsure how people will be celebrating Raksha Bandhan,” Ranawade said. The siblings who live in close proximity to each other have planned a physical visit on Monday for Raksha Bandhan. “My brother and I live in the same area in Lohegaon, I will be visiting his house, with complete precautions wearing a mask, using sanitizer and also have made a packet of Rakhi, sweets which I will hand over. We will share a meal together while maintaining social distance as his house is very big and they’re a small family,” said Archana Mane, a working professional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/virtual-meet-ups-couriered-rakhis-the-new-normal-on-a-covid-hit-raksha-bandhan/story-4piG85Tm6SHyG0I6fdrfnM.html

The deputy director of education, Pune, has released the 2019 cut-off list for all colleges in Pune. Students will now be able to fill up Part two of the admission form, in which they have to state their college of preference for admission. Meanwhile, since the part two form was released on Saturday, 19,044 students have filled the form so far. A detailed schedule of the Class 11 centralised online admission process is to be declared by the deputy director of education. “This year due to the pandemic, the entire admission process will be online and after the SSC results we opened part two of the admission form for students. It is a crucial part of the admission process as students need to give their college preferences. And while giving the preferences if they know the last year’s cut off list of those colleges it will help them. So the cut off list is shared on our website,” said Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune. Until August 2, a total of 76,598 students have registered for admission and 19,044 students have completed filling the part one form. Among these, 10,190 students’ forms have been verified. Students on Saturday and Sunday have complained about problems with the website, including hanging and technical glitches while filling up the form. “I have scored 88 per cent marks in the SSC exam and when I sat to fill up the admission form the website was not starting for over an hour. Initially, I thought it was a connectivity issue, but then I realised that the website had technical issues as thousands of students are using it at the same time,” said Sameer Nimbalkar, a student applying for admission to class 11. “There were some technical issues on the first day as many students logged in to fill up the form. We are continuously monitoring the system and the process is smooth now. There will be no problem now onwards,” said Shendkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cut-off-list-for-all-colleges-released-students-begin-fyjc-admission-process/story-yCckeCHBoI1NgAYwKtApbJ.html

During the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, the court only entertained important applications related to bails and emergency cases. The courts functioned for emergency cases during the lockdown period, from March until May. After lockdown restrictions were eased, the court functioned in two shifts, however, the rising number of Covid-19 patients led to the court working for only one shift in July. Pune bar association president Satish Mulik said, “The court will be working for only one shift during August as the number of Covid-19 cases is rising in the city.” Mulik added, the lawyers and the defence counsel must come to court only if it is essential. Once in court, all the lawyers have been appealed to strictly follow social distancing norms, with the use of masks and sanitisers. “The litigants and lawyers must also exercise self-control during their visit to the court and keep themselves safe by adhering to the guidelines of the state government,” he said. According to the PBA, the numbers of court visitors including lawyers have drastically reduced due to the Covid-19 infection in the city as only the most emergency-related cases are heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/courts-to-function-on-single-shift-in-august/story-oxKI3KRRlhX1NiMBkwTM9H.html

The FIR registered at Chatuhshrungi police based on the complaint filed by Yuvraj Dhamale, a developer and brother of Kakade’s wife Usha Kakade, states that alleged life threats were given to him by Kakades in 2018. Kakade issued a statement denying all the allegations. “I have not spoken to Dhamale since 2018 even my wife is not on talking terms with him since the past one year. This seems to be a political conspiracy against me by someone who is using Dhamale as a proxy. I will take legal advice and file defamation case against him,” said Kakade in a statement. Dhamale in his complaint said that before 2012, he and Kakade were partners in a construction business. In 2010, Dhamale started his independent construction business and since then both developed differences that led to family disputes.Anil Shewale, senior police inspector at Chatuhshrungi police station said as per the complaint registered by Dhamale, he was given life threats by Kakade and his wife in August and September 2018 when he had gone to their house.“The complainant alleged that when he had gone to their house, Kakade’s wife and his sister told him that though he started his own business and earned fame, he should always remember that whatever he has achieved, it was because of her husband,” said the officer.He added that in the complaint, Dhamale also alleged that Kakade used abusive language and gave him life threats.Dhamale in his statement said that he was afraid to file a complaint against Kakades as Sanjay Kakade was MP.“In the statement, Dhamale said that since the last two weeks, he was feeling insecure, he approached the police and registered a complaint,” said the officer. A complaint under section relevant sections of IPC was registered on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/fir-against-former-mp-sanjay-kakade-for-threatening-brother-in-law/story-wt6I83rJw9sU5IUOjWN2iP.html

Ferozepur district has been put on the danger list, while Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Mansa, Moga and Tarn Taran districts are on the threat list of a locust attack that may harm vegetable crops and pulses, the FAO said. The district administrations of Amritsar, Fazilka, Ludhiana, Sangrur, Faridkot, Muktsar, Bathinda and Barnala have been advised to stay alert. The state agriculture department has asked district officials to alert farmers and prepare for a possible locust attack in the coming days. In its circular to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the FAO warned the state of an attack between August 1 and 6. Jalandhar district agriculture officer Surinder Singh said, “We have formed WhatsApp a group of farmers and the deputy commissioner has set up committees at the sub-divisional level to take swift action. We will act in a specific area after the locust attack.” Punjab was put on the threat list after the Regional Remote Sensing Centre (West) issued a warning in its weekly locust surveillance using geospatial technology, which monitors the weather and ecology to provide an early warning based on the survey and control results from the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO). The survey states that summer breeding is underway along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border. In India, numerous adult groups and swarms are laying eggs over a wide area of Rajasthan between Jodhpur and Churu, while hatching and band formation from earlier laying has occurred further south from Phalodi to Gujarat.

03-08-2020||Delhi||To make or not to make: Pandemic leaves idol makers in a dilemma as festive season nears||Two piles of mud in the parking lot of the defunct Chandralok Cinema in south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park are the only discernible signs of the space serving as the workplace for idol makers over five months every year.The festive season is around the corner, but the customary idol makers are missing in action, as are their Ganesha idols — many of which would have been receiving the final touches by this time of the year, if not for Covid-19.“Beginning June every year, about a dozen idol makers from West Bengal would camp here for five months. No one has turned up this time,” says Zulfikar Malik, the caretaker of the lonely parking lot.With the outbreak of the coronavirus disease forcing authorities to restrict public gatherings, most idol makers in the city returned to their hometowns during the lockdown. With the uncertainty surrounding upcoming festivals, and Delhi still recording an average of over 1,000 new cases of the infection every day, the idol makers who stayed back in the Capital face a dilemma — to begin work for grand festivities or not.Also read: Durga Puja organisers frame norms on how to hold week-long festival amid Covid-19“I am making small Ganesha idols for people who want to put them up in their homes during Ganesh Chaturthi. But I don’t know if I should make a few big ones for the pandals (stages),” says 48-year-old Govind Nath, who has been making idols of deities at a shed in CR Park Kali Mandir for decades now.It takes Nath around a month to ready a 12-feet-tall idol. He says it’s easier when he works on several idols simultaneously. But he isn’t sure if he should proceed with the plan when he has got no orders, and much still up in the air.Ganesh Chaturthi is due to be held on August 22, and Durga Puja will be celebrated between October 22 and 26.While religious places in the Capital were thrown open for the public in early June, the relaxation came with a host of rules — such as maintaining a six-feet distance between each devotee, not touching idols and not making any offerings. Religious congregations are still not permitted, even under the Centre’s Unlock 3 guidelines.Meanwhile, enthusiasm has steadily dampened among idol makers and devotees.Sunil Pal, vice-president of CR Park Mela Ground Durga Puja Samiti says he doesn’t expect the government to grant permission even for Durga Puja. “Usually, we place orders for Mata idols by June-end, but this time we are yet to decide,” Pal says.The Bengali-dominated south Delhi locality is the hub of Durga Puja festivities in Delhi every year.Even if they are permitted to set up pandals on a small scale, the association will settle for smaller idols that can be readied at short notice, Pal says.Idol makers say given the volume of idols required for Durga Puja every year, they begin work in June itself.But Kheta Ram, a 26-year-old idol maker in Tughlaqabad village in South Delhi says he is yet to begin work. “I am not sure people will want to spend money on idols this time. Those organising pandals are unlikely to receive donations. So I have been postponing the work every day. I have lost the enthusiasm to pursue such hard work,” he says.For Ganesh Chaturthi, there will be far fewer pandals in Delhi this year, says Mahendra Ladda, president of the 18-year-old Shri Gant Sewa Mandal Delhi, an association in Laxmi Nagar.“There will be little work for the artisans this time, as celebrations will be muted, but our pandal will still go ahead with celebrations, even if it means shortening the period to three days instead of the usual 10, and having only the core members perform the puja,” he says.He says pandals are usually set up a month before the celebrations, but everything is on hold this year. “We have never missed the celebrations in the last 18 years, and the puja will be streamed online for the devotees this year,” he added.While the association has already placed an order for a two-feet-tall statue, idol makers aren’t sure they’ll be able to deliver large idols if orders are placed late.“I had about 20 people working for me, who have all returned to their home towns and villages in Bengal. They don’t want to come back, and even if some do, I don’t know if I can pay them the usual wages,” Govind Nath says.Working alone for now, Nath is readying a couple of large Ganesha and Durga idols — each of them about half the usual size he prepares for CR Park’s major pandals, but he isn’t sure they’ll find buyers.Nath and other idol makers had received a jolt early on in the lockdown itself. They had made Durga and Annapurna Devi idols for Ram Navami, but the lockdown was announced before they could be sold out for the festival on April 2.“Not one of the 70 idols I had prepared were sold. Now I have packed them in plastic covers and stored them to sell during Durga Puja, and hope people will buy them for their homes. I’ll be selling them for much less than usual,” says Ram Rawat, an idol maker in Yamuna Pushta, near Akshardham Mandir.“I am making just around 200 small Ganesha idols this time,” says Rawat, who made 1,000 idols last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-make-or-not-to-make-pandemic-leaves-idol-makers-in-a-dilemma-as-festive-season-nears/story-P0xpn34gIse49rZLaZoBaJ.html

The INLD, which was the main opposition party in Haryana in the 2014 assembly elections, has been reduced to only one seat secured by its general secretary Abhay Chautala in Ellenabad constituency.Talking to HT in Rohtak, Ellenabad legislator and senior INLD leader Abhay Chautala said they had started the membership drive last week from Panchkula and aimed to enrol 10 lakh new members in the state by August 15.“We have started a membership drive in 20 districts, which will also commence in Faridabad and Palwal districts tomorrow. I have taken charge of these drives in 10 districts while party president Nafe Singh Rathi and senior leader Parkash Bharti are looking after the initiative in six districts each,” he added.He further said that his party was focusing on bringing back old workers into the fold, who had shifted to other parties after the emergence of the JJP.‘JJP dissolved national, state units after many of its office bearers joins INLD’INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala said that the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) had dissolved its units after many of its leaders switched over to the INLD.“I am waiting when the JJP will revamp its units and then many of its office bearers will join our party. Don’t be surprised if any member of my brother Ajay Chautala’s family joins the INLD in coming days. Many people enjoyed the moment when our party was divided into two parts and they thought that INLD’s game was over in Haryana. But, they failed to realise the attachment of Chautala sahab’s supporters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/inld-aims-to-enrol-10-lakh-members-in-haryana-in-next-two-weeks-abhay-chautala/story-0ziVJZcW8G6jWHEnGuzONN.html

Women from various fields, including renowned singer Himani Kapoor, Class 12 toppers, vice-chancellors of various universities, lawyers, doctors and panchayat representatives participated in the webinar. Khattar also spelled out the initiatives taken by his government for the empowerment of women, saying providing equal opportunities to them was a priority. During the interaction, Khattar was asked a question on women safety by Archana Chaudhary from Karnal’s Shamgarh village, who said he has been living in California for five years and driving a truck there.“I drive a truck in the United States. When I drive at night, I feel equally safe as I do during the day. Can women get such an atmosphere in Haryana? Can they feel equally safe if they go out during late nights? What steps the state government have taken to make sure that women feel safe and secure,” she asked.Responding to it, the CM said his government has opened 31 women police stations in the state and claimed of making tough laws with zero tolerance towards crimes against women. He said the government has been laying a lot of emphasis on women’s education and providing them equal opportunities to progress.“We hope that situation is created (when women across the state can freely go out during late night hours), let us see how it goes,” he said.A student from Mewat’s Nuh, Shaheen Khan, drew Khattar’s attention towards the need for doing more towards women education in the district.Khattar said the state government has taken several steps to uplift education standards in Mewat, identified as among 115 districts lagging on specific development parameters by the Centre.“Education, health and employment have been our focus for the district for the past few years,” he said.Khattar said if the coronavirus situation prolongs, the government will contemplate giving smartphones or tablets to some schoolchildren. Khattar said on Monday, he will lay the foundation stone of 10 colleges through video conferencing on Raksha Bandhan, which will be set up in far flung areas of various districts.Ensure sufficient buses operate on Raksha Bandhan: Haryana transport minister to roadwaysHaryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma on Sunday directed the roadways authorities to ensure that the buses in sufficient numbers operate as per the demand of the passengers in view of Raksha Bandhan so that the public doesn’t face any inconvenience. “A passenger without a mask will not be allowed to board the bus,” the minister said. Sharma said in view of Covid-19, presently buses were operating with 50% passenger strength while adhering to the social distancing norms. However, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, to ensure hassle-free travel for people of the state, all depot general managers have been instructed to operate sufficient numbers of buses as per the demand. He said during the movement of buses, it will be ensured that social distancing norms are being followed and sanitisers are available. ‘For the 1st time in 14 yrs, govt will collect bus fare from women on such auspicious day’ Former chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday asked the state government to allow women travel free of cost in the roadways buses on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan. Asking the state government to reconsider its decision of stopping free bus service for women on the day of Raksha Bandhan, Hooda said. “This will be for the first time in 14 years that the state government will collect bus fare from women on the auspicious day of Raksha Bandhan.” He said the Congress government had started this free bus service for women of the state on Raksha Bandhan. The former chief minister said instead of providing relief to women, the BJP-JJP coalition government has taken back whatever concessions were given to them.Demanding that the government should run more buses to avoid crowding and ensure social distancing, he said there could be no justification for removing a one-day waiver for women on one of the most important festivals of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/providing-equal-opportunities-to-women-a-priority-haryana-cm/story-E9ZSaf8jIW2LlrIs9CAHPM.html

I urge you to pitch a farmer in the Baroda byelection and ensure his win from the constituency.

As per the eyewitnesses, the mound they were digging suddenly collapsed and at least seven labourers were trapped under it. They were extracted by fellow labourers and rushed to a hospital, where two of them were declared brought dead, police officials said.The deceased were identified as Suraiya Begam, 45, and Giano Devi, 55. Two labourers, Hansraj and Amit, are undergoing treatment at the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital where their condition is said to the stable. As per the police complaint filed by Suraiya’s husband Mehboob Khan, the incident took place due to the negligence of MGNREGA mate Sonia and contractor Sethpal as they engaged the workers in the digging process without taking any safety measures. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the workers were engaged in earth-filling work of a ‘Baarat Ghar’ being constructed under the government scheme. He said an inquiry has been handed over to Indri SDM and those who died and injured will be given claims as per the Act and labour laws.

03-08-2020||Lucknow||UP uses rapid antigen tests to boost testing||Amid a surge in new Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, a data analysis by HT shows that the state government has relied on rapid antigen tests to improve testing numbers — an area in which India’s most populous state has been a laggard so far.In the week ending on Saturday, an average 93,770 samples were tested in Uttar Pradesh every day — the highest in the country in absolute numbers. The next closest state in terms of daily tests was Tamil Nadu with 61,626 samples tested on average every day in the last week — 34% fewer than UP.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA month ago, for the week ending July 1, UP was testing 22,218 samples a day on average, while Tamil Nadu was testing 32,338 (45% more). In fact, two other states – Maharashtra (24,135 daily tests) and Andhra Pradesh (24,028) – tested more than UP as well. This shows how testing has been ramped up in UP over the past few weeks (Chart 1).To be sure, this increase in testing was much needed in UP, in the backdrop of the state’s massive population of 225 million. A month ago, the state conducted 3,373 tests per million residents, the lowest in the country after Bihar (2,493 tests per million) and Telangana (1,913) against the then national average of 6,794 tests per million. Since then the state has climbed two spots and has tested 10,571 sampled per million; though it remains significantly lower than the national average of 14,871 (Chart 2). Much of the increase can be attributed to the state’s decision to start using antigen tests. An antigen is a protein that induces an immune response in the form of production of antibodies against a disease, and detecting its presence through an antigen-based test determines a present infection. Since these tests can possibly lead to false negatives, several cases can slide under the radar. But experts say it can be used in small areas of hot spots to test every resident and quickly isolate as many patients as possible.In contrast, the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the gold-standard for Covid-19 testing. It is used for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from the Sars-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens and is primarily based on PCR, a process that duplicates and amplifies genetic fragments of the virus, so that it becomes easily detectable. Experts say this is the most definitive test currently available and should be used as often as possible.On July 20, when the state tested 40,659 samples, only 7,780 or 19.1% of tests were antigen tests (Chart 3). This share of antigen tests in the total samples tested in the state has been increasing daily since. As of August 1, nearly 69% of the 114,844 samples tested in the state were antigen-based.In the same time period, while RT-PCR tests have largely remained the same (in the 30,000-a-day range), antigen tests have grown 10-fold (from 7,700 tests a day on July 10 to 78,000 tests a day on August 1). The strategy applied by the UP government is not unheard of. Nearly one in four Covid-19 tests conducted across the country currently uses a rapid antigen test kit, HT reported on Saturday. Delhi, which is perhaps the only region in the country that has managed to control the outbreak, has also relied heavily on antigen tests to scale its testing – on July 30, for instance, 71.6% of all tests performed in the capital were antigen-based.A senior doctor with the core team of Kanpur’s chief medical officer (CMO), who did not wish to be identified, said the decision to rely on antigen tests so heavily was based on the limited number of RT-PCR labs and machines. The target for daily tests was not achievable without ramping up the scale of rapid antigen tests, the doctor said, adding that the number of machines available as of now was “clearly not enough”. Experts say the lack of infrastructure related to RT-PCR tests remains a major challenge for the UP government, especially with he monsoon, which sees a massive spike in infections, underway. “Monsoon is favourable for the spread of infection. RT-PCR is the gold standard to test and identify cases early and accurately. Satellite testing centres should be made and RT-PCR machines should be placed for a population of every two lakh. In a city such as Lucknow, there should be at least 100 RT-PCR machines placed in different areas,” said professor TN Dhol, ex-head of the department of microbiology at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-uses-rapid-antigen-tests-to-boost-testing/story-rqrnIgiSwhqAfctzI8FlTN.html
03-08-2020||Chandigarh||Opposition calls for CM’s resignation, CBI probe in Punjab hooch case||Opposition parties in Punjab on Sunday attacked the state government over the hooch tragedy that has killed 104 people, with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) asking chief minister Amarinder Singh to step down and demanding action against “Congress leaders patronising spurious liquor trade.”The SAD also rejected the magisterial inquiry ordered by the state government and sought a probe either by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or a sitting judge of the high court. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also demanded an investigation by the CBI, with its state chief Bhagwant Mann indicating that political leaders might be involved in it.Also read: ‘Mind your business’: Punjab CM to Kejriwal on demand for CBI probe into hooch deathsAAP also held a statewide agitation against the government.Both parties demanded that a murder case be registered against those behind it. “There should be a probe by the CBI or a sitting judge of the high court into this incident,” SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said, describing the investigation ordered by the state government as “farce and mere eyewash”.He accused the state government of suppressing the actual number of casualties. He also demanded that former Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya be booked for murder. He claimed that many people in the area had approached the then SSP about bootleggers and their alleged Congress “kingpins”, but the official had turned a blind eye.AAP MP Bhagwant Mann said, “Nothing will happen with the transfer of some officers. The problem is deep rooted and there is a big nexus. People are openly taking names of leaders. There should be a probe by the CBI.”Survivors of the tragedy have complained of low vision and uneasiness after consuming spurious liquor. Fifty-year-old Tilak Raj, a contractual employee of the Batala Municipal Corporation, says he felt uneasy after drinking the liquor, which he had bought for ₹60 from Triveni Chauhan and Darshana Rani, alias Faujan, outside the Hathi Gate locality in Batala. Both accused have been arrested. “After I drank it, I was not able to see properly and felt uneasiness,” said Raj. He survived as his family immediately took him to a doctor. “Now, I am feeling slightly better but my vision has not improved and I am feeling giddy,” said Raj. According to a senior excise official, although the chemical analysis reports of the material seized in police raids were awaited, a superficial check showed that the material was denatured spirit, generally used in paint or hardware industry. Meanwhile, some families of the deceased in Amritsar flayed the police for not taking any action against those culpable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/opposition-calls-for-cm-s-resignation-cbi-probe-in-punjab-hooch-case/story-LAoCzmXKajTP1hEe9CwvFJ.html

A bench headed by Justice AS Bopanna will hear Mulakkal’s plea for dropping of rape charges against him. Mulakkal had filed the plea in the top court where he claimed to be innocent and said he was implicated after he questioned the financial dealings of the victim nun. He approached the top court after the Kerala high court rejected his plea for discharge from the case. The prosecution in the high court had contended that there was strong evidence against him and he was moving pleas frequently to delay the trial. He had approached the Kerala High Court after a trial court in Kottayam had dismissed the plea to discharge him from the case in March. In June 2018, the nun, who is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab, had complained to the police in Kottayam that Jalandhar Bishop had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. After several rounds of questioning, the special investigation team (SIT) of Kerala Police arrested him in September 2018.

The officials said that they are focusing on 11 FIRs registered at police stations in Patiala, Khanna and Ludhiana and have also asked the police to share details of the accused in the Hooch tragedy as prima-facie, there seems to be a nexus. “We have written to the Punjab police but if they don’t share the details with us soon, we will move court,” said an official privy to the investigation.The central agency officials are also suspecting the role of distilleries in the state. An illegal distillery busted in Khanna and another one in Khadur village of Ludhiana is also under ED lens.“As per a conservative estimate, the accused in the Ghanaur illegal distillery case had earned Rs 100 crore in the last five months,” said an excise official, pleading anonymity. Congress sarpanch Amrik Singh and Dipesh Kumar of Rajpura, an aide of a ruling party MLA, were booked in the case. Dipesh, who is believed to be the kingpin of the racket, has been arrested. The agency has also asked the excise and taxation department about the details of ENA manufacturing and supply chain. When contacted, Khanna senior superintendent of police Harpreet Singh said that he has to check the records and only then can he comment on the matter. Similarly, Patiala’s new SSP Vikramjit Singh Duggal said that he will ask his SP (investigation) to give details on the matter.Ludhiana-based RTI activist Kuldeep Singh Khaira who also filed complaint with ED demanding probe into nexus said that it has created doubt over intentions of the Punjab government and police seems to be dragging their feet to share the details . “They must share it if they really want to curb the menace,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-police-yet-to-share-details-of-illegal-liquor-trade-cases-with-ed/story-Qw35z8YIltfyNPtI0BmvuK.html

There have been several signs of this shift in focus —and a gradual return to business as usual—over the past three weeks.Since July 21, the government cleared the decks for its flagship doorstep delivery of rations scheme, inspected infrastructure projects such as the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk and flyovers in north-east Delhi’s Seelampur and Shastri Park, and on July 27 Kejriwal launched an employment portal to facilitate job seekers and employers who have been hit by the lockdown.In June, Kejriwal had no appointment connected to a non-Covid issue. In July, he made two non-Covid visits—to the Shastri Park flyover and Chandni Chowk.To be sure, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city’s finance minister, issued a caveat that the government will not launch any new projects just yet given the financial crisis that the city faces. “We are struggling to pay salaries. It is impossible to think of investing in new projects now, unless we get some financial help from the central government. We had sought ₹5,000 crore from the Centre but we have not got any money till date,” Sisodia said. The government has also consistently warned against complacency and the need to adhere to safety and distancing norms.Also read: Railways to create over 1.1mn man-days work for migrants in 6 statesBut the administration, once the unlock guidelines were in place, started delivering day-to-day essential services gradually—including meter readings for power bills that started July 1, and issuing important documents such as income certificates, disability certificates, caste certificates, mutation of property and works related to stamp duty—highlighting that Delhi, which is the only place in India where cases are consistently reducing, is starting to look at life beyond the pandemic from a governance perspective. Debolina Kundu, a professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), emphasised three points that the government should consider as it gets back to regular non-Covid affairs.“First, workplaces must adhere to social distancing. For that, offices can chalk out plans such as staggered timings and encourage work from home in departments where possible. Second, while drafting welfare policies, the government must consider that a large chunk of people who were borderline above the poverty line (APL) have now dropped below the poverty line (BPL) after the lockdown. All targeted benefit schemes have to be re-assessed and expanded, if needed. Third, while designing habitation schemes for the poor, the government must ensure that houses are capable of isolation of the residents. The policymakers should use Covid management as a learning experience. At this juncture, it is very important to ensure closed drains, toilets and access to clean water for each such household.” Here is a look at some of the areas that the administration had started gradually reopening.INFRASTRUCTURE & DEVELOPMENTOver the past two weeks, the chief minister has reviewed the Shastri Park flyover project and the plan for redevelopment of Chandni Chowk, which are scheduled to be opened to the public in August and November respectively. Both the projects have been delayed due to labour shortages owing to the pandemic. While the Shastri Park road project consists of two flyovers and is aimed at decongesting northeast Delhi’s traffic, the Chandni Chowk project aims to establish a decongested and pedestrianised heritage market on the 1.5km road stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid.Senior officials from different government departments who spoke to HT on condition of anonymity said a funding crunch had forced the government to prioritise a handful of incomplete works over several flagship projects. For instance, the plan to start the second phase of the government’s CCTV camera scheme, which involved installing 140,000 cameras across the city, is still on hold. There has been no talk on when it will be revived. POWERDue to the Covid-19 lockdown, consumers in Delhi were getting provisional power bills in the months of March, April and May because private power distribution companies (Discoms) had stopped meter readings over safety concerns. The state power department said all discoms had resumed meter readings last week, except in containment zones.A spokesperson for BSES said the pandemic pushed up online payments of power bills. “As per our data, in the pre-Covid times, 72% of the consumers of BYPL and BRPL, which constitute around 85% of Delhi’s total 5.5 million domestic consumers, used to pay their electricity bills online. Until last week, we found that this has now increased to 90%,” a BSES spokesperson said. WATERThe Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has opened all its offices, said Raghav Chadha, DJB vice-chairperson and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Rajendra Nagar.He said that all the zonal revenue offices (ZROs) of DJB in each of the 11 districts have opened, but very few people are turning up owing to the pandemic. “The zonal revenue offices are the offices where the real public dealing used to happen, but despite the unlocking, very few people are coming due to the pandemic. Another reason for fewer people turning up is that the Delhi government has now extended its water bill waiver scheme till September 30,” he said. TRANSPORT SERVICES The state transport department said that it is witnessing a deluge of queries regarding driving license, fitness certificates and permit renewals. Services such as making a licence now entails a long wait which can go up to two months at regional transport offices (RTOs) such as Rohini, Sarai Kale Khan and Dwarka. The RTO at Sarai Kale Khan, for example, which is also one of the busiest in Delhi, 200 driving tests used to be conducted every day till March. At the moment, around 80 tests are conducted in a day. The number of online tests for a learners’ license is now down to around 100 from 250 daily tests conducted before the pandemic. “Due to social distancing norms, which cannot be compromised with, we have capped the number of daily driving tests being conducted in every RTO. Hence, demand is much higher. We are also trying to make people aware of the Central government’s latest relaxed rule under which expired transport documents such as a licence, fitness certificates and other permits are valid till September 30. So, there is no need to panic,” said a senior transport official who asked not to be named.Apart from routine services, the Delhi government has also floated tenders for acquiring 300 e-buses for the Delhi Transport Corporation’s fleet and also released an instalment of its share to the DMRC to resume work on the Janakpuri West – R K Ashram corridor under Delhi Metro’s phase 4, said a second senior transport official.REVENUE SERVICES More than 23 revenue services that were categorised as “non-essential” were shut in Delhi on March 20. From June 8, when the first unlocking guidelines were issued, Delhi government’s revenue department slowly opened its public services — including issuing income, domicile, marriage, caste and solvency certificates, mutation of properties, enrolment of Aadhaar and civil defence volunteers, and registration of documents in sub-registrar offices. Government data seen by HT shows that earnings through revenue services in June this year dropped by almost 44% compared to the same period last year. Various district revenue offices in June 2019 processed and approved 24,709 documents compared to 14,165 in June 2020. In the same month last year, the government earned ₹49 crore in registration fees and ₹238 crore in stamp duty. This June, the two collections were ₹28 crore and ₹135 crore respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/key-governance-issues-return-to-focus-in-delhi-as-covid-19-cases-drop/story-cdU42VjBk9T1ThIDEK8o2J.html

MMR has reported 9,887 Covid-19 deaths.The tally of active cases in the state stood at 148,537 as 9,926 patients were discharged on Sunday, taking the number of recoveries to 276,809.Mumbai recorded 1,105 new cases, taking the city tally to 116,436, while 49 fatalities on Sunday took the death toll to 6,447. The state, on Sunday, tested 60,758 samples and had a positivity rate of 15.65%.MMR and the Pune division, which comprises Pune city, Pune district, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Solapur district, have contributed to 73% of the fatalities recorded on Sunday. MMR and Pune division has reported 190 of the 260 fatalities. The Pune division is expected to breach the 3,000 mark in a couple of days. So far, Pune division has reported 2,899 deaths.MMR, excluding Mumbai, which saw a surge in fresh cases in July, also saw a chunk of its fatalities in the previous month. From July 1 to August 2, MMR alone has reported 2,274 deaths and 81,976 cases. MMR, excluding Mumbai, has nearly reported 3,500 fatalities since the outbreak. Of the total deaths, 66.10% of the fatalities were reported in the last 33 days.The state health department is concerned over the case fatality rate (CFR) in the state and particularly in MMR, which is densely populated. Municipal bodies, including Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation, have reported a high mortality rate. As per the data of the state health department, Bhiwandi-Nizampur had the highest CFR in MMR of 6.05%, followed by Mumbai at 5.53%. Thane city had a CFR of 3.49%.Pankaj Ashiya, municipal commissioner of Bhiwandi-Nizampur, said that the CFR in the city is on a downward trend now and fatalities that were recorded were in June due to unavailability of a dedicated COVID facility. “The doubling rate here is now 86 days, only the mortality rate is high, but we have it under control now. Earlier, we did not have a dedicated Covid facility. Patients chose to go to Thane and Mumbai, but then the situation in these cities was also bad. Now, the daily cases and deaths have reduced,” he said.“The Thane district is a huge region and barring Thane city and parts of Navi Mumbai, the health infrastructure is weak. A central command centre in Thane is in the works to manage the availability of beds. With a central command centre, the cases that need beds urgently will get assistance and thereby helping in reducing deaths. The local civic bodies in the areas have been working aggressively to track suspected cased, people with co-morbidities are being identified to start treatment, like it was done in Mumbai,” said a senior health department official, who did not wish to be named.The death toll in Pune city has touched 1,507 with 25 new fatalities, while the death toll in Pimpri-Chinchwad has touched 401 with 15 deaths on Sunday. Solapur city, in Pune division, has the highest CFR in the state at 7.47%. Solapur city has 387 deaths so far.

So far 24 children in the juvenile home had tested positive for Covid-19, most of whom were asymptomatic.“We have three isolation centres and the children are moved through them in stages before they are shifted to the main home. The whole process takes around a month. These children had come in on July 29,” said Dharmendra Maurya, in-charge of the juvenile home.He said that the shift in-charge at the time had dozed off and the teenagers used the opportunity to escape. The home authorities, soon noticed that the three were missing and reported it to the police helpline at 3.18 am.Three more children too tried to escape but were caught almost immediately.Based on Maurya’s complaint, a case was registered at the Phase 2 police station against the children under sections 223 (escape from confinement) and 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“One of the kids was apprehended from near the NSEZ metro station on Saturday night and the other from Bhangel today. They have both been returned to judicial custody,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.An official said that the third teenager has been traced to Shamli district (his home-town) and will be brought back to Gautam Budh Nagar soon.All three undertrials are between the ages 15-17. One was detained for rape and the others for kidnapping from Dadri and Badalpur police jurisdictions, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-teens-detained-after-escape-from-juvenile-detention-centre/story-jQGOgJLd3vfsaacBImYQnK.html
03-08-2020||Noida||Greater Noida’s annual budget will remain unaffected despite Covid-19 pandemic: CEO||The Greater Noida authority is likely to organise a board meeting on August 4 to approve important proposals that may include the annual budget, housing projects and water meters scheme.The authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) said that the civic body’s finances were stretched due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the annual budget will not be hit.“Our budget remains in the range of ₹1,500 crore to ₹2,000 crore every year for past couple of years. And it will remain almost the same this year. However, our revenue has dropped drastically upto 70% since April,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the CEO.Between April and June the authority had expected to collect ₹200 crore in revenue, but ended up with only ₹80 crore, with nil in April. The authority had spent ₹180 crore in the last four months. The authority hoped that the earnings would improve as and when the market are opened completely, said officials. That, however, may have to wait longer as the threat of Covid-19 is still high.The authority is also likely to discuss the interest rate issue related with the developers in the board meeting. The Supreme Court on July 10 had directed the Greater Noida and Noida authorities to charge only 8.5% interest rate on housing land thereby impacting the financial conditions of two industrial bodies.“The board will take appropriate decision as per rules,” said Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-s-annual-budget-will-remain-unaffected-despite-covid-19-pandemic-ceo/story-etMyFOf562gIbwexeiFbxO.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||Chandni Chowk redevelopment to ease traffic on adjacent roads: Traffic Police||Regulating vehicular movement on the Chandni Chowk main road as part of the redevelopment project will not only ease traffic chaos in the neighbourhood but is also expected to have a positive effect on adjoining arterial roads, says a detailed traffic assessment of the area conducted by Delhi traffic police.The assessment focused on how traffic movement and vehicular volume will affect adjoining areas after the redevelopment plan is implemented. According to the assessment, streamlining of vehicles in Chandni Chowk is likely to smoothen traffic on key roads such as Netaji Subhash Marg, Jama Masjid Road, Shanti Van Marg, Kasturba Hospital Marg and Ansari Road. Traffic volume on Netaji Subhash Marg and Jama Masjid Road is likely to reduce by 10% to 12%, while on other roads, the same traffic is estimated move more smoothly as bottlenecks are expected to ease. The 1.3-km stretch between Fatehpuri Masjid and Red Fort in Chandni Chowk is on its way to becoming car-free by October end -- replete with beautified sandstone pathway, greenery on both sides and dedicated lanes for e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws . The redevelopment project was supposed to have been completed by May this year but was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Only allow pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles will be allowed between 9 am and 9 pm, after which loading and off-loading of goods will be permitted for the benefit of traders. Chandni Chowk is a wholesale hub.During an inspection on July 23, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said most of the work was over and the stretch was expected to be opened for the public by October-end. Beautification work on 400 metres, of the total 1.3-km stretch, has been completed. Traffic officials also expect that the promised 2,300-car multi-level parking facility being built by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation can tackle the problem of roadside parking. “A major chokepoint during peak morning and evening rush hours is the Chandni Chowk-Netaji Subhash Marg crossing. Vehicles turning towards Chandni Chowk, near Jain temple, create chaos and the spillover is seen till Delhi Gate. Once the stretch is closed for traffic, we will see a visible difference,” a senior traffic official explained. The assessment says that before the redevelopment project started, the Chandni Chowk main road had a vehicular movement of nearly 23,721 (only passenger vehicles) on both sides of the carriageway, which is quite low for a four-lane road. This shows the snarls were caused not by traffic volume but by chaotic parking and mismanaged movement of non-motorised vehicles such as cycle and battery-operated rickshaws. On a weekday, about 172 cars and 196 two-wheelers would be parked at a time on the Chandni Chowk road. Even though these would be parked for 30 minutes or less, this affected the movement of vehicles on the road, where the effective carriageway was as narrow as 4.5 metres to 5 metres -- dropping to 4 metres at places. “With pedestrianisation, we expect shoppers not coming for wholesale purchase to prefer Delhi Metro to commute. There was also shortage of parking space, and the multilevel parking would help,” the traffic official said. A similar traffic assessment conducted around Karol Bagh after Ajmal Khan Road was made a pedestrian-only stretch observed that traffic movement had eased in the area. Anuj Malhotra, knowledge partner with the union ministry of home affairs, who was also behind the Karol Bagh and Kamla Nagar pedestrianisation projects, said when a street is made car-free, traffic in adjacent areas readjust and jams eventually ease. “For instance, if a street that was revamped had more goods vehicles, that load is likely to shift to the neighbouring streets but then the volume of private vehicles will automatically reduce,” Malhotra said. He said a comprehensive traffic plan for entire Chandni Chowk is being worked out with the north corporation, which is delayed because of Covid-19. Though it is in a nascent stage, it will ease traffic snarls in the entire area. The traffic assessment report of the Chandni Chowk main road said, “The composition of traffic on Esplanade Road, Deewan Hall Road, Dariba Kalan Road, Bhagirath Palace Road, Nai Sadak, Bali Maran Road, Khari Baoli Road and Naya Bazar Road mainly consists of cycle rickshaws, two-wheelers, cycles and small tempos. The rush on these roads is likely to continue. A separate traffic plan for these areas could yield better results.” Pralad Singh Sawhney, Chandni Chowk MLA, said the area has been the centre of the Capital’s heritage and such a plan will help people visit the neighbourhood with ease. “Surely, we will see a major difference. We are conducting regular meetings with stakeholders to look at the progress,” Sawhney said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandni-chowk-redevelopment-to-ease-traffic-on-adjacent-roads-traffic-police/story-GNeewkl4pI0Hl9lqnLX3eP.html
03-08-2020||City||Yamuna E-way authority gets ₹5,000 crore to develop four cities near Jewar airport||GREATER NOIDA: With a sanction of ₹5,000, the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) is all set to procure land needed to develop four new cities on the periphery of the Noida International Greenfield Airport site at Jewar, along the 165km Yamuna Expressway. The funds have come from Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO), a state-owned technical and financing agency, as a loan. “A lot of investors, both domestic and international, are ready to invest in projects which are interlinked with the airport project. We want to develop a city meant for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of aircraft, two cities for electronic clusters, and an aviation hub. For these four new cities, we have started preparations on a war footing,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida and Noida international airport Limited (NIAL). The latter is the nodal agency for development of the airport.The authority has decided to spend the ₹5,000 crore funds on development of drainage and sewage systems, apart from roads and parks, and land acquisition for these four new cities, said officials of Yeida. The authority will procure land and develop it for investors who want to buy land and set up manufacturing units there. As per rules, the Yeida buys agricultural land directly from farmers, develops it and then allots the same to investors or manufacturing units. In total, Yeida will directly buy 3,200 acres of agricultural land from willing farmers and then start development of basic facilities before floating the plot scheme. “HUDCO has given us three years’ time to utilise the ₹5,000 crore on developing these four projects in the agreement that we together signed on July 30. We aim to begin the procurement of land in a month from now,” said Singh.The Yeida has made detailed project reports of these four projects and also made drawings. It has sent the project details to the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) that is likely to approve the same and make necessary changes in the master plan meant for NCR.“We hope NCRPB gives its approval in a month paving the way for the land purchase,” said Singh. These four cities are planned in sectors 7, 8, 30 and 31. “These four ambitious projects will create huge job opportunities to professionals and boost growth in this region,” said Singh.The work on ₹30,000 crore airport project will begin onsite once the Covid-19 pandemic is over and air travel restrictions are eased, as the state government is likely to complete legal formalities with Switzerland-based company Zurich International Airport AG that will develop the airport. The Yeida wants to start the development of urban zones in this region so that the catchment area of the airport is developed well on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yamuna-e-way-authority-gets-5-000-crore-to-develop-four-cities-near-jewar-airport/story-ePhSqHOPPTUSx8vibDxGYK.html
03-08-2020||Noida||With most deaths in July, increased recoveries bring some relief to Noida||Out of the total Covid-19 cases reported in Gautam Budh Nagar so far, more than half of the people had tested positive for the infection in the month of July alone. According to the data provided by the district health department, with 2,901 people testing positive for the coronavirus disease and 20 people succumbing to it last month, July recorded the maximum number of cases and deaths in a month.However, among the rising numbers of infections in July, Gautam Budh Nagar found a silver lining with about 2,859 patients being cured/discharged last month—the maximum in a month so far. As many as 5, 531 cases of Covid-19 cases have been reported in the district so far, as per the data by the state control room, out of which as many as 4,502 patients have recovered.In March this year, the district reported 38 Covid-19 positive cases, which indicates that more than one patient tested positive for the disease per day in a month. According to the district’s health department data, with 100 positive cases reported in April, the daily average rose to more than three patients in that month. As 315 positive cases were reported in May, it was over 10 patients per day. In June, it went to nearly 62 patients per day, with 1,851 positive cases reported in that month. But in July, the average daily positives climbed up to nearly 94 cases.The district administration said the rising numbers can be attributed to an increase in testing. “We are focusing on containing the infection as well as early treatment of patients. We have increased our testing manifold. Till July 31, samples of over one lakh people were tested, which is one of the highest testing figures for a district in north India,” Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said. Till April, sample collection figures in the district were not very huge, he added. “But ever since the number of positive cases started mounting up and the government allotted an adequate number of sampling kits, particularly the rapid antigen kits, the speed of sample collection has accelerated. While in June, we tested around 30,000 samples, nearly 50,000 samples were tested in July,” said the DM.The DM added that with the increase in testing, the number of infections has definitely gone up, but the positivity rate has come down to nearly 5% in July (from nearly 6.17 in June), which had reached up to 20% in June one day,” he said.With the case-fatality rate still below 1% in the district, the DM said, the administration has been largely successful in its fight against Covid-19. Till July 31, with a total of 42 deaths (out of 5,205 cases), the fatality ratio stood at nearly 0.80% which came down to 0.77%on August 2 (total 43 deaths).About the sampling rate, the DM said it is around 1,500 per million per day in the district, which is much higher than other districts in Delhi-NCR. “We shall continue with the intensive screening and testing till the spread of deadly virus ends,” he said.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said over 1,500 teams of health department and other volunteers have been conducting surveys in households and identifying high-risk groups, persons with symptoms of Covid-19. “These teams are carrying thermal screening equipment and pulse oximeters for oxygen saturation monitoring. The better we become at comorbidity monitoring and management, the lesser will be our mortality rate,” he said.Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, the medical superintendent of Sharda hospital also agreed that the surveillance in the district has been ramped up since the beginning of July. “If screening and testing are increased, the number of cases rise initially. But after a certain span of time, the graph of positivity rate starts moving downward and that is why, the district now has a very low fatality rate and a moderate positivity rate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-most-deaths-in-july-increased-recoveries-bring-some-relief-to-noida/story-4CGFXr9zIMbqMkyyegpD2M.html

Colleges have been asked to share their inputs by Wednesday. A final decision in this regard would be taken by the department by August 15.In a written directive shared with principals of all colleges, Hemant Verma, the deputy director of higher education department, asked colleges to share their suggestions on delivery of online lectures that would be initiated after completion of the admission process and physical classes in a post-Covid scenario. The decision comes a day after the department asked teaching and non-teaching staff to report back to colleges from Tuesday. Colleges have also been asked to conduct 70% of the yearly lectures online, while the remaining lectures can be conducted physically once the situation improves. Pooja Khullar, principal of the Dronacharya Government College, said that the staff would be reporting to work from Tuesday ahead of initiation of admissions and the new academic session. “The college has been sanitised once again ahead of the reopening of colleges for all staff. We expect guidelines regarding the online admission process by this week. Work is already being carried out in full swing as we prepare for admissions,” said Khullar.Ahead of the reopening of colleges, principals of the colleges that are being used in different capacities by the district administration have sought clarity from the admin on the way forward.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, which was being used as a quarantine facility, said he has written to the district administration asking them to handover the college premises. “We have informed the admin that colleges need to open from Tuesday in line with the directions from the department of higher education. Accordingly, they should either handover the college premises after sanitisation or make an alternative site available to us,” said Yadav. Vijay Adlakha, principal, Government Girls’ College, Sector 14, which was being used as a neighbourhood shelter, said that he had written to the administration apprising them about the development regarding the opening of colleges and had sought assistance. “We have requested the administration to let us know if the college premises can be handed back to us. If not, we will have to make other arrangements,” said Adlakha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-higher-education-dept-asks-colleges-on-options-for-holding-classes/story-vM7rqUCXW1JDBbVTr5mt1J.html

03-08-2020||Gurugram||Assault over beef suspicion: 3policemen suspended; case transferred to crime branch||Three policemen were suspended on Sunday for failing to take action on the spot against a group of men who had allegedly stopped and beaten up a 25-year-old man with rods and hammer in Badshahpur area on the alleged suspicion that he was ferrying beef.On Saturday, the station house officer (SHO) of Badshahpur police station, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place, was transferred to police lines for negligence of duty and for failing to control the situation. The case has now been transferred from Badshahpur police station to the crime branch, police said. Investigators added that ten to 11 other suspects, who were involved in the incident, have been identified and several teams were conducting raids to arrest them. On Sunday, the crime branch of sector 10 nabbed a second suspect, Mahesh, 30, from his house in Rithoj village after a tip-off. Police said prima facie, Mahesh did not have a criminal record and works with a brick dealer. The police had earlier arrested one Pradeep Yadav, 28, a resident of Rajeev Nagar in the case. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Three police officials, who were present at the spot while the victim was being assaulted, have been suspended and a departmental enquiry will be conducted against them. The action was taken for negligence of duty and failing to take action. An attempt to murder charge (section 307of Indian Penal Code) was added to the FIR and the suspect have been booked.” In several videos that started floating online on Friday, the suspects could be seen assaulting and kicking the victim, identified as Lukman, 25, as more than a dozen policemen looked on and tried to disperse a crowd. In a video, the victim is seen sitting cross legged while a man repeatedly kicks him in the face. In another video, as police are trying to push back a crowd from the truck, a man in a brown t-shirt could be seen lunging and hitting a rock on the truck’s windshield while some policemen lead the victim to a police car. The suspects are even spotted trying to force the victim out of the police vehicle. Meanwhile, the family of Lukman on Sunday alleged that the suspects continued to beat him up despite repeated pleas stating that he was transporting buffalo meat. Lukman’s father, Bilal, said, “Lukman pleaded with them to let him go and told them that he was ferrying buffalo meat. He even told them that if it was proved that he had beef in his truck, they would be free to hit him. But no one listened. They continued to beat him with rods and a hammer. He started praying but the suspects forced him to chant ‘Jai Siya Ram’. The suspects also threatened to burn him alive.” His family said that after initial check up at the civil hospital, Lukman was taken to a private hospital in Gurugram but they got him discharged since they could not afford the treatment there. Lukman has now been admitted to a hospital in Nuh. Lukman’s first cousin, Ehsan, said, He was beaten up by a group of people at two spots, in front of several policemen . Yet the suspects managed to get away. In the videos, it can be seen that the armed suspects were trying to push him out of the vehicle, abusing him and hitting him repeatedly while policemen just stood by and watched.” Responding to the allegations, the Gurugram police in a statement, said, “It has been made clear that such illegal activities will not be tolerated in the city by district administration and strict action would be taken against anyone who takes law into their own hands. The timely intervention by Gurugram police saved the life of the victim. We took him to a hospital too, from where he was treated and discharged after two hours. We are further taking care of him.” The incident took place around 9.30 am on Friday when Lukman, a native of Ghasera village in Nuh, was transporting buffalo in his pick-up truck to a shop near Jama Masjid. In the FIR registered at Badshahpur police station on Friday, Lukman had said, “ As I reached near a traffic signal in Badshahpur, several men on 4-5 motorcycles started following me. They tried to stop my vehicle but I sped towards Jama Masjid. A few lanes away from the mosque, near the Trunk Market, the men cornered me and assaulted me with rods. They broke the window panes of the truck. They took me to Jail road in Badshahpur and assaulted me, before a police team rescued me.” Police said that the arrested suspect, Mahesh, told the police that he and his aides suspected that the complainant was carrying cow meat in his pick-up truck and tried to stop him. A police official from crime branch, requesting anonymity, said, “The meat recovered from the truck was sent to the laboratory for testing and the results are still awaited.” KK Rao, police commissioner, Gurugram, said, “Strict action would be taken against anyone who tries to disrupt harmony. If any negligent conduct is found on part of the police, action will be duly taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/assault-over-beef-suspicion-3policemen-suspended-case-transferred-to-crime-branch/story-hnieExaI4E756Cyn2a38NO.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A mask in the crowd||So much has changed in just a few months. Auto rickshaw driver Shah Hasan barely manages to register the individuality of his customers anymore. “They’re always in masks.... a series of masks getting in and out of my auto,” he says, shaking his head. The gentleman is actually referring to masks as naqab, which means veil in Urdu.In his late 50s, Mr Hasan himself is in a mask. All one sees is his long unwieldy white beard, spreading out from under his “naqab” like a king’s rebellious subjects too stubborn to do his bidding.This time of the year tends to be very hot and also very humid, and the sweaty-faced Mr Hasan often struggles with the temptation of getting rid of his mask, he confesses. But then he remembers his promise to Hamsareen, his wife. After the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, she let him go out into the virus-ridden world under the condition that he would be wearing the mask at all times. “Poor woman, she was silently shedding tears when I first left home to drive the auto,” says Mr Hasan, recalling that just before he stepped out of their home in Northeast Delhi’s Bhalswa Dairy neighbourhood, his wife made a quick prayer while standing in the doorway. But the lady didn’t leave her husband’s protection to the higher power alone. “Every morning she herself re-fixes this plastic,” says Mr Hasan, gesturing towards the plastic sheet that separates him from the auto’s passenger seat. “It was her idea... she says that this way, even if a customer has corona and sneezes or coughs, the bimari (sickness) won’t reach me.”Initially, Hamsareen herself would stitch masks by the dozens for him as well as for her three sons, but later she turned to buying masks from chemist shops, once a relative told her on phone of their “double-proof safety”.To be sure, his wife had implored him to give up the profession until the world gets a teeka (vaccine) against corona. They could live off the earnings of their sons—this was her argument. “But I’m khuddar,” Mr Hasan says, insisting on the sanctity of his self-respect. “As long as I’m able to stand on my two feet, I should be able to feed at least myself and my woman.”He pauses before speaking up again: “The world cannot stop because of a bimari... one has to live, to earn, to keep having self-respect. One also has to take risks.”Every night, as the auto driver reaches home, he goes straight to wash himself, and changes into a clean ironed set of white salwar kurta and a clean white topi. His wife washes his grey uniform and the white topi he had been wearing during the day so that it is ready to be worn the next morning.Now the auto driver makes a revelation: “At times, I’m desperate to air the lips (he uses the Hindi phrase “hawa dena”)... so when there’s no one around, I take off the mask for a minute.” Mr Hasan’s bearded cheeks seem to expand under the mask, perhaps he is smiling. “And then it feels like AC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-mask-in-the-crowd/story-pJFI6ObW1vbZ36CUzb3mtO.html
03-08-2020||City||Gurugram: 30,000 city residents get water bills for the first time||Gurugram: For more than 30,000 people of the city, this week was the first time they received water bills from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), said officials Sunday. These 30,000 consumers are part of a list of 3.3 lakh residents that the civic body is aiming to start sending bills to, MCG officials said.Since June, however, using its property tax records, which has 3.97 lakh residents registered, MCG has tried to regularise water connections in the city.Officials said that 30,000 were sent quarterly water bills in the first phase of this process, and their bills were tabulated based on flat rates.As per officials privy to the matter, another reason for sending water bills was to encourage residents to get water metres installed in their households.“On an average, water bills on flat rates are usually 20-30% higher than the actual consumption. As residents are paying at a higher rate than their usage, it will encourage them to get their connections metered,” said an MCG official privy to the matter, asking not to be named.Under the flat rates, consumption of the first 20 kilolitres is charged at Rs 8 per kilolitre and for every kilolitre thereafter, the charges are Rs 10.In January 2018, MCG started taking over more than 40 residential sectors of Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). As part of the process, HSVP’s water connections were also transferred to MCG. Until last month, the MCG’s water supply wing had water connection records of only 67,000 consumers.“Regulating water connections and installing water meters are of utmost importance as it will not only encourage residents to conserve water, thus ensuring lower bills, but will also help us keep a check on illegal water connections. This will further help us analyse the exact amount of water required for the city, and see if there is a surplus or deficit in supply,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.In ten years the demand for water is projected to increase by four times in the city.As per a July 2019 estimate by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), the city’s daily demand will increase from 400 million litres per day (MLD) to 1,650 MLD.Gurugram gets its water supply from the Yamuna River through a 71 km canal from Kakroi, located near Sonipat.GMDA is currently working on increasing the existing length of the canal by another 3.5 kilometre by building a concrete canal that will further augment the city’s water supply by another 60%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-30-000-city-residents-get-water-bills-for-the-first-time/story-rw8S4nWRq1kzjHhWZs2vmO.html
03-08-2020||City||DHBVN officials, farm house owner booked illegal supply of electricity||The Faridabad Police has booked six people, including the owner of a farm house, for allegedly stealing electricity from a high-tension wire of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (DHBVNL) and supplying it through underground cables to 45 farmhouses in Uttar Pradesh. No arrests have been made so far, said the police. As per the police, Illegal supply of electricity was provided to the farm houses in Greater Noida from Sector 66 of Faridabad. Police said, 11,000 lines were supplied and 24 transformers were running on these connections. The DHBVN has imposed a fine of ₹1.04 crore against the main accused, Pradeep Tyagi, owner of the Faridabad farm house, who had been stealing electricity. A case under sections 136 and 137 of the Electricity Act 2003; sections 120 B (conspiracy), 204 (destruction of document ) and 463(forgery) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 7 and 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 was registered at Bhupani Police station in Faridabad. The suspects have been identified as former sub-divisional officer (SDO) Sandeep Kundu, ex-junior engineer (JE) Nishant Rohilla, JE Jai Jitendra Singh, outsourced staff Devi Ram and Kanhaiya Lal, and Pradeep Tyagi, a resident of village Dadasiya. The commissioner of police of Faridabad, O P Singh, said that a raid was conducted by the DHBVN officials on July 16, 19 and 22 in village Kirawali situated across Yamuna river, after the authority received a tip-off. “On July 14, director of operations of DHBVN received information about the theft of electricity, following which a team was formed under the leadership of XEN (energy audit) Shamsher Singh, along with SDO (energy audit) Ajit Kumar, SDO Upendera Kumar, and other officials from the department,” he said. Singh said according to the inspection team a spot check conducted at the site revealed that high tension line erected by DHBVN across the banks of Yamuna for supply of electricity to Pradeep Tyagi was being illegally tapped beneath a 100-KVA transformer installed at the site by using an underground three-core 11 KV XLPE 70mm cable. The line was connected to an alien parallel distribution network of iron and tubular poles spread outside the licence area or the jurisdiction of DHBVN into Uttar Pradesh . “The electricity connection issued to Tyagi was for 15-KW load, which could be catered through a 25-KVA transformer. The 25-KVA transformer had been illegally changed into a 100-KVA transformer to increase the capacity that would enable the supply of stolen electricity to more premises. The alien distribution network, among other infrastructure, consisted of 24 step-down transformers of 100-KVA and 25-KVA capacities,” he said. The police said it was also discovered later that out of these transformers, 23 step-down transformers did not bear any identification plate recording the ownership details, make, or the year of manufacturing. All these transformers were used to provide supply of electricity to the occupants of at least 45 farm houses in Uttar Pradesh, said the police. The electricity meter installed at the premises of Tyagi was lying disconnected beneath the 100-KVA transformer and his premises were directly connected to the distribution network bypassing the meter. The DHBVN officials recovered the meter and the original LT cable that was installed to connect the meter. “The recovery shows that the poles were DHBVN’s property and were stolen by the suspects in connivance with DHVBN officers and employees, who have been booked for the conspiracy. This fraud not only leads to revenue loss but is also against the law,” he said Singh said neither Tyagi’s farm house nor the 45 other farm houses have any legal electricity connection from the concerned distribution licensee of Uttar Pradesh. In fact, the distribution licensee of Uttar Pradesh had disconnected the supply of electricity to the 45 farm houses sometime in 2013-2014, after which the owners of these farm houses arranged for the installation of the high tension line and associated infrastructure across the Yamuna river for the illegal supply of electricity. The police have formed teams who are investigating the matter further.Shamsher Singh, XEN (energy audit) of DHBVN of Hisar said that they have estimated that the amount of electricity stolen was around 220 KV and during preliminary investigation they have found that three former and two present employees were involved in the theft. “After taking the stock of the situation, a case was registered against the farm house owner and officials,” he said . Subhash Chand, SHO, irrigation and electricity police station, said that they have served notice to owners of 44 farm houses of Greater Noida and have given them ultimatum of seven days to pay a fine of ₹1.04 crore, failing which they would be arrested. Police said that the fraud came in notice after an employee of one of the farm houses, whose salary was deducted , informed DHBVN office (Hisar range) and narrated the entire matter, following which a team from the Hisar office conducted an initial probe on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dhbvn-officials-farm-house-owner-booked-illegal-supply-of-electricity/story-bmtvCJtkBkaGjGXx24TIAP.html
03-08-2020||City||Delhi govt-funded colleges in DU struggle to pay staff salaries, bills||Twelve Delhi University (DU) colleges fully funded by the Delhi government are struggling to pay salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff, and electricity and other bills, for the last three months due to the shortage of funds. Officials at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College (DDU) said their phone and internet connections were disconnected as they could not pay the dues for four months. While some of these colleges have paid salaries to their teaching staff for the month of May by diverting funds from other accounts, majority of them are yet to pay salaries for the last three months. Although the Delhi government said it has released funds for salaries, officials at these colleges said the money is “insufficient”. A senior official in the government’s finance department said there is a major shortage of funds because of the pandemic.“Revenues have dropped. The Capital recorded revenue collections of less than 40% for the first four months of the financial year 2020-21 compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Till June, the government was facing difficulties even in paying salaries of employees. Large portions of funds were utilised in Covid management. The government has sought financial assistance of Rs 5,000 crore from the Centre but it is yet to receive any amount,” the official quoted above said. Hem Chand Jain, principal of DDU, said their phone and internet connections were disconnected and electricity connection will be snapped soon. “The college has Rs 17.6 crore deficit of which Rs 8 crore is required for the payment of salaries. The Delhi government has already paid Rs 2.3 crore twice in March and April but it was not sufficient. Our monthly expenditure on salary payment is Rs 2.7 crore. We could not pay salaries to our teaching and non-teaching staff since May. How can the government think we would be able to meet all expenditures with such an insufficient fund?” he said.Jain said the college could not pay electricity bills, property tax and other pending expenditures since April. “We are getting repeated calls from the electricity board. We could not pay the electricity bill for the last four months and now we have to pay Rs 40 lakh together. We are soon going to lose the connection if the amount is not paid at the earliest. It will be a big issue since we have staff and some international students living at the campus,” he said.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “We have already released the salary funds but the government is also short of funds.”A similar situation prevails in other 11 colleges, including Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Shaheed Rajguru College for Applied Sciences for Women, Maharaja Agrasen College and Acharya Narendra Dev College. There are around 1,200 teaching and 900 non-teaching staff members employed on a permanent basis in these colleges, other than the contractual staff.DU’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said the university had written to the Delhi government several times in the last three months over the issue. “In April, the colleges had a backlog of previous months. The funds received were also insufficient. If the college required Rs 7 crore, only Rs 2 crore was transferred to them. How is it even possible for the colleges to function in such circumstances,” he said.Ravi Toteja, principal of Acharya Narendra Dev College, said, “We could not pay salaries to our teaching and non-teaching staff members since April. We are yet to pay our electricity and other bills. Our connection can be disconnected anytime soon.”Beside salaries and bills, these colleges are struggling to maintain infrastructure and other facilities. Payal Mago, principal of Shaheed Rajguru College for Applied Sciences for Women, said, “The college has a sewage treatment plant at its campus. Due to the non-payment of salaries, the PWD removed the technician looking after the plant and now sewer water is flowing all over the campus. But we do not have funds to fix it.” The college paid electricity bills till last month, diverting funds from students’ funds.DU Teachers’ Association president Rajib Ray said, “It’s absolutely inhuman that our colleagues working in these colleges are unpaid for the last three months. The government should immediately release all pending funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-funded-colleges-in-du-struggle-to-pay-staff-salaries-bills/story-swkF8YqCuOQJ2ah6wLoG4J.html

03-08-2020||Delhi||Two men held for posing as DSIIDC staffers, duping people of over Rs8 crore||The Delhi Police have arrested two men who allegedly posed as employees of the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (DSIIDC) and duped several people on the pretext of allotting them industrial land at steep costs. Police said the men have so far duped people of at least Rs8 crore. Luxury cars and a flat they bought with the cheated money have been seized, the police said.The two arrested men are Vikram Saxena, 34, who has also been involved in a case of cheating in Delhi previously, and Saxena’s brother-in-law Mudit Kumar, 38. Kumar is a law graduate and was enrolled as a member at the Allahabad bar council. Two years ago, he came to Delhi and started practising law at Patiala house court. He has no previous criminal involvements, police said.DSIIDC is an agency responsible for several major infrastructure projects in the national capital.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said that in March and February this year, the law-enforcement agency had received multiple complaints at the Connaught Place police station, all of them alleging they were duped by two men from DSIIDC who took hefty sums from them, promising to allot industrial land in the city. “A core team was set up to probe the fraud. An initial probe revealed that the two suspects met all the targets at coffee shops in Connaught Place near the DSIIDC office. By showing them fake allotment papers, the duo took money in demand drafts and cash. People had even paid up to Rs1.8 crore,” Singhal said. He added, following months of enquiry and technical surveillance, the teams succeeded in locating Saxena in Dehradun. “Our team raided his Dehradun hideout on July 20, and arrested him. Based on information he provided us, we arrested Mudit Kumar from Saharanpur on July 27,” he said.The two used to provide receipts against the payments received. “The two have confessed to have duped people of at least Rs8 crore,” Singhal added.“The DSIIDC itself suggested the victims approach the police, and have ourselves lodged a complaint with the Connaught Place police station,” a senior DSIIDC official said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-men-held-for-posing-as-dsiidc-staffers-duping-people-of-over-8-crore/story-E6nLOWS7o5qz1m3ECWJ4UO.html
03-08-2020||Delhi||Man who killed taxi driver to sell his vehicle nabbed, hunt on for others||Delhi Police on Sunday arrested a man and claimed to have busted a gang that booked outstation cabs from Delhi before murdering the driver and fleeing with his vehicle and other valuables.Police said the arrested suspect, identified as Vikas Tomar, killed a taxi driver in June this year and might have been involved in a similar murder in 2008. Investigators said they had launched efforts to arrest other members of the gang and were trying to ascertain if they were involved in multiple murders. Tomar, police said, is a resident of Baghpat in UP. He is a graduate and is married two kids.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) PK Mishra said that on June 15 a missing persons report was lodged by the family members of a cab driver Pradeep Singhal, 35, of Vijay Vihar, Rohini. the family alleged that Singhal had gone missing on June 12 along with his taxi.“A search operation was started and after checking call details and a number of CCTV footages, we received information about a body that was recovered in Rabupura district of Gautam Buddha Nagar, which resembled Singhal. The body was later positively identified as that of Singhal by his family. A case of murder was registered and investigations started,” Mishra said.During preliminary probe, when police teams scanned through Singhal’s call details, they zeroed down on three suspicious mobile phone numbers. “Following days of surveillance we managed to identify the prime suspect as VikasTomar, who may have been previously involved in a murder case of a taxi driver in 2008 and is currently out on bail. His hideouts were raided and we finally managed to arrest him on July 26,” Mishra said.The DCP said Tomar led the police team to the spot where he had dumped Singhal’s body. Further, on Tomar’s instance, we also recovered the taxi from Kaushambi, Uttar Pradesh that he was trying to sell through his associates in UP but failed, Mishra said.The officer said, during interrogation Tomar confessed to having killed Singhal. “He said he and his associates booked the taxi for Meerut through an app based cab service provider on June 12. On their way they befriended the cab driver Singhal and got him drunk. When Singhal was inebriated, they bludgeoned him to death and dumped his body in a canal. They then took the taxi to Kanpur to sell it for Rs 2 lakh. He also confessed that he had looted a taxi in a similar way by murdering a taxi driver in 2008,” the DCP said, adding that they’re also probing if Tomar is involved in multiple murders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-who-killed-taxi-driver-to-sell-his-vehicle-nabbed-hunt-on-for-others/story-azQ6fjIIBVR5f7cIi9g4vN.html
03-08-2020||City||Palghar villagers climb trees in search of mobile network||Residents of Ujjaini, Akhada, Mangrol, Ogdha, Panchghar and other hamlets in Wada taluka of Palghar district are coping with a communication nightmare. The villagers are forced to climb on top of the trees in search of mobile network to talk to their near and dear ones. “The students of Class 10 and 12 also had to climb trees to check their results online,” said Ramesh Patil, a resident of Wada. The village gram panchayats have written to all service providers regarding the network issues, but so far none of the companies has responded, said Vasant Bhoir, another resident.“The villagers are compelled to climb tall trees. There is a risk of falling, losing life or inviting fractures, especially during the monsoon. But there is no other way,” said Patil. The villagers, however, choose only those trees that have strong branches and are tall so that there is less risk, he added. Pravin Kuwara, a resident of Akhada village, said that while the young can climb trees, senior citizens in the village are helpless. “Youngsters risk their lives and climb the trees to talk over phones, but for senior citizens these phones are merely used as a torch to traverse through the forest,” he said.Another resident who travels 6 kms everyday to access network said, “We are being cheated by the big mobile service providers. They are ignoring the rural areas and are not installing towers here. Everyday is a struggle for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-villagers-climb-trees-in-search-of-mobile-network/story-SGAVyBUMVaucDJZp3G9tXN.html
03-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case: Patna SP in Mumbai to supervise probe||For the investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, Vinay Kumar Tiwari, superintendent of police of Patna city, arrived in Mumbai on Sunday, amid reports that the Mumbai police was not cooperating with the four-member special investigation team (SIT) from Bihar which arrived five days ago. The SIT was formed after Rajput’s father filed a case of abetment to suicide against Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.Tiwari said, “It is not right to say that there is no coordination between the Bihar and Mumbai police. This investigation requires supervision of a senior officer, which is why I have been sent. So far, there are no plans to arrest Chakraborty. When we feel the need to question Chakraborty, we will do it.”He said the Patna police had not received case-related documents from the Mumbai Police yet and he would try and get access to the documents.Anil Deshmukh, home minister of Maharashtra on Sunday, tweeted, “Mumbai Police already began investigating allegations about Sushant’s unfortunate alleged suicide. Even if Bihar Police registered an offence in Patna, under Chapter 12 (information to the police and their powers to investigate) and 13 (jurisdiction of criminal courts in inquiries and trials) of the CrPC, it has to be investigated, inquired & tried by police & courts within whose jurisdiction the offence is committed. I condemn the demand for the Sushant case to be handed to CBI. The case is now being politcised for political gains. Maharashtra Police is inquiring into the case professionally & are competent in digging out the truth, leaving no stone unturned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/patna-sp-in-mumbai-to-supervise-probe/story-V50TXagdVnXXvpKOnu9RMK.html
03-08-2020||India||Raksha Bandhan 2020: Denizens prefer online rakhis for variety and quirk factor||Great variety, quirky themes, no hassle of going to the market — more so considering the social distancing norms put in place — online rakhis are a hit this season. And given that there’s something for everyone in the online world, why wouldn’t they be! So ahead of Raksha Bandhan (August 3), here’s your guide to which rakhi to choose for your sibling:Gurugram-based Upasana Mahatani, shares, “I have bought rakhi online for the first time for my brother in New York, USA. One of our entrepreneur moms was selling some adorable food rakhis, so we ordered those.” Pawan Gadia, CEO, Retail & Online, Ferns N Petals, India, UAE & Singapore, shares, “We have come up with 1,000 plus trendy designs of rakhis this year, and some of the unique offerings are agate rakhi, food trails rakhi, etc. We get over 10k orders every day, and deliver in over 80 countries.”Another Gurugram resident, Astuti Bhatnagar, says, “I want simple rakhis for my brothers and elegant ones for my bhabhis. The kind they can wear for more than a day. I have seen a few entrepreneurs selling some really cool ones, and I’m going to order them online.”A Delhiite, Sakshi Jain, says, “I haven’t really thought of venturing out to the markets this year to buy rakhis. I will order them online or will ask my daughters to make them. Although, we did use the online service this time to send rakhis to my brother in the USA.”Abhir Bhalla, a student from a Haryana-based university, says, “Since I wanted to avoid visiting the market because of the pandemic, I decided to order it online. It’s convenient because you can choose from all the options in one place. It’s just like ordering clothes and groceries online; something many of us have shifted to in recent times.” Shivika Mathur, an Udaipur-based student, bought a stethoscope rakhi online for her doctor brother. She says, “I was bored of buying rakhis from the market and wanted a fun design. The quality is top-notch, and you can wear it for a long time too. The variety and pricing are great as well.”Jaipur-based Pallavi Maroo says, “I prefer buying rakhis online or at exhibitions as they are unique and not available in local shops. Since there are no exhibitions this year, I bought cubic zirconia (CZ) stone rakhis online.”Delhi-based Priyansha Sharma has bought a dumbbell shaped rakhi for her brother. “It is perfect for him as he’s a gym and fitness enthusiast.

03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says TikTok must sell US operations by September 15 or close||President Donald Trump said TikTok will have to close its U.S. operations by Sept. 15 unless there’s a deal to sell the social media network’s American operations.He said that he’s okay with the idea of Microsoft Corp. buying TikTok -- as the company has said it’s negotiating to do -- and that there would have to be a substantial payment to the U.S. as part of the deal.Trump set off a furious scramble over the fate of the Chinese-owned app on Friday, when he said he would ban the company’s operations through an executive action on Saturday. But the weekend passed without any official move from the White House, after the president spoke with Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella about his company’s efforts to purchase the viral video application.Microsoft said in a blog post that it was aiming to complete a deal for TikTok’s operations in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, no later than Sept. 15. The White House had insisted upon that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. It could prove an uphill climb, with key details for the deal -- including price -- still not worked out, people familiar with the discussions said.The White House has said it’s concerned that TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., could be compelled to hand over American users’ data to Beijing or use the app to influence the 165 million Americans, and more than 2 billion users globally, who have downloaded it. And Trump has looked to ratchet up pressure on China ahead of November’s election, frustrated by slow implementation of the trade pact inked earlier this year and the spread of the coronavirus for which he blames China.Trump RallyTeenagers opposed to the president have also used the app to disrupt the president’s campaign activities, including signing up for tickets to the president’s first rally since the beginning of the pandemic, in Tulsa. Attendance at the late June event was far below expectations, and Trump hasn’t held another rally since.In its blog post, Microsoft pledged to add more security, privacy and digital safety protections to the TikTok app and ensure that all private data of Americans be transferred back to the U.S. and deleted from servers outside the country. The company also said it may invite other American investors to take minority stakes in the company.“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns,” the company said. “It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.”Still, U.S. lawmakers and administration officials have favored shutting down the application altogether to send a message to China after Beijing restricted American companies like Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. White House adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said in a pair of interviews with CNN and Fox News that he wasn’t sure Microsoft was the right company to buy TikTok’s U.S. operations, saying it had helped China construct its internet firewall.“Should we trust any company that operates in China?” Navarro told Fox News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-tiktok-must-sell-us-operations-by-september-15-or-close/story-wu95VrlxrOT3cdahAJ2EJM.html
03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump bars US government agencies from outsourcing to foreign workers||President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday that bars federal government agencies from displacing American nationals and citizens with foreign workers. It also calls for prohibiting American employers from using H-1B workers to displace Americans in outsourcing contracts. Indians have been largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme. The White House said in a statement the order will “create a policy where Federal agencies will focus on United States labor in lucrative Federal contracts” as it will be :unfair” for federal government agencies to “ replace perfectly qualified Americans with workers from other countries”.All federal agencies will conduct an internal audit following to order to ensure “only United States citizens and nationals are appointed to the competitive service.”.The executive order also enjoins upon the department of labor, which is responsible for ensuring the fairness of the process of hiring foreign workers, to “finalize guidance to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers’ job sites to displace Americans workers”, in what is called third-arty locations, essentially the practice of outsourcing using foreign workers on H-1B.“President Trump’s actions will help combat employers’ misuse of H-1B visas, which were never intended to replace qualified American workers with low-cost foreign labor,” said the White House.The is a follow-up of the April 2017 “Buy American, Hire American” executive order that unleashed a series of ongoing steps and measures bringing unprecedented scrutiny and tightening of the H-1B visa programme that has been in the crosshairs of the administration’s immigration hardliners.Indian hired by US companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon and US subsidiaries of Indian IT forms Infosys, TCS and Wipro are the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 that are issued every year.A response is awaited from Nasscom, which represents the Indian IT industry.The immediate provocation for the Monday order is the decision in May for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest federally owned power provider, to outsource 20% of its highly skilled tech workers to Accenture, Capgemini and CGI, that are based in Ireland, France and Canada respectively.The White House said TVA’s action could lead to the firing of 200 highly-skilled American tech workers, who will be replaced by “low-wage, foreign workers hired on temporary work visas.” and cost the local economy tens of millions of dollars in the coming 5 years.“So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board,” Trump said at a White House event to sign the order, where he also said he was pushing for the firing of the TVA CEO Jeff Lyash. “If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words ‘you’re fired. You’re fired’.”The Trump administration said outsourcing of hundreds of workers was “especially detrimental in the middle of a pandemic”, which has led to millions of job-losses. Trump has also suspended the H-1B visa programme — as well as Green Cards — to ensure Americans get the first shot at jobs becoming available now as the economy struggles to get back to normalcy, from record job losses.It also sought to frame the practice of outsourcing, with a new twists, asa “national security risk”, if linked to IT jobs that involve sensitive information. The reference was probably to the country’s growing estrangement from China, which the Trump administration has accused of theft of intellectual property rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-bars-us-government-agencies-from-outsourcing-to-foreign-workers/story-ifzkwfjOBL1Uq3zYFqtaeL.html
03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump takes disciplinary action against TVA leadership||President Donald Trump said Monday that he had fired the chair of the Tennessee Valley Authority claiming it has betrayed American workers.Trump told reporters at the White House that he was formally removing the authority’s chair of the board and another member of the board and threatened to remove other board members if they keep hiring foreign labor.The TVA is a federally owned corporation created in 1933 to provide flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing and economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region that was hard hit by the Great Depression. The region covers most of Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Kentucky as well as small sections of Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.He said the TVA board must immediately hire a new chief executive officer that “puts the interests of Americans first.”U.S. Tech Workers, a nonprofit that wants to limit visas given to foreign technology workers, took out an ad to persuade Trump to stop the TVA from outsourcing much of its information technology division. The group, led by Kevin Lynn, criticized the TVA for furloughing its own workers and replacing them with contractors using foreign workers with H-1B visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-takes-disciplinary-action-against-tva-leadership/story-OdhBwVByFlPY4QYhIjNwCN.html

03-08-2020||World||Sorry, boomers: Millennials and younger are new US majority||Sorry, boomers. Millennials and their younger siblings and children now make up a majority of the U.S. population.A new analysis by the Brookings Institution shows that 50.7% of U.S. residents were under age 40, as of July 2019.The Brookings’ analysis of population estimates released this summer by the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the combined millennial, Generation Z and younger generations numbered 166 million people. The combined Generation X, baby boomer, and older cohorts represented 162 million U.S. residents.“To many Americans — especially baby boomers themselves — this news may come as a shock. For them, the term “millennial” has been associated with a youthful, often negative, vibe in terms of habits, ideology, and politics,” William Frey, a senior fellow at Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, wrote in the analysis. “Now, the oldest millennial is 39, and with their numbers exceeding those of baby boomers, the millennial generation is poised to take over influential roles in business and government.”Those under age 40 are more diverse than the older cohorts, with almost half identifying as being part of a racial or ethnic minority. Past surveys show that the younger generations split from the older generations on issues such as immigration reform, criminal justice reform and environmental protection, and the pandemic and recent racial justice protests are likely to galvanize the younger groups to promote an array of progressive causes, Frey wrote.Millennials typically are defined as being born between 1981 and 1996. Baby boomers, long considered a primary driver of demographic and social change in the U.S. because of their large numbers, were born between the end of World War II and the arrival of the Beatles in the U.S. in 1964.Squeezed between the boomers and millennials, Generation Xers were born in the late 1960s and 1970s. Members of Generation Z were born after 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sorry-boomers-millennials-and-younger-are-new-us-majority/story-UeAVKvjCrrAmVjzou3MkMJ.html

Officials fear children could become coronavirus carriers, infecting relatives at home. Students will not return to classrooms until the government’s version of a stoplight to evaluate the pandemic’s risk is safely at green.In remote indigenous communities, instruction will be carried on government radio.

03-08-2020||World||Anxious WHO implores world to ‘do it all’ in long war on Covid-19||The World Health Organization warned on Monday that there might never be a “silver bullet” for Covid-19 in the form of a perfect vaccine and that the road to normality would be long, with some countries requiring a reset of strategy.More than 18.14 million people around the world are reported to have been infected with the disease and 688,080​ have died, according to a Reuters tally, with some nations that thought they were over the worst experiencing a resurgence.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and WHO emergencies head Mike Ryan exhorted nations to rigorously enforce health measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, hand-washing and testing.“The message to people and governments is clear: ‘Do it all’,” Tedros told a virtual news briefing from the U.N. body’s headquarters in Geneva. He said face masks should become a symbol of solidarity round the world.“A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection. However, there’s no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be.”The WHO head said that, while the coronavirus was the biggest health emergency since the early 20th century, the international scramble for a vaccine was also “unprecedented”.But he underscored uncertainties. “There are concerns that we may not have a vaccine that may work, or its protection could be for just a few months, not more. But until we finish the clinical trials, we will not know.”“THE WAY OUT IS LONG”Ryan said countries with high transmission rates, including Brazil and India, needed to brace for a big battle: “The way out is long and requires a sustained commitment,” he said, calling for a “reset” of approach in some places.“Some countries are really going to have to take a step back now and really take a look at how they are addressing the pandemic within their national borders,” he added.Asked about the U.S. outbreak, which White House coronavirus experts say is entering a “new phase”, he said officials seemed to have set out the “right path” and it was not the WHO’s job to do so.The WHO officials said an advance investigation team had concluded its China mission and laid out the groundwork for further efforts to identify the origins of the virus.The study is one of the demands made by top donor the United States which plans to leave the body next year, accusing it of being too acquiescent to China.A larger, WHO-led team of Chinese and international experts is planned next, including in the city of Wuhan, although the timing and composition of that was unclear. Ryan said China had already given some information but knowledge gaps remained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anxious-who-implores-world-to-do-it-all-in-long-war-on-covid-19/story-2Hs7NNpsO9oEXjSX99NQ9N.html
03-08-2020||World||Beijing accuses US of harassing Chinese students, researchers||China on Monday accused the United States of “monitoring, harassing and willfully detaining” Chinese students and researchers in the U.S.Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin’s comments follow the denial of a bail request in California for a university researcher accused of lying about her ties to China’s military and governing Communist Party to gain access to the United States.Wang also criticized the Trump administration for imposing sanctions on a major paramilitary organization in the country’s western Xinjiang region and on two officials for alleged human rights abuses against ethnic and religious minorities.Wang said China had no intention of helping Juan Tang escape from the United States, but did not otherwise comment directly on the accusations against her.However, he said China urges the U.S. to “handle the case fairly in accordance with the law and ensure the safety and legitimate rights and interests” due to Tang.“For some time, the U.S., with ideological prejudice, keeps monitoring, harassing and willfully detaining Chinese students and researchers, and making presumptions of guilt against Chinese researchers,” Wang said.“The U.S. actions have seriously violated the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and severely disrupted the normal cultural and personnel exchanges between China and the U.S., which amounts to outright political persecution,” he said.In denying bail, U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Barnes said Tang, 37, would have reason to leave the country if released. Tang has been held without bail since July 23 when she was arrested after she left the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco to seek medical care for her asthma.Tang, who has a doctorate in cellular biology, entered the United States on Dec. 27, 2019, to work at the University of California, Davis, as a visiting researcher in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Alexandra Negin, an assistant federal public defender, said in her filing asking the court for her release on bail. The lab closed because of the coronavirus pandemic and Tang had been preparing to return to China, Negin said.Tang and three other scientists living in the U.S. face charges of lying about their status as members of China’s People’s Liberation Army, or PLA. All were charged with visa fraud, the Justice Department said.Tang was the last of the four to be arrested after the Justice Department accused the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco of harboring a known fugitive.Negin said Tang went to the consulate to seek help and remained there after FBI agents questioned her at her Davis apartment on June 20 and executed a search warrant, seizing her passport and visa.Agents found photographs of Tang in a uniform of the civilian cadre of the PLA and also reviewed articles from China that identified her military affiliation. Negin argued that the evidence against Tang is based on old photographs from when she was a student at a medical school run by the military and documents that were translated on apps.Wang said the U.S. State and Treasury Department penalties targeting the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps “seriously interfered in China’s internal affairs and violated the basic norms of international relations.”The sanctions hit the corps, its commander and former political commissar for alleged abuses against Uighur Muslims, including mass arbitrary detentions, forced labor and torture. They freeze any assets the targets may have in U.S. jurisdictions, and perhaps more significantly, bar Americans from doing business with them,Wang repeated China’s assertion that it has been acting against violence, terrorism and separatism and that “Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, ethnic groups, or religions at all.”China has used that in an attempt to deflect international condemnation of its internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in prison-like camps that it calls re-education and job training centers, along with other abuses.The corps acts like a parallel government in the vast, resource-rich region, operating its own schools, courts and a large network of businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-accuses-us-of-harassing-chinese-students-researchers/story-S54MxY1laLe2tsLdeH9wfM.html
03-08-2020||World||Afghan troops retake prison attacked by IS group; 29 killed||Afghan forces said they retook a prison in the country’s east on Monday afternoon, following an hours-long battle a day after the facility was targeted by the Islamic State group in an attack that killed 29 people. The prison is believed to be holding hundreds of IS members.The attack highlighted the challenges ahead for Afghanistan, even as U.S. and NATO forces begin to withdraw following America striking a peace deal with the Taliban.Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman said the prison was taken back in the afternoon. The fighting also left at least 50 wounded.Even as Afghan troops seized the prison in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, some 115 kilometers (70 miles) east of Kabul, IS militants continued to fire on Afghan security forces from a nearby neighborhood.Sporadic gunfire rang out from nearby residential buildings in central Jalalabad, an area of high security near the provincial governor’s office.As security forces swept through the prison, they found the bodies of two Taliban prisoners apparently killed by the Islamic State group, showing the tensions between the two militant factions battling each other in eastern Afghanistan.The 29 dead included civilians, prisoners, guards and Afghan security forces, said Attaullah Khogyani, the provincial governor’s spokesman.The attack began Sunday, when an Islamic State suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives up to the prison’s main gate, detonating the bomb. Islamic State militants opened fire on the prison’s guards and poured in through the breach.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province and headquartered in Nangarhar province, later claimed responsibility for the attack.Some of the 1,500 prisoners held at the prison in Jalalabad escaped during the fighting. Khyogyani said about 1,000 prisoners who earlier escaped had been found by security forces across the city. It wasn’t immediately clear if any prisoners were still at large.The attack came a day after authorities said Afghan special forces killed a senior Islamic State commander near Jalalabad. Several hundred prisoners in Jalalabad are believed to be Islamic State members.While the Islamic State group has seen its so-called caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria eliminated after a yearslong campaign, the group has continued fighting in Afghanistan. The extremists also have battled the Taliban in the country, whom the U.S. overthrew following the 2001 American-led invasion after the Sept. 11 attacks.The Taliban’s political spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, told The Associated Press that his group was not involved in the Jalalabad attack. The U.S. struck a peace deal with the Taliban in February. A second, crucial round of negotiations between the Taliban and the political leadership in Kabul has yet to start.The Taliban had declared a three-day cease-fire starting last Friday for the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. The cease-fire expired at 12 a.m. Monday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if it would be extended as the U.S. pushes for an early start to intra-Afghan negotiations that have repeatedly been delayed since Washington signed the peace deal with the Taliban.“We have a cease-fire and are not involved in any of these attacks anywhere in the country,” Shaheen said.The Taliban also had denied being involved in a suicide bombing in eastern Logar province late Thursday that killed at least nine people and wounded 40.Afghanistan has seen a recent spike in violence, with most attacks claimed by the local IS affiliate.___Faiez reported from Kabul, Afghanistan.

03-08-2020||World||Pak army tries to corner Supreme Court’s tough judge. It is worried about 2023||Prime Minister Imran Khan and the army’s joint effort to embarrass and oust Supreme Court judge Qazi Faez Isa is driven by the establishment’s 2023 worry when the judge, who has taken a tough line on the army, is slated to be elevated as the country’s Chief Justice. Justice Isa, who was elevated to Pakistan’s top court in 2014, riled the army brass and Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf by his verdicts that have been unsparing of the establishment and Pakistan’s deep state.A 10-judge bench of the Supreme Court on June 19 cancelled a May 2019 presidential reference to the Supreme Court Judicial Council that wanted action against Justice Isa, accusing him of concealing foreign properties of his wife and children in his declaration of assets. But the bench didn’t close the case and ordered the Federal Board of Revenue to probe the charge and send its report to the top court.Last month, Justice Isa’s wife Sarina Isa filed her statement with the Federal Board of Revenue in compliance with the top court order.But she isn’t giving up. Sarina Isa has also challenged this part of the top court’s order, according to a report in Dawn newspaper. It is the fourth review petition filed against the 7-3 majority verdict that ordered tax authorities to probe three offshore properties owned by her and her children. Three bar associations including Pakistan’s Supreme Court Bar Association have filed separate petitions backing the outspoken judge known for his impeccable integrity.Justice Isa, who has mostly let his verdicts do the talking, was equally unsparing when he challenged the presidential reference, wondering why his wife - an independent taxpayer - was treated as his dependent when she paid as much tax as Prime Minister Imran Khan or more.Pakistan watchers say Justice Isa - son of a leading Pakistani politician and a close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah - got on the wrong side of Pakistan’s deep state when he ticked off the powerful armed forces, which have ruled for nearly half of Pakistan’s history and have resumed a more active role in politics in recent years.“The involvement of ISI and of the members of the Armed Forces in politics, media and other ‘unlawful activities’ should have stopped,” the Supreme Court bench, which comprised Qazi Faez Isa along with Justice Mushir Alam said in the February verdict.The judgment ordered the government to prosecute those spreading hate, besides telling the defence minister and the Army chief to initiate action against armed forces for violating their oath. It was a reference to Punjab Rangers director General Major General Azhar Naveed and then head of internal security section of ISI, Major General Faiz Hamid, in negotiating with the cleric to end the Faizabad protest led by a hardline Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik’s that paralysed the capital Islamabad in 2017 .It wasn’t a first for Justice Isa. In 2016, an inquiry commission headed by Justice Isa to investigate a terrorist attack on a hospital in Quetta that killed dozens of lawyers, had severely criticised security agencies and asked the government to act against extremist organisations.Pakistan watchers in Delhi say the army was determined to carry out its plan to remove Justice Isa since he could challenge the authority of Pakistan Army and possibly become one of the power centers in the country when he takes over as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2023.It is not a coincidence that Farogh Naseem, lawyer of former President Gen Pervez Musharraf, who was inducted as law minister at the request of the army in 2018, prepared the reference against Justice Isa, putting the government on a collision course with a segment of the judiciary.“There is a historical context to why the army wants Justice Isa out,” said a Pakistan watcher in the Indian government.Gen Musharrafwas the last Pakistan ruler to have gone this far to browbeat the judiciary back in 2007 when he tried to pressurise then Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry to resign, drew up a presidential reference and then suspended him.Gen Musharraf had to reinstate Chief Justice Chaudhary after thousands of lawyers hit the streets but imposed Emergency a few months later in November 2007 and cracked down on judges and lawyers. His government was routed in the next election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-tries-to-corner-supreme-court-s-tough-judge-it-is-worried-about-2023/story-0YFjzadavRHw7sDrpW5RlO.html

The death toll in the U.S. has reached about 155,000, and cases are rising in numerous states.Dunn’s East Baton Rouge district has asked employees to begin work this week, while students are set to begin virtual classes next week. School officials have said they hope to begin in-person classes after Labor Day.“My family works. I have no one I can take her to and say, `OK, at 12 o’clock you are going to have to start working online with her for school,’” Dunn said.Parents in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee are among those who will be the first to navigate the new academic year as schools open up in parts of those states this week.In Indiana, where schools reopened last week for the first time since a pandemic-driven nationwide shutdown in March, a student at Greenfield-Central Junior High School tested positive for the coronavirus on the first day back to class.School Superintendent Harold Olin said the student was tested days earlier and attended class before receiving the results. The student was isolated in the school clinic, while school nurses worked to identify other youngsters or staff who may have had close contact with the student.“This really does not change our plans,” Olin said. “We knew that we would have a positive case at some point in the fall. We simply did not think it would happen on Day One.”Schools in Hawaii were supposed to reopen Tuesday, but the teachers union led a move to delay that until Aug 17.Most schools in the state are planning a hybrid approach, with students alternating between in-person classes and online instruction. Some schools will have full in-person instruction for lower grade levels, but only a few schools will offer a full-time, in-person return.Many school districts around the country had offered parents a choice of at least some in-person classes or remote instruction. But an uptick in Covid-19 cases in many states has prompted districts to scrap in-person classes at least for the start of the school year, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington.Dunn said she hopes her daughter will be able to attend in-person classes at her school after Labor Day. But even if she does, that will not ease Dunn’s mind completely.“I’m definitely going to worry,” she said. “I will send her to in-person classes, but if I hear of the spread of COVID at the school, then I’d have to rethink it all over again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parents-struggle-as-schools-reopen-amid-coronavirus-surge/story-CdG6oVkGQDaEWFF96DKQZI.html

03-08-2020||World||Covid-19: UK ramps up tests, vaccine delivery plan||A test to detect coronavirus in 90 minutes and a ‘fill and finish’ partnership with pharma major Wockhardt for vaccine delivery were unveiled on Monday, as a senior scientist criticised ‘shroud of secrecy’ in the Boris Johnson government’s decision-making. Business secretary Alok Sharma announced the agreement with Wockhardt that follows similar previous partnerships to secure early access to millions of vaccine doses from AstraZeneca for the University of Oxford vaccine, BioNTech/Pfizer alliance, Valneva and GSK/Sanofi.The agreements have been reached in the hope that various vaccine trials, including the Oxford candidate vaccine, will be conclusively proved to be effective against the virus later this year. There have been 46,201 deaths and 304,695 cases in the UK as of Sunday.The 18-month agreement with Wockhardt based in north Wales to carry out the ‘fill and finish’ stage of the manufacturing process involves dispensing the manufactured vaccine substance into vials ready for it to be distributed.Sharma said: “Ensuring the UK has the capability to research, develop and manufacture a safe and effective vaccine is critical in our fight against coronavirus. Today we have secured additional capacity to manufacture millions of doses of multiple Covid-19 candidates, guaranteeing the supply of vaccines we need to protect people across the UK rapidly and in large numbers”.Announcing the 90-minute test, health secretary Matt Hancock said it is part of two new tests – one for coronavirus and another for flu – that will be rolled out to increase testing capacity before winter sets in, when flu and other season-related ailments occupy the National Health Service.The tests, he said, do not require a trained health professional to operate them, meaning they can be rolled out in more non-clinical settings.Hancock said: “Millions of new rapid coronavirus tests will provide on-the-spot results in under 90 minutes, helping us to break chains of transmission quickly. The fact these tests can detect flu as well as Covid-19 will be hugely beneficial as we head into winter, so patients can follow the right advice to protect themselves and others”.Meanwhile, Nobel laureate Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute in London, alleged that important decisions throughout the pandemic had been made in what he called a “black box” of scientists, civil servants and politicians, calling for more transparency and scrutiny.He told The Guardian that the alleged failure to be more open about pivotal decisions, and the basis on which they were reached, meant it had been impossible to challenge emerging policy, a situation that put public trust at risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-ramps-up-tests-vaccine-delivery-plan/story-KhaganetLBV3kwcZOszqhN.html
03-08-2020||World||British woman who stabbed her husband to death avoids gallows, jailed for 42 months||A British woman accused of stabbing her husband to death at their Malaysian resort home avoided the gallows and was sentenced to 42 months in jail on Monday after she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.Lawyer Sangeet Kaur Deo said prosecutors reduced the murder charge against Samantha Jones, 51, to culpable homicide, which is murder without intent, after the defense appealed to the attorney-general’s office.A conviction for murder carries a mandatory death sentence by hanging.“I was scared, and he was so angry,” Kaur quoted Jones as telling the court as she sought a lighter penalty before sentencing. “I miss him terribly. What I did that night was unintended. I tried to stop him, I did not know it would happen like this.”In addition to the 42-month jail sentence, Kaur said Jones was also fined 10,000 ringgit ($2,368).“She is very relieved having come to terms with what happened that night and for the court ... to understand what happened that night. She didn’t intend for this to happen,” the lawyer told reporters later at the end of the hearing.Wearing handcuffs and a surgical mask, Jones was earlier escorted by police into the courthouse in Alor Setar in northern Kedah state for the start of the trial. She was charged nearly two years ago after police found a blood-stained kitchen knife in the couple’s home where John William Jones was found dead on Oct. 18, 2018.The 63-year-old victim, who was drunk at the time, had a 15-centimeter (six-inch) wound in his liver, according to prosecutors. Police have said Jones confessed she stabbed her husband in the chest during a heated argument.The couple moved to tropical Langkawi island 11 years ago under the Malaysia My Second Home program, which gives foreigners long-stay visas.The lawyer said the couple, who had been married for 17 years, were devoted to each other but Jones was struggling with physical violence by her husband.“Unfortunately Samantha found herself at the receiving end of abuse. She supported John through various therapies to address certain problems that he had, none of which worked obviously, until that unfortunate night when things took a turn for the worst,” Kaur said.“She has accepted the fact that she needs to serve the sentence. She acknowledged the fact that a life is lost and I think she is looking forward to her own recovery because this was indeed a traumatizing event for her,” the lawyer added.Kaur said Jones, who has spent 20 months in detention, could be released as early as the end of next year with one-third off the sentence for good behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-woman-who-stabbed-her-husband-to-death-avoids-gallows-jailed-for-42-months/story-ylSYaV2K5N6Heq2rpn8PeL.html
03-08-2020||World||Thousands remain evacuated from Southern California wildfire||Evacuation orders remained in place early Monday for thousands of people after a wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles exploded in size and forced crews to battle flames in triple-digit heat.The Apple Fire in Riverside County consumed more than 31 square miles (about 80 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.As of Monday morning, it was 5% contained. The cause was under investigation.Officials allowed flames to run up the side of Mount San Gorgonio, an 11,000-foot (3,350-meter) peak, because it wasn’t safe to let crews work in such steep, rugged terrain, said Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the US Forest Service.“We don’t want to put firefighters in a dangerous situation,” Cox told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. “It’s burning in a straight line up a mountain.” The blaze began as two adjacent fires reported Friday evening in Cherry Valley, an unincorporated area near the city of Beaumont about 85 miles (137 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.Flames leapt along brushy ridge tops and came close to homes while firefighters attacked it from the ground and air.One home and two outbuildings were destroyed, Cal Fire said. No injuries were reported.Evacuation orders and advisories were issued for about 8,000 people in mountain, canyon and foothill neighbourhoods. Campgrounds and hiking trails were closed in the San Gorgonio Wilderness area of the San Bernardino National Forest.A huge smoke plume was visible for miles around and contributed to poor air quality.The mercury hit 109 degrees (43 Celsius) Sunday in nearby Palm Springs. The National Weather Service said “dangerously hot conditions” were expected to continue because of high pressure over much of Southern California.To the north, the Pond Fire in San Luis Obispo County was 10% contained Sunday after burning more than 2 square miles of (6 square kilometres) brush east of Santa Margarita. The blaze destroyed two structures but officials said it was unclear whether they were homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-remain-evacuated-from-southern-california-wildfire/story-C7vhtlGdvRSfwVKok9FiBO.html

It will take six months just to tune the organ, and its music isn’t expected to resound again through the medieval Paris monument until 2024, according to the state agency overseeing Notre Dame’s restoration.Amazingly, the 8,000-pipe organ survived the April 2019 fire that consumed the cathedral’s roof and toppled its spire. But the blaze coated the instrument in toxic lead dust that must now be painstakingly removed.And while the organ didn’t burn, it did suffer damage from a record heatwave last summer and has been affected by other temperature variations it’s been exposed to since the 12th-century cathedral lost its roof, the agency said.Experts stared removing the organ’s keyboards Monday and will then take out its pipes in a dismantling process that will last through the end of this year, according to the restoration agency. The pieces will be placed in special containers inside the huge cathedral, where the cleaning and restoration will take place.The general who leads the agency said the organ, which dates from 1733, will next play again on April 16, 2024, marking five years since the fire.President Emmanuel Macron hopes the cathedral can reopen in time for the 2024 Olympics in Paris. But it’s taken more than a year to clear out dangerous lead residue and scaffolding that had been in place before the fire for a previous renovation effort, and reconstruction of the landmark has yet to begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/notre-dame-cathedral-s-organ-getting-4-year-long-cleaning/story-CznBmzRyJu6NA7MFElPcPL.html

Since then, protests have occurred in Vancouver, more in Toronto and Montreal.On Saturday, a rally was organized in downtown Toronto and among those who participated was Gloria Fung, president of Canada-Hong Kong Link - a platform for 15 groups countering China’s moves in Hong Kong including a recent national security law.Also read: Finger Area in focus as India, China hold talks“I do not support China’s move towards India, that’s the reason why I participated in this rally. I would like us to show our solidarity to each other because we are facing a common threat,” she said of her presence at the Toronto rally.The Hong Kongers have been agitating against China for the past couple of years and held a major rally in Toronto last August, as did Tibetan immigrants to Canada. Sunny Sonam, vice-president of RTYC in Toronto, said they had to take advantage of the reality that the world was “right now focused on China” partly due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and because of its actions in Hong Kong and the Galwan Valley. And while the Tibetan community has held many protests over the years against the Chinese occupation of the plateau, their cause is getting a lift because of the current circumstances, as he said, “Because of that, Tibetan people are getting more attention.”Other disparate groups have also joined in these marches and demonstrations against China in Canada, including Taiwanese and Vietnamese-origin Canadians, even Bangladeshi minorities. Toronto-based Salman Sina of the International Human Rights Centre in Canada helmed protests in July in the city and this Sunday in Montreal. A refugee from Iran, Sina said of his motivation, “As human rights defenders, we are seeing what’s going on with the Uighurs, Tibetans and Hong Kong because of China. I decided to unite people suffering because of the Chinese regime. Unity is better than division. We have a common cause.”Such protests also have resonance in Canada because two citizens, including a former diplomat, have spent more than 600 days in prison in China in what Ottawa has described as “hostage diplomacy” by Beijing in retaliation against the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei in Vancouver in late 2018.As Fung prepares for a large protest in August in Toronto, she is hopeful there will be greater cooperation and collaboration between these groups going ahead, as she said, “We hope to invite other communities and civil society organisations to come together for a unified voice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unusual-coalition-taking-shape-in-canada-hong-kongers-tibetans-and-others-protest-against-china/story-295gw5XBUz01lc5pmZvQWP.html
03-08-2020||World||Who should be the first in line for Covid-19 vaccine? Experts debate||The entire world is racing to find a vaccine for the coronavirus disease which has affected millions of people. There are nearly 100 vaccine candidates which are in different phases of research and trials.The researchers from Oxford University recently shared the results of their vaccine candidate’s human trials. But now, a debate has been raging on: Who gets to be first in line for a Covid-19 vaccine?There is no set protocol or guidelines for now to decide on how to ration doses. For experts, it is a vexing issue.“Not everybody’s going to like the answer,” said Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. “There will be many people who feel that they should have been at the top of the list,” he recently told one of the advisory groups the government asked to help decide.Traditionally, first in line for a scarce vaccine are health workers and the people most vulnerable to the targeted infection.But Collins gave it a new spin. He wants people where an outbreak is hitting hardest to be given priority.And then there are volunteers who are helping various pharmaceutical firms in human trials of the vaccine. Moderna and Pfizer began tests last week that eventually will include 30,000 volunteers each. AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax are next in line to go for human trials and will require a large number of volunteers.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has also given a suggestion: The vaccine should be given to most critical health, national security and other essential workers. Next in line would be those over 65 who live in long-term care facilities, or those of any age who are in poor health - or who also are deemed essential workers. The general population would come later. And then, there is of course the rich vs poor divide.The World Health Organisation (WHO) is also facing this dilemma as it wants to fairly distribute the Covid-19 vaccine to poor countries.Last month, eight world leaders came together demanding equitable access to coronavirus disease vaccine when it is developed. Leaders of Canada, Spain, New Zealand, South Korea, Ethiopia and three other countries sought cooperation from various countries in manufacturing and distributing a Covid-19 vaccine.They jointly published an oopnion piece in the Washington Post where the leaders called vaccine as the “most powerful public health tool”. They also said that vaccine distribution, if managed successfully, will be a “cornerstone of strengthening multilateralism for the future”.For now, health experts are devising innovative strategies to make the Covid-19 vaccine available to as many people as possible. Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s effort to speed vaccine manufacturing and distribution, is working out how to rapidly transport the right number of doses to wherever vaccinations are set to occur.Drive-through vaccinations, pop-up clinics and other innovative ideas are all on the table, said CDC’s Dr Nancy Messonnier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-will-be-the-first-in-line-for-covid-19-vaccine-experts-debate/story-6FGrW9t6LdjnuRCBIw3KAL.html

The tests will help “break chains of transmission quickly,” he said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageJohnson’s government, which has been criticized for locking down too slowly at the start of the UK outbreak, is making preparations for flare-ups in the fall and winter. Ministers have been reviewing possible responses and The Sunday Times reported they war-gamed sealing off London from the rest of the country in a meeting last week.A report published Monday by the Institute for Government and the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy said cuts to budgets since Johnson’s Conservatives came to power in 2010 meant vital services were understaffed and poorly equipped when the virus hit the UK in February. Ministers had failed to learn the lessons of pandemic simulation exercises, it said.“Greater investment in staff, buildings and equipment would have left services far better placed to respond to coronavirus,” Nick Davies, program director at the IFG said in a statement. “The government must learn from these mistakes, reflect on where public services are least resilient, and ensure key services are better prepared for either a second wave of coronavirus or any future pandemic.”‘Major incident’Ministers are seeking to damp down spikes of the virus while rebooting the economy, which is facing its worst recession in 300 years. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick denied newspaper reports that the government plans to close pubs and said curbs on the movements of everyone over the age of 50 is “not something being actively considered.”The reports came days after Johnson reintroduced restrictions in northwest England and postponed the planned easing of nationwide lockdown measures. On Sunday evening, emergency and public services organizations in Greater Manchester declared a “major incident” to improve their response to a surge in infections.Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said the government should make it clear that Asian communities in the northwest are at the center of the renewed outbreak in the area.“British Asians -- a diverse group -- are more likely to work in frontline jobs and live in larger multi generational households,” he said on Twitter. “These factors put them at risk. Let’s be honest about it to protect the most vulnerable.”Range of optionsPossible measures if infection rates spike elsewhere include locking down the capital and tightening quarantine rules on those flying into the UK, the Sunday Telegraph reported. There could be travel curbs in and out of the M25 highway encircling Greater London and a ban on overnight stays if there’s a surge in cases, the Sunday Times said.Johnson’s office said the reports were “speculation” but Jenrick said it is right for ministers to keep responses to all possible scenarios under review.“You’d expect the government to be considering the range of all the options,” Jenrick, who said he wasn’t aware of the plan to seal off London, told Times Radio on Sunday. “We don’t want to do anything that’s a blanket approach across the country; our strategy is to manage this in a localized way with targeted action.”Oxford Nanopore Technologies said its initial order from the government is for 450,000 of its LamPORE tests, which use DNA and RNA sequencing to detect the virus. There is potential to scale up to millions of tests per month, the company said in a statement.DnaNudge said it will provide 5.8 million tests along with processing equipment in a deal worth about 161 million pounds ($211 million). The technology allows doctors and nurses to quickly determine whether patients are infected in emergency settings and before undergoing surgery, cancer care and other procedures, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-buys-fast-covid-19-tests-in-readiness-for-winter-resurgence/story-iPXwwb3qZmHvuLyziAXJSI.html

Trump said on Friday he was planning to ban TikTok in the United States after dismissing the idea of a sale to Microsoft.But following a discussion between Trump and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the Redwood, Washington-based company said in a statement that it would continue negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, and that it aimed to reach a deal by Sept. 15.It was not immediately clear what changed Trump’s mind. Several prominent Republican lawmakers put out statements in the last two days urging him to back a sale of TikTok to Microsoft.The negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a US government panel that has the right to block any agreement, the sources added.“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,” Microsoft said in a statement.ByteDance and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Under the proposed deal, Microsoft said it would take over TikTok’s operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok’s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.Microsoft may invite other American investors to acquire minority stakes in TikTok, the company added.

Facebook issued a statement saying it complied due to the threat of criminal liability for an employee in Brazil.But it called the new order “extreme”. The company said it would appeal to the full court.Facebook also argued it had complied with the previous order by “restricting the ability for the target Pages and Profiles to be seen from IP locations in Brazil”.Moraes also had ruled Twitter should block the accounts. While Twitter said then the decision was “disproportionated” under Brazil’s freedom of speech rules and that it would appeal, the targeted profiles were disabled.Moraes is overseeing a controversial probe into whether some of Bolsonaro’s allies are running a social media network aimed at spreading threats and fake news against Supreme Court justices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-shuts-pro-bolsonaro-accounts-following-sc-s-order/story-pD64yTcgUyrps5jTvr0UOI.html

Declaring a “state of disaster”, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said Melbourne would move to Stage 4 restrictions until September 13 given “unacceptably high” levels of community transmission.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe harshest rules in Australia to date will see city residents face a curfew from 8 pm to 5 am for the next six weeks. Only those carrying out essential work, or seeking or providing care, will be allowed out. Six months after the UN health agency declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 680,000 people.Even as South Africa accounted for more than half of diagnosed infections in Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the fatality rate is lower than the global average. Health authorities had been expecting a surge in cases after the gradual loosening of a strict lockdown that was imposed at the end of March.An emergency WHO committee reviewing the pandemic “highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of the outbreak, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts”.“WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” it said in its latest statement.

03-08-2020||World||TikTok acquisition talks on hold||Negotiations for Microsoft to buy the US operations of Chinese-owned TikTok are on hold after President Donald Trump threatened to bar the social media app and came out against the sale, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.Trump has pledged to get tough on the massively popular video-sharing app, which US officials have said could be a tool for Chinese intelligence -- a claim the firm, owned by Chinese internet giant ByteDance, has repeatedly denied.Also read: What US ban on Chinese app TikTok would meanWhile there has been no sign yet of the ban he threatened on Friday to impose, his words were reportedly already adding to uncertainties for TikTok.“Before Mr. Trump’s remarks, the two sides believed the broad strokes of a deal could be in place by Monday,” the paper reported on a possible TikTok-Microsoft sale, citing unnamed sources.It also said Trump’s threats and opposition to the deal had prompted TikTok to make further concessions, including adding up to 10,000 jobs in the US over the next three years.TikTok defended itself on Saturday, with its general manager for the US, Vanessa Pappas, telling users that the company was working to give them “the safest app,” amid US concerns over data security. “We’re not planning on going anywhere,” Pappas said in a message released on the app.TikTok, especially popular with young audiences who create and watch its short-form videos, has an estimated one billion users worldwide. It has grown even faster as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed people physically away from each other, but into close contact online. Earlier media reports had suggested Trump would require that the app’s US operations be divested from ByteDance, but he instead announced a ban.Trump’s announcement drew criticism from some in the tech sector, including former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, who questioned whether the move was spurred by national security concerns.“A 100 percent sale to an American company would have been considered a radical solution two weeks ago and, eventually, mitigates any reasonable data protection concerns,” he wrote on Twitter.TikTokers employed the apps’ signature short-form videos to poke fun at Trump.One clip that was liked over 300,000 times shows a young woman stacking bricks and smearing orange paint on her face, apparent digs at the president’s skin tone and controversial pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico.“Me trying to convince Trump to let us keep TikTok”, read the text on the post.- ‘For the long run’ -The American Civil Liberties Union cried foul over the possibility of a ban on the app.“Banning an app that millions of Americans use to communicate with each other is a danger to free expression and is technologically impractical,” said the ACLU’s surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, Jennifer Granick.“With any Internet platform, we should be concerned about the risk that sensitive private data will be funneled to abusive governments, including our own,” Granick said in a statement. “But shutting one platform down, even if it were legally possible to do so, harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance.”Pappas said she was “proud” of TikTok’s 1,500 US employees, and also noted the “additional 10,000 jobs” the company plans on creating in the US in the next three years.“When it comes to safety and security, we’re building the safest app because we know it’s the right thing to do,” she said. “So we appreciate the support. We’re here for the long run, and continue to share your voice here and let’s stand for TikTok.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-acquisition-talks-on-hold/story-JdbiQVmDScQC6tQjMccVtM.html
03-08-2020||World||SpaceX capsule and NASA crew make 1st splashdown in 45 years||Two NASA astronauts returned to Earth on Sunday in a dramatic, retro-style splashdown, their capsule parachuting into the Gulf of Mexico to close out an unprecedented test flight by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company.It was the first splashdown by US astronauts in 45 years, with the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to carry people to and from orbit. The return clears the way for another SpaceX crew launch as early as next month and possible tourist flights next year.Test pilots Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode the SpaceX Dragon capsule back to Earth less than a day after departing the International Space Station and two months after blasting off from Florida. The capsule parachuted into the calm gulf waters off the coast of Pensacola, hundreds of miles from Tropical Storm Isaias pounding Florida’s Atlantic coast.Watch: NASA astronauts’ dramatic return to Earth on SpaceX capsule Also read: US astronauts prepare for SpaceX-NASA return home from ISS“Welcome back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX,” the company’s Mission Control said.The astronauts’ ride home in the capsule dubbed Endeavour was fast, bumpy and hot, at least on the outside.The spacecraft went from a screaming orbital speed of 17,500 mph (28,000 kph) to 350 mph (560 kph) during atmospheric reentry, and finally to 15 mph (24 kph) at splashdown. Peak heating during descent was 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,900 degrees Celsius). The anticipated top G forces felt by the crew: four to five times the force of Earth’s gravity.A SpaceX recovery ship with more than 40 staff, including doctors and nurses, moved in following splashdown, with two smaller, faster boats leading the way. To keep the returning astronauts safe in the pandemic, the recovery crew quarantined for two weeks and were tested for the coronavirus.SpaceX expected it to take a half-hour for the ship to arrive at the capsule and additional time to lift it out of the water onto the deck. The astronauts had plenty of seasick bags if needed while waiting in the bobbing capsule. A flight surgeon was going to be the first to look into the capsule, once the hatch swung open. After medical exams, the astronauts were expected to fly home to Houston for a reunion with their wives and sons.The last time NASA astronauts returned from space to water was on July 24, 1975, in the Pacific, the scene of most splashdowns, to end a joint US-Soviet mission known as Apollo-Soyuz. The Mercury and Gemini crews in the early to mid-1960s parachuted into the Atlantic, while most of the later Apollo capsules hit the Pacific. The lone Russian “splashdown” was in 1976 on a partially frozen lake amid a blizzard following an aborted mission; the harrowing recovery took hours.Also read: SpaceX ready for defining moment with first humans on rocketSpaceX made history with this mission, which launched May 30 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. It was the first time a private company launched people into orbit and also the first launch of NASA astronauts from home turf in nearly a decade. Hurley came full circle, serving as pilot of NASA’s last space shuttle flight in 2011 and the commander of this SpaceX flight.Musk monitored the descent and splashdown from SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, California.NASA turned to SpaceX and also Boeing to build capsules and ferry astronauts to and from the space station, following the retirement of the shuttles. Until Hurley and Behnken rocketed into orbit, NASA astronauts relied on Russian rockets. SpaceX already had experience hauling cargo to the space station, bringing those capsules back to a Pacific splashdown.“This is the next era in human spaceflight where NASA gets to be the customer,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said from Johnson Space Center in Houston shortly before the astronauts’ return.SpaceX needs six weeks to inspect the capsule before launching the next crew around the end of September. This next mission of four astronauts will spend a full six months aboard the space station. Hurley and Behnken’s capsule will be refurbished for another flight next spring. A Houston company run by a former NASA official, meanwhile, has partnered with SpaceX to send three customers to the space station in fall 2021.Boeing doesn’t expect to launch its first crew until next year. The company encountered significant software problems in the debut of its Starliner capsule, with no one aboard, last year. Its capsules will touch down in the US Southwest desert.By beating Boeing, SpaceX laid claim to a small US flag left at the space station by Hurley and the rest of the last shuttle crew. The flag — which also flew on the first shuttle flight — was carefully packed aboard the Dragon for the homecoming.Also on board: a toy dinosaur named Tremor, sent into space by the astronauts’ young sons.The boys recorded a wake-up call for their fathers Sunday morning, urging them to “rise and shine” and “we can’t wait to see you.”“Don’t worry, you can sleep in tomorrow,” said Behnken’s 6-year-old son Theo, who was promised a puppy after the flight. “Hurry home so we can go get my dog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-two-nasa-astronauts-makes-dramatic-splashdown-in-gulf-of-mexico-to-end-test-flight/story-1vT5VlKdR5yWU6FKYz2sBK.html
03-08-2020||World||Suicide car bomb, gunmen attack prison in east Afghanistan; 3 dead||A suicide car bomb and multiple gunmen attacked a prison in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, Afghan officials said, killing three people and injuring 20 others.The gunbattle between Afghan security forces and insurgents in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, was still ongoing Sunday evening, and casualties were likely to rise, according to Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor. Ajmal Omer, a provincial council member, and Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, also confirmed the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but both the Taliban and the local Islamic State group’s affiliate are active in eastern Afghanistan. The IS affiliate is headquartered in Nangarhar province. Sunday’s attack comes a day after the Afghan intelligence agency said a senior IS commander was killed by Afghan special forces near Jalalabad.The Taliban’s political spokesman Suhail Shaheen told The Associated Press, “We have a cease fire and are not involved in any of these attacks anywhere in the country,” but said he was not aware of the details of the Jalalabad attack. The Taliban declared a three-day cease-fire starting Friday for the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.The Taliban had also denied involvement in a suicide bombing in the eastern Logar province late Thursday, which killed at least nine people and wounded at least 40, authorities said.Afghanistan has seen a recent spike in violence, with most attacks claimed by the local IS affiliate.Efforts to get peace talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government underway have stalled after the Taliban and the U.S. signed a deal in February, seen as a blueprint to ending Afghanistan’s decades of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-car-bomb-gunmen-attack-prison-in-east-afghanistan/story-pXs8urBF8DhHvEbMbBnPbK.html
03-08-2020||World||With CPEC in mind, China wants Pakistan to pitch Baloch outfit as terror group in UN||With China-Pakistan Economic Corridor at the heart of President Xi Jinping’s plan to consolidate economic relations with Africa and Middle-East via Gwadar, Beijing wants Islamabad to move the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaida, Taliban and affiliates committee to brand Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) a global terrorist organisation. The BLA is engaged in a struggle for self-determination for ethnic Baloch people and has been declared a terrorist organization by Pakistan, UK and US.While Beijing has assured Pakistan of full backing to get the BLA declared as global terrorist organisation by the UNSC, Islamabad has developed cold feet as it feels that the matter should be handled internally and any move to UN will only internationalise the Baloch issue.According to intelligence inputs based on diplomatic interlocution between the two iron brothers, while China has thanked Pakistan for supporting the Xi Jinping regime on South China Sea and Hong Kong, it has assured Islamabad full coordination and support over the Kashmir issue to Islamabad. It is understood that both sides have decided to counter what they call is India’s growing threat.Beijing and Islamabad are currently engaged to sort out serious financial crisis faced by Pakistan while simultaneously considering Imran Khan government’s request for raising the Kashmir issue at the forthcoming UNGA session next month. When Pakistani interlocutors raised the issue of BLA and East Turkestan Islamic Movement (a Uighur militant group active in Xinjiang and Wakhan corridor), the Chinese diplomats wanted Islamabad to get BLA sanctioned through UNSC 1267 committee. While Islamabad did not want to internationalize the issue by going to UN, it has conveyed to Beijing that suppression of BLA is top focus of the Imran Khan government.The Chinese are putting pressure on the Imran Khan government as the BLA are totally opposed to the CPEC corridor and the use of Gwadar port for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy and merchant ships. The BLA in the past two years have not only attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi but also the Karachi Stock Exchange as well as a luxury hotel in Gwadar in a bid to hit at the Chinese developers of the port.The CPEC port with initial investment of US $46 billion is key to China having a dedicated corridor to Arabian Sea to feed the markets of Africa and Middle-East, where Beijing has already prepared grounds by pumping in money. With Indian Navy sitting on mouth of Malacca Straits through intensive monitoring of the 10 degree and six degree sea lanes bisecting the Andamans and Nicobar Islands, the CPEC provides an alternative route to Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden and at the same time consolidates China’s strangle hold on client state Pakistan.Many China watchers believe that the crux of India’s problem with PLA aggression in East Ladakh is that the Chinese PLA wants a second road via Karakoram Pass to link Tibet and Pakistan in case the Indian Army targets the Karakoram highway that runs via Khunjerab Pass linking Xinjiang to Gwadar port.In pursuit of its long term economic vision, China clearly wants to avoid dependency on Malacca Straits and would prefer its goods to be transported through the Pakistani Karakoram corridor as even the other developing Kyaukpyu port corridor through Myanmar opens up in Bay of Bengal apart from being in the restive Rakhine state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-cpec-in-mind-china-wants-iron-brother-pakistan-to-pitch-bla-as-terror-group-in-un/story-GcOrzYG3gwqqAutSTlPqHL.html
03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump orders limits on US contractors’ use of foreign workers||President Donald Trump on Monday barred federal agencies from dismissing U.S. citizens or green card holders and replacing them with foreign workers, and blasted a major state enterprise for having done so.The executive order Trump signed Monday increases scrutiny of federal contractors’ use of H-1B visas to bring in temporary foreign labor for high-skilled jobs rather than relying on American workers.The action was prompted by the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority’s June announcement that it’s laying off 62 information technology workers as the federal power agency outsources data and programming work, according to an administration official who asked for anonymity.The Covid-19 recession has thrown millions of Americans out of work, with uncertain prospects for a recovery given continued surges in virus case counts in many states. With the president running behind Democrat Joe Biden in polls ahead of November’s election, Trump’s move would showcase actions to support jobs. The administration also remains in talks with Democrats about extending extra jobless benefits.Trump called TVA Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lyash’s outsourcing decision “disastrous and heartless.” Trump said the board must remove Lyash, or he’ll do it. He also said he’ll remove some board members, including Chairman James Thompson.After being handed a note during the White House event, Trump said that he got a call from Lyash and that the TVA chief had indicated a “willingness to reverse course” on the announced layoffs. The TVA didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Historical TensionsThe TVA’s board has defied Trump before. Last year, it voted 6-1 to shutter a coal plant in Kentucky that the president had pushed to keep open. The Paradise Fossil Plant Unit 3 got most of its coal from mines operated by a longtime and vocal Trump supporter, Robert Murray.Then-TVA CEO Bill Johnson said the decision was about economics, and keeping rates as low as feasible.Read More: Trump’s Love for Coal Not Enough to Save Money-Losing PlantTrump’s new executive order requires federal agencies to give preference to U.S. residents and green card holders for contract positions, just as they would for full-time roles, the official said on condition of anonymity. The order also will prompt a study to determine how many federal jobs are held by foreign visa holders.The Trump administration is working on other changes to the H-1B visa program that may be announced in coming weeks, the official also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-limit-us-contractors-use-of-foreign-workers/story-iVe4QKegjwnQ8lFJ7dcdYK.html
03-08-2020||India||Curfew imposed in Srinagar ahead of Aug 5||Srinagar: Authorities on Monday imposed a curfew in Srinagar until Wednesday fearing protests by separatists against the Centre’s move last year on August 5 to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and to divide the state into two Union territories.In an order, Srinagar district magistrate Shahid Chaudhary quoted a police report, saying separatists and Pakistan-sponsored groups were planning to observe August 5 as a black day. “There are specific inputs about violent protests endangering public life and property,” he said. “The report has further made a case that to prevent such violence and loss of life and property, it is immanent to impose curfew in the district.”Chaudhary added such gatherings would also be detrimental to the efforts of containing Covid-19. The six-day Covid-19-related restrictions, which began from July 31, have also been extended up to August 8.Jammu & Kashmir on Monday reported 590 fresh Covid-19 cases and 11 deaths that took the toll from the infection to 407. A bulk of the fatalities —377—have been reported from the Kashmir Valley.Shaheena Akhtar, a 42-year-old Srinagar resident, said the severity of the pandemic-related restrictions suddenly intensified from Monday. She said the security forces manning the roads were harsher and even manhandled people. “My young daughter who was pillion riding was chased by baton-wielding security men at Hawal. They were really scared,” Akhtar said. “Since August 5 is coming, they are forcing people to stay indoors.”Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter, Iltija, said security and surveillance in the Valley have suddenly been increased. “Not like non-discriminatory COVID virus will be more active in the days approaching 5th August, so clearly this is being done to ensure that anger & frustration felt by people here remain hidden,” she tweeted.Mufti was among hundreds of people detained in August last year as part of measures to prevent protests against the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370 that stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its special status. Two other former chief ministers, Omar Abdullah and Farooq Abdullah who were also detained, have since been released.A communications blackout and a lockdown were also imposed in Jammu & Kashmir in August last year. Most of the restrictions have since been eased even as high-speed 4G internet services remain banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curfew-imposed-in-srinagar-ahead-of-aug-5/story-6JUNy41z1LOGluPcDSnedM.html

The rest should remain at their respective places,” Adityanath said.In Lucknow, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said only people who have received invitation for ceremony should visit Ayodhya on August 5 while the rest should stay at home and watch the event on television. He also recalled the contribution of the mahants, or head priests, of Gorakhnath Math, Digvijay Nath, Avaidyanath as well as the seers of Ayodhya -- Ram Chandra Paramhans, Nritya Gopal Das -- and former Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal.Police said security arrangements had been tightened across the city. “We are continuously keeping a watch across the VIP routes via drones. There are no movement restrictions for the people residing in Ayodhya. I urge people not to step outdoors to contain Covid-19. We will not let outsiders enter the city,” said Deepak Kumar, deputy director general of police, Ayodhya.

03-08-2020||India||Andhra farmers’ body moves HC against formation of 3 capital cities||Hyderabad A farmers’ body in Andhra Pradesh has moved the high court challenging the formation of three capitals cities in the state. In its petition, the Rajadhani Rythu Parirakshana Samithi (farmers’ committee to safeguard the state capital) has sought a stay on the implementation of the gazette notifications issued by the state government in this regard on Friday. The gazette notifications were issued after governor Biswabhushan Harichandan gave his assent to the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 aimed at creating the three capital cities for the state and the AP Capital Region Development Authority (Repeal) Bill, 2020, seeking to abolish the APCRDA formed in December 2014 to develop Amaravati as the state capital. The petitioner challenged the notifications and requested that the high court stall the shifting of Raj Bhavan, Chief Minister’s Office and state secretariat from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam and the high court to Kurnool. The petitioner also questioned the legality of the recommendations of the experts committee, led by retired IAS officer G N Rao, and the high-power committee, comprising ministers and senior bureaucrats, following which the chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government took a decision on the three capitals. The high court has posted the case for hearing on Tuesday. The government, on Saturday, issued orders for abolishing the APCRDA, thereby de-notifying Amaravati as the capital region. The government has instead created Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA). All the areas within the jurisdiction of hitherto capital will now fall under AMRDA. All assets, liabilities, agreements and concessions, which were handled by the APCRDA would now be vested with the new authority. According to the government order, the AMRDA would be headed by a chairperson and comprise 11 members, with secretary of the municipal administration and urban development department as the deputy chairperson and commissioner as the member-convenor. The authority will also include experts with knowledge of urban governance, urban planning, conservation, environment and transportation, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-farmers-body-moves-hc-against-formation-of-3-capital-cities/story-0WKua5tovuVe69PebY0XRK.html

When my son died on June 14, I requested them to take action against named persons. But nothing came of it even after 40 days.

He thanked chief minister Nitish Kumar and state minister Sanjay Jha who came forward to “stand for the truth”.Singh, in his complaint on which an FIR was lodged on July 25, accused actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members of abetting his son’s suicide, besides defrauding him of his money and subjecting him to blackmail.In a press note, the Mumbai Police rejected the claim by Rajput’s father and said they did not receive any written complaint about threat to the actor’s life.Back in Bihar, the demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe resonated in the state assembly on Monday. The demand was first raised by Neeraj Kumar Singh Bablu, a BJP legislator and Rajput’s cousin, when members were allowed to speak on the subject by speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary after the passage of 12 bills by the House, which assembled for a truncated, day-long monsoon session.The demand was backed by leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav, Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh, and Raju Tiwari, an MLA of Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/told-mumbai-cops-about-threat-to-life-actor-s-father/story-0aYAPXfDKuHRIfkY40UpVO.html

03-08-2020||India||Centre may extend deadline for emergency capital loans||New Delhi: The Union government may extend the October 31 deadline to avail the emergency working capital loan facility -- worth a total of Rs 3 lakh crore -- for small enterprises and individual professionals to help them tide over the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the matter. The government has already extended the scope of the provision by enhancing eligibility criteria to include larger units and individual professionals such as doctors and chartered accountants. The proposal to continue the scheme beyond October is also under active consideration, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The Union Cabinet on May 20, 2020 approved an Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for about five months ending October 31.The scheme provides for an easy additional working capital loan at a concessional rate of interest to an existing borrower who is not a defaulter. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday expanded its scope at the request of industry in line with the revised definition of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and the cap on funding under the scheme doubled from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore. Apart from industrial units with turnover up to Rs 250 crore (earlier cap was Rs 100 crore), the finance minister extended the facility to individual professionals. HT reported the development on Sunday. The National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC), which issued the operational guidelines of ECLGS on June 2, said the interest rate under the scheme is capped at 9.25% per annum for banks and financial institutions. For non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), the interest rate should not exceed 14% per annum. NCGTC is a wholly owned company of the Union government formed in March 2014 to act as a trustee for multiple credit guarantee funds. Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP said, “With most of the states still under various stages of lockdown and vaccine expected only by the year-end, it would definitely make sense for the government to extend the deadline. Once the demand picks up, there would be lot more takers for this scheme.” In the last two months, over Rs 1.36 lakh crore, less than 50% of Rs 3 lakh crore, was sanctioned by banks and NBFCs, and only Rs 87,227 crore could be disbursed under the scheme. The government expects Rs 1 lakh crore loan offtake by newly eligible individual professionals. Some headroom may still remain, which could prompt the government to extend the deadline, one of the officials quoted above said. Kapil Rana, chartered accountant and founder of HostBooks Ltd, a cloud-based accounting platform, said the deadline should be extended as the pandemic situation has not completely normalised, and several people have not resumed their businesses. “Extension of the deadline will benefit to the SME’s [small and medium enterprises] who have not yet availed the facilities,” he said. “The intention of the government was to provide ease in cash flow. However, till now, the sanction and disbursement are not up to the expected level,” he added. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) chairman A Sakthivel, meanwhile, proposed removing the turnover criterion completely for exporters. “While turnover of exporters may seem large due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the thin margin on which they work and the perishable nature of their products make them vulnerable to any changes in export orders and delay in shipment, which is clearly evident during the ongoing crisis,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-extend-deadline-for-emergency-capital-loans/story-8svUPMjK9KydbUpxkSSm3J.html

03-08-2020||India||Bhushan refuses to apologise for tweets||New Delhi: Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, citing freedom of speech, has refused to apologise for two tweets in June, one of which accused the judiciary of destroying democracy and the other criticised the current Chief Justice of India for keeping the courts shut during the Covid-19 lockdown.In an affidavit filed on Sunday in response to the suo motu (on its own) contempt proceedings initiated against him by the Supreme Court over the tweets on July 22, Bhushan said : “Such expression of opinion however outspoken, disagreeable or however unpalatable to some, cannot constitute contempt of court. This proposition has been laid down by several judgments of this court and in foreign jurisdictions such as Britain, US and Canada.” Bhushan also cited the speeches on dissent made by Supreme Court judges DY Chandrachud and Deepak Gupta, who retired in May, in February. “Justice DY Chandrachud, while delivering the 15th P D Desai Memorial Lecture in the Gujarat High Court on February 15, expressed his anguish at the manner in which dissent was labelled as anti-national.”A three-judge bench on July 22 issued a notice to Bhushan over the tweets and directed him to respond by August 5. The first tweet, which was reproduced in the court order, said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”In his affidavit, he explained this as his “bonafide opinion, which people can and may disagree with” but added that “in any healthy democracy, there needs to be free and frank discussion about the role of every institution”. The second tweet referred to the incumbent Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde. It was also cited in the order and said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Bhushan, in his affidavit, regretted saying Bobde was not wearing a helmet. He added he failed to notice the bike was stationary and that the CJI was not riding, but merely sitting on it. “...I admit that I did not notice that the bike was on a stand and, therefore, wearing a helmet was not required. I, therefore, regret that part of my tweet. However, I stand by the remaining part of what I have stated in my tweet.” He sought to explain in his affidavit that criticism of the CJI doesn’t mean criticism of the court itself. The next hearing of the case is set for August 5. The two tweets in question have been disabled by Twitter Inc after it was made a party to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhushan-refuses-to-apologise-for-tweets/story-gAs6tZmSJb3Sk10UMaaIlJ.html
03-08-2020||India||Let India appoint lawyer for Jadhav: Pakistan HC||Islamabad/New Delhi: A Pakistani court on Monday directed the government to inform India to appoint a lawyer for Kulbhushan Jadhav, the former Indian Navy officer sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, in order to file a review petition against his conviction.A two-judge bench of the Islamabad high court headed by chief justice Athar Minallah also directed the Pakistan government to again inform Jadhav, 50, of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order of 2019 staying his execution and calling for a review of his conviction.Referring to an ordinance promulgated by Pakistan to give effect to ICJ’s order, the bench said: “He shall be specifically informed regarding his right to avail the statutory remedy provided under the Ordinance of 2020 and to authorise the Government of India to arrange legal representation on his behalf.”The judges ordered the formation of a larger bench to hear the case in view of its importance and adjourned the matter till September 3.Pakistan’s attorney general Khalid Jawed Khan told the media after Monday’s hearing the high court had said Jadhav would be given a second chance to engage a lawyer. “The federal government also wants that he should himself engage a lawyer,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. Asked by reporters whether Indian lawyers could appear in the Islamabad high court on behalf of Jadhav, Khan said “only Pakistani lawyers and those who are entitled to practice in Pakistan” can be appointed. In response to another question on whether Indian lawyers could assist any Pakistani counsel engaged for Jadhav, he said, “This option has not been considered as of now.” There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the development. The high court also appointed three senior lawyers – Abid Hassan Manto, Hamid Khan and former attorney general Makhdoom Ali Khan – as amici curiae or “friends of the court” to “ensure that the judgement of the [ICJ] is effectively implemented”. In its order, the high court further said it expected Jadhav’s right to a fair trial “will be respected and utmost care will be exercised while making statements,...reporting by print and electronic media or otherwise commenting on or relating to the proceedings”. Before joining the Islamabad high court, Minallah was a leading lawyer and played a key role in the lawyers’ movement against former dictator Pervez Musharraf. Some of his rulings have gone against the military establishment. India recently said Pakistan had blocked all its efforts to seek remedies in the case of Jadhav, who was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. India rejected these allegations and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The Pakistan government has promulgated the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance 2020 to allow Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court in 2017. The ordinance was recently tabled in Parliament for approval. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual weekly news briefing last week that Pakistan had systematically blocked all of India’s attempts to seek remedies for Jadhav. He also accused Pakistan of violating the 2019 judgement of ICJ, which called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentencing of Jadhav. India has also accused Pakistan of not providing unhindered, unimpeded and unconditional access to Jadhav or the official documents needed for filing a review petition. “We reserve our position in this matter, which includes the right to avail of further remedies. I’ll also reiterate that we stand committed to protect the life of our national Kulbhushan Jadhav,” Srivastava had said last week. On July 22, the Pakistan government petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. The petition contended Jadhav was made aware of his rights but had refused to file a review petition against his sentence and that India had “not demonstrated a bonafide serious intent” to avail of remedies. However, India dismissed the contentions made in this petition and said a Pakistani lawyer appointed by it had been unable to file a review petition on July 18 as he wasn’t provided the necessary documents by Pakistani authorities. Indian officials had also walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances of providing unimpeded consular access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-india-appoint-lawyer-for-jadhav-pakistan-hc/story-6PJ24luh1z7NCkBiJgJg2M.html

The incident took place in the forests of Kondru tribal hamlet under Injari gram panchayat limits of Pedabayalu block at around 4 pm. The deceased were identified as Mondipalli Ajay Kumar and Mondipalli Mohan Rao of Jamiguda tribal hamlet of Chintalaveedi gram panchayat. According to the police, the two tribal youth had gone into the forest in search of some cattle which were missing from the herd after grazing. “They accidentally stepped on a mine planted under the soil on the thoroughfare. It exploded, killing both of them on the spot,” Pedyabayalu sub-inspector of police Raja Rao said.He said there was specific information that the landmine was planted by the Maoists targeting the security forces combing in the area for the last few days. “We came to know that the Maoists had planted landmines in the Kondru forest area and our forces have been avoiding the route in the last two days,” the SI said. The two tribal youth, who were unaware of the landmines, ventured into the forest in search of cattle. “We suspect it to be a pressure mine, rather than remote-controlled sensor mine, as the Maoists use the latter only on seeing the combing police forces,” Raja Rao said. The bodies were still lying in the village, as the police did not go there because of Maoist threat. “The village is located deep in the interior and inaccessible by road. We shall shift the bodies to the hospital for post-mortem on Tuesday,” the SI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-landmine-kills-two-tribals-in-forest-area-of-visakhapatnam/story-UOqETMeQz6EMELLsNkdnIN.html

Adityanath, who was is Ayodhya to take stock of the preparations for the “bhoomi pujan” of the Ram temple here on August 5, also asked the opposition party to introspect, saying the construction of the temple should have started soon after the Independence. But when the power becomes more important for people than the country, they play with the emotions of the public for their political games; divide society on caste, creed and religion, he said, adding that the Congress did not “want the dispute to end”. Even a leader of the Opposition party had filed a petition in the apex court contending the issue “should not be resolved before the 2019 elections”, the CM claimed. The chief minister also termed November 9, 2019 a historic day when the Supreme Court paved a way for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. He claimed that now “pseudo-secularism and politics of caste, creed and religion has ended for always”. The chief minister said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation of a grand Ram temple on August 5, it will be a historic and emotional moment for all. Besides, it will also be an opportunity to lay the foundation of a new India, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-didn-t-want-resolution-of-ram-janmabhoomi-land-dispute-adityanath/story-UeCodqsJ0RMTTNe6R35IFK.html

Rath prayed that along with Puri’s Jagannath Temple, all temples in Odisha should be opened for devotees to offer prayers. In another PIL, 15 servitors of ‘Maa Mangala’ shrine at Kakatpur area of Puri too approached the Orissa High Court seeking opening of the temple and demanded financial assistance of Rs 5,000 for the temple servitors.In both the PILs, the petitioners have said that closure of the temples had created immense hardships to all servitors across the state. “The servitors usually depend on the devotees to eke out their living. They earn by providing services to the devotees. With no devotees being allowed to visit the temple, the servitors are left with no income,” said the PIL.Jagannath Temple, the most popular religious shrine in Odisha, has been shut for devotees since March 20 just before the lockdown started. The Rath Yatra festival in June was held without the presence of common devotees with temple servitors pulling the three wooden chariots after the Supreme Court passed an order. Though the Centre allowed opening of the temple, an ASI-protected monument in June, Odisha has preferred to keep it closed apprehensive of the rise in Covid-19 cases once devotees start thronging to it.In its latest order issued on July 31, the Odisha government allowed gyms and shopping malls to open with certain SOPs, but said religious places would continue to be shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-resident-files-pil-in-orissa-high-court-seeks-reopening-of-jagannath-temple/story-MU5xwysQRfS28pmezBgGVP.html

The two leaders had a phone conversation and exchanged greetings on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha. Ghani thanked Modi for timely supply of food and medical assistance to meet Afghanistan’s requirements, according to an official statement. “The two leaders also exchanged views on the evolving security situation in the region and other areas of mutual bilateral interest,” the statement said, adding Modi had reiterated India’s commitment to the Afghan people “in their quest for a peaceful, prosperous and inclusive Afghanistan”. The phone conversation coincided with a meeting in Kabul between Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib and Indian ambassador Vinay Kumar. Kumar spoke of India’s continued help for Afghanistan to counter the Covid-19 pandemic, and Mohib thanked India for its support and affirmed Afghanistan’s “strong commitment to the bilateral partnership”, the Afghan National Security Council said. The contacts between the two sides came a week after Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi chaired a virtual meeting with his counterparts from Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan and called for “four-party cooperation”, including on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Wang also said Kathmandu and Kabul should learn from China-Pakistan cooperation and the four countries should work together to extend CPEC to Afghanistan. The meeting, held against the backdrop of the China-India border standoff, was viewed warily in New Delhi. India also has serious concerns about the spike in terrorist violence in Afghanistan and the role being played by Pakistan in the Afghan peace process. Days after a report by a UN expert team monitoring the implementation of sanctions against banned terror groups and individuals said almost 6,500 Pakistani terrorists were present in Afghanistan, acting Afghan interior minister Masoud Andarabi said on Monday that the new leader of the Khorasan unit of Islamic State was a member of the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network. “Shahab Almahajir, the newly appointed leader of Islamic State of Khorasan Province-ISKP is a Haqani member. Haqani & the Taliban carry out their terrorism on a daily basis across Afg & when their terrorist activities [do] not suit them politically they rebrand it under ISKP,” Andarabi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-president-ghani-discuss-evolving-security-situation-terrorism-in-region/story-QuXoIZwT2sJFNpDqGDqaOO.html
03-08-2020||India||Muted Raksha Bandhan celebrations amid raging coronavirus pandemic||Raksha Bandhan celebrations remained subdued this year as the rampaging coronavirus pandemic cast a shadow over the festivities, that celebrate the brother-sister bond, with people mostly preferring to stay at home.People relied on homemade sweets and some rituals moved online, with siblings ordering rakhis and e-gifts for each other and meeting through video calls. “This is the first time that it has happened, but this is the need of the hour,” said Rahul Bhardwaj, a resident of the national capital, who could not meet his sister who lives in a different city. “We need to keep ourselves safe and our loved ones safe too.” On Monday, India reported 52,972 coronavirus cases and 771 fatalities, taking the overall figures to 18,03,695 infections and 38,135 deaths, according to the health ministry data. There are 5,79,357 active cases, while the recoveries have increased to 11,86,203.“The festival was a bit different this year. I got homemade barfi for my brothers and did not buy anything from outside. We are also not going anywhere and just spending time with our family,” said Shivani Rawat of Delhi. President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders greeted the people on the occasion. The President celebrated the festival with members of the nursing community at Rashtrapati Bhavan, describing them as saviours who are risking their own lives in the line of duty to save others. Naidu said he missed his “dear sister” Sushma Swaraj a lot on this Raksha Bandhan. Former External Affairs Minister Swaraj died on August 6 last year.Legendry singer Lata Mangeshkar shared a special audio message with the PM on the occasion, wishing him well. In his response, the PM said her message “filled me with immense inspiration and energy”. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is in a hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus, tweeted, “Heartfelt greetings to the people of the country on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also wished everyone. His sister and the party’s general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said she is proud to have a brother like Rahul Gandhi.“My best wishes to all the countrymen on Raksha Bandhan,” she tweeted. But as people remained at home, with the fears of contracting the virus running deeper than ever, industry sources estimated severe losses to shopkeepers. “Sweets worth around Rs 10,000 crore were sold across the country on Raksha Bandhan last year. This figure is expected to come down to around Rs 5,000 crore this time,” the director of the Federation of Sweets and Namkeen Manufacturers, Feroz H. Naqvi, had told PTI on Snnday. Samir Saha, a roadside vendor in In West Bengal’s Shyambazar, said, “Last year, I had earned Rs 5,000 selling rakhis. This time, I managed to earn just Rs 1,000. The pandemic has hit us hard.” Some people, however, celebrated the festival in symbolically unique ways. Animal lovers tied ‘rakhis’ to two elephants in Jalpaiguri district and vowed to protect them “as many of them are dying in man-animal conflict”. In Odisha, acclaimed sand artiste Sudarsan Pattnaik created a mural on Puri beach as a tribute to Covid-19 warriors. “Let’s celebrate this #RakshaBandhan with #CovidWarriors, those are working tirelessly day and night for us,” he said in a Twitter post. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar tied a ‘rakhi’ around a tree at a park, while women Congress MLAs in Rajasthan celebrated the festival by tying rakhis on the wrist of CM Ashok Gehlot.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a Bhopal hospital, shared on Twitter a picture of a rakhi tied on his wrist by nurse Saroj who is attending to him in the isolation ward. Tribal residents in Mumbai’s forested Aarey Colony, a prominent green lung of Mumbai and the site of a metro car shed, vowed to protect trees by tying them ‘rakhis’ on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muted-raksha-bandhan-celebrations-amid-raging-coronavirus-pandemic/story-GhTK5lRWwr4RBp1bClaoPP.html

There was a leakage in a natural gas pipeline of ONGC in the afternoon and it was plugged within an hour. There was no major damage and no one was injured or evacuated,” said Sampriti Goswami, sub-divisional officer (civil), Nazira. According to local reports, the incident took place at ONGC’s Rig No-2 at Seuj Chapori in Geleki. There were reports of a loud explosion due to the leakage. Officials of ONGC could not be contacted to confirm it. Monday’s incident, which happened more than two months after a natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) had a blow out in May and caught fire in June at Baghjan in Tinsukia district, had led to worries that something similar had happened. The Baghjan fire is still blazing. “The leakage was substantial and there was some sound as well. But thankfully nothing major happened. Unlike what’s being reported, the incident didn’t happen close to a residential area and there were no evacuations,” said Goswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ongc-seals-leaking-gas-pipeline-in-assam-averts-major-incident/story-KTJt719NNAjuWenCYehW3J.html
03-08-2020||India||India eyeing Rs 1.75 lakh crore in turnover in defence manufacturing by 2025||The government is eyeing a turnover of Rs 1.75 lakh crore (USD 25 billion) in defence manufacturing by 2025 as it has identified the sector as a potential driver to boost the overall economy, according to a draft of a major policy prepared by the defence ministry. The draft Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy 2020 set an export target of Rs 35,000 crore (USD 5 billion) in aerospace and defence goods and services in the next five years, which has been estimated as part of the total projected turnover. The policy is envisaged as overarching guiding document of the defence ministry to provide a “focused, structured and significant” thrust to production of military hardware and platforms for self-reliance and exports, officials said. Officials said the policy is aimed at developing a dynamic, robust and competitive defence industry, including aerospace and naval shipbuilding, to cater to the needs of the armed forces. In May, Finance Minster Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out a number of reform measures for the defence sector including making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons which will not be allowed to import. India is one of the most lucrative markets for global defence giants as it figured among top three importers of military hardware in the world for the last eight years. According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years. The draft Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy (DPEPP) also prescribed a framework to reduce dependence on imports and take forward the “Make in India” initiatives through domestic design and development. It also suggested steps to promote export of defence products to make India become part of the global defence supply chain. The officials said the policy paper made several key recommendations to boost defence manufacturing so that the sector compliments the government’s aim make the country’s economy a USD 5 trillion one by 2024. In an address at the 11th edition of DefExpo in Lucknow in February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said lack of proper policy initiative in last several decades made India the biggest importer of defence platforms and that his government has taken a series of initiatives to cut the country’s dependence on foreign acquisitions. The draft policy has laid out a goal to achieve a turnover of Rs 1,75,000 crore (USD 25 billion) including export of Rs 35,000 crore (USD 5 billion) in aerospace and defence goods and services by 2025. It also laid out goals to create an environment that encourages research and development, rewards innovation, creates Indian IP (intellectual property) ownership and promotes a robust and self-reliant defence industry. The policy brought out multiple strategies under a range of “focus areas” indigenisation and support to MSMEs and startups, optimisation of resource allocation, FDI in defence, ease of doing business, quality assurance and testing infrastructure and export promotion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eyeing-rs-1-75-lakh-crore-in-turnover-in-defence-manufacturing-by-2025/story-EszPR5d8J8RUCNJnuD2fRM.html

As on Sunday night, the state has reported a total number of 67,660 positive cases for Covid-19, including 983 in the previous 24 hours. “Around 25 per cent of these cases are of patients in the age group of 31-40 years. While 22.1 per cent cases are that of patients in the 21-30 years age group, 5.3 per cent of patients fall in the age group of 11-10 and only 3.4 per cent of patients are below 10 years of age,” director of medical and health department G Srinivasa Rao said. Another 18.6 per cent of the positive cases are of people within the age group of 41-50 years and 14.7 per cent of the patients are in 51-60 years’ age group. “It means, nearly 89 per cent of the Covid-19 patients are below 60 years of age,” Rao said. Among the total number of patients, 65.6 per cent are men and the remaining are women. Though the department has not mentioned any reasons for the high percentage of cases among the youth, the health director indicated that the cases had been on the rise due to increasing mobility among people in the post-lockdown period. While the general perception is that most of the fatalities due to Covid-19 are those of people suffering from co-morbidities like cancer, asthma, coronary diseases, diabetes and hypertension, etc., the study revealed that 46.13 per cent of the patients who died of Covid-19 in the state so far did not have any co-morbidities. “While 53.87 per cent of the patients who died of Covid-19 till date had one or the other co-morbidity, all the remaining victims died only because of the Covid-19 disease,” the health director said. Despite having a huge number of positive cases, Telangana reported fewer deaths – only 551 till now, with a mortality rate of 0.81 per cent, which is far below the national average of 2.13 per cent. Health minister Eatala Rajender, who held a video-conference with senior doctors with expertise in infectious diseases on Monday, pointed out that that most of the deaths were out of fear psychosis, rather than the disease itself. He asked the doctors to infuse confidence among the patients by regularly conducting psychological counselling sessions. The health director pointed out that the state has a high recovery rate – 71.8 per cent, as against the national average of 65.44 per cent. So far, 48,609 out of 67,660 positive cases have recovered after testing negative, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-56-of-covid-19-patients-below-40-years-of-age-telangana-health-dept-study/story-WfSazWg1MaErJkEloGR8BL.html

03-08-2020||India||Opposition piles pressure on Kerala CM to quit over gold smuggling case||Opposition parties have stepped up pressure on Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to quit owning moral responsibility as details of the  gold smuggling case began to emerge.  A day after Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan sat on a dharna in Delhi, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala held a day-long fast in the state capital on Monday seeking Vijayan’s resignation. “The CM’s office is under cloud after his secretary’s role came out in the smuggling case. Pinarayi Vijyan is Narendra Modi of Kerala and he never tolerates any healthy criticism.This is the first time a CM’s office is coming under such a charge,” said AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik in a video conference as Chennithala began his fast.The CM’s powerful secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was suspended after his alleged links with one of the accused Swapna Suresh surfaced. The case hit  the headlines on July 5 after 30 kg of gold that came in an air consignment for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was seized from the airport. Swapna Suresh and another accused Sandip Nair were about to get a plum contract to furnish the upcoming consular office UAE in Hyderabad, said a senior official familiar with the ongoing multi-agency probe.An agreement was clinched with a furniture firm in Malappuram for a multi-crore rupee deal which also had a provision forpayment of commission. A week after Swapna’s arrest in Bengaluru on July 11,furniture mart owner T M Anwar was also arrested in connection with the smuggling case.   “We have information that she acted as a brokerin many deals and accepted hefty commissions. She used her proximity with the powerful to strike deals. Her prowess in many languages including Arabic,English and Hindi bowled over many,” said the senior official. Meanwhile State Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel, whose phone number figured prominently in Suresh’s call list,reiterated that he interacted with her only for distributing Ramadan kits and copies of the Quran donated by the UAE. The BJP had expressed serious doubtsover consignments that came from the UAE and later transferred to Malappuram ina government vehicle. The Minister of State for External Affairs has said he violated protocol by accepting donations from another country without informing the Centre. “Some people are threatening me with terms like treason and protocol violation. The NIA is probing the case, let it investigate this also. I am least bothered about these wild allegations,” said Jaleel.  But BJP state president K Surendran said there was no need to send holy books from the UAE as they were readily available in Kerala also. He alleged that 28 such packets were taken to the minister’s constituency in a government vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-piles-pressure-on-kerala-cm-to-quit-over-gold-smuggling-case/story-E8JgUMHWNaWQ9yw3pV9oHP.html

The Congress government in Rajasthan is facing a crisis since July 12, when 18 party MLAs, loyal to Pilot, revolted and sought removal of Gehlot, a demand that not been met by the party’s high command. On Sunday night, Gehlot announced that the upcoming World Tribal Day on August 9 would be a public holiday in the state and met the long-standing demand of the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP). The two BTP MLAs are camping with 100 legislators supporting Gehlot in a Jaisalmer Hotel. All the MLAs along with Gehlot reached Jaisalmer, a desert town, on Friday from a hotel in Jaipur, where they were staying since July 12. The BTP had announced its support to the government on July 18 and had given a letter that listed 17 charter of demands, a few days after BTP national party chief Mahesh C Vasava issued a whip asking the party MLAs to remain neutral amid the power tussle.Congress leaders said the MLAs decided to support their government after Gehlot assured them that all their demand would be met once there is stability in the dispensation and there would be no dearth of funds for developmental works in their constituencies. BTP state president, Velaram Ghogra, said: “It was a long pending demand and we are thankful to the CM for keeping it. We are hopeful that other demands will also be met.” The second decision to give a 5% reservation to the MBCs in judicial services, which include the Gujjars, is to send a message that the government was working for the uplift of all communities, despite Pilot’s rebellion. Earlier, Gehlot had announced 5% of reservation for MBCs, including Gujjars, in other government jobs. “The CM wants to send a message to the Gujjar community that the Congress is with them if, in case, by-polls takes place in the constituencies of the 19 rebel Congress MLAs,” said a senior Congress functionary, requesting anonymity. There are eight Gujjar MLAs in Rajasthan Assembly, including Pilot. All of them are from the Congress, including one who had fought on the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket but later merged with the Congress last September.In at least 10 of these 19 constituencies, the Gujjar community has a sizeable vote share, a Congress leader said. Gujjar leader Himmat Singh said the decision has come at the time, where there was some anger among the community members against the ouster of Pilot as state Congress president and the deputy CM. “The decision would offset that anger to some extent,” he said. The two decisions came days after Gehlot assured the MLAs at a Congress Legislative Party (CLP) meeting that their local area fund would be restored soon and the bureaucrats would cooperate with them in carrying out development works. “The CM has assured the MLAs that there would be no dearth of money for developmental works in their constituencies and all their grievances would be redressed,” said the Congress leader quoted above. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said Gehlot would use the available time before the start of the assembly session from August 14 to send a message that all is right with his government and there is no need to worry. “I see more such decisions in the coming days. The latest decisions are an attempt to save the government. Besides the moves have also strengthened the Congress’s traditional tribal base, which is part of Gehlot’s politics,” he said. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Mukesh Pareek said there are many promises that are yet to be kept such as unemployment allowance, relief to farmers, and regularisation of contractual employees. The Gehlot government should also keep them without looking at political gains, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujjars-get-reservation-tribals-a-public-holiday-as-gehlot-tries-to-keep-mlas-together/story-IGBWTEMRAMtWkBwLIBDY7H.html

BMC authorities also stamped his hand showing the quarantine period till August 15.In another tweet, Fadnavis said this kind of action will cause disbelief among the people over the investigation.“Instead of solving the mystery of #SushantSinghRajput ‘s death , such behaviour will only result into huge public outcry and disbelief amongst the people about the investigation,” the former CM said.The opposition BJP in Maharashtra has been demanding that the probe in the case be handed over to the CBI, while the state government has been dismissing the same.Earlier Monday, Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh said Rajput’s family did not complain about any lapse in the investigation being carried by his force.

03-08-2020||India||Centre may extend deadline to avail Rs 3 lakh crore emergency credit facility||The Central government may extend the October 31 deadline to avail the Rs 3 lakh crore emergency working loan facility for small enterprises and individual professionals to help them tide over the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, two officials said. The government has already extended its scope by enhancing eligibility criteria to include larger units and also allowed individual professionals such as doctors, chartered accountants and cab drivers. The proposal to continue the scheme beyond October is also under consideration, the officials with direct knowledge of the matter said requesting anonymity. The Union Cabinet on May 20, 2020 approved an Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) with a corpus of Rs 41,600 crore for about five months ending on October 31.The scheme provides for an easy additional working capital loan at a concessional rate of interest to an existing borrower who was not a defaulter. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday expanded its scope at the request of the industry in line with the revised definition of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and the cap on funding under the scheme doubled from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore. Besides, industrial units with turnover up to Rs 250 crore (earlier cap was Rs 100 crore), the finance minister extended the facility to individual professional. HT reported it on Sunday. The National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) that issued the operational guideline of ECLGS on June 2, said the interest rate under the scheme is capped at 9.25% per annum for banks and financial institutions. For non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), the interest rate should not exceed 14% per annum. NCGTC is a wholly-owned company of the Union government formed in March 2014 to act as a trustee for multiple credit guarantee funds. Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP said, “With most of the states still under various stages of lockdown and vaccine expected by year end, it would definitely make sense for the government to extend the deadline. Once the demand picks up, there would be lot more takers for this scheme.” In the last two months over Rs 1.36 lakh crore, less than 50% of Rs 3 lakh crore had been sanctioned by banks and NBFCs and only Rs 87,227 crore could be disbursed under the scheme. The government expects about Rs 1 lakh crore loan offtake by newly eligible individual professionals. Still there would be some headroom, which could prompt the government to extend the deadline, one of the officials quoted above said. Kapil Rana, chartered accountant and founder of HostBooks Ltd, a cloud-based accounting platform said the deadline should be extended as the pandemic situation has not completely normalised and several people have not resumed their businesses. “Extension of the deadline will benefit the SME’s [small and medium enterprises] who have not yet availed the facilities,” he said. “The intention of the government was to provide ease in cash flow, however, till now the sanction and disbursement are not up to the expected level,” he said. Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) chairman A Sakthivel proposed to remove the turnover criterion completely for exporters. “While turnover of exporters may seem large due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the thin margin on which the apparel exporters work and the perishable nature of their products make them vulnerable to any changes in export orders and delay in shipment, which is clearly evident during the ongoing crisis,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-extend-deadline-to-avail-the-rs-3-lakh-crore-emergency-credit-facility/story-etXGPFuS2FyfkR9jwZuRfJ.html

During the meeting, the governor had apprised the home minister about the prevailing law and order, political and Covid-19 situation in the Trinamool Congress-ruled state. “I am in quarantine now and staying alone in my Delhi house. Till date, I have not developed any (Covid-19) symptoms,” said Debasree Chaudhuri, minister of state (MoS), Women and Child Development (WCD), and a lawmaker, who represents north Bengal’s Raiganj constituency in Lok Sabha (LS). BJP LS lawmakers Saumitra Khan and Nisith Pramanik had met Shah a few days ago to apprise him about the Covid-19 situation in the state. “We had maintained social distancing while meeting the union home minister. I am in home quarantine. I may undergo a Covid-19 test,” said Khan. Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta and Union minister Babul Supriyo have also met Shah in the past fortnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-bjp-leaders-who-met-amit-shah-quarantine-themselves-at-home/story-mbgYBMqnNAojNLXD4nJRZM.html

In an affidavit filed in HC, the state government has stated that street vendors and hawkers would not be allowed to resume businesses in containment zones and areas that are still under lockdown restrictions They will also not be allowed to resume businesses in other areas as well. “… these sectors (street vending and hawking) fall in unorganised sectors and it is very difficult, if any and if at all, imposed for conducting such businesses,” said the affidavit filed by Kishor Nimbalkar, secretary, disaster management, relief, and rehabilitation department, Maharashtra.Huge manpower, including police and civic staff, would be required to ensure compliance of guidelines issued for the conduct of these businesses and the ground reality is that all these agencies are over-burdened and exhausted, it added. The affidavit is filed in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by activist Manoj Oswal (43) for a declaration that the imposition of the complete ban on the sale of products or food by street vendors to be illegal or unconstitutional and violative of the rights of the people to conduct legitimate business. In his petition, filed through advocate Ashish Verma, the Pune-based activist said the nationwide lockdown restrictions have led to serious issues for the survival of a vast section of the population, including street vendors and traders, who own small informal shops and vends, and the only possible relief for them is that if they are allowed conducting their daily business with reasonable restrictions. Oswal has termed the state government’s stand as “extremely high-handed and insensitive.” “The assumption that the street vendors can cause more Covid-19 infections than the store or shop owners is not supported by science or findings by any research,” his petition stated “Merely because these people are poor, they are being treated as more infectious and responsible for causing infections. This is a clear prejudice and nothing else,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-hawkers-in-maharashtra-as-of-now-state-reiterates-it-s-stand-before-hc/story-idUVTiF6WcAMX3k9PumShK.html

Sudip Roy Barman, the BJP lawmaker and former state health minister, visited the Covid-19 Care Centre set up at Bhagat Singh Youth hostel in West district on Sunday wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). However within a few hours, Dr. Sandeep Namdeo Mahatme, district magistrate (DM), West district, served him a notice asking him to remain in an institutional quarantine for seven days and followed by home quarantine for another seven days. In reply to the notice, Roy Barman alleged that a conspiracy was hatched to malign him. He said he visited the centre after taking all precautionary measures and to get a sense about the alleged infrastructure inadequacy at the emergency healthcare facility. He said he watched a video on social media, where a pregnant Covid-19 patient could be seen and heard complaining of lack of doctors’ visit to the centre. Later, speaking to the reporters on Monday, he said that he would not opt for quarantine until he is found to have contracted the viral infection. Earlier on July 28, the state government had issued a notice, stating that home quarantine is permissible in case of mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Tripura has reported 5,392 Covid-19 cases, of whom 3,605 patients have recovered from their viral infection. So far, 24 people have died due to the viral infection and two Covid-19 patients died by suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-visit-to-covid-care-centre-tripura-bjp-legislator-asked-to-stay-in-quarantine-for-two-weeks/story-aBEFafCZAASOu2KgblDInI.html
03-08-2020||India||Mumbai: Doctor pursuing diploma seeks HC intervention for degree certificate||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) has directed a petitioner doctor to amend his plea and add a request to be included in a 2018 notification issued by Maharashtra government that had changed the status of two-year diploma courses for post-graduate (PG) medical students to a three-year degree course. All diploma courses were changed to three-year degree courses in June 2018, a month after the petitioner took the admission for it. Though the petitioner completed the two-year diploma course in March, he has been asked to persist with it because of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. He submitted before the court that he should get a P-G degree because he has to continue the course for another nine months. A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Milind Jadhav, while hearing a petition of Dr. Shashikant Morale was informed by advocate Vijay Thorat about the disadvantage suffered by his client because of the state government notification. He pleaded that his client was denied the degree benefit as the state government notification could not be applied retrospectively. The petitioner moved HC seeking direction to the Medical Council of India (MCI) to extend the benefit of the change in status. Thorat cited that Dr. Morale had completed three months in excess of the two-year of the diploma course and was willing to serve another nine months. The advocate said his client should get a degree certificate instead of a diploma upon completion of three years of the PG course. Thorat also submitted that the state government notification was discriminatory and was in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution and it should be struck down. The court will hear the petition next on August 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-doctor-pursuing-diploma-seeks-hc-intervention-for-degree-certificate/story-kKmVAYqQQ3j92eDEEMAx6I.html
03-08-2020||India||Citizens becoming law breakers due to court delays: Retired SC judge||New Delhi: Delay by courts in deciding cases is forcing the public to resort to extra-legal measures to solve their disputes and law-abiding citizens are becoming lawbreakers, retired Supreme Court (SC) judge justice RV Raveendran said last week. The mounting pendency of cases is also affecting the quality of dispensation of justice, as judges look at cases as mere “statistics” rather than as a human problem due to the enormous workload on them, he had said on July 28, urging measures to be taken to address the pressing issue. “Due to delay, confidence in the rule of law and justice system is getting eroded. So, people start thinking of solutions outside the legal framework. Landlords engage musclemen to evict tenants, financial institutions engage dubious collection agencies, etc. Law-abiding citizens become a society of lawbreakers. This is the most dangerous side-effect of delay,” he said. Justice Ravindran, who retired from the SC in 2011, was speaking at the launch of a book titled Justice Frustrated: The Systemic Impact of Delay in Indian Courts by Daksh, a civil society organisation. The book is a volume of essays with contributions from jurists, economists, sociologists, and researchers. The book gives insight into the effects of delay and to understand the practical repercussions of judicial delay on the lives of people, organisations, institutions, and society itself. “Learnings from Daksh’s Access to Justice Surveys in 2016 and 2017 (findings of which are published in two earlier reports, State of The Indian Judiciary and Approaches to Justice in India) made us think more deeply about the various kinds of impact that judicial delay has on individuals, society, and the justice system. This led us to conceptualise this book. In analysing the impact of judicial delay, we want to go beyond calculating the costs and time spent on attending court hearings to a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the cascading effects of judicial delay at multiple levels,” Surya Prakash BS, programme director, at Daksh told HT. Justice Ravindran, in his speech, highlighted the abysmal judge to population ratio which, he said, was one of the major reasons for the delay. “Indian judiciary has a judge population ratio of 18 judges per million. Judiciary seldom functions at its sanctioned strength, it normally operates with 75% of strength. So the ratio of judges to the population will be around 12. If you compare it with developed countries, they have 50 to 110 judges per million,” he said. He said that the mindset of the bar and the bench has to change when it comes to addressing the issue. “A powerful bar and a very conservative judiciary have developed a mindset tuned to think of the life cycle of cases in terms of years and decades rather than days and months. Negotiated settlements and adoption of alternative dispute resolution is not given the push which they deserve,” Ravindran added. He said that the executive, legislature and the judiciary have been lacklustre, when it comes to tackling the problem. “The response of the executive to demands for more courts, judge, and infrastructure have been lukewarm. The response of the legislature to the demand for better laws has been sluggish. The response of judiciary for demands for better processes for selection of judges and their training has been unsatisfactory,” he said. “Judicial delays are a societal problem, not just a judicial institution problem. They have social, economic, political, and other day-to-day ramifications and affects our lives in more ways than one without us realising it. It goes to the very root of our constitutional republic. After all, if we don’t sort out our problems in court, the rule of law fails and undermines us as a society,” said Harish Narasappa, lawyer and co-founder of Daksh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citizens-becoming-law-breakers-due-to-court-delays-retired-sc-judge/story-Wrg4Wp8fccBhEw2qHkXLxJ.html

03-08-2020||India||Kulbhushan Jadhav case: Pakistan High Court allows India to appoint lawyer||A Pakistani court on Monday directed the government to inform India to appoint a lawyer for Kulbhushan Jadhav, the former Indian Navy officer sentenced to death for alleged involvement in spying, in order to file a review petition against his conviction. A two-judge bench of the Islamabad high court headed by chief justice Athar Minallah also directed the Pakistan government to again inform Jadhav, 50, of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) order of 2019 staying his execution and calling for a review of his conviction. Referring to an ordinance promulgated by Pakistan to give effect to ICJ’s order, the bench said: “He shall be specifically informed regarding his right to avail the statutory remedy provided under the Ordinance of 2020 and to authorise the Government of India to arrange legal representation on his behalf.” The judges ordered the formation of a larger bench to hear the case in view of its importance and adjourned the matter till September 3. Pakistan’s attorney general Khalid Jawed Khan told the media after Monday’s hearing the high court had said Jadhav would be given a second chance to engage a lawyer. “The federal government also wants that he should himself engage a lawyer,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. Asked by reporters whether Indian lawyers could appear in the Islamabad high court on behalf of Jadhav, Khan said “only Pakistani lawyers and those who are entitled to practice in Pakistan” can be appointed. In response to another question on whether Indian lawyers could assist any Pakistani counsel engaged for Jadhav, he said, “This option has not been considered as of now.” There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the development. The high court also appointed three senior lawyers – Abid Hassan Manto, Hamid Khan and former attorney general Makhdoom Ali Khan – as amici curiae or “friends of the court” to “ensure that the judgement of the [ICJ] is effectively implemented”. In its order, the high court further said it expected Jadhav’s right to a fair trial “will be respected and utmost care will be exercised while making statements,...reporting by print and electronic media or otherwise commenting on or relating to the proceedings”. Before joining the Islamabad high court, Minallah was a leading lawyer and played a key role in the lawyers’ movement against former dictator Pervez Musharraf. Some of his rulings have gone against the military establishment. India recently said Pakistan had blocked all its efforts to seek remedies in the case of Jadhav, who was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. India rejected these allegations and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The Pakistan government has promulgated the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance 2020 to allow Jadhav to appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court in 2017. The ordinance was recently tabled in Parliament for approval. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual weekly news briefing last week that Pakistan had systematically blocked all of India’s attempts to seek remedies for Jadhav. He also accused Pakistan of violating the 2019 judgement of ICJ, which called for an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentencing of Jadhav. India has also accused Pakistan of not providing unhindered, unimpeded and unconditional access to Jadhav or the official documents needed for filing a review petition. “We reserve our position in this matter, which includes the right to avail of further remedies. I’ll also reiterate that we stand committed to protect the life of our national Kulbhushan Jadhav,” Srivastava had said last week. On July 22, the Pakistan government petitioned the Islamabad high court to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav. The petition contended Jadhav was made aware of his rights but had refused to file a review petition against his sentence and that India had “not demonstrated a bonafide serious intent” to avail of remedies. However, India dismissed the contentions made in this petition and said a Pakistani lawyer appointed by it had been unable to file a review petition on July 18 as he wasn’t provided the necessary documents by Pakistani authorities. Indian officials had also walked out of a meeting with Jadhav on July 16 after Pakistan breached assurances of providing unimpeded consular access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-pakistan-hc-allows-india-to-appoint-lawyer/story-uz4JOCFsFM2h6Fjxs2T5bL.html

The fraudster posed as an executive from a popular e-wallet service provider and under the pretext of updating his KYC (Know Your Customer) details he ricked him into sharing his bank details, including OTPs (one-time passwords). The accused used these details and fraudulently transferred money to another bank account.The complainant is a retired government employee and lives in a Borivali (West) housing complex, the police said, On Sunday morning, he received a call from one Abhishekh Choudhary, who identified himself as an executive of a popular e-wallet service provider’s Delhi office. He told him he would not be able to use the e-wallet service, as his KYC details have not been updated.“He told the complainant that he needed to pay a one-time fee of Rs 10, if he wants to update the KYC detail. The senior citizen paid Rs 10 four times as per Choudhary’s instructions and also shared OTPs with him,” said an officer from the Borivali police station. When the accused asked the complainant for his debit card details he suspected trouble and disconnected the phone call, the first information report (FIR) stated.Soon, the complainant immediately found out that Rs 3,17,800 has been debited from his bank account.

According to officials, the proposed helipad is coming up at Narsahi village, a short distance from Thari border outpost (BOP) of Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) near Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in West Champaran district, 80 km from the district headquarters Bettiah.“According to the information available with us, Nepal is planning to construct a helipad at Narsahi village which is a disputed land on the Indo-Nepal border. A tender for it has already been floated,” said Commandant Rajendra Bhardwaj of 21st Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) Battalion.“We have already informed the headquarters about the development,” said the commandant.Officials blame the changing course of the Gandak river for the controversy around Narsahi on the Indo Nepal border along West Champaran district. “As agreed upon, the central of Gandak river forms the international boundary between Nepal and India. With the river changing its course in the 1970s, Narsahi shifted to the other side of the river and later the Indian citizens living there moved to this part of the Indian territory,” said Bhardwaj. Known as Sapt Gandaki and Narayani in Nepal, it originates in the Nhubine Himal glacier in Nepal and flows across the Himalayan country before entering India near the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar. The Gandak river flows another 300 km to meet the Ganga near Patna.Nepal’s Parliament recently approved a new political map, claiming its territorial command over key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand.The Indo-Nepal border stretches for more than 800-km along Bihar. Last month Nepal stopped fortification of an embankment for 400 meters on Lal Bakey river in Baluwa- Guabari panchayat in Dhaka block of East Champaran district in Bihar, claiming that some part of the construction fell under its territorial jurisdiction. Over the past two months there has been friction between the two countries along the border in Bihar.On July 7, the Sashtra Seema Bal (SSB) foiled a Nepalese bid to put up a board in an area on Bharat-Nepal Matripul which reportedly lies in no man’s land near Raxaul town of East Champaran district of Bihar. On June 13, Nepalease authorities buried an unclaimed body of a Covid-19 patient in their territory, barely 200 metres from Bharat-Nepal Maitri Pul at Raxaul in East Champaran district, creating panic among the locals.On June 12, Nepal Armed Police shot dead a youth and wounded two others near Sitamarhi district border following an altercation with them.On June 26, Nepal’s Armed Police Force (APF) withdrew a temporary camp set up at Pantoka village, appearing to be within Indian territory, near Raxaul town of Bihar’s East Champaran district.Meanwhile, the SSB have intensified the patrolling along the Indo-Nepal border ahead of Independence Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-plans-helipad-on-disputed-location-in-bihar-s-west-champaran-district/story-aDlDp1nQes1NTiDIwuDc2M.html

03-08-2020||India||‘Supreme Court remained a mute spectator when Delhi burnt’: Prashant Bhushan refuses to apologise||The Supreme Court (SC) remained a mute spectator as communal riots ravaged north-east Delhi, advocate Prashant Bhushan said on Sunday in his counter-affidavit filed in response to the contempt of court case initiated against him by the top court for his tweets against the apex court and the Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde. Bhushan refused to apologise for his tweets stating that it fell within the domain of free speech and also cited the speeches on dissent made by sitting SC judges, Justices DY Chandrachud on February 15 and Deepak Gupta on February 24, when he was a sitting judge before retiring on May 6, to bolster his argument. “Justice DY Chandrachud, while delivering the 15th PD Desai Memorial Lecture in the Gujarat high court on February 15, had expressed his anguish at the manner in which dissent was labelled as anti-national. Yet, a week later, when the Delhi riots were unleashed, with daily videos emerging of mobs tearing down and burning mosques, the police systematically destroying public CCTVs (closed-circuit TVs) and taking an active part in stone-throwing, the SC remained a mute spectator while the national capital burnt,” the affidavit said. Also read: Prashant Bhushan, Arun Shourie and N Ram challenge Contempt of Courts Act in SCBhushan had posted two tweets, one against the SC on June 27 and the second against CJI Bobde two days later. Both these tweets had led to the contempt of court case against him for which he was served notice by the SC on July 22.In his tweet on June 29, Bhushan had posted a photo of CJI Bobde sitting on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which belonged to the son of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Sonba Musale. Bhushan said that the CJI was riding a motorcycle without a helmet or mask, when he was keeping the SC shut, due to raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19), denying justice to millions. He was referring to the fact that the SC was functioning in a restricted manner during lockdown restrictions due to Covid-19 and was hearing only a reduced number of cases via video-conference since March 24. Bhushan, in his affidavit, offered a limited apology for that part of the tweet, which said that the CJI was not wearing a helmet stating that he failed to notice that the bike was stationary and Bobde was not riding it but only sitting on it. “At the outset, I admit that I did not notice that the bike was on a stand and, therefore, wearing a helmet was not required. I, therefore, regret that part of my tweet. However, I stand by the remaining part of what I have stated in my tweet,” he said. Also read: SC seeks detailed response from Prashant Bhushan on contempt matter over his tweetsEarlier on June 27, he had tweeted that the SC’s role and four former CJIs in aiding the destruction of democracy will be taken note of by historians in the future. This tweet, he said in his affidavit, is his impression about the manner and functioning of the SC in the past 10 years and especially about the role the last four CJIs that has led to the apex court failing to check executive high-handedness. “Such expression of opinion however outspoken, disagreeable or however unpalatable to some, cannot constitute contempt of court. This proposition has been laid down by several judgments of this court and in foreign jurisdictions such as Britain, USA (United States of America), and Canada,” Bhushan contended. The stifling of dissent under the watch of the SC has not only been adversely commented upon by the court’s retired judges, but even by the sitting ones during the tenure of the four CJIs, he added referring to the speeches by Justices Chandrachud and Gupta. In defence of his perception that the SC aided in the destruction of democracy, Bhushan referred to the press conference held by four SC judges – Justices Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph – in January 2018 against the manner in which cases were being assigned to select benches. “So serious were the misgivings of the senior sitting judges that they (the four judges) felt compelled to disregard the code of judicial conduct to call a press conference and warn citizens of danger to democracy because of danger to a free judiciary,” Bhushan further submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-remained-a-mute-spectator-when-delhi-burnt-prashant-bhushan-refuses-to-apologise/story-werSNrWZMFZYGKTaVvMPhK.html

Rajput’s father, KK Singh, has lodged a police complaint against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family members and Patna Police registered a first information report (FIR) under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including abetment to suicide. His father alleged that Chakraborty and her family kept his son away from his family, handled his bank accounts and took away crores of rupees.

Also read: Why Ayodhya’s Hanumangarhi temple is first on PM Modi’s itineraryAlong with Ayodhya, the Lucknow bungalow and offices of the chief minister, his ministerial colleagues as well the party offices and those held by senior party functionaries and cadres would be also be lit up. Besides Uttar Pradesh, potters from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, have contacted Prajapati and expressed the desire to be associated with the Ram temple event.  “A Mumbai based businessman has contacted me offering to donate one lakh earthen lamps. A big potter from Rajasthan wants to donate a Ram idol worth nearly Rs 60 lakh. It’s going to be ‘Diwali’ on, and in the run-up to, the August 5 event. For everyone from Ayodhya to Lucknow and beyond it would be a momentous occasion. We are especially happy because the potters, who are mostly OBCs, and for whose cause the Maati Kala Board has been set up by our government, would get recognition and respect that they deserve,” said Prajapati, who is busy these days with identifying promising potters to be listed on the board. Prajapatis, an OBC community, traditionally make a living by giving shape to clay - from toys to diyas.   Also read: 20,000 temples get fresh paint. Ram dhun reverberates as Ayodhya decks up for the big dayPrajapati said CM Yogi was so impressed by the designer diyas that he ordered one lakh of them. “When I showed him the designs, Yogiji immediately said he wanted them in Ayodhya. He has big plans for Maati Kala Board and feels it has great potential,” Prajapati said. Pratyush Kumar, the potter from Kannauj whose designer ‘diyas’ impressed Yogi, said he was doubly pleased.  “I am delighted that my lamps would add to the occasion at Ayodhya’s bhoomi pujan. What delights me even more is that our community’s ‘kala’ (art) would now get a wider audience. The setting up of the Maati Kala Board has been a step in the right direction,” said Kumar.  Since 2017, when an estimated 1.7 lakh earthen lamps were lit up on the banks of the Saryu river, to 2019 - when Ayodhya made it to the Guinness records with 5.5 lakh earthen lamps lit up at the same time - the ‘deepotsav’ has been getting bigger each Diwali. This time, deepotsav is being celebrated a few months ahead of Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-ayodhya-to-lucknow-designer-diyas-to-add-glitter-to-bhoomi-pujan/story-qtA8F2XxPlQvoDLXpAnTtK.html

That is why Modi ji and Yogi ji are coming and will do special pooja at Hanumangarhi temple and then will lay the foundation for the construction of Ram temple at Janmabhoomi Sthal with the blessings of Hanuman ji,” Madhuvan Das, a Hanumangarhi temple, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Das said no work has been done without the blessings of Hanuman, a devotee of Lord Ram, so the first blessing will be sought from him for the smooth construction of the Ram temple.Mahant Raju Das, the head priest of Hanumangarhi, said they have been allocated seven minutes for Prime Minister’s rituals at the temple, according to ANI.Vedic priests will escort the Prime Minister while reciting mantras to the Hanumangarhi temple where the ceremony will also include prayers for his wellbeing and to reduce the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country. The head priest said only four priests are likely to conduct the prayers in the temple.“We have to follow social distancing, these are the orders we have received from the Prime Minister’s Office. So, following the norms, no one will be allowed to touch the Prime Minister neither will they offer him ‘prasad’,” he said.The temple town has been decked up ahead of the August 5 ceremony when PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for construction of the Ram temple.The construction of Ram temple will begin after the ceremony to lay the foundation stone and several dignitaries from the political and religious fields are expected to take part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/his-blessings-first-why-ayodhya-s-hanumangarhi-temple-is-first-on-pm-modi-s-itinerary/story-6l8SN3MJn1d4QkHicZQW2J.html

SJM, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that was at the forefront of a campaign to boycott Chinese goods, has taken umbrage at BCCI’s decision to allow Chinese sponsorship and said Indians should consider boycotting the premier cricket series if the decision isn’t reversed. The national co-convenor of SJM, Ashwani Mahajan, said on Monday BCCI’s decision went against the “current mood of the nation”. “The call for boycott of Chinese goods is no longer just a demand from the SJM, it is a call being supported by ordinary citizens in the wake of what transpired between India and China,” he said. The cricket board should be sensitive towards the nation and its security concerns, Mahajan said. “The whole world is boycotting China, IPL is sheltering them. They should understand that nothing is above the nation, not even cricket,” he added. Following the June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead, RSS and its affiliates have pushed the government to opt for a more muscular policy to deal with China and intensified their campaign to revisit bilateral trade ties. Lending support to the demand for boycotting Chinese goods, RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi told an RSS publication last month the campaign to not buy Chinese products “has happened naturally, not due to a mass movement”, implying the decision wasn’t enforced. The opposition too has criticised BCCI’s decision. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, “Wither #AatmaNirbharBharatAbhiyan .

03-08-2020||India||Tripura CPI(M) leader, 2 others booked on criminal conspiracy, rumour mongering after post against BJP||CPI(M) leader and former lawmaker from Tripura, Jitendra Chaudhury, and two others were on Sunday charged with criminal conspiracy, rumour-mongering and spreading communal disharmony over a social media post alleging BJP supporters broke a statue of an indigenous woman. The 17-feet long statue was found broken on Saturday morning in Khumulwng, the headquarters of the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC). Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secretary Mihir Sarkar lodged the complaint, claiming that the statue fell down because of heavy rainfall and storm. “ ....with an ill and perverse motive and malafide intention, one of the political parties of the state, Communist Party of India (Marxist) had tried to fraudulently distort the facts and has tried to put the blame upon BJP and RSS as is clear from Facebook posts of CPIM Paschim Tripura Zilla,” Sarkar said in his complaint. “We see it as a criminal effort to spread communal disharmony among the different communities of the state and as it appears a deep conspiracy has been hatched by the CPI ( M) to promote and spread communal violence in the state,” Sarkar said. Sarkar submitted the complaint at West Agartala Police Station from where it was referred to Radhapur police station in Khumulwng as the incident occurred in that place. “We took an FIR against three including former MP Jitendra Chaudhury under Section 120(b), 153(a), 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code. We are investigating the matter,” Suman Majumder, Jirania’s sub-divisional police officer, said. The administrators of the Facebook page of CPI(M) Tripura and that of CPI(M) Paschim Tripura Zilla were also charged.Tripura police appealed to people not to believe in rumours and warned that legal action would be taken against the violators. “Rumours are being spread in social media about one broken statue at Khumulwng, PS Radhapur, West district with an attempt to cause disharmony among the communities. Actually it fell down due to heavy rain and storm. A police party was present at that time when it fell down. A general diary entry has been recorded in the Radhapur police station in this regard,” the police posted on its social media page.Chaudhury had written on Facebook that the statue was vandalised and the state has been transformed into a laboratory of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and BJP to give a shape to their Hindu Rashtra model. “I didn’t say that they (BJP) did this. I said that since the formation of their government, their culture of violence began the journey with vandalising of statues of Lenin, Karl Marx and even last ruler Maharaja Bir Bikram. The saffron party polluted cultural, political and social environment of our state,” he said later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-cpi-m-leader-2-others-booked-on-criminal-conspiracy-rumour-mongering-after-post-against-bjp/story-yTfHjua6IGZk7DHJrOo7qK.html

He was released on parole for a month from Jalpaiguri Central Jail in north Bengal and went home in remote Lodhama village in Darjeeling district almost a week ago. On Sunday evening, when he was being taken to Tribeni Covid-19 hospital in Kalimpong, about 100 kilometres (km) from his native village, he managed to flee from the ambulance. There was no security in the ambulance, a jail official said. “The convict had asked the ambulance driver to stop in a wooded area. It was dark and he fled. A search operation has been launched,” said Subodh Dutta, officer-in-charge of Lodhoma police station. Even though his family members, including his daughter and elder brother, and some villagers have already been quarantined, he had spent a night with another convict in Darjeeling, who was also released on parole along with him. “We don’t know how many people he had come in contact with. He tested Covid-19 positive on Friday, but the ambulance arrived on Sunday. He absconded because of lack of security in the ambulance,” said Dutta. S Poonambalam, district magistrate, of Darjeeling said: “We will take up the matter with the police and trace him.” Senior officials of Jalpaiguri central jail said that some convicts, who have been released on parole or have completed their jail term, have tested Covid-19 positive after reaching home. “Many inmates and officials have also tested Covid-19 positive in the overcrowded jail,” said another official. A convict from Teesta Bazaar, who was released on July 20 after completing a seven-year jail term, also tested Covid-19 positive after reaching home. Abhishek Tiwari, DM, Jalpaiguri, however, said the district authorities are yet to be intimated about the convict’s escape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-lifer-who-tested-positive-for-covid-19-flees-from-custody/story-EEHL8uVgxRbkCXiD7hn2cO.html

03-08-2020||India||Positivity rate comes down by at least 50% in Bihar||The positive rate of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – the percentage of people testing positive out of those tested – has come down by at least 50% between July 15 and August 1, even though there has been a 63% surge in the number of cases during the corresponding period. The positivity rate, which was 15.17% on July 15 had dipped to 7.75% on August 1, indicates the extent of the viral outbreak, according to state the health department. The declining positivity rate, said officials, was due to increased testing of swab samples. Bihar, of late, has been able to ramp up its daily testing to more than 3.5 times since July 15, when it had tested 10,052 samples, as compared to 35,619 on August 1. The state has tested 6,12,415 samples to date. Bihar’s positivity rate has declined since July 27, when it was 14.53% and 14,236 tests were carried out on that day. The turnaround happened after Pratyaya Amrit replaced Uday Singh Kumawat, as the state principal secretary, health, on July 27. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was sore with Kumawat’s performance, had also chided him earlier. “When Delhi can do 38,000 tests per day, why can’t Bihar?” the angry CM is said to have fumed during a review meeting on the management of Covid-19 and floods that ravaged the state and had asked Kumawat to quit if he could not take care of the health department. Kumawat was unavailable for his comment. “The decline in positivity rate has been possible because we have been able to ramp up our daily testing across the state. I am still not satisfied with what has been achieved. I would like to get it down to less than 5%,” said Amrit. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a positivity rate of less than 5% — for two weeks — indicates that an epidemic is under control, he said, stressing on the CM’s mantra for increased daily testing. Dr. Tanmay Mahapatra, a Bihar-based epidemiologist, who had had a stint of research in the United States of America (USA) on infectious disease epidemiology, however, cautioned that the declining positivity alone was not enough. “Declining positivity may be a good sign in the sense that daily testing is being conducted more. Declining positivity, along with improving recovery (64% as on Sunday), and reducing the spread of the virus are all a good sign,” he said. “Test positivity may decrease due to many factors. The strengthening healthcare system to handle the upsurge, coupled with syndromic surveillance and home isolation are the need of the hour,” he added. Bihar reported 2,762 Covid cases on Sunday, as the tally climbed to 57,270, including 322 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-positivity-rate-comes-down-by-at-least-50-between-july-15-and-august-1/story-Gb0OfTKEoYayj5tct4ld9L.html

03-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India’s home minister, and the second most important and powerful man in the country has contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Amit Shah tweeted out the information himself, and said that while his health is fine, he is being admitted to a hospital on the recommendation of doctors. He also asked everyone who met him in the past few days to get themselves tested. This writer wishes Shah a rapid recovery, but his infection is significant because it highlights both the prevalence of the disease in the Capital, and the risks involved in what would have been considered normal before the pandemic.First, almost one in four people in Delhi show antibodies to the coronavirus disease, according to a recent survey of all of Delhi’s 11 districts, indicating that they have been exposed to it in the past (and infected, perhaps without showing any symptoms at all). It also means that these people have immunity against the disease, at least in the short-term — perhaps as long as their antibodies last, and maybe longer, according to Swedish research that shows that T-cells, which fight infected cells and have long memories, are there in roughly twice the number of people in whom antibodies are found.The fact that Shah has been infected points to the fact that the disease is all around us and that anyone could get infected at anytime. This is true for Mumbai as well, where another Amit (Amitabh Bachchan) was infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 (he was discharged from a hospital on Sunday), and where a limited sero survey (antibody test) in three of the city’s 23 wards showed that around 40% of the people in the city have been exposed to the disease. Caveat: this survey is not as representative as the Delhi one.A high prevalence of antibodies in the population may be good from the perspective of building immunity (and achieving herd immunity, the level of infection in a population that makes it difficult for the virus to travel easily from one person to another), but it is still dangerous for the old, infirm, and those with comorbidities.Second, people who continue to go about their work, even if they take adequate precautions, stand a high chance of getting infected. Shah continued to meet people, and, with Delhi’s infections peaking in June, got involved in the Capital’s fight against the disease — even visiting the LNJP Hospital, Delhi’s main facility to treat Covid-19 patients. It isn’t clear how Shah got infected — contrary to what the health ministry continues to claim, the disease has been in community transmission mode for a few months now, so it is difficult to trace the chain of infection. Shah also attended a cabinet meeting last week — the one in which the new National Education Policy was passed — which means everyone else who attended that meeting needs to isolate themselves and also go in for a test.India is currently in a phase the government calls Unlock 3.0, referring to more activities being allowed (and the scrapping of a night-time curfew), but Shah’s infection indicates that it isn’t going to be business-as-usual anytime soon. Participating in social activities, for work or for pleasure, increases the risk of contracting the infection. Wearing masks (all the time one is outside or at work), and practising social distancing and hand hygiene is the only way to prevent being infected.Interestingly, gyms and public transport, including metros, in countries and cities where these are functioning, have so far not been linked to any major clusters of infection — the first, according to a Norwegian study and the second, according to a recent article in the New York Times — but this writer believes that visiting a gym or taking a metro will come with risks for at least some time.Those of us who can avoid the risk altogether — through social isolation, WFH (work from home), video-conferencing — should, and those of us who cannot (I suspect Shah belongs to this category), should take adequate precautions and hope the mathematics of chance is in our favour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-GGV2AGisCXLzUlxtIn6WFJ.html
03-08-2020||India||‘Saddened by three-language formula in NEP 2020, won’t allow it’: Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami||Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said on Monday that he is saddened by the three-language formula adopted by the central government in the recently-announced National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.“We are saddened by the three-language formula introduced by the central government in National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Our state is already following two-language policy (of Tamil and English) for decades and there will be no changes in it,” Palaniswami said after chairing a cabinet meeting in Chennai.“I request Prime Minister to pay heed to the unanimous demand of the people of Tamil Nadu to reconsider the three language policy and allow states to make a decision as per their own policy,” he further said.Palaniswami’s statement comes in the backdrop of opposition to the NEP in Tamil Nadu on the grounds that the policy allegedly imposes Hindi and Sanskrit.The MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and many Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu have opposed the new education policy and want a review of the sweeping reforms it has proposed.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank had said on Sunday that the Centre will not impose any language on any state through NEP. Nishank posted the clarification through a tweet in Tamil while replying to former Union minister from Tamil Nadu Pon Radhakrishnan.“I once again like to insist that the Central government will not impose any language on any state,” Nishank said.On Saturday, the DMK chief said the policy was an attempt at alleged imposition of Hindi and Sanskrit and vowed to fight against it by joining hands with like-minded political parties and chief ministers of other states.Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy has also termed the NEP as “chaotic” and said it has several unanswered questions. He claimed that the policy has no specific and clear direction on promoting employment and has also not clarified whether the financial responsibility to implement it would fall on the state governments.“What is relevant for northern States cannot be taken as suitable for the southern states,” Narayanasamy said.Charging the Centre with seeking to “impose” Sanskrit through NEP, he also said it was fomenting ‘confusion’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saddened-by-three-language-formula-in-nep-2020-won-allow-it-tamil-nadu-cm-palaniswami/story-wCF0tGGpxPLfHjIYykjEmN.html

03-08-2020||India||Trial court must also record signs and gestures of hearing and speech impaired witness: HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has held that while recording the testimony of a hearing and speech-impaired witness, the trial courts must also record the signs and gestures made by the challenged person along with the interpretation put on the signs and gestures. Justice VK Jadhav said recording details of signs and gestures made by the witness was mandatory under Section 119 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which lays down the procedure for recording the testimony of a hearing and speech-impaired witness. The judge granted bail to a gang-rape convict, Abdul Salim, after noticing that the trial court did not record in its evidence the hearing and speech-impaired survivor the details of signs and gestures made by her while testifying before the court along with the interpretation put on the signs and gestures by a special teacher. “On careful perusal of prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of victim and evidence of the special teacher, it appears that the learned judge of the trial court has not taken any pains to record the gestures made by the victim during the course of recording her evidence nor there is any reference as to how those gestures came to be interpreted by the special teacher.” Abdul moved HC after Nanded sessions court on October 3, 2019, had convicted him for gang-raping the girl with hearing and speech impairment along with two juveniles, and sentenced him to 10-year imprisonment. He had filed a plea for bail during the pendency of his appeal and his lawyer pointed out the lacunae in recording the evidence of the survivor while urging the HC to suspend the substantive sentence headed down to the convict and release him on bail. Justice Jadhav found substance in the argument that the trial court had failed to comply with the mandate of Section 119 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 Besides, the judge also took note of the fact that the evidence of the doctor, who examined the survivor, was not clear and the medical evidence did not support the prosecution case of gang rape. HC also noted that though the opinion of the doctor about the possibility of forcible intercourse was unclear, he had stated clearly that he did not find any marks of struggle on the person of the survivor. Justice Jadhav was also annoyed with the manner in which the identification parade was conducted by the investigation officer, by calling a few boys in the age group between 18 and 20 years at the police station and asking the survivor to identify the three culprits. “This particular procedure is unknown to the criminal law, violating all norms and guidelines for conducting the identification parade,” said Justice Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trial-court-must-also-record-signs-and-gestures-of-hearing-and-speech-impaired-witness-hc/story-2ZzM1wso9iTBr38aXuPc6I.html
03-08-2020||India||Serum Institute gets regulatory nod for phase 2/3 trials of Oxford Covid vaccine||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has given approval to Serum Institute of India (SII) for conducting phase II and III clinical trials of Oxford University-Astra Zeneca vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country, the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) said on Monday. A senior official in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said, “The subject expert committee that went through the data and protocol submitted for the trial was satisfied with the results and based on their opinion the DCGI permitted its trial in India.” On July 20, the initial trial results for the vaccine candidate, Covishield, which were made public by Oxford University had shown promising results. The preliminary trial results published in the medical journal The Lancet said that the vaccine candidate was safe and induced immune reaction against SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and protect healthy people from infection. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “… As soon as they (DCGI) grant us permission, we will begin with the trials for the vaccine in India. We will soon start manufacturing the vaccine in large volumes,” Adar Poonawalla, CEO, SII, had said. SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by the number of doses produced and sold globally, has entered a manufacturing partnership with biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the Oxford vaccine. The company plans to start human clinical trials in India with about 5,000 participants. “One billion doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine will be produced over the next one year. The vaccines will be for India and middle-and low-income countries across the world,” Poonawalla had said. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from Chimpanzee and genetically modified to make it impossible for it to infect humans. Researchers added genetic material to ChAdOx1 from the Sars-CoV-2 virus’s surface protein, spike glycoprotein (S), which helps the virus to bind to Ace2 receptors to enter human cells and cause an infection. The new trial included 1,077 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 years with no history of Covid-19, and took place in five hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK) between April 23 and May 21.The data that was published in The Lancet covered the first 56 days of the trial and is ongoing. The widely-followed trial is currently at an advanced stage, with trials in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. A collaboration has already been reached between Oxford, the UK government and AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results are also positive. “India is one of the vaccine hubs globally, and wherever the Covid-19 vaccine is developed we will take lead in its manufacturing. The vaccine is the ultimate solution to prevent Covid-19 transmission even though India has managed to control the outbreak very well so far,” said Dr. Vinod Paul, a Niti Aayog member and the chairman of the Empowered Group on the government’s medical emergency management plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-gets-regulatory-nod-for-phase-2-3-trials-of-oxford-covid-vaccine/story-c0bWnh5aEv74GlW6OnuaoI.html

03-08-2020||India||People in flood relief camps to be tested for Covid-19 in Bihar||Bihar, grappling with Covid-19 and floods, has decided to test those staying in its flood relief camps for Sars CoV-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease.The tests will be done through rapid antigen detection (RAD) kit, which gives out instant result, though experts say it has a fair possibility of giving false negative result. “Testing people before getting them into our relief camps will allow us to segregate the infected people from healthy ones, so that we can shift them to other camps, which will also function as Covid-19 isolation camp for them. This will minimise the risk of spread of infection,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s principal secretary of departments of health and disaster management. The initiative will also help Bihar ramp up testing of samples. Bihar scaled up its daily testing rate almost five times in the last one month. As against 7,291 tests done on July 1, Bihar clocked 35,619 tests on August 1. Efforts were on to increase it further, said officials. The state reported 2,762 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking its overall case tally to 57,270, with 322 fatalities so far.The state government has set up 19 relief camps across four worst-hit districts by floods. Gopalganj had 11 relief camps, East Champaran two, Samastipur five and one in Khagaria districts.

Vinay Tiwari, heading a Patna Police team which is in Mumbai to investigate an ‘‘abetment to suicide’‘ case on the basis of a complaint filed by the late actor’s father in Patna, had reached the city earlier in the day.“IPS officer Vinay Tiwari reached Mumbai today from Patna on official duty to lead the police team there but he has been forcibly quarantined by BMC officials at 11 PM today,” Pandey tweeted. IPS officer Binay Tiwari reached Mumbai today from patna on official duty to lead the police team there but he has been forcibly quarantined by BMC officials at 11pm today.He was not provided accommodation in the IPSMess despite request and was staying in a guest house in Goregaw pic.twitter.com/JUPFRpqiGEWatch | Sushant death: Bihar IPS officer who reached Mumbai ‘forcibly quarantined’ Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said Tiwari has been quarantined as per the present guidelines for domestic arrivals at the Mumbai airport, according to news agency ANI.“He was not provided accommodation in the IPS mess, despite request, and was staying in a Guest House in Goregaon,” he said.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14.Rajput’s father lodged a police complaint against actor Rhea Chakraborty and her family members and the department registered a first information report (FIR) under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including abetment to suicide. Rajput’s father alleged that Chakraborty and her family kept his son away from his family, handled his bank accounts and took away crores of rupees. His FIR mentioned that when she found Rajput’s bank balance was depleting, she left his house on June 8 and took cash, jewellery and his medical reports along with her, and also blocked his mobile number.Rajput, according to him, had called his sister and told her that Chakraborty had threatened him that she would show the doctors’ receipts to the media and prove he was insane.Mumbai Police are also probing the death case and have so far recorded statements of nearly 40 people, including those from Rajput’s family, his cook and people from the film industry that include filmmakers Mahesh Bhatt and Aditya Chopra, film critic Rajeev Masand, director Sanjay Leela Bhansali.Pandey had said earlier that Rajput’s death shouldn’t be turned into a Maharashtra versus Bihar battle amid reports that the police team from Patna is not being helped by the force in Mumbai.“I am saying a simple thing that one should look at the sentiments of the country’s people. People say that he was a vibrant, enthusiastic and successful young man. They feel there is some kind of mystery if a man who had money and fame hangs himself,” he had said in an interview to a Hindi television news channel on Saturday.“That mystery must be probed and truth must come out. Why should anyone have any problem with that? Bihar Police have registered an FIR and started a probe,” he added.He had also urged Chakraborty to join the investigation into the death of Rajput being conducted by Patna Police if she has nothing to hide. The four-member team had reached Mumbai on July 27 and began its probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ips-officer-probing-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-forcibly-quarantined-by-bmc-bihar-police-chief/story-yP7KpY6BkQ2nlm58krkzHJ.html

Earlier, both Indian Army and PLA would undertake patrols to their perceived LAC once a month with both sides avoiding face-offs. Today with India and China both building border infrastructure right up to perceived LAC, the patrolling intensity has not only increased but also the friction with the opposing force,” said a second senior official. Also read: India, China to hold commander-level talks today, disengagement in finger area key focusWeeks of tensions along the LAC in eastern Ladakh flared into a violent brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese dead. The last attempt to exchange western sector maps in 2002 was unsuccessful with China pulling out at the last moment.While the national security establishment and the Indian Army don’t trust the PLA and feel that the Chinese border infrastructure allows for rapid deployment as compared to India’s, diplomats say that neither India nor China should object to upgrading border infrastructure as long as it is within their LAC limits and does not encroach on the other’s perception of where the border lies.“As long as the two sides keep away from each other’s perception of LAC, which is very well known to the ground troops, the situation can be controlled. Just as we can’t stop China from upgrading its border infrastructure, the same holds true for China too,” said another government official.While the PLA has shown some signs of thinning out troops from the depth areas in occupied Aksai Chin, the Indian Army and the PLA, for once, are not facing each other at all friction points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-plan-protocol-to-avoid-skirmishes/story-vIhdZCJb2jGmd7RlSE2OFM.html

Amit Shah, who is the first union cabinet minister to have tested positive for Covid-19, announced this on Twitter : “After showing initial symptoms, I underwent a test for coronavirus and the report came out positive. My health is fine but I am being admitted to the hospital on the advice of doctors”. The home minister also requested those who came in his contact in last few days to isolate themselves and get tested. Among those who have met Amit Shah in last few days and have gone into isolation are BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and Babul Supriyo. Babul Supriyo tweeted “I had met Honble HM Amit Shah Ji day before in the evening. I am advised by doctors to confine myself, away from my family members, for the next few days with a test to be done soon”. Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, who was attending regular meetings with the home minister, few joint secretaries and Shah’s personal staff as well as security personnel deployed in his close proximity are also likely to be in isolation and undergo tests, government officials familiar with the matter said. The officials added that Amit Shah has had a full schedule for the past few days: he was present at the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Wednesday, in which the government approved the new National Education Policy . However, social distancing was strictly followed at the cabinet meeting at the PM’s residence, the officials said. “There is a strict protocol at PM’s residence in the last few months which includes temperature checks, analyzing a person’s status through Aarogya Setu app and proper hand sanitization,” said an official who didn’t wish to be named.

Speaking at a webinar , Abdullah, a Lok Sabha member and president of the National Conference (NC), said the government took the decision on the abrogation of the special status without consulting anyone from J&K. “It was passed in one day in Rajya Sabha and another day in Lok Sabha,” he said and added that the narrative sold by the government is that Kashmir would now become a part of India. “We were always part of India holding the tricolour,” Abdullah said. BJP leader Priya Sethi and former MLC Surinder Ambardar countered Abdullah and said the abrogation of Article 370 provisions had become necessary to ensure all-round development. “One year is little time to assess the benefits, give us some time and you will see for yourself,” Sethi said.  “Article 370 was a continuation of the two-nation theory which gave rise to Pakistan in 1947,” Ambardar said. “What changed which forced them (to take such a decision)? This was the agenda of the BJP to abrogate it and so it projected it that development will be pouring in from the top, industrialists will come in and the whole map will change. UTs become states but states never become UTs,” Abdullah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revoking-article-370-didn-t-usher-in-any-development-in-j-k-farooq-abdullah/story-23rObQ2tyn3epkj80VBFlI.html

03-08-2020||India||Uttarakhand to develop 6 city forests to increase green cover in urban spaces||The Uttarakhand forest department will develop six city forests in Kumaon region, including two in the plains and four in hilly districts, said forest officials. The forest department has also started searching for land in municipal areas, said officials. Tejaswini Patil, chief conservator forests (CCF) Kumaon region said six city forests will be developed in Kumaon region. “Two will be developed in the plains and four in hilly districts. Each forest will be created in around 10 hectares land. These city forests will be developed in civic areas” she said. Patil said the purpose of city forests is to increase the green cover in urban areas and thus help in creating a green and clean environment in such spaces. “Also, its purpose is to connect people with greenery and clean environment through the city forests. We hope it will also motivate people to plant trees to compensate for the loss of greenery due to concretization in the city areas,” she said The forest department has identified land for city forests in Haldwani (Nanital) and US Nagar. However, forest officials said it is comparatively challenging to identify 10-hectare land in hilly districts (Almora, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh and Champawat). “So the forest department has sent a proposal for only one-hectare city forests in hilly districts,” said a senior forest official. “Ten 10 hectares of land is being acquired in the municipal areas in plain districts. But it is not easy to find 10 hectares of land at one place in hilly districts. So we have sent a proposal to the Central government to make provision for city forests over one hectare of land in the hilly districts of Uttarakhand,” said Patil. She said if the Centre approves the proposal, then city forests will be developed over a hectare of land in hilly districts. Uttarakhand’s first city forest is being developed in Dehradun, she added. According to the last two surveys conducted by the Forest Survey of India over a period of four years from 2015 to 2019, Uttarakhand has not managed to report even an increase of even 1% forest cover in the state. Uttarakhand reported an increase of a mere 8.04 sq km of forests as per the India State of Forest Report 2019, released by the Forest Survey of India in December last year. The India State of Forest Report 2017, released by the Union ministry of environment and forests in February 2018, showed that only a marginal increase of 23 sq km forest cover was reported in Uttarakhand since 2015. The report of 2017 showed a meagre increase of 165 sq km in very dense forest and 636 sq km in other forest categories, while the moderate dense forest diminished with a difference of 778 sq km, leaving the total cover in state to 24,295 sq km. As per the 2019 report the districts of Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar reported a negative result of -2.75 sq km, -6.44 sq km and -4.21sq km decrease in forest area with respect to the assessment done by Forest Survey of India in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-develop-6-city-forests-to-increase-green-cover-in-urban-spaces/story-6Wm1MJ9RV78t7A81obppRO.html
03-08-2020||India||Sushant’s death embroiled in a web of theories||On the morning of Sunday, June 14, Sushant Singh Rajput, a 34-year-old actor with a seemingly promising movie career ahead of him, was found dead at his rented apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra in what the police suspected was a case of suicide. The death triggered dark conspiracy theories of how a powerful cabal of Bollywood producers had tried to sabotage his career, pushing him to kill himself, and set off a raging debate on insiders versus outsiders and the role of nepotism in the Hindi movie business.Also read: Disha Salian’s mother on Sushant Singh Rajput’s death: ‘How can there be a connection after meeting him just once?’Almost 50 days later, the police are still investigating what exactly prompted Rajput to commit suicide, which remains a mystery. After all, he seemed to have a lot going for him; his last film, 2019’s Chhichhore, was a box-office winner, earning Rs150 crore, and he had a release coming up in Dil Bechara, which eventually started streaming on July 24 on an over-the-top (OTT) movie platform.Rajput’s long-time ex-girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, 35, has demanded an in-depth investigation, saying a man with so much joie de vivre couldn’t have sunk into such a deep depression that he would have taken his own life, and offered to be a witness. His last girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty, 28, said the actor was under severe mental stress and on medication.Rajput’s father has, meanwhile, filed a first information report (FIR) in Patna against Chakraborty, after which she moved the Supreme Court, pleading that the investigation remain with Mumbai Police. He accused her of, among other things, abetment to suicide.“I have immense faith in god and the judiciary. I believe that I will get justice. Even though a lot of horrible things are being said about me on the electronic media, I refrain from commenting on the advice of my lawyers as the matter is sub-judice. Satyameva Jayate, the truth shall prevail,” Chakraborty said in a video message on July 31.The road to stardomBorn in Patna on January 21, 1986 to Krishan Kumar Singh and Usha Singh, Rajput attended St. Karen’s High School in Patna. After his mother’s death in 2002, he was devastated, and the family moved to Delhi the same year. Rajput completed his schooling in New Delhi’s Kulachi Hansraj Model School, and wanted to pursue engineering.He cleared as many as 11 engineering entrance examinations, and completed three years out of four in the Bachelor of Engineering course at Delhi Technological University before dropping out. Having enrolled in choreographer Shiamak Davar’s dance classes, Rajput was selected in 2005 as one of the background dancers for a popular awards ceremony. The lure of theatre and dance was too powerful to resist.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s call records, family of ex-manager on Bihar Police’s probe radarHe was noticed by the makers of his first television series, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, at a stage performance, and landed a role. He became popular enough for Ekta Kapoor to choose him for a lead role in the daily soap Pavitra Rishta in 2009. His chemistry with co-star Lokhande was apparent, and the two dated each other until breaking up in 2016.Bollywood came calling after his small screen appearances. In 2013, Rajput made a successful film debut with Kai Po Che!, which started his Bollywood journey. Shuddh Desi Romance, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story were his subsequent films. The last named movie was a box office smash, cementing Rajput’s stardom.After Chhichhore turned out to be a box-office hit, Dil Bechara, a remake of the 2014 Hollywood film The Fault In Our Stars, opened to a record-breaking 95 million views in 24 hours on Disney Hotstar on July 24. Now with the actor gone, his family has decided to convert his childhood home, which is located in Rajeev Nagar, Patna, into a memorial, said a statement released by the family. It will house his telescope, guitar, flight simulator and other personal belongings that reflect his eclectic tastes, including an abiding interest in astronomy.The investigationMumbai Police swung into action on June 14 after a domestic help alerted the department about Rajput being found hanging in his room.“He has committed suicide. Mumbai Police is investigating. The police has not found any (suicide) note yet,” Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Pranay Ashok said then. The actor’s maternal uncle, the following day, claimed that there seemed to be a “conspiracy” behind his death, and that “he has been murdered”.Also read: Ankita Lokhande on why she didn’t go to Sushant Singh Rajput’s funeral: ‘I knew if I see him like that, I will never be able to forget’Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted on June 15, “While the post mortem report says actor @itsSSR committed suicide by hanging himself, there are media reports that he allegedly suffered from clinical depression because of professional rivalry. @MumbaiPolice will probe this angle too.”Mumbai Police sought a copy of the actor’s contract with production house Yash Raj Films (YRF), with which he had signed a three-film deal.Statements by Rajput’s father and two sisters were recorded on June 16 wherein the father reportedly revealed that his son would often feel “low” but they didn’t know he was depressed. Mukesh Chhabra, the director of Rajput’s last film Dil Bechara, recorded his statement with the police on June 17.On June 18, Chakraborty was called for questioning at the Bandra police station. She reportedly revealed that he had been suffering from depression for the past few months, and had stopped taking the medicines for the past few weeks. The two had been living together during the lockdown, she claimed, and she left his house after a fight. Rohini Iyer, a friend of Rajput’s and ex-publicist, was next questioned on June 22.The final post mortem report in the case was received on June 25, which identified the cause of the actor’s death as “asphyxia due to hanging”, stating that it was a “clear case of suicide”.YRF casting director Shanoo Sharma was questioned on June 27, Rajput’s Dil Bechara co-star Sanjana Sanghi on June 30, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali on July 6. Abhishek Trimukhe, DCP (Zone IX), Mumbai police, said Bhansali had planned to cast Rajput in four of his films, but due to non-availability of his dates, other actors had to be cast instead. He added that the police had taken into custody CCTV recordings of the building where the late actor stayed.Nepotism debate, professional rivalryIn the public domain, and in the police investigation, the focus turned towards alleged nepotism and professional rivalry in the movie world and dragged some big names into the case. After asking for a copy of Rajput’s contract with YRF, the police called in head honcho of the production house, Aditya Chopra, for questioning on July 18. It was speculated, especially after actor Kangana Ranaut said so in a TV interview, that having signed a three-film deal with YRF, Rajput lost out on some big outside projects because YRF didn’t allow him to do them and instead let actor Ranveer Singh, also a part of the production house’s talent pool, to do them instead. Hindustan Times couldn’t independently verify the claims.Director Shekhar Kapur’s film Paani, which was to be produced by YRF, was one project which didn’t take off, and speculation has been that it affected the actor’s mental health and pushed him into depression.According to several media reports, Chopra told the police that the project had to be shelved owing to creative differences between him and Kapur. He also added that no one in YRF stopped Rajput from working outside the banner, and that Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, one of the films that Bhansali said he offered to Rajput, already had Ranveer Singh on board before YRF’s deal with Rajput took place.Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt was called in for questioning on July 27. His association with Chakraborty was being seen with suspicion, and it was speculated that he had asked her to leave Rajput. Bhatt’s associate Sucharita Das, in a now deleted Facebook post, had written that Bhatt had told Chakraborty to “walk away or this will take you down under along with him”. In a statement, Bhatt said he met the late actor through her, and never asked her to quit the relationship. He also reportedly said Rajput was never offered a role in his upcoming film Sadak 2.Filmmaker Karan Johar has also been under the scanner after Rajput’s fans alleged that he sabotaged the actor’s career by casting him in the movie Drive, which was stuck for over two years for a theatrical release and eventually released digitally to bad reviews, and noted that Rajput had been made fun of on his chat show, Koffee With Karan.Apoorva Mehta, CEO of Johar’s production house Dharma Productions, was next to record his statement with the police. He also submitted to the police a copy of the contract for Drive.Family complaintOn July 25, Rajput’s father filed an FIR against his girlfriend Chakraborty with Patna police. Sanjay Singh, inspector general of Patna (central zone), told ANI that the FIR was registered under various sections, including abetment to suicide. Sections of the Indian Penal Code including 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in a dwelling house), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 306 (abetment of suicide) were invoked, according to PTI.“A four-member team has been sent to Mumbai. The team will collect case diary and other important documents from Mumbai Police,” Singh added.Rajput’s father levelled serious allegations against Chakraborty and her family, including that they kept him away from his family, handled his bank accounts and took away crores of rupees. His FIR mentioned that when she found Rajput’s bank balance was depleting, she left his house on June 8 and took cash, jewellery and his medical reports along with her, and also blocked his mobile number.Rajput, according to him, had called his sister and told her that Chakraborty had threatened him that she would show the doctors’ receipts to the media and prove he was insane.On June 8, Rajput’s manager Disha Salian, who had been appointed by Chakraborty, committed suicide. He was, according to the FIR, afraid that Chakraborty would pin the responsibility for the suicide on him after she threatened to frame him in a murder case. In his complaint, the late actor’s father also sought to invoke the provisions of the Mental Health Care Act, alleging that the “machinations” of Chakraborty and her family members affected Rajput’s mental health, which drove him to suicide despite a successful career. Bihar Police started an investigation on the basis of this FIR.What took the case to a totally different direction was Rajput’s father claiming that the family had approached the Mumbai police four months before his alleged suicide. Vikas Singh, ex-additional solicitor general and the former’s lawyer, told Times Now channel, “On 25th February, the family had reported to Bandra police saying, ‘he is not in good company and please ensure nothing untoward happens to him’,” adding that the Patna police only filed the FIR after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar stepped in. Political turnAfter Rajput’s family filed the FIR, the Bihar and Maharashtra governments are tussling over the actor’s death probe. The Bihar government has alleged that Mumbai police is not cooperating. Lalit Kishore, Bihar’s advocate general, said, “When one state’s police goes to another, they get cooperation. It’s unfortunate that Mumbai police is not helping us in the probe.”Maharashtra’s minister of state for home Satej Patil said: “Mumbai police will probe the case properly and it is going in the right direction.” He ruled out a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Many political leaders have demanded the CBI’s intervention. On June 18, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Jharkhand, Nishikant Dubey, claimed that Rajput was “pressured” to end his life and blamed his death on a “mafia” and “syndicate” operating in Bollywood. Actor-turned-BJP MP Rupa Ganguly, Rajput’s cousin Neeraj Singh, an MLA in Bihar, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati, and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, too have pressed for a CBI probe.Alleged financial irregularities pointed out in the FIR filed by Rajput’s father prompted former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis to urge the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to look into the case. On July 31, he tweeted, “There is a huge public sentiment about handing over #SushantSinghRajput case to CBI but looking at the reluctance of State Government, atleast @dir_ed ED can register an ECIR {Enforcement Case Information Report} since misappropriation and money laundering angle has come out.”The ED, after studying the FIR filed by Bihar police, registered a money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Who is Rhea Chakaborty?A video jockey and actor, Chakraborty made her Bollywood debut with Mere Dad Ki Maruti in 2013 after hosting TV shows and starring in a Telugu film.Chakraborty and Rajput started dating around one-and-a-half years ago and had been living in together for a year. The two never made their relationship official although they often posted pictures with each other on social media with romantic captions. After Rajput’s death, many trolled Chakraborty for not posting a single condolence message or grieving her boyfriend’s demise.It was on July 14, exactly a month after the actor’s death, that she wrote a long post on social media and identified herself as “Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend”. Two days later, she revealed that she was getting rape and death threats and filed a complaint with Cyber Crime department.“I was called a gold digger, I kept quiet. I was called a murderer, I kept quiet. I was slut shamed, I kept quiet. But how does my silence give you the right to tell me that you will get me RAPED and MURDERED if I don’t commit suicide? Do you realise the seriousness of what you have said....” she wrote with a screenshot of the comment.The same day, she appealed to Union home minister Amit Shah for a CBI probe into Rajput’s death case, as she wanted to “understand what pressures prompted Sushant to take this step”.Mental health in the spotlightRajput’s sudden death sparked a conversation about mental health, and the kind of difficult life film stars lead.The police are reported to have found medical prescriptions and medicines for depression in the late actor’s room when they found him hanging. According to an Indian Express report, deputy commissioner of Police Abhishek Trimukhe had said, “We have so far recorded the statement of his sister, two managers, a cook, actor Mahesh Shetty (Rajput’s close friend) and a keymaker who was called to the spot to open his bedroom’s door” on June 14. From their statements, the police learnt that the late actor was depressed.What added another angle to the case was Kangana Ranaut’s viral Instagram video where she talked about how outsiders— people in the film industry without any family connections in the business — are pressurised by the insiders.Filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, whose project with Rajput got shelved, wrote in a condolence tweet: “I knew the pain you were going through. I knew the story of the people that let you down so bad that you would weep on my shoulder. I wish I was around the last six months. I wish you had reached out to me. What happened to you was their Karma. Not yours.”In a new twist to the debate, Mumbai-based psychotherapist Susan Walker, claiming to be Rajput’s therapist, told journalist Barkha Dutt’s multi-media content platform Mojo that the late actor was suffering from severe bipolar disorder and tried to offer a clean chit to Chakraborty, setting off a controversy on whether her revelation had breached patient-therapist confidentiality.Director Abhishek Kapoor, who directed Rajput’s debut film Kai Po Che and later Kedarnath (2018), said in an interview that it was a case of “systematic dismantling of a fragile mind” by the film industry.“Sushant was a troubled man who was systematically dismantled by the industry. Sushant was fragile, he had become fragile. He was incredibly intelligent, but he was also a complicated guy. He was an engineer, he was into astrophysics and quantum physics. But because we couldn’t box him into stereotypes we called him ‘off’. He was off, just off your radar. There’s this thing that if you’re not like us then you can’t be with us. There are so many camps that if you’re not part of a camp, even if you’re in the middle of a room, you will be ignored.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-s-death-embroiled-in-a-web-of-theories/story-TEWZDqHtQRJXoN22jE5cqJ.html
03-08-2020||India||Inbound flyers can skip isolation after online declaration||International passengers arriving in India will have to upload a report showing they had tested negative for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) if they want exemption from a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine, according to a union health ministry guideline issued on Sunday. Travellers also need to submit online a self-declaration at least 72 hours before their scheduled travel on the portal www.newdelhiairport.in, the guideline said. The test should be done using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, considered to be the gold standard of testing for Covid-19, and conducted no longer than 96 hours before travel. Since the government started Vande Bharat Mission flights from May 6 to repatriate Indian citizens stranded overseas, the Centre has been allowing passengers to go home straight, bypassing the seven-day mandatory institutional quarantine. Exemption from the quarantine is meant only for people with compelling reasons including human distress, pregnancy, death in the family, serious illness and for parent(s) with children of the age of 10 years or below. Top officials involved in the planning maintained that the authorities, especially at Delhi airport, are flooded with a vast number of exemption requests -- both genuine and fraudulent — leading to massive crowds at Delhi airport that result in passengers getting stuck for about 3-4 hours in the triage area. The officials requested anonymity. Civil aviation authorities said that earlier this month a young man held up an inhaler to back his claim that he had a “serious disease” to go home. Another man cited a death in the family to skip institutional quarantine and other passengers in the queue took the lead and made similar excuses to go home, Delhi government officials said.“Passengers would ask relatives or friends to send WhatsApp messages and show them to authorities to claim death in family,” said one official. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri told HT that he received complaints from passengers about long, tiring queues and massive crowding at the Delhi airport, which prompted him to ask officials and airport authorities to put in place an online system. The new system will kick in from August 8. “We have deliberately given this time so that passengers are informed and well-prepared before arrival,” one of the officials added.The government will inform passengers of the status of their application through the same portal. “They should also give an undertaking on the portal that they would undergo mandatory quarantine for 14 days i.e. 7 days paid institutional quarantine at their own cost, followed by 7 days isolation at home with self-monitoring of health,” the guideline added. Travellers who seek exemption from institutional quarantine and upload their Covid-19 free certificate will also need to fill an online self-declaration form attesting to the authenticity of the certificate. “Any fraudulent claims will be liable for criminal prosecution. The test report could also be produced upon arrival at the point of entry airport in India,” the guideline says. Only asymptomatic travellers will be allowed to board after thermal screening, including those arriving through the land borders. Only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to cross the border into India. If the required documents are not furnished online for some reason, passengers will have the option of filling a hard copy in duplicate in the flight or ship that will be submitted to the health and immigration officials at the airport, seaport or land port. Passengers found to be symptomatic during screening will be isolated on the spot and moved to a hospital for further assessment, in line with government protocol. States are free to tweak the guideline according to local requirements. “States can develop their own protocol with regards to quarantine and isolation as per their assessment post arrival of passengers in the state concerned,” the guideline says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inbound-flyers-can-skip-isolation-after-online-declaration/story-706ykdEudctDjYLuN1PS3H.html
03-08-2020||India||Silver lining as Covid-19 recoveries see big spike||The number of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in India crossed the 1.1 million mark over the weekend when over 100,000 people were declared free of the virus, the highest numbers recorded yet over two days in what is being seen as a sign of the country’s disease mitigation strategy being effective in avoiding a high number of fatalities. HT’s dashboard of Covid-19 data from across the country showed that 51,845 recovered on Saturday and 40,449 recovered on Sunday, bringing the proportion of recoveries to 65.76%. As on Sunday, of the 1,803,267 infections in all, 38,159 people have succumbed to the viral disease, translating to a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.12%. As of Sunday night, the doubling rate of cases – the number of days it takes for infections to double – across the country is 21.2 days. Coordinated implementation of “effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols” resulted in a consistent trend of rising recovery rate and progressively reducing CFR, said a statement by the Union health ministry on Sunday.The trends indicate India’s response to the pandemic is “improving at various levels of care including at the societal level as well as in hospitals,” said Niti Aayog member VK Paul, who heads the national task force on Covid. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It suggests that we have learnt to take care of our positive cases; we have learnt how soon to act and what works and what doesn’t. We are able to provide more organised and systematic treatment clinically. Those involved in Covid-19 management are learning by the day by reading and from each other,” Paul added. To be sure, India’s recovery rate is expected to eventually soar to over 90% — since current trends indicate the final fatality rate could lie between 2-3% — once the outbreak nears its end. For instance Germany, which has had over 200,000 infections but at present has around 8,300 active cases, has a recovery rate of 92%.A look at infection, recovery and fatality rates from the top 10 countries with the highest cases shows only the United States — at around 50% — has a lower rate of recovery than India.In India, the 579,183 active cases (as of August 1) account for 32.12% of the total case load. At the current rate in which new cases are reported, active cases are doubling in 27.3 days, and new hot spots emerging in three large-population states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal, threatens to bring this number down – thereby accelerating the speed at which the outbreak grows. The current CFR also masks the potential fatalities that could be recorded from among the over 500,000 active cases at present. According to a study in Lancet based on case progression among patients in China, it takes around 17 days for people who develop critical Covid-19 infections to succumb to the illness. Also read: Key governance issues return to focus in Delhi as Covid-19 cases dropThe 38,159 deaths seen till August 2 will thus correspond, roughly, to the 1,004,652 cases seen 17 days ago on July 16. This brings India’s lagged case fatality ratio to 3.8% -- a number consistent with what has been seen in countries that have largely been able to keep its health care systems from being overwhelmed. Italy and Spain, two European nations that were hit hard in the second peak of the global pandemic and accounted for larger populations of more vulnerable people, have a CFR of over 14% and 8%, respectively. “India’s mortality rate is low; under 3%, which means around 97-98% of those who get infected will eventually recover. The recovery rate is also linked with the case load; if the case load is higher, the recovery will take longer as it will also include higher percentage of serious cases,” said a senior epidemiologist with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), requesting not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media. The official said the numbers also reflect the accuracy in reporting, which could vary between states. “If the number of positive cases goes up then recovery rate will automatically slow down, and that explains why states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, etc, have low recovery rate. Also, for states and UTs having higher recoveries, it could also indicate fewer new infections being reported on a daily basis in comparison,” he added. Another set of epidemiologists say that it could also mean in certain regions there probably are fewer severely ill cases, leading to faster recovery, which needs to be analysed. “Looks like more number of discharges have taken place in the last two to three weeks. And most of these can be asymptomatic too, so might discharge faster. The pattern needs to be studied if it’s area specific and what could be the cause,” says Dr Giridhara Babu, professor, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India. Out of the total active cases currently, 0.28% patients are on ventilator, 1.61% require intensive care unit (ICU) support, and 2.32% are on oxygen support – trends that officials said reflected the level of preparations. “What has also worked for India is that we have been prepared well in advance that has ensured our health system is not overwhelmed, and there is buffer, cushion and headroom that helps in saving lives. Faster recoveries are also because of increased testing because of which we are able to detect cases early and act accordingly,” he added. The country’s maximum case load, which is about 80% of the cases, is restricted to 50 districts out of about 740 total districts. Experts said this could also indicate that the way Covid is affecting Indians – the disease has been established to hit countries with older populations harder – may be different from the way it has in countries like Italy and Spain. “This is a good sign that people are getting better and our mortality is low. Most positive cases do not require hospitalisation, and those needing intensive care is actually a minuscule number. Most people in hospitals have moderate disease with good chances of recovery. The need is to take care of our old and vulnerable population with co-morbidities that is at high risk of developing severe illness,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare. The government is now shifting its focus to emerging hot spots and rural pockets, Niti Aayog’s Paul said. “Rural India needs special focus because if we have advantages like low population density and better surveillance... there are also challenges like limited access to health care facilities [in these regions]. The long distances can work to our disadvantage, which is why it is important to ensure rural areas are not severely affected. Right now we are managing fine, and watching the situation closely,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/silver-lining-as-covid-19-recoveries-see-big-spike/story-k998o75dzmlxdW11PMTx5I.html
03-08-2020||India||Congress warns leaders over Twitter war amid Rajasthan crisis||The Congress on Sunday stepped in to check a war of words between seniors who served as ministers in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and young leaders considered close to former party chief Rahul Gandhi, cautioning both sides against playing “Twitter-Twitter.” Both sides were told to air their views only on organisational platforms and not on social media. The party’s media department head Randeep Singh Surjewala was asked by the top leadership to rush to Delhi from a trip to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and address a news conference to ask the warring leaders to refrain from escalating the matter, a Congress leader said on condition of anonymity. Also read: BJP using ED in Rajasthan after failing to kidnap democracy, says CongressRahul Gandhi has been upset by media reports suggesting a deep divide within the party between the seniors and young leaders and “unwarranted” criticism of the UPA government, the leader said. “Rahul Gandhi does not appreciate people making an issue out of a non-issue. He wanted an immediate end to this so-called old versus young divide debate and the Twitter war over UPA’s performance and subsequently Surjewala rushed to Delhi,” the leader added. Surjewala, addressing a news conference at the party headquarters in Delhi, said, “I will advise friends who are playing Twitter-Twitter to stop making comments on social media. We have internal democracy and you should present your views at the appropriate party platforms.” The advisory to stop open mudslinging in the social media came a day after four former ministers – Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Milind Deora -- came out to defend the ten-year tenure of Manmohan Singh as PM and the UPA government following critical remarks against the former ruling coalition by young Congress leader Rajeev Satav, considered close to Rahul Gandhi. At Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with party’s Rajya Sabha members on Thursday, Satav suggested introspection over the UPA II tenure that, he said, was responsible for the party dropping to an all-time low of 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Surjewala conveyed the leadership’s message in no uncertain terms to both the sides — that no one can question former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and there were no differences between him and Rahul Gandhi who “owns up {to} and stands by each and every decision” of UPA I and II. On Sunday, except former Madhya Pradesh Digvijaya Singh and Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore, who later deleted his tweets, no other leader commented on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-warns-leaders-over-twitter-war-amid-rajasthan-crisis/story-l925RIfCsetKcJMbcYMwdM.html
03-08-2020||India||Woman, 15-year-old daughter raped in MP||A woman in her thirties and her 15-year-old daughter were abducted and raped by six people in a village in Burhanpur district on the Madhya Pradesh-Maharashtra border on Friday night, police said on Sunday. The crime came to light on Saturday, when the husband of the woman, a labourer, informed officials at the Shahpur police station after the victims returned home, officials said. “The six accused barged into the dwelling of the victims around midnight on Friday. They held the labourer captive and stole about ₹2,500 in cash and a mobile phone. When they started taking the labourer’s wife and minor daughter, the labourer cried for help and a neighbour came to help them but the miscreants tied them both with a rope and beat them up. The accused took the woman and her daughter to a nearby agricultural field at knife-point and raped them,” said M Tarnekar, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Burhanpur. Both the woman and her daughter were taken to a hospital, officials said. Police officials suspect that the accused might have crossed the border. Two teams of police personnel have been sent to the neighbouring districts of Jalgaon and Bhaswal in Maharashtra to track the criminals, after Khargone range deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Tilak Singh, ordered a special team to identify and nab the accused.“The family belongs to Chhattisgarh but they moved to Burhanpur, a year ago to work as labourers at a stone crushing plant in the village where the crime was committed under Shahpur police station,” said Tarnekar. An FIR under sections 347 (wrongful confinement), 363 (kidnapping) and 376D (gang-rape) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has been filed against the unidentified accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-15-year-old-daughter-raped-in-mp/story-8dhbjGWSuS8wFNk0qE0wvK.html
03-08-2020||India||Amid Rajasthan crisis, Cong warns leaders over Twitter war||New Delhi: The Congress on Sunday stepped in to check a war of words between seniors who served as ministers in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and young leaders considered close to former party chief Rahul Gandhi, cautioning both sides against playing “Twitter-Twitter.” Both sides were told to air their views only on organisational platforms and not on social media. The party’s media department head Randeep Singh Surjewala was asked by the top leadership to rush to Delhi from a trip to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and address a news conference to ask the warring leaders to refrain from escalating the matter, a Congress leader said on condition of anonymity. Rahul Gandhi has been upset by media reports suggesting a deep divide within the party between the seniors and young leaders and “unwarranted” criticism of the UPA government, the leader said. “Rahul Gandhi does not appreciate people making an issue out of a non-issue. He wanted an immediate end to this so-called old versus young divide debate and the Twitter war over UPA’s performance and subsequently Surjewala rushed to Delhi,” the leader added. Surjewala and party colleague Ajay Maken had been camping in Rajasthan for the past three weeks to deal with a crisis faced by the Ashok Gehlot government following a rebellion by former deputy chief minister and state Congress president Sachin Pilot and 18 other legislators. “I will advise friends who are playing Twitter-Twitter to stop making comments on social media. We have internal democracy and you should present your views at the appropriate party platforms,” Surjewala said, addressing a news conference at the party headquarters in Delhi. The advisory to stop open mud-slinging in the social media came a day after four former ministers – Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Milind Deora -- came out to defend the ten-year tenure of Manmohan Singh as PM and the UPA government following critical remarks against the former ruling coalition by young Congress leader Rajeev Satav, considered close to Rahul Gandhi. At Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with party’s Rajya Sabha members on Thursday, Satav suggested introspection over the UPA II tenure that, he said, was responsible for the party dropping to an all-time low of 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Satav was responding to senior leader Kapil Sibal’s call for introspection within the party for not being able to corner Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) despite their “failures to tackle Covid-19 pandemic and counter Chinese transgressions and the setback on the economic front.” Surjewala conveyed the leadership’s message in no uncertain terms to both the sides - that no one can question former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and there were no differences between him and Rahul Gandhi who “owns up {to} and stands by each and every decision” of UPA I and II. Apart from communicating that Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were on the same page as far as the UPA’s decisions, policies and programmes are concerned, Surjewala also sought to assuage the feelings of the seniors by recognising their contribution to the party. “Senior leaders have much more responsibility. They have done excellent work in the government and the party organisation. In the time of economic crisis, Covid-19 pandemic and Chinese intrusions, they should stand together with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh and show the mirror to the government. It is also their responsibility to guide the young leaders, promote and also make way for them,” Surjewala said. On Sunday, except former Madhya Pradesh Digvijaya Singh and Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore, who later deleted his tweets, no other leader commented on social media about the ongoing tussle in the party. “I agree. He (Rahul Gandhi) is different and wants to do politics differently. We should allow him to do so but then we also would like him to be more active in Parliament and more accessible to people. As advised by {Nationalist Congress Party chief} Sharad Pawar he should go around India.‘Yatras are important to connect,” Singh said in response to a tweet by a Congress member. At the press conference, Surjewala listed the achievements of the UPA government in its 10-year rule and referred to the rural job guarantee scheme, the Right to Information Act, the Food Security Act and the Right to Education Act. “The UPA government did remarkable work but couldn’t take on the conspiracy hatched against it,” he said and criticised the people behind the anti-corruption campaign led by social activist Anna Hazare that damaged the image of the coalition. Without taking names of Puducherry lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai and Yoga guru Ramdev, he alleged that they worked under the guidance of the BJP and Modi with Hazare, who was the face of the campaign and has since been “dumped in a village” in Maharashtra. Meanwhile, a day after Gehlot said he would embrace rebel Congress legislators if they apologised to the party high command, the Congress on Sunday asked Pilot to spell out his position unequivocally and hold a conversation. “Sachin Pilot must come and hold a conversation first. Pilot must come out and state his position clearly and unequivocally first and only then can any talk of his return happen,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rajasthan-crisis-cong-warns-leaders-over-twitter-war/story-tRujMxZgEtSC14SfKiszJL.html
03-08-2020||India||1st shipment of cargo leaves Chabahar port for Thailand||New Delhi A ship carrying Iranian goods bound for Thailand left Chabahar port last week, marking the first time the strategic port has been used to ship a consignment to a Southeast Asian country. MV Libra sailed from Shahid Behesthi terminal of Chabahar port, which is operated by an Indian state-run company, with 123 containers on July 29. This included the first ever shipment from Chabahar to Bangkok, people familiar with developments said. The merchant vessel sailed to Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai and Mumdra port, from where the consignment will be transhipped to Thailand, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. They said the shipment is significant in view of efforts by India and Iran to enhance the economic viability of Chabahar port. The director general of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan Ports and Maritime Organisation, Behrouz Aghaei, was quoted by the Iranian media as saying that this was the first time aquatic products were shipped from Chabahar to Thailand. Afghanistan recently sent a consignment of different products, including dried fruits, to India and China through Shahid Beheshti terminal as well, Aghaei said. The vessel carrying the Afghan goods was the fourth ship that left Chabahar for destinations such as India, China and Thailand during July. India, Afghanistan and Iran signed an agreement in 2016 to jointly develop Chabahar as a trade and transit hub, including for markets in the landlocked Central Asian states to the north. India has used Chabahar since 2017 to transport essential goods and humanitarian supplies, including wheat, to Afghanistan. About 60,000 tonnes of wheat has been shipped from India to Afghanistan through Chabahar since March. The port has also been used by Afghanistan since last year to export goods to India. Hossein Shahdadi, deputy director general of Sistan-Baluchestan province’s ports and maritime department, told IRNA news agency the main goal of the Chabahar development plan is to boost the volume of transit and exports from Iran. A total of 627,000 tonnes of goods were unloaded at the port since March 20, and Shahdadi described the growth in the port’s handling of goods over the past two years as “remarkable”. Chabahar is also the “safest and the most economically efficient route” for export and import of commodities from India, Afghanistan and the Central Asian countries, he said. Iranian officials are also eyeing the possibility of making Chabahar, which was granted a special waiver from US sanctions, the country’s third trade hub after Bandar Abbas and Imam Khomeini ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-shipment-of-cargo-leaves-chabahar-port-for-thailand/story-11AYiJMrD6okQnIALWqMAL.html
03-08-2020||India||Low pressure area to bring heavy rain next week: IMD||India’s monsoon rains, exactly at 100% of the so-called long period average of LPA on Saturday, the halfway mark of the four month season, but with a 9.5% deficit in July, the most critical month of the four, will likely increase this week in the core monsoon zone, The India Meteorological Department said on Sunday. The northwest part of the country, though, including Delhi, are unlikely to benefit from this. The remnant of a low-pressure system from the east is likely to emerge and under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal around August 4, IMD said. This is likely to be the first significant low-pressure area formation this monsoon which can bring monsoon rains in central and peninsular India according to IMD’s Sunday bulletin. Also read | Heavy rainfall expected tomorrow in several districts of Kerala: IMD“Since June 21 no low-pressure area had formed over Bay of Bengal. Low pressure areas are the main rain bearing systems during monsoon which bring rain to the core monsoon zone. A cyclonic storm is forming over the west Pacific, remnants of which are likely to enter Bay of Bengal and form a low-pressure area,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune.The absence of a low-pressure area has hit parts of the country hard. Since June 1, northwest India has a rain deficiency of 18% and central India has a deficiency of 5%. This falls well in the plus or minus 20% of normal range. It has also been a dry July, the month which typically sees around a third of monsoon rainfall, and which, along with June, is the most critical month for agriculture in India.  In July central India or the core monsoon zone recorded a deficiency of 22.3%. In northwest India, Delhi has a 27% deficiency; Rajasthan has a 24% deficiency; Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh have recorded 62%, 49% and 28% deficiency respectively.These areas are unlikely to see much rain this week, but the southern part of the country and central India will. “Under the above favourable scenario, monsoon will enter to active phase over the central and peninsular India from August 4 onwards for subsequent 3-4 days. Widespread and very heavy rain is also likely over Konkan and Goa during August 3 to 5. Mumbai and Madhya Maharashtra including the ghat areas are also likely to be affected by very heavy rains. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely over many places in Coastal Karnataka and Kerala,” IMD said. Also read | IMD plans to use artificial intelligence in weather forecastingThe July deficiency is a rare occurrence. “In the absence of any low-pressure area forming over Bay of Bengal, for the first time in five years July recorded a 9.5% deficiency. But now a low-pressure area is forming over north Bay of Bengal which can travel inland over central India and bring a lot of rain to Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh. Due to strengthening of south westerly winds, the west coast is also likely to get very heavy rain. We are monitoring Mumbai for very heavy rains between August 3 and 5,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre. Jenamani’s research work shows the number of depressions forming over Bay of Bengal during monsoon months particularly July are on a decline.For the season, as of Saturday, monsoon rains showed a 12% excess over east and northeast India; 18% deficiency over northwest India; 5% deficiency over central India; and 13% excess over peninsular India.Presently, cool El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Sea surface temperatures over the region are likely to cool further. There is enhanced probability for development of weak La Niña conditions during August-September-October season, IMD has forecast.“Both cool ENSO neutral conditions and weak La Nina conditions in September are favourable for rains which is why we are expecting a normal monsoon this year—around 102% of the long period average,” added Pai. La Niña is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific and is associated with normal or above normal rains over India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-pressure-area-to-bring-heavy-rain-next-week-imd/story-hjouarRFWwzoLkkH3yX11H.html
03-08-2020||India||NIA arrests suspected PFI member in Kerala gold smuggling case||Unearthing a Popular Front of India (PFI) link to the Kerala gold smuggling scandal, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a member of the controversial organization for assisting the suspected kingpin of the racket, the agency said on Sunday. Apart from the PFI member identified as Muhammad Ali, five more suspects have also been arrested from Kerala for conspiring with the gold smugglers; raids have been conducted at six places in Kerala in the past three days, the NIA said. Ernakulam resident Ali, arrested on Saturday, is a PFI member and took part in the smuggling racket besides aiding and assisting a person named Jalal A M in collecting the smuggled gold from suspected kingpin Ramees K T in Thiruvananthapuram and distributing the contraband among other conspirators, deputy inspector general (DIG) Sonia Narang, who is also the NIA spokesperson, said. When contacted, PFI’s Kerala state president C P Mohammad Bashir denied that Ali is a PFI member. “He is not associated with us. PFI’s name is being dragged {into the case},” Bashir said. Ali had been arrested by Kerala police in connection with an attack on July 4, 2010 on professor T K Joseph of Newman College, Thodupuzha; he was acquitted n May 2015 for want of evidence. The NIA has been investigating the case since 2011 and after his arrest now in the gold smuggling case, officials who didn’t wish to be named said they will again probe Ali’s role in the attack. Joseph was attacked for preparing a question paper that carried allegedly blasphemous content against the Prophet. His palm was chopped off during the attack, but was surgically restored. Thirteen people were convicted and 17 let off by the NIA court in Ernakulam in 2015 in connection with the attack.NIA is investigating a larger terror conspiracy in the smuggling of gold in various districts of Kerala. It is suspected that a wider network of terror financing and hawala operations is linked to the smuggling racket. Apart from Ali, those arrested in last three days include Jalal A M and Said Alvi E, residents of Ernakulam and Malappuram respectively. They were arrested on charges of conspiring with Ramees KT, who had been arrested earlier, and for smuggling gold through diplomatic baggage addressed to the United Arab Emirates consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Two more men, namely Mohammed Shafi and Abdu PT, both residents of Malappuram district, were arrested for allegedly playing similar roles. On Saturday, NIA arrested Muhammad Ali Ebrahim along with Muhammad Ali, both residents of Muvattupuzha, Ernakulam. The four arrested earlier included Swapna Suresh, a former information technology consultant with the Kerala government, and P.Sarith Kumar, who had gone to the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on July 3 to pick up a consignment addressed to the UAE consulate. At least 30 kilograms of 24-carat gold — the best quality — estimated to be worth at least Rs 15 crore, were found hidden inside pipes contained in a carton.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s powerful secretary M Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Service officer, has been suspended over his alleged links with Suresh. Opposition parties have sought the resignation of the CM, saying he was aware of his secretary’s role in the smuggling racket. In Delhi, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan observed a one-day fast in his residence on Sunday. “It is sad the CM’s office has turned a hub for anti-national activities. He can’t get away by sacrificing some officials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-suspected-pfi-member-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case/story-FZaKk3tARy7eDZlQyHIsXN.html
03-08-2020||India||Mahatma Gandhi’s image may appear on British coins||London: Chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak’s office confirmed on Sunday that Mahatma Gandhi’s image on a coin is being considered as part of efforts to celebrate achievements of non-white individuals such as Indian-origin British spy Noor Inayat Khan and Jamaican British nurse Mary Seacole.Sunak has written to the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (RMAC) that recommends themes and designs of coins, supporting a campaign called “We Too Built Britain,” which seeks representation of non-white icons on British currency.The proposal to put Gandhi’s image on a British coin was made by former chancellor Sajid Javid in October 2019. If the proposal now becomes reality, it would make the Indian independence hero the first non-White person to feature on a British coin.In a letter to Zehra Zahidi, who has led the campaign, Sunak said: “Black, Asian and other ethnic minority communities have made a profound contribution to the shared history of the United Kingdom”.“For generations, ethnic minority groups have fought and died for this country we have built together; taught our children, nursed the sick, cared for the elderly; and through their enterprising spirit have started some of our most exciting and dynamic businesses, creating jobs and driving growth”.“I am writing today to the Chair of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (RMAC), Lord Waldegrave…asking the RMAC Sub-Committee on Themes to consider recognising this very great contribution on our nation’s coinage,” he wrote.The chancellor’s office confirmed that the RMAC is currently considering a coin to commemorate Gandhi, adding that Sunak is keen that British coins commemorate the work of the previous generations who have served the UK and nations that form the Commonwealth.Campaigners previously sought Noor Inayat Khan’s image on a new £50 note, but the Bank of England announced that the new series to enter circulation in 2021 will have the image of computer pioneer and code-breaker Alan Turing.-||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahatma-gandhi-s-image-may-appear-on-british-coins/story-XQ5U9QRB3hvmXmwbnpti9J.html
03-08-2020||India||Congress slams NEP for lacking ‘strategy’||The Congress on Sunday questioned the new National Education Policy (NEP), saying it was high on “catchwords” and “verbosity” but lacked a coherent road-map and strategy for implementation. The party also said the new policy had circumvented parliamentary oversight, noting that it had been unveiled in the midst of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Congress leaders MM Pallam Raju, Rajeev Gowda and Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters through video conferencing that the NEP sought to create a digital divide between the poor and the rich as it promotes privatisation of public education. This will put education out of the reach of the middle class and the disadvantaged, they said. Also read: NEP can make India a knowledge superpower | OpinionThe Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the new NEP, replacing the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986. The policy aims to reduce regulatory hurdles, promote autonomy in the higher education sector and the use of local languages as the medium of instruction in schools. NEP misses the fundamental goal of human development and expansion of knowledge, and there has been no discussion with the academia; only the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been consulted, according to the Congress . The Congress leaders also questioned the government’s intent in raising spending on education to 6% of gross domestic product (GDP), saying the figure had fallen from 4.14% in 2014 to 3.2% currently and is likely to fall further because of cuts in outlays on account of a resource crunch caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The new education policy, which is aimed to pave the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education, is high on catchwords, gloss, appearance and verbosity yet lacks a coherent implementational roadmap and strategy, clearly defined milestones and the critical finances necessary to execute this grand vision,” they said in a joint statement. Raju, a former human resource development minister, said over-centralisation of the education sector would pose severe challenges. “While the intent seems to be there, there are serious shortcomings in the policy,” he said. Gowda, a former Indian Institute of Management (IIM) faculty member, asked where the money to fund the ambitious plans would come from. “Or is it going to come out of people’s pockets,” he asked. Surjewala said the new policy will remain on paper in the absence of the required finances and asked how the government proposed to fill 1.2 million vacancies of school teachers. Citing official records, he said only 10% of government schools in the country have access to computers and only 4% have network connectivity. “More than 70% children of marginalised sections may be completely excluded as seen during access to online classes in the Covid-19 period. This will also make the rural versus urban divide even stronger on account of absent or diminished internet connectivity and access to computers in rural areas,” he said. Surjewala also claimed that there was no mention of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes, comprising over 50% of the country’s population, in the entire policy document. NEP’s objective of “critical thinking, creative independence and spirit of enquiry remains empty rhetoric as the BJP regime has systematically attacked universities, obliterated institutional autonomy and stifled freedom of expression” among teachers and students alike, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-slams-nep-for-lacking-strategy/story-NVcjf7J1YZ07HFNhoxA7mO.html
03-08-2020||India||Rajya Sabha fails to get hold of RK Puram plot from encroachers||Rajya Sabha authorities have been unable to take full possession of a plot of land in the heart of New Delhi for the last 17 years due to encroachments, underlining how painstakingly difficult it can be even for public offices to get hold of government land. The 8,700 square metre plot in RK Puram is worth more than ₹200 crore, and was allotted to the Rajya Sabha in 2003 to construct a guest hostel for the Upper House’s MPs and accommodation for its officers. According to officials, the land had been under encroachment by some NGOs and slum residents, and the issue remains unresolved despite repeated efforts and offers of compensation. Some officials pointed out that between 2005 and 2012, Rajya Sabha authorities didn’t take any steps to clear the coveted land of the unauthorised occupants, resulting in mounting troubles for the current regime. On July 30, House chairman Venkaiah Naidu held a high-level meeting to review the status of the issue with House officials, Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, Delhi government and legal counsels. “Naidu asked officials to take appropriate and quick action to get the land cleared of encroachments,” an official said. Out of the total plot, around 4,384sqm remains occupied by different organisations, including NGOs, and after years of neglect, unauthorised slum clusters have occupied another 1194 sq m. House officials said the plot is earmarked to be used for officers’ accommodation and also to set up the Rajya Sabha TV office, which is now housed at a plush but expensive property in Talkatora Stadium at an annual rent of ₹15 crore — a hefty amount for a channel with hardly any revenue source. “Naidu also noted that there have been inordinate delays and urged that necessary steps be taken to resolve all outstanding issues including pending cases in the high court, where the issue has been pending for a long time,” said an official. Another official involved in the issue said, “Several meetings have been taken at various levels and the government agencies are trying their best, but nothing seems to be moving. There are three NGOs that have not moved out so far, apart from a large slum cluster and a place of worship, which has been built without sanction.” The plot has become more important as the Parliament is set to merge the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV channels into one, which will necessitate more space at a lower cost of operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-fails-to-get-hold-of-rk-puram-plot-from-encroachers/story-y7IrVtmMoHK9b7qamiRIfK.html

The plan to accelerate the construction of infrastructure is targeted at Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe national transporter plans to utilise the entire capital expenditure budget it has been allocated this year, according to Yadav, who said infrastructure building had already started picking up. Indian Railways has a capex budget of Rs 1.61 lakh crore for financial year 2020-21.The railroad network has employed migrant workers in states where the maximum number of such workers have returned, and already generated more than 380,000 person-days of employment in the past four weeks, he said.“That is helping us to expedite our infra projects. Our infrastructure work has really started picking up and we have almost reached previous year’s level,” Yadav said.According to railway ministry data, Uttar Pradesh has generated the maximum employment of 140,000 person-days followed by Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.The national carrier has raised its earlier target of generating 800,000 person-days of employment for migrant workers in infrastructure projects worth Rs 1,800 crore over 125 days, until October 31, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan.The Centre has identified 116 districts with a large concentration of returnee migrant workers in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for the ambitious employment-cum-rural public works programme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20. The PM said Rs 50,000 crore would be spent on building durable rural infrastructure under the initiative.“There are several projects identified across these states where the labourers have been deployed. We require unskilled labourers too for a lot of construction work. We want to expedite projects in these states. There is a nodal officer in each state supervising this and we monitor and prepare a weekly report,” a ministry official said, requesting anonymity. The ministry of railways is also considering generating employment under the government’s flagship rural job guarantee scheme for minor construction works. Indian Railways is also in talks with states to get back labourers for construction work on its biggest infrastructure projects—the dedicated freight corridors, HT reported on July 5. The project implementation agency, the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL), which had been left with about 50% of its workforce after the lockdown for Covid-19 was enforced on March 25, has begun the process of getting back nearly 20,000 labourers. DFCCIL has sought help from state governments including those of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand to arrange workers for the Rs 81,000 crore project, scheduled to be completed by 2021. DFCCIIL has begun booking special trains in bulk and deploying buses to get the workers back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-to-create-over-1-1mn-man-days-work-for-migrants-in-6-states/story-Psp4ju7wGI52CNKIatkRBI.html
03-08-2020||India||BCG vaccine can control spread: Study||Countries where people have been mandatorily immunised with the Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccine to prevent childhood tuberculosis reported fewer Covid-19 infections as well as deaths in the first month of their outbreak, according to a new, peer-reviewed study that offers fresh insight into why some countries such as India may be doing better than some major countries in tackling the coronavirus. The role of the BCG vaccine has been linked to milder Covid-19 infections previously, but the study reviewing infection and fatality numbers from over 130 countries shows for the first time that regions with no BCG immunisation policy since 2000 recorded an exponential increase in deaths due to Covid-19.The analysis “revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against Covid-19,” said the researchers from University of Michigan in the study published on July 31 in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) journal.By applying a statistical model based on their findings, the researchers further estimated that only 468 people would likely have died from Covid-19 in the US as of March 29, 2020 – which is 19% of the actual figure of 2,467 deaths by that date – if the US had mandatory BCG vaccinations several decades ago.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe BCG vaccine has been given to children since 1949 and in 2019, at least 97% of the 26 million babies born that year received it. The vaccine protects against disseminated TB and meningitis in childhood, but doesn’t offer protection from adult pulmonary TB, which has led to several countries discontinuing its use.The researchers note that the benefits were seen in countries that had the policy in place till about the year 2000. “Notably, the growth curves were as steep in countries that mandated BCG policies only during the 20th century as in those that never mandated the vaccine... That is to say, the spread of the virus may be slowed only when there is “herd immunity” that prevents the virus from spreading easily across the population,” they added.The study took three specific approaches to rule out external bias, the researchers added. “First, we focused on the rate of growth of both cases and deaths, which should be uninfluenced by reporting biases as long as these biases are stable during the period of study. To meet this requirement, we focused on a short period (either the first 30 days or 15 days). Second, we used the best available estimate of country-wise reporting biases and used this as a weight in our analysis. Third, we controlled for testing availability,” they said.But, the findings also showed there was substantial variation in Covid-19 growth rates even among BCG-mandated countries, suggesting that additional societal variables are likely have an effect on mandatory BCG vaccination’s effect on the spread of the coronavirus. Thus, “BCG is by no means a magic bullet that assures safety against Covid-19,” the authors added. On July 18, the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (ICMR-NIRT) announced it has initiated a multi-centric study to see if the BCG vaccine can reduce the severity of Covid-19 among people aged 60 and above residing in hot spots for the coronavirus outbreak. According to the statement, the study will involve around 1,000 healthy volunteers above 60 years of age in six states that have reported a high Covid-19 disease burden so far. “A lot is being talked about the protective effect of BCG vaccine in terms of Covid-19. This study was in the pipeline for some time and now we have begun the process. It is being done to generate India-specific evidence,” said an ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bcg-vaccine-can-control-spread-study/story-w73NroXd1r7vtt44duX6LO.html

03-08-2020||India||Tracing the role of Yogi Adityanath and Gorakhnath Math in Ram temple movement||When chief minister Yogi Adityanath visits Ayodhya to participate in the ‘bhumi pujan’ on August 5, the event will also mark the culmination of a long struggle launched by mahants (head priests) of the Gorakhnath Math (monastery) in Gorakhpur for construction of the Ram temple. Located 137 kilometres east of Ayodhya, the Gorakhnath Math has been at the centre of the Ram temple movement since British rule. It played a pivotal role in the Ayodhya movement under three mahants —-Digvijay Nath, Avaidyanath and Yogi Adityanath. Digvijay Nath, who became mahant in 1935 not only made the math a centre of right-wing political activities, but also became a leading light of the temple movement. After joining the Hindu Mahasabha in 1937, he started mobilising the Hindu community for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He led a team of volunteers to Ayodhya in 1949, held a meeting with then Raja of Balrampur, Pateshwari Prasad Singh and Swami Karpatri Maharaj, a prominent seer. Also Read: Yogi Adityanath’s Ayodhya visit cancelled after minister Kamal Rani Varun’s deathThe Akhil Bhartiya Ram Rajya Parishad Party was floated at the time. On the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949, when Ram idol was placed in the then disputed structure, Digvijay Nath was present in Ayodhya. He motivated volunteers to start prayers. Although the state government directed then district magistrate to remove the idol, he refused to execute the order, stating that the move may lead to communal violence in the area. Pradeep Rao, a teacher at Gorakhpur’s MP Post Graduate College who has done research on the Nath tradition of monasticism and the Goraknath Math, said, “The placing of the idol inside the mosque worked as a catalyst in the Ram temple movement, mobilising devotees and sadhus to take the fight for the temple to the streets, courts and Parliament. Till his death in 1969, Digvijay Nath gave the momentum to the Ram temple movement,” he said. Also Read: Venkaiah Naidu associates Ayodhya Ram Temple with Indian culture, secular valuesThe next mahant, Avaidyanath, continued the movement for the Ram temple. In 1984, he constituted the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mukti Yagya Samiti to bring all the Hindu organisations and sadhus associated with the Ram temple movement on a single platform. He organised a march from Sitamarhi in Bihar to Ayodhya for liberation of the Ram temple in September 1984. He called upon the people to vote for that party or leader who supported the construction of the Ram temple, Rao said. At the dharam sansad (religious conference) organised at Udupi, Karnataka, on October 31, 1985, Avaidyanath and Ramchandra Das Paramhans, a mahant of the Digambar Akhara, demanded opening of the lock of the mosque so that devotees could offer prayers to the idol. A committee known as the Akhil Bhartiya Sangharsh Samiti was constituted to give a push to the movement. On February 1, 1986, when the then district judge of Faizabad gave the order for opening of the lock, Avaidyanath was present in Ayodhya. In a rally organised in Delhi on September 22, 1989, Avaidyanath announced ‘shilanyas’ at Ram Janmabhoomi on November 9, 1989. Later, in a meeting organised in Haridwar, he announced that sadhus will visit Ayodhya to start construction of the Ram temple. The then union home minister Buta Singh and the then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari urged him to postpone the programme. A few years later, a delegation led by him met the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in the early 1990s. An announcement was made at the dharam sansad held in Delhi on October 30, 1992 that kar sewa for the Ram temple in Ayodhya would be launched from December 2, 1992. Inspired by the temple movement, Yogi Adityanath, a fresh graduate, then known as Ajay Singh Bisht, visited Gorakhpur in 1992 to meet Avaidyanth. He renounced family life to become a monk of the Nath Panth. He became a disciple of Avaidyanath and started participating in meetings of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mukti Yagya Samiti headed by his guru. The leaders of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Hindu Mahasabha, as well as sadhus of Ayodhya, participated in these meetings. The task to organise the meetings was entrusted to the young Adityanath who proved his mettle by inviting the sadhus, heads of various Hindu religious orders and scholars from across the country. Impressed with Adityanath’s capabilities and diligence, Mahant Avaidyanth appointed him his successor in 1996. Soon, he established himself as a leader. Contentious issues like construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, uniform civil code, ban on cow slaughter and anti- conversion campaign topped the agenda of these meetings organised in east UP. In 1998, Mahant Avaidyanth decided to bid adieu to active politics. He announced that Adityanath will contest the Lok Sabha election from prestigious Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat that Avaidyanath had won four times. In 1997-98, when the Ram temple movement started losing its sheen in other parts of UP, Adityanath kept the issue alive in east UP by organising Vishwa Hindu Mahasammelan and Virat Hindu Sangam in Gorakhpur and the adjoining districts. The representatives of 970 Hindu organisations and 10,000 sadhus were invited to the meetings. VHP leader Ashok Singhal also extended support to Adityanath. In 1998, Adityanath was elected to the Lok Sabha from Gorakhpur. He raised the Ram temple as well as Hindutva issues in the House. In 2002, when Adityanath’s relationship with the BJP leadership soured, he not only activated the Hindu Mahasabha in east UP but also launched the Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) to mobilise youths for the Ram temple movement. Soon, these organisations spread their wings in central and east UP. After being appointed chief minister on March 19, 2017, Yogi Adityanath has visited Ayodhya several times. The state government declared Ayodhya a municipal corporation, launched projects to promote tourism and amenities for pilgrims, organised Deepotsav on the Diwali eve in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The state government also announced that a 200 feet high statue of Lord Ram would be installed on the banks of the Saryu river in Ayodhya. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic Adityanath visited Ayodhya on March 25, when the idol of Ram Lalla (the child Ram) was shifted to a new pre-fabricated structure. He went there again on July 25 to review preparations for the bhumi pujan and inspect other projects under way in various parts of Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tracing-the-role-of-yogi-adityanath-and-gorakhnath-math-in-ram-temple-movement/story-0zaFhkWuRY62qic8FSuWsI.html
03-08-2020||India||First shipment of cargo leaves from Chabahar port for Thailand||A ship carrying Iranian goods bound for Thailand left Chabahar port last week, marking the first time the strategic port has been used to ship a consignment to a Southeast Asian country. MV Libra sailed from Shahid Behesthi terminal of Chabahar port, which is operated by an Indian state-run company, with 123 containers on July 29. This included the first ever shipment from Chabahar to Bangkok, people familiar with developments said. The merchant vessel sailed to Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai and Mumdra port, from where the consignment will be transhipped to Thailand, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. They said the shipment is significant in view of efforts by India and Iran to enhance the economic viability of Chabahar port. The director general of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan Ports and Maritime Organisation, Behrouz Aghaei, was quoted by the Iranian media as saying that this was the first time aquatic products were shipped from Chabahar to Thailand. Afghanistan recently sent a consignment of different products, including dried fruits, to India and China through Shahid Beheshti terminal as well, Aghaei said. The vessel carrying the Afghan goods was the fourth ship that left Chabahar for destinations such as India, China and Thailand during July. India, Afghanistan and Iran signed an agreement in 2016 to jointly develop Chabahar as a trade and transit hub, including for markets in the landlocked Central Asian states to the north. India has used Chabahar since 2017 to transport essential goods and humanitarian supplies, including wheat, to Afghanistan. About 60,000 tonnes of wheat has been shipped from India to Afghanistan through Chabahar since March. The port has also been used by Afghanistan since last year to export goods to India. Hossein Shahdadi, deputy director general of Sistan-Baluchestan province’s ports and maritime department, told IRNA news agency the main goal of the Chabahar development plan is to boost the volume of transit and exports from Iran. A total of 627,000 tonnes of goods were unloaded at the port since March 20, and Shahdadi described the growth in the port’s handling of goods over the past two years as “remarkable”. Chabahar is also the “safest and the most economically efficient route” for export and import of commodities from India, Afghanistan and the Central Asian countries, he said. Iranian officials are also eyeing the possibility of making Chabahar, which was granted a special waiver from US sanctions, the country’s third trade hub after Bandar Abbas and Imam Khomeini ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-shipment-of-cargo-from-chabahar-port-to-southeast-asia/story-yhH9HtJY02AAjkkRD9JgWL.html
03-08-2020||Editorials||Preserving the wildlife ecosystem | HT Editorial||Camera-traps used in the last tiger census (2018) captured the presence of more free-ranging domestic dogs than tigers in 17 tiger reserves, according to a report in The Indian Express. There is also a substantial presence of both dogs and livestock in at least 30 tiger reserves, the report added. The presence of feral and abandoned dogs and livestock in forests, say experts, could lead to the transmission of diseases to wild animals. These stray animals also compete with wild animals for resources, affecting their foraging patterns. The National Tiger Conservation Authority has said that livestock and dogs are found in fringe areas of forests close to villages.While the camera-trap capture has provided real-time evidence now, this problem has been growing for years. India has about five million stray cattle, thanks to rural distress and fodder shortage (both make livestock maintenance expensive), lack of the adequate number of shelters, increase in peri-urban dairies, and a ban on cattle slaughter in many states. The feral dog population is 60 million because of the breakdown of the animal birth control (ABC) programme, increasing cases of abandonment of dogs, and the lack of adequate waste management and requisite number of shelters. A 2018 research by ATREE found that free-ranging dogs attacked 80 species of wildlife between 2015 and 2016, mostly mammals.The problem of stray animals is not just in forests, but also in Indian cities. Instead of endless debates on whether it’s right to feed dogs or not, citizens must demand answers on the operational record of the Animal Welfare Board of India, why governments have reduced funding and support to the ABC programme and failed to untangle the problem of multiplicity of authorities and build shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/preserving-the-wildlife-ecosystem/story-ONvgefTFTfdSdtfTXB4mcM.html
03-08-2020||Editorials||Signalling belligerence | HT Editorial||Events over the last week have made it clear that the situation in eastern Ladakh remains grim. There is a clear disjunct between China’s, entirely erroneous, description of the disengagement process as almost complete and India’s, factual, understanding of the ground reality regarding the deployment of People’s Liberation Army troops. Military and diplomatic-level talks between the two sides have made little progress. The Chinese ambassador to India, late last week, reiterated the Chinese position and stuck to Beijing’s narrative of the Galwan incident, blaming India.All of this points to a clear signal from the Chinese. Talks or no talks, Beijing is telling New Delhi that it will not budge. The chutzpah here is staggering. China wants the Indian side to pull back from what is Indian territory; it wants patrolling powers curtailed; it wants to convert the new facts on the ground it has created by violating past pacts into the new reality; it wants India to give up on its own territorial claims in the region; and all this while, it also expects Delhi to be held responsible for the stand-off in the first place.There is little doubt that events over the past three months have shown China is India’s most dangerous strategic adversary. In the immediate context, Delhi has to focus on retaining and boosting its military strength at the Line of Actual Control. It should also come up with creative ways to exert military pressure on China, perhaps in other geographies where Beijing is more vulnerable, to force it to step back — while factoring in the risks of escalation carefully. It must continue to tell China that Beijing’s fond hope of retaining the economic benefits of the relationship while posing a security threat will not be entertained. It must cement international partnerships, and actively participate in the global narrative against China’s belligerence, for hedging is no longer a viable option. It must prepare for not just a long winter in Ladakh, but a difficult decade ahead where India’s territorial integrity and sovereignty will be challenged from two fronts. And it must focus on the domestic front to ensure political stability, social harmony, and most importantly, economic growth and national unity to be able to take on China. Beijing’s signals leave India with no choice but to respond accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/signalling-belligerence/story-CFiSwsCaH6sWS3KEjdkOhL.html
