04-08-2020||News||In Jammu and Kashmir, a year of loss and suffering||On August 5 and 6 last year, the Narendra Modi administration took two steps that fundamentally altered the lives of the people of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). First, it removed the special status that the state enjoyed in the Indian Union under Article 370 of the Constitution. Then, Parliament enacted the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, which demoted and divided the state into two Union territories. To ensure that there was no protest against these steps, the Modi administration arrested all the state’s political leaders the day before, except those belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), imposed Section 144, and snapped all communications in and with the state.The BJP claimed these measures would improve security, and give the people of J&K the same rights as prevailed in the rest of India. One year has passed. How do we assess those claims? Take security first. There has been a sharp rise in insecurity on the borders, but some improvement internally. We are still struggling to reverse the Chinese incursions into Ladakh, and cross-border firing by Pakistan has risen sharply. Internally, however, there has been a drop of around 30% in casualties comparing August 2019-July 2020 with the same period in the preceding year. But we also find a rising trend in casualties from April 2020, which is worrying. The reduction in casualties was achieved at considerable human cost. According to figures given by the J&K administration, this came at the cost of the detention of 6,600 people — including children — under the draconian Public Safety Act, the continuous imposition of Section 144 to date, the restriction of mobile telephony and Internet to 2G services, and a new media policy that allows security agencies to censor media outlets.Most of the detainees have been gradually released, but the majority of political leaders spent anywhere between eight-to-11 months in detention. Many of them were released only after agreeing that they would not criticise the August actions. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti is still under detention and there is controversy over whether Congress leader Saifuddin Soz is under house arrest or not. Since the August lockdown was only gradually being relaxed when the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed, J&K has suffered one year of closures. According to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, businesses across all sectors of the economy have lost close to ~40,000 crore in the Valley alone. Even discounting these figures, the economic cost to the former state as a whole must be even larger.Losses in education and health are similarly grave. Schools had just reopened after the August lockdown and winter vacations, when the pandemic struck. Online classes barely worked on 2G networks. In a recent report issued by the Forum for Human Rights in Jammu and Kashmir, of which I am a member, teachers, students and researchers spoke in the same voice about the damage done to human development, of which education is a critical pillar. University students often missed college admissions, teachers and researchers could not participate in conferences or send papers for publication.Health care professionals faced the same problems. Doctors could not seek specialist advice on serious illnesses or participate in exchanges of the latest information on Covid-19. In the first few months after August, pharmacies could not get deliveries of medicine and clinics were closed.Because of the ban on 4G networks and the continuous imposition of Section 144, most of these problems persist, along with a host of others. The media has been deeply affected, both editorially and financially. Anyone who reads the local papers can see the difference before and after August 2019. There is some reporting but no comment on either the August actions or their implementation over the past year. Though challenges to the removal of special status and reorganisation of the state are pending in the Supreme Court, the Modi administration has proceeded to implement both. New domicile rules have replaced the permanent resident certificates, raising fears of further job and industry losses as well as long-term fears of losses of land and other privileges. The latter impact Jammu more than the Valley; reportedly 2.9 lakh applications for domicile certificates have been made in Jammu as against 73,000 in the Valley. The past year has been one of a terrible loss for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Not only has development been rolled back and incomes fallen, political rights to representation, civic rights to information and communication, and human rights to freedom of expression, protection against arrest and attendant rights, to bail or a speedy trial, have all been denied. The only gain has been in counter-insurgency, and that too small in absolute numbers. We should, of course, be glad that even a couple of hundred lives have been saved — but we should equally ask whether banning 4G has really contributed to it, and how a drastic curtailment of rights can possibly be justified in the name of counter-insurgency.Worst still, we are yet to hear the voices of the people. One year has passed, but we do not know what they feel about losing their special status under Article 370 and its implementation, or what they feel about being divided and turned into two Union Territories. We don’t even know whether these government actions are constitutionally valid. Many ask, what can be done now to win Kashmiri hearts and minds. After what they have undergone, I am doubtful whether forgiveness will come so easy. But the first step would be to restore special status as well as statehood, hold elections and open a dialogue based on the promises made within the Instrument of Accession. The fact that the Modi administration is unlikely to take these steps does not make them any the less necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-jammu-and-kashmir-a-year-of-loss-and-suffering/story-4uf3FWMltzj7GkTpAWjdpK.html
04-08-2020||News||The eclipse of separatist politics, the dawn of peace||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi visited Srinagar in May 2018. It was Ramzan and the Union home ministry had announced a unilateral ceasefire in the state. The prime minister was there to inaugurate several development projects.“My appeal to these misguided youth is to return to the national mainstream, which is their own family, and participate in the development of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said in his address at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Conference Centre. “Every stone or weapon picked up by the youth of this state is only meant to destabilise their own state,” he cautioned. During an earlier visit in 2016, he had laid out his development agenda by invoking former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee — “Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave the mantra — Insaniyat, Jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat. He based Jammu&Kashmir’s development on this. We need to take it forward”.The twin themes of peace and development have guided the PM’s Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) policies. The abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A was a corollary of that. The so-called mainstream parties in J&K were used to a different kind of emotional politics pitched around separatist agendas. They knew well that Article 370 had been hollowed out by successive governments starting with Jawaharlal Nehru. Yet, they used the chimera of special status to mislead people, breed separatism and perpetuate their rule.One year after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, one thing stands out: The separatist and emotional narrative is no longer working. When some Kashmiri politicians rue the fact that they have been made irrelevant, it should be understood that they are unable to pursue the old agendas. Also gone were the days when Opposition leaders, from N T Rama Rao to Biju Patnaik to Jyoti Basu, would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Farooq Abdullah to form a national alliance against the Congress. Not a single political party, including the Left parties, which used to argue that Kashmiris was a separate nation, is ready to stand with them on the question of Article 370.The political leadership in the Union Territory (UT) must realise that Naya Kashmir needs a new politics and agenda. Those who want to persist with the old agendas of separatism and rhetoric of “resistance” would do well to quit mainstream politics and choose one of the Hurriyat factions. The people of the state are not in the least interested in this language of violence and intimidation. There is almost an 80% dip in the number of violent incidents in the Union territories after the abrogation of Article 370. There has been a 40% drop in the terror incidents. There was not a single civilian casualty at the hands of the security forces in the last one year, whereas terrorists killed 22 civilians in the last six months. The security forces have succeeded in neutralising over 180 terrorists in the last year. New recruitments are low. Interestingly, even the terrorists are scared to initiate incidents. The number of attacks has come down drastically to 21 compared to 51 last year. The people’s choice is clear — a new politics without violence and emotions — on the lines of Vajpayee’s three principles. Kashmiriyat was originally a concept denoting the state’s harmonious pluralism, Sufi, Buddhist and Shivaite tolerance, multiplicity of languages, customs, cuisines and cultures, coexisting peacefully. It was converted into a separatist political hyperbole in the 1960s. Real Kashmiriyat, together with insaniyat — humanism, and jamhooriyat — democratic politics, will form the core of the new politics. The march in that direction has already begun. New parties and leaders are emerging with an ambition to pursue a constructive agenda of development and peace. With the extension of Article 73 and 74 of the Constitution, local bodies from panchayats upwards have secured more powers. These empowered grassroots political institutions are going to throw up a new leadership. The end of Article 370 has also ended the injustice to many sections of society. Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, women, refugees, the LGBTQ community — all of them secured their civic and political rights including reservations. The dominance of a couple of families in politics will end and a Dogra, a Pahari, and a Gujjar can aspire to the highest positions now.Contrary to the propaganda about demographic change, the new domicile law actually safeguards the interests of the people of J&K. Under the new domicile policy, all the jobs in the state have been reserved for domiciles only. The job markets are opening up with the government announcing a recruitment for 10,000 vacancies. With over ~13,500 crore worth of memorandums of understanding already signed, private investment inflows have also started giving more boost to employment. Infrastructure projects such as roads, power projects, irrigation works and entertainment projects have picked up momentum; 50% of the Prime Minister’s Development Package of ~80,000 crore, lying unspent, is being utilised by the administration to expedite several projects for the public good. With the delimitation commission in place and elections to the UT legislature slated post the delimitation, UT will soon return into the political leadership’s hands. Naya Kashmir is embarking on a new journey of progress, prosperity and development. Leaders with a vision for development and those fired by the nationalist mission will lead the destiny of J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-eclipse-of-separatist-politics-the-dawn-of-peace/story-uzsXB5N9g1xQySDcReZ7tL.html

While 11 fishermen were rescued by another boat, God King, two people are still missing. Senior inspector Sanjeev Narkar of Gorai police station said the incident occurred around 2pm. “We have informed to Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and Indian Navy to help with the search operations to find the two missing people.” Following the request, the ICG sent a rescue boat. “We received information about the incident and a rescue boat has been dispatched for the rescue operation,” commandant RK Singh of the coast guard said. The boat was in the sea since August 1. “It seems like while returning to the shore, the boat capsized around 10 nautical miles away from the coast. The reason behind the incident is not clear. It could be because of the rough sea and high tide or due to a technical problem with the boat. It will be clear once we record the statements of the rescued fishermen,” said Narkar. The rescued fishermen will undergo a medical check-up. “A team has been informed to wait at Gorai coast to provide medical help to the two missing people after they are found. The rescued fishermen will be taken to a local hospital for a medical check-up,” said Narkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-missing-after-boat-with-13-fishermen-capsizes-near-gorai/story-AAq7xXwk5Udj7nTz4hZjSL.html

A native of Ganaur’s Tewri village, Pradeep said, “My father Sukhbir Singh, who served as sarpanch for two terms, inspired me to become an IAS officer. He always wanted to work for the welfare of the farming community,” he added. ‘MY FATHER HELPED ME WHENEVER I HIT A WALL’About his route to success, Pradeep said, “My focus was to cover targeted syllabus everyday. UPSC demands undeviating attention and sometimes, I felt that I was not consistent. But, my father always encouraged me.” “After completing my graduation, I cleared the SSC exam and got my first job as an income tax officer in Delhi five years ago. I sat for the UPSC civil services exam four times. Last year, I got 260th rank,” the UPSC topper added. Pradeep said it was quite difficult for him to juggle between studies and job. “Some of my friends also helped me in cracking this exam. I have achieved this feat by resorting to self-study,” he added. Pradeep studied till Class 7 in government school at Tewri before his family moved to Sonepat. He did his Class 12 from Shambhu Dayal Modern School, Sonepat, in 2008 and engineering from Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology in Sonepat’s Murthal in 2012. His elder brother Ajit is married and younger sister Manisha is a postgraduate in mathematics. Their mother is a homemaker. “Pradeep has made every Haryanavi proud today. I want to tell all farmers and labourers that their children have more potential to become an IAS officer,” his father Sukhbir said. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has congratulated Pradeep for securing top spot in the examination. “Pradeep has brought laurels to Haryana,” he said in a message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/want-to-work-for-welfare-of-agrarian-society-says-upsc-topper-pradeep-singh/story-apI7OY6Fvfo4uC55C0yn2J.html

AAP’s Delhi convener Gopal Rai said the process will begin Wednesday, adding people who have led from the front during the Covid crisis may also be given posts. Currently, the three municipal corporations in Delhi are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2017, the party won 64 out of 104 seats in the north Delhi municipal body, 70 out of 104 in the south Delhi municipal body and 47 out of 64 in the east Delhi municipal body. “The AAP is going to initiate a process of restructuring within its organisation in Delhi keeping a close watch on the forthcoming Delhi municipal corporation elections. Changes will be made at the assembly level, district level, ward level, polling station level, and at the booth level. The restructuring will commence from August 5. New responsibilities will be given to those who performed well in the 2020 assembly elections,” said Rai.He further said, “Under this process, the performance of everyone in the assembly elections held in February 2020, ranging from a volunteer to office bearers will be reviewed and those with praiseworthy performances will be given priority. At the same time, those who played a significant role during corona crises in the ration and food distribution, in creating awareness about proper sanitisation and ensuring social distancing are being considered for new responsibilities to build a strong volunteer organisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-eye-on-2022-municipal-polls-aap-to-restructure-party-unit-in-delhi/story-giNQuwrZ6ELbykKwVj5aYP.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records second highest 24-hour August rain in 10 years||The city and suburbs witnessed the most intense showers of the season between Monday night and Tuesday morning, making it the second highest 24-hour August rain in 10 years at 268.6mm, and also taking Mumbai’s rain tally past the 2,000-mm mark, with almost two months of the monsoon still remaining. While the red alert (extremely heavy rain across isolated areas) prediction for Wednesday stays, a yellow alert (heavy rain at isolated places) has been issued for Thursday for Mumbai, even as the red alert continues for Thane and Palghar. Between 8.30pm on Monday and 8.30am on Tuesday, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 268.6mm rain, of which 251mm was over a 12-hour period between 8.30pm on Monday and 8.30am on Tuesday. On Tuesday, between 8.30am and 8.30pm, the suburbs recorded 29.3mm rain, while 19mm was recorded in south Mumbai. Borivli recorded the highest rain at 30.2mm, followed by BKC at 28.4mm. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 252.2mm rain over 24 hours, with 214 mm over 12 hours. Mumbai recorded the highest rain across the state between Monday and Tuesday. Mumbai has received 310mm rain this month, 53% of its August average. The seasonal rain tally on Tuesday evening (from June 1 to 8.30pm on August 4) for the suburbs reached 2,198.9mm, which was 97% of the seasonal target of 2260.4mm. Similarly south Mumbai recorded 2,038mm for the season so far against the target of 2,066mm, covering 98% of the required rainfall. The highest 24-hour August rain for the decade was recorded on July 30, 2017 at 331.4mm, while the all-time high was on July 23, 1997 at 346.2mm. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday announced the formation of a low-pressure system over north Bay of Bengal (BoB). “As per the accurate forecast, the Konkan coast including Mumbai witnessed intense showers stemming from the low pressure system in BoB. This trend is likely to continue, and necessary warnings were issued to respective government departments well in advance,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD. According to the IMD, the wind speed ranged between 55-60 kmph between 4am and 6am in parts of south Mumbai and 41-45kmph in the suburbs. When cyclone Nisarga had brushed past the city, the wind speed was 92kmph in south Mumbai and 74kmph in the suburbs. “Active monsoon conditions over the Arabian Sea led to high convection and localised circulation that enhanced rain activity, thunderstorms and overnight gusty winds. After a minor break through the day on Tuesday, extremely heavy rain is likely to pick up on Wednesday again,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. Independent meteorologists said an offshore trough and a vortex system (localised circulation) were activated on Monday night paving the way for extremely heavy rain. “North Konkan including Mumbai, Palghar, Thane, and Raigad should continue to remain on high alert for the next 48 hours,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Like other thunderstorms, the vortex weakened on Tuesday morning leading to a sharp reduction in rainfall, said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-second-highest-24-hour-august-rain-in-10-years/story-8yimpwnqCvkzDEdLDZArkN.html

On August 1, 37 fishing trawlers had left from the coasts of Vasai, Arnala, and Naigaon; 238 from Satpati, Murbhe, Nawapur, and Dandi, and 60 from Uttan coast. They have not returned yet.“We have informed the respective fish workers’ societies to maintain contact with the fishermen stranded at sea and told them to return to base. We may also contact the coast guard, Dahanu to join in the search and rescue operations if needed,” said Ajinkya Patil, assistant commissioner, fisheries, Palghar.Fishing resumed on Narali Purnima on August 3, after the monsoon-season ban was lifted by the fisheries department. Heavy rain showers are expected to continue along the Maharashtra-Goa belt till August 7, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast.Trawler avoids mid-sea collision with cargo shipOn Tuesday morning, fishing trawler – Morya – piloted by Suraj Chowdhary of Satpati, Palghar, with 14 khalasis (fish labourers) on board, was returning to base amid heavy rainfall and winds, when it has a near collision with an unidentified cargo vessel. The ship was around 100 feet away from the trawler when the captain blew the horn, and Chowdhary veered the trawler to avoid a collision. Chowdhary informed a member of a fish worker welfare co-operative society at Satpati about the near-collision via the boat’s wireless system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/341-palghar-fishing-boats-stranded-at-mid-sea-fisheries-department-mulls-calling-in-coast-guard-for-help/story-2ZvSJoMiUDwYFYVPVPxeMP.html
04-08-2020||City||Govt to crack down on tax defaulters in Delhi||New Delhi: Nearly 10,800 companies in Delhi have paid lesser or zero tax between January and March this year because of which the revenue dropped by over Rs 2,000 crore compared to the same period last year, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday.To take stock of the situation, Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, held a meeting with the state trade and taxes department on Tuesday. During the meeting, Sisodia directed officials to intensify the crackdown on companies evading taxes and evaluate as many as 700,000 companies registered under the goods and services taxes (GST).Data showed that the department, so far, has analysed around 15,000 companies having a high turnover, of which 970 companies did not pay tax to the government despite charging from the consumers. Of the 10,800 defaulting companies, 9.73% firms were those dealing in real estate, leasing and rentals. Around 8.83% companies belonged to the services sector and 5.46% are consulting firms.The Delhi government received around Rs 2,015 crore lesser tax than last year during this period. In 2019, it collected around Rs 5,792 crore as tax returns, but this year the tax collection was only Rs 3,777 crore.“The Delhi government has started issuing 3A notices to the defaulting 10,800 taxpayers and in case they fail to file their return within the prescribed time of 15 days, the department will proceed to make best judgment assessment of such taxpayers. The Delhi government has also issued notices against 111 liquor companies that did not pay VAT (value-added tax) from January to March,” Sisodia said. The deputy chief minister appealed to the companies to immediately deposit the pending tax. “This is public money which the companies have collected from the people, but did not deposit it with the government. This will affect development works for the citizens, including the fight against the Covid pandemic. The Delhi government will take stringent action against the companies who will not deposit the full tax,” he said.A senior official in the trade and taxes department said the government is also identifying general taxpayers who are evading tax. “The department has been able to recover Rs. 10 crore from two such defaulting companies in the last one week,” the official said.Last week, three major search operations were conducted against the defaulters, including marble and granite companies and bulk taxpayers, the government said in a statement. “Rs 20.70 lakh was collected from them. In one case, the company’s office was sealed. In the second case, the company’s papers were confiscated. The Delhi government has also taken action against movement of goods without carrying e-way bills. With effect from June 23, around 140 vehicles have been detained and tax and penalty to the tune of around Rs. 1 crore were collected,” it said.“Of the 15,000 high turnover taxpayers that were analysed, almost 970 taxpayers belonging to both Centre and state jurisdiction have not filed returns for Q4 2019-20 and Q1 2020-21. The extended time period granted for the filing of GST return for Q1 2020-21 had expired in July 2020,” the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-to-crack-down-on-tax-defaulters-in-delhi/story-qLLaK9UOgmQ79E78AmDuMK.html

The protesters led by AAP’s state unit president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann and several MLAs squatted on the road in nearby Mullanpur when they were stopped from proceedings towards the chief minister’s farmhouse at Siswan in Mohali to ‘gherao’ him. There were heated arguments between the AAP leaders, including Mann and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, and the police personnel when they were stopped from going to the CM’s house. The protesters sat on the road, raising slogans against the Punjab government for not being allowed to exercise their democratic right. Several party members were detained and taken to a police station in Mohali where they were later released. The party, in a press statement later, also said that some leaders, including Garshankar MLA Jai Kishan Singh Rori, were also injured in the jostling. Demanding a CBI probe, Mann said the AAP leaders wanted to inform Amarinder minister the alleged “unholy alliance” of the Congress leaders and MLAs with various mafias who were enjoying patronage of the ruling party. He said the chief minister was also the minister in-charge of home and excise but had not visible on the ground for the past three years. “The idea was to stir him out of deep slumber but there was heavy deployment of police force which did not allow us to meet and inform him about all that is going on in the state,” he said. Earlier, the AAP leaders and members had planned to gather at the party office in Chandigarh and move towards the chief minister’s residence in Mullanpur, but were not allowed to assembly there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aap-stages-protest-over-hooch-tragedy/story-uF1dikHr7ELWoVkHH3iidI.html

04-08-2020||City||HOOCH TRAGEDY: Cong, Akali leaders from supply hub of killer spirit under lens||The role of a Congress leader as well as a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) activist from Pandoori Gola village in the Khadoor Sahib constituency has come under scanner in death of 111 persons due to consumption of illicit liquor in Tarn Taran and adjoining districts of Amritsar and Gurdaspur. Located just 4 kilometres from the district headquarters, Pandoori Gola, the police believe, was the hub from where the killer spirit was distributed to various villages and towns of the three Majha districts.Kashmir Singh, a village resident who fought the zila parishad elections in 2018 on the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) ticket, has been named as an accused while the role of sitting sarpanch Kulwinder Singh Babbu, who owes allegiance to the ruling Congress, is also under scanner. Kashmir along with six others was arrested on Saturday by the Tarn Taran police after the initial reports of deaths emerged. He was booked under Sections 304 (culpable homicide), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 61-1-14 of the Excise Act.Kashmir’s brother Harjit Singh and the latter’s sons Satnam and Shamsher are seen as some of the key players in the case. Police say Harjit Singh and his two sons were in contact with Moga’s Avtar Singh, who allegedly sold three drums of the spirit which is believed to be the cause of the deaths, to them for Rs 84,000. The drums were found hidden in the bushes near the village.Harjit and his sons sold part of the spirit to Gobinder Singh of Jandiala, who further supplied it to Muchhal village in Amritsar and Gurdaspur’s Batala town, say the police. The residents of the village said Kashmir and Harjit are into the illicit liquor trade for the last two decades despite the police being aware about it.Kashmir lost the election as a member of zila parishad against Congress’ Jaswant Singh. SSP: ‘NO TECHNICAL EVIDENCE AGAINST VILLAGE HEAD SO FAR’Village sarpanch Kulwinder Singh has also been booked in the case. Kulwinder’s wife said, “My husband has been booked by the police under political pressure. He is innocent.” Some residents of the village said he had been sheltering those into selling illicit liquor in the village. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said, “Kulwinder’s role is being probed. Till now, no technical evidence has been found against him.”Tarn Taran zila parishad former chairman and SAD leader Baldev Singh, who is a resident of the same village, said, “Kashmir Singh was fielded as a party candidate when Ravinder Singh Brahmpura was the in-charge of the constituency. When Ravinder Singh’s father and former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpra parted his way with the party, Kashmir also joined the rebels.”Ravinder Brahmpura, said, “Kashmir joined our group in 2019, but he went back to the Akali Dal after my father’s tenure as MP came to an end.”SAD district president Virsa Singh Valtoha said, “All accused should be punished strictly no matter which political party they belong to. People are also accusing Congress’ Khadoor Sahib MLA Ramanjit Singh Sikki’s personal assistant (PA) Jarmanjit Singh of being involved. Action should be taken against him too.”Sikki said attempts were being made o defame him by dragging his PA’s name in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooch-tragedy-cong-akali-leaders-from-supply-hub-of-killer-spirit-under-lens/story-M4jJR2IQg3IYwazg4FsCbP.html
04-08-2020||City||Operating from canal banks, zero line, bootleggers in border belt keep cops on toes||Running illicit breweries on canal banks, village streets to isolated spots near the zero line, bootleggers in the border belt of south Malwa districts have been giving the police and the excise department officials a tough time. The business of manufacturing illicit liquor by villagers in the region is not new as it has been going on for the last several decades. Most of those into bootlegging, including women, are repeat offenders as they evade strict legal action due to the toothless Excise Act, say the officials.Every district in the region has villages that have earned the notoriety for distilling illicit liquor in bulk. In Fazilka district, Mahlam, Hindu Mal Kot (located on the line zero on Pakistan border) and Chananwala areas are among the most infamous for distilling liquor. Kattianwali in Muktsar district and Bathinda’s Bir Talab, Nathana and Talwandi Sabo areas are known for producing illicit liquor.Police officials say tracks between the Pakistan border and the Sutlej in Ferozepur district are commonly used to brew liquor.“Floodplains and small islands in the river areas along the international border have restricted access due to the Border Security Force (BSF) protocol. Thus they become haven for bootleggers. The brewers work in connivance with the corrupt low-rung cops,” says a senior police official.Another official said as authorised liquor vends are not available in some of the far-off places in the border belt, villagers prefer buying illicit liquor which comes at relatively cheap price.Besides, highly unhygienic ways are adopted to produce liquor.Fazilka senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harjit Singh said raiding Mahlama and two other villages is a weekly exercise as lahan (raw material used to manufacture liquor) in hundreds of liters is destroyed every month. Since it is a herculean task to store huge quantity of illicit liquor at the police stations, it is preferred to dismantle such unauthorised breweries with a stern warning to villagers, he said.“Villagers dig large pits outside their houses to brew liquor. In the last three months, we have seized and destroyed over 1.25 lakh liters of lahan at Mahlam alone. A section of villagers at Hindu Mal Kot have brewing units in the adjoining Rajasthan and we frequently make joint raid with the Sriganganagar police,” said the SSP.“There is no data on how illicit liquor gradually affects the health of consumers. It is easily available at villages but civil society activists, including those of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), who have a wide network of volunteers, have hardly ever raised the issue of unauthorised liquor to build a societal pressure on the administration and the government,” says a senior police official.Newly appointed Bathinda SSP Bhupinderjit Singh Virk said about 30 quintal lahan and 35,000 litre illicit liquor was recovered from about five identified villages in the last four days. “The list of habitual offenders is being prepared for further legal action. Illicit liquor is also a social nuisance and we are maintaining a close watch on the areas where people indulge in brewing and selling of hooch,” said Virk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/operating-from-canal-banks-zero-line-bootleggers-in-border-belt-keep-cops-on-toes/story-yVI1J9Ive8rQJoVaoSF4TN.html

04-08-2020||City||Only 2.5% of Covid-19 patients put on ventilators survived in Punjab||Only 2.5% of critically ill Covid-19 patients put on ventilator support in government and private hospitals across Punjab could recover from the disease.As per the state health department data, 200 critical coronavirus patients were put on ventilation machines and only five of them (2.5%) survived. A ventilator facilitates the breathing of a patient who is physically unable to breathe. The number of Covid-related fatalities in the state stands at 442. Punjab has 300 ventilators in government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCH) and 900 in private facilities to treat Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile in Punjab, the survival rate of Covid-19 patients who were given ventilator support has dipped by 7.5% in past two months. Till May 30, two of the 21 patients (10%) put on ventilator support had survived from the disease.“To date, 200 Covid-19 patients out of the total 18,527 had required ventilator support, which is only 1%. But we could save only 5 patients. The survival rate of patients on ventilators in Punjab matches the national average. The health team is focusing on lowering the fatality rate in the state. Most of the Covid-19 patients who died in the state had co-morbidities,” said Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.He added, “The state has increased the ventilator capacity from 600 to 1,200 in the last two months. At present, 18 critical patients are on ventilator support in Punjab and nearly 150 patients are on oxygen support. The remaining 1,182 ventilators are vacant at present and the state is prepared to handle the worst situation.”“The death rate of patients on ventilators is high because the cases arrive late as most of them initially hesitate in revealing their condition to the health department and take medicines without prescription. Also, the patients get referred to government hospitals from private facilities at an almost irreversible stage,” Dr Bhaskar added.Blurb: Of 200 critical coronavirus patients provided mechanical breathing assistance in the state, only five survived||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-2-5-of-covid-19-patients-put-on-ventilators-survived-in-punjab/story-29f3vs2T7gbZsHzo7NdhSJ.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana plans to switch over to machine-driven procurement||Before the paddy harvesting season sets in, Haryana government is actively planning to gradually switch from manual to machine-driven procurement of food grains and overcome the looming risk of labour shortage induced by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In what is being seen a first firm step towards mechanisation of procurement process, Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) has mooted a plan about introducing stock-lifting machines in the wholesale grain market yards. The new equipment will include motor-operated electrical loaders, bag stackers, electronic weighing scales and bag stitching machines. Based on the volume of grain arrival in the mandis, about two to five e-loaders and bag stackers will be installed in each procurement centre. “To begin with, we plan to introduce these machines in about 80 mandis,” PK Das, additional chief secretary (ACS), food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, said. “This system will also help us in eliminating ghost purchasing of the grains. At the entry and exit points of the mandis, there would be electronic weighing scales that will help us in quantity audit.” Haryana produces nearly 68 lakh metric tonne (LMT) paddy, including over 25 LMT basmati on about 32 lakh acre land. As paddy production consumes massive quantity of water, Haryana government has also introduced ‘Mera Pani Meri Virasat’ policy to encourage farmers to switch over to alternative crop in place of paddy. Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, in a statement said due to Covid-19, labour shortage may continue during paddy procurement in October. “In view of this, the state government has decided to mechanise the procurement process,” he added. Haryana largely depends on farm labourers from UP and Bihar and most of them had gone back to their native places amid coronavirus outbreak. Once the farmers bring in their harvest to the mandis, the next challenge is how to unload the large volumes, weigh and pack the vast quantity of grain. The delay in lifting of grains leads to glut in the wholesale markets as at present, trucks are loaded manually. “You need a specialised labour for this laborious task of lifting, loading and unloading of grain bags. The electrical loader will reduce dependence on manual labour,” the ACS said. In its proposal to the government, the HSAMB has said that these machines can load and unload two to three bags per minute and could reduce 75% dependency on labour. “...Also, the time of loading, stacking and unloading will reduce to less than half,” reads the HSAMB note. According to Sumedha Kataria, chief administrator of HSAMB, at least 24 maize dryers will be bought for three Kurukshetra mandis (Ladwa, Babain and Pipli). The maize arriving in the markets contains high moisture ranging from 24% to 46%. Drying of maize during the peak arrival period is a difficult task for farmers as manual drying is a labour-oriented and time-consuming process. These machines can reduce high moisture of maize to normal purchasable moisture 18% to 20% in seven to eight hours. “Being portable, these machine can be shifted from one mandi to another as per requirement,” Kataria added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-plans-to-switch-over-to-machine-driven-procurement/story-Sf74HqDBFappPBP6J82x2N.html
04-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to build over 70 check dams in Asola Bhatti to conserve rainwater, prevent soil erosion||The Delhi government’s forest department is planning to build over 70 small check dams in the catchment areas of the Asola Bhatti sanctuary and the southern and central ridges to conserve rainwater and prevent soil erosion.The project aims to retain water in the form of small ponds that will help recharge groundwater aquifers, bring up the depleting water table and also serve as a natural water resource to support wildlife and improve vegetation. These forests are considered the city’s green lungs. During monsoon, rainwater flows out of the forests into nearby colonies and drains and nutrient-rich soil is lost due to surface runoff.According to officials in the forest department, the project has already been launched at the Asola sanctuary. Eleven check dams are already being built. These dams will help retain as much water as possible, which will gradually aid in raising the water table of nearby areas as well. It will also improve the soil quality and vegetation in the area.The sanctuary is located on the southern ridge and is spread across 1,960 hectares. It is part of the northern Aravallis and serves as a carbon sink for the national capital and a potential shelterbelt against desert storms.The decision to build check dams was taken by the Delhi government after the Delhi High Court told the city government last year to trap rainwater and check soil erosion in protected forest areas.“Check dams are small dams that are built across a water channel or a drainage ditch (depression) to counteract erosion by reducing the velocity of the flow of water. It prevents the soil from erosion during rainfall and allows water to be retained in the form of small pools or waterholes where wild animals can drink and bathe. They also help natural vegetation grow by retaining moisture,” said Ishwar Singh, the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and head of the forest department.A senior forest official said that their departments has undertaken an extensive survey to identify the catchment areas at all three locations. “So far at Asola, we have identified around 30 sites where check dams of about 2-4 feet in height will come up. A survey to identify 20 more sites is going on. Also, three or four bigger dams of 6-8 feet in height will be constructed in the sanctuary area. Besides, on the southern and central ridges, 8-10 dams each will come up. These forests already have a few bigger check dams we constructed a few years ago,” the official said, not wishing to be named.“The first batch of 11 dams has been set up in the forest area behind Sangam Vihar. At present, work is being undertaken at the Neeli Jheel and near the Shahurpur village. Work has also started at the central ridge,” the official added.The forest department has roped in the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) for the project. Sohail Madan, an ecologist and manager of the BNHS Conservation Education Centre at Asola Bhatti sanctuary said that three kinds of check dams—gabion rock dams, soil embankment dams and grass dams—are being built on seasonal streams.“Check dams are effective, low-cost and do not disturb the forest as such. They will be of immense help in retaining soil and moisture at a place like Asola, which has steep slopes where the water and the silt run down fast,” said Madan.CR Babu, professor emeritus and head of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) at Delhi University, said that check dams are a traditional method of rainwater harvesting in larger landscapes such as forests that have bigger surface drainage channels. “There are many roles that these dams play, from increasing the capacity of groundwater recharge, raising the water table and retaining moisture for plant growth to serving as grassland habitats, which enrich the overall biodiversity. It is a good technique to prevent soil erosion. Some of the deeper streams serve as a water resource even during the dry season,” said Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-build-over-70-check-dams-in-asola-bhatti-to-conserve-rainwater-prevent-soil-erosion/story-oG3nhBCNjvyLvmNhKxokGJ.html

It offers infrastructure loans to educational institutions which the institutions have to pay back. Previously, institutions were getting government grants for the expansion of infrastructure.This statement comes two weeks after Hindustan Times reported that the ministry was in favour of approving projects of approximately ₹450 crore in the JNU and these included five new hostel blocks, a building for its management school, another for an advanced animal research facility and an incubation centre.JNU vice-chancellor N Jagadesh Kumar Wednesday said the funds allotted by HEFA will be used for various projects such as hostels and “academic complex buildings for the School of Engineering, Atal Bihari Vajpayee School of Management & Entrepreneurship, trans disciplinary academic research, advanced animal research facility, advanced instrumentation research facility, incubation centre for start-up companies, special centre for e-learning, lecture hall complex and the setting up of an integrated and unified education system”.The special centre for e-learning will offer online degree programmes to students who could not be admitted to JNU, registrar Pramod Kumar later said in a statement. “These students can still benefit from the expertise of JNU faculty,” he said.The JNU teachers’ association (JNUTA), however, opposed the move. “This is a replacement of public funding for infrastructure development with loans, the terms of which cannot possibly be better than grants where no repayment obligation exists. Furthermore, a part of this financing will also be directed towards making JNU the instrument of helping the government shirk its responsibility to invest in making education accessible to all -- by promoting online education and falsely selling the idea that it is a substitute for regular teaching and learning,” JNUTA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-gets-funding-of-455-crore-for-new-buildings-e-learning/story-mzoA3Fn7J48c0ER1Kwf43K.html

Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, commissioner of police Rakesh Kumar Agrawal, additional deputy commissioner (development) Sandeep Kumar, deputy commissioner of police Ashwani Kapoor and other senior officials held a meeting with representatives of the private hospitals at police lines on Tuesday.When all these private hospitals start the facility, at least 200 ICU and 500 non-ICU (level 2) beds will be added to the existing strength, Sharma said.At present, seven private hospitals, namely Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, SPS Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Deep Hospital, GTB Hospital and Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer Hospital are providing Covid treatment, along with government hospitals.The deputy commissioner said that some of the private hospitals have assured to start Covid treatment within a day, and some will start within the next 48 hours. He also directed private hospitals to reserve at least 50% of their total ICU beds for Covid treatment.The civil surgeon, Ludhiana, has been asked to train medical and other healthcare staff for Covid treatment in private hospitals. Also, doctors of these hospitals will be able to seek guidance regarding treatment of Covid patients from the state-level expert committee specially formed for this purpose.The DC told representatives of private hospitals that it is their moral and social responsibility to treat patients during the ongoing pandemic. He added that if a staff members of these private hospitals denies treatment to Covid patients, action will be taken against them under National Disaster Management Act. Police commissioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal urged all private hospitals to come forward and assist the district administration in the war against Covid-19. He also assured police security at their premises.Sandeep Kumar, ADC (development)-cum-nodal officer, Covid-19, said that once these 50 private hospitals start providing Covid treatment, their data will be added in the newly developed mobile app so that residents can check real-time status of vacant beds in private hospitals of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pvt-hospitals-in-ludhiana-assure-admn-of-starting-covid-treatment/story-EO0vmjzpf0jCZTLQ6wsrRJ.html
04-08-2020||City||DU ad hoc teachers worried about renewal of contracts amid Covid pandemic||New Delhi: The rather permanent problem of Delhi University’s temporary teachers – guest and ad-hoc – has surfaced again amid the Covid-19 pandemic. With first-year admissions delayed by at least two months, teachers are now worried about the upcoming academic session, their role in it and renewal of their contracts.Himanshu Singh, an ad-hoc teacher at DU’s Satyawati College, said, “The revised academic session states that classes will begin on August 10 for first, third, and fifth semester students. But admission for the first year was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. This has substantially reduced the workload. We are worried that some colleges may use this as an excuse to not renew our appointment.” Singh said while some principals said they would renew the appointments of their ad-hoc teachers, others have “created confusion” over how they will execute this.Ad-hoc teachers number around 4,500 and constitute more than 50% of the university’s teaching strength of around 10,000 and participate in other college activities. Their teaching hours are around 16 hours per week. While ad-hoc teachers are appointed for four months, after which the contract may be renewed, guest teachers (roughly 1,700) are paid on a lecture basis and have around five to eight teaching hours per week. The rest are permanent teachers. Abhishek Parashar, an ad-hoc teacher at Delhi University, said the uncertainty of jobs during a health crisis has been unnerving. “The university must intervene and order colleges to redistribute work but there has been no directive so far. Permanent teachers have stepped up and said they would take the workload for the first year and we could look at continuing students. These are only quick-fixes but we need a permanent appointment, which have not been done despite directives.”Asit Kumar, a guest teacher of DU who resides in Burari with his family, said he has to rely upon his brother to run his family. “While my college has cleared my payment till April, I am yet to receive remuneration for classes conducted at non-collegiate courses of the varsity, which amounts to over Rs 70,000. I have already used up all my savings during the lockdown and have to rely on the money my brother sends me from our village with little clarity on when I will get my pay. There is no clarity over our appointments and due to the Covid-19 crisis, looking for other jobs is also difficult.”Rajesh Jha, DU’s executive council member, said, “We found out that fewer number of approvals were sent out for ad-hoc teachers than usual. Thousands of these teachers have been mentoring, counselling and providing academic guidance throughout the Covid-19 period. They don’t have any health benefits and are dependent on salary. We have written to university officials, asking them to ensure that their appointments are not hampered.”In order to implement the constitutionally mandated Economically Weaker Section reservation, Jha said there have been cases of ad-hoc teachers being removed as the posts are going to the EWS category, requiring fresh appointments. “These teachers should not be sacrificed overnight during such an uncertain time,” Jha said.Earlier this month, the DU Teachers’ Association also wrote to vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, asking that services of all ad-hoc teachers must be renewed and vacation salaries must be disbursed. “The appointment of guest faculty required for the teaching of courses for continuing students must be done on an immediate basis to prevent loss of teaching time,” the association said in its letter. The association also said guest faculty engaged in non-collegiate and regular courses have gone without pay and their remuneration must be released immediately.Balaram Pani, the university’s dean of colleges, said, “The academic session has not started yet. Beginning August 10, classes will be conducted online. How can teachers get the letter [of renewal] before the session even begins?” He said DU’s School of Open Learning had cleared all bills for guest teachers and only those for which applications had not been moved were pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-ad-hoc-teachers-worried-about-renewal-of-contracts-amid-covid-pandemic/story-C7ReR4Mj728kRIg1hsZKyL.html

04-08-2020||City||Delhi Police probing Kaushal gang hand in two Delhi shooting incidents||New Delhi: Delhi Police are probing a possible link between Gurugram’s dreaded Kaushal gang and two back-to-back firing incidents cum extortion threats in Delhi within 48 hours last week. One person arrested on Monday for the shootings allegedly claimed he was following the gangster’s orders, police said.At least 10 teams, including members from the special cell and crime branch, were formed after the firing incidents by gunmen, who left a letter at each spot, demanding R1 crore as “protection money” on behalf of Kaushal, who is presently lodged in Hisar jail.The first firing took place on July 31 at a sweet shop in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar, where two bike-borne persons opened fire and left a letter, demanding R1 crore. Even as the west district police were probing the case, a similar incident took place the very next day, when three masked men opened fire at a car showroom near the Sultanpur Metro station in south Delhi and left a similar letter.Initial investigation hinted that at least five gangs, mostly based in Haryana, joined hands with Kaushal’s group to carry out extortions and establish themselves in Delhi’s crime world, which has been lying void after the arrest of gangsters such as Jitender alias Gogi, Jyoti Prakash alias Baba, Vikas alias PK, and Sandeep alias Dhillu, police said.Officers said some members of the so-called “Kranti gang” led Rajesh Bharti, who was killed in a shootout in south Delhi in 2018, also joined Kaushal.“Gangsters such as Kuldeep Gadoli, Sandeep alias Kala Jatheri, Sube Gujjar and their accomplices are now working with Kaushal’s gang and their prime focus is to expand their empire to the national capital. There was another firing and extortion demand case in Najafgarh two-three months ago and the name of Kaushal’s gang had emerged during the investigation,” said a special cell officer, requesting anonymity.Members of the special cell and crime branch were put on the job to break the emerging nexus of different gangs and nab their members, senior police officers privy to the case said.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said, “We have been receiving information that gangs from Haryana are trying to establish base in Delhi. Our teams are committed to thwart their attempts.”A plumber till 16 years ago, Kaushal, 39, was arrested in August 2019 by Haryana Police from the Delhi airport. He was involved in more than 200 cases of murder, extortion, blackmail, and threat calls. Kaushal fled to Dubai and shifted eight locations there since December 2017. A Red Corner Notice and a lookout circular (LOC) were issued against him. Another officer said on condition of anonymity that Kaushal is also trying to get himself shifted to a Delhi prison, to avoid threat to his life from rivals and seek the support of Delhi’s jailed gangsters. On Monday, the special cell caught 24-year-old Kapil alias Ravi Kumar, who was involved in the recent shootings, after an exchange of fire in outer Delhi’s Rohini. Five bullets were exchanged and one fired by the police hit Kapil’s leg. Two policemen took one bullet each in their bulletproof vests, an officer associated with the raid said.Kapil told police he was acting on the directions of Kaushal and his aide Sachin, whom he had met in Bhondsi jail this year, DCP Yadav said. “Sachin is Kaushal’s hitman and he was with Kapil in both the firing incidents. Sachin told Kapil that Kaushal had selected him for some work and later included him in the firings,” said Yadav. “Since Kaushal’s name emerged in the car showroom firing case, our team will question him and take his custody if needed,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya.Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of Gurugram police (crime), said, “We will extend our support to Delhi Police as and when they need in their cases involving Kaushal and other gangs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-probing-kaushal-gang-hand-in-two-delhi-shooting-incidents/story-EmOKVQDARtHvn21lcWAKKO.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||SONGS VS SOCIETY: Will ‘Desi Daru’ obsession wane after a high in Punjabi songs?||While songs in any culture celebrate a drink or more, Punjabi songs in the past few decades have overdone this glorification.Music-makers of the region have endorsed alcohol, which is part of a Punjabi lifestyle, and extolled the tradition all the way from a swig of ‘Patiala Peg’ to a gulp of ‘Desi Daru’.Such was the fervour of ‘Desi Daru’ songs in the past decades that even the otherwise sober and sentimental Gurdas Maan could not resist the joy of home-brewed liquor in ‘Apna Punjab hove, ghar di sharab hove’. In the video of this 2011 song, the singer can be seen drinking from an enamelled mug and riding high as ‘Jatt Nawab’ on a string cot.Of course, this drinking obsession was exploited to the optimum by the controversial singer Yo Yo Honey Singh who sang out with joy ‘One bottle down’, ‘Char botal vodka’, and “Party all night’. When questioned, he said: “Whenever you party, alcohol is the biggest reason to do so. You cannot avoid it.” Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh, before he turned to a singing literary poet like Shiv Kumar Batalvi, took thrill in singing ‘Oh desi daru vargi te, mera mood bigad’da jaave’.Well known Punjabi music director Atul Sharma says: “The trend is of eulogising ‘daru’ all the way. Young, educated and socially aware singers are not indulging in this culture. We have singers like Rabbi Shergill and Satinder Sartaj, who are winning young Punjabi hearts without playing the liquor card.”Nevertheless, singer Sharry Maan’s ‘3 Bottle’ song continues to be the most popular with millions of viewers.Song writer and former alcoholic, Baljinder Singh, says: “Liquor is a part of the Punjabi way of life. Even in covid times, the state government has allowed its home delivery. Desi Daru is all that a poor person can afford. I feel that alcoholism is a personal issue and songs cannot encourage or discourage it.”Along with Punjabi beats, glorification of alcohol has also entered Bollywood. For instance, in Cocktail, a sensitive Malerkotla poet like Irshad Kamil wrote: ‘Chadhi mujhe yaari teri aisi jaise daru desi’. Popular song ‘Party abhi baaki hai’ also refers to ‘Desi Daru’; this was also the name of a song sung by Jasbir Jassi for the film Main Aur Mr Riight.The issue, however, is if country-brew is legal or illicit and ‘Desi Daru’ is a poor Punjabi’s drink. So, the debate of whether songs influence society or it is the other way around continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/songs-vs-society-will-desi-daru-obsession-wane-after-a-high-in-punjabi-songs/story-sg3xVxdVWSEIpCjAs1Z31H.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana vet varsity to use stray cows as surrogate mothers for high-yielding calves||Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, is all set to use the stray cows as surrogate mothers to produce high-yield varieties of calves. The animal-sciences university is establishing its own cow shed (gaushala) where stray cows fit to give birth will be used to reproduce high-yield varieties of calf through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET). GADVASU vice-chancellor (VC) Dr Inderjeet Singh said the gaushala is being established for research, demonstration and training purposes. He said the university was making an effort to lower number of stray cattle left abandoned on highways. The census count conducted last year found that there were 1.4 lakh stray cattle in the state. Sachin Sharma, chairman of state Gau Sewa Commission, issued a notice to all deputy commissioners of the state on Tuesday highlighting the problem of stray cattle on highways. “It has been observed that during the lockdown and post lockdown, some gaushalas have run out of funds and abandoned cattle. The deputy commissioner, who is defecto president of cow pond, has been asked to provide shelter to cattle so that precious lives of both commuters and cows can be saved,” Sharma said. EMBRYOS TRANSFER PROJECT The varsity was the first in the country to carry out such an experiment successfully in 2017 when embryos of indigenous cows were transferred to exotic Holstein Friesian (HF) breed of cows and they became surrogate mothers to pure Sahiwal calves. The newborn calves had no traits of HF and were born in brown colour of Sahiwal. EXAMINATION OF PG COURSES FROM AUGUST 20 The V-C said that examinations of final semester students of postgraduate courses will be conducted from August 20, while the process of admission will be decided during the academic counsel meeting on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-vet-varsity-to-use-stray-cows-as-surrogate-mothers-for-high-yielding-calves/story-ICL2EuOUTY7UCP0Ma9e1HJ.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to link welfare schemes with ‘Parivar Pehchan Patra’||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday announced that welfare schemes of all departments would be linked with ‘Parivar Pehchan Patra’ (PPP) within three months. The PPP is a unique e-governance initiative that will enable the citizens to get the benefit of various central and state government schemes at their doorsteps in a fair and transparent manner, the chief minister said, while distributing the new identification cards to heads of 20 eligible families in a function organised at Panchkula. The Mukhya Mantri Parivar Samridhi Yojana and three pension schemes old age — Samman Allowance Scheme, Divyang Jan Pension Scheme and Widow and Destitute Women Pension Scheme — have been integrated with the PPP. The ‘Parivar Pehchan Patra’ were also distributed in other 21 districts on Tuesday. Khattar said the state government has decided to celebrate this year as ‘Susashan Sanakap Varsh’ and the integration of schemes of all departments with PPP would not only ensure effective and efficient delivery of services to the people, but also put an end to the complaints of corruption and red-tapism in the system. Out of the available record of 56.2 lakh families in the state, ‘golden data’ of 18.19 lakh families has been prepared and these are being given ‘Parivar Pehchan Patras’. The additional 20 lakh cards would be distributed by the end of August, Khattar said, adding that for the remaining family IDs that are to be distributed in September, verification would be completed this month only. Special camps would also be organised from August 27 to August 30 at village and ward levels for the collection and verification of data. The chief minister said with the distribution of PPPs, the state government would not only take care of educational, health and other needs of such families, but also skilling and employment of youth. To avail the benefits, the eligible beneficiaries would be required to fill up a simple form only once at their nearest saral kendras or Antyodaya Saral Kendra. Khattar said under the government’s drive to integrate the schemes of various departments with the PPP, ration cards of all those families would be prepared which at present do not have any ration card, but are eligible to have a ration card of the appropriate category. Later, Khattar inaugurated a portal for the registration of unorganised workers through PPP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-link-welfare-schemes-with-parivar-pehchan-patra/story-OLeoYW4dQvcH4YlsSPmE2M.html

The problem was reported from Sector 9, 10, Jagadhari gate road, Shakul Kund road, Manali House etc. Severe waterlogging was reported near the Kalka Mor on National Highway-44 where the vehicles were seen crawling to avoid large pits that were filled with rainwater.Residents alleged that the civic body only cleans dry waste over the drains and does not open them due to which water remains on roads for hours.A shopkeeper Anil said that every year roads are filled with water even after half-an-hour of rain. “Customers are not visiting markets due to the fear of Covid-19 pandemic and now waterlogging is adding to our woes,” he said.Posh areas like Manali House and Sectors 9 and 10 also reported waterlogging in some lanes. SDM Gauri Midha along with MC officials had visited the same sectors last week to take stock of the situation. She had directed the municipal authorities to resolve the issue.Meanwhile, MC commissioner Parth Gupta said that rainwater was gradually cleared in most of the areas but Kalka Mor area is not under his jurisdiction.“Due to heavy rains, the main drains near Nahan House and Shukul Kund road were initially full due to the water flow from interiors but later it cleared the water from peripheral areas as well. Nine pumping stations were also operating and we’ve already done extensive cleaning to ensure waterlogging doesn’t occur,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-washes-away-tall-claims-of-ambala-civic-body/story-US8qeYXPts3NLvJAE1KEQM.html

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board set to legalise PG facility in independent houses||Owners of independent houses allotted by the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) will soon be able to legally run paying guest accommodations on their premises.However, only those with houses of or above 7.5 marla will benefit from this decision. At present, it is illegal to run paying guest residential accommodations (PGRA) in CHB houses.A PGRA policy has been drafted, which will be tabled before the board of directors on August 6 for final approval, confirmed Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer (CEO), CHB. “Thereafter, the permission of the UT administration will be taken. The policy will not be applicable in group housing societies/flats allotted by the CHB,” he said.The development comes in the wake of a fire incident in a PG accommodation in Sector 32 on February 22, which claimed lives of three girl students. It led to the authorities mulling over allowing licensed PGRA in more houses to discourage unauthorised facilities and have better regulation.Residential properties under the jurisdiction of the UT estate office are already governed by the UT administration’s PG policy. The CHB has formulated its policy on the lines of the revised estate office policy notified earlier this year.“A large number of PG accommodations are being run illegally in independent houses allotted by the CHB. Even if house owners want permission for starting such a facility, it is not forthcoming. On approaching the estate office for registration, they are told to get a no-objection certificate from the CHB, which has no policy for it,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation.REGISTRATION PROCESSAccording to the draft policy, the house owner/lessee interested for starting the PGRA has to register with the CHB secretary. A physical inspection will be carried out before issuing the registration. The facility will be allowed only in those houses that have sanctioned plans and no building rule violations. A no-objection certificate from UT’s chief fire office is also mandatory. The owner has to renew the licence every year.WHAT THE POLICY ENTAILSArea of independent house cannot be less than 7.5 marlaThe owner/lessee or member of their family must reside in houseMinimum usable area for one PG must be 50 sq ft with provision for toiletNo extra or new kitchen can be erected beyond approved building plansA register of PGs has to be maintained with intimation to police and list should be displayedList of available accommodation with tariff plan must be displayedList of employees to take care of PGs to be verified by policeOwner/lessee responsible for maintaining disciplineVehicles should be parked within premises as far as possibleNo front office system allowed and facility should appear as a normal houseIn case of a breach of rules, CHB resume property or cancel allotment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-housing-board-set-to-legalise-pg-facility-in-independent-houses/story-yHncKOSGkxIxKB3WwyUK5O.html

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Bajwa, Dullo hit back, say limit to accepting misgovernance||Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo on Tuesday said there is always a limit to accepting “misgovernance and maladministration”. Responding to Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar’s demand for their expulsion from the party, Bajwa said they are loyalists of the Congress but not of leaders who are looting the state under the garb of welfare and good governance. “I have not bartered away my conscience for a seat in a former Maharaja’s durbar. I will continue raising issues of such magnitude,” the Congress MP said in a statement, denying any personal agenda. Bajwa said they had been raising the issue of liquor mafia and writing to the chief minister but he had the audacity to publicly comment in a press conference that he does not read their communications. “Jakhar should understand that I have not backstabbed the party but was left with no alternative means to raise these issues with the chief minister,” he added, offering to accompany him for a meeting with Sonia Gandhi to apprise her of the true administration of Punjab. The Congress MP said they did betray the Congress or its leadership but sought an inquiry where the government was protecting the mafia. Training his guns on Jakhar, the Congress MLA accused him of “weak-kneed and spineless leadership” that had left the Congress workers in the state demoralised and disgruntled. He said if Jakhar had the courage to question the chief minister, lives would have been saved. “We do not understand how the conscience of Jakhar permits him to ignore a tragedy of this magnitude,” he said, accusing him of defending the undefendable. Dullo also asked Jakhar to perform his dharma as the state unit chief of the party. “Is it a crime to talk against mafia? We are working to save the Congress,” he said, accusing Jakhar of not performing his duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bajwa-dullo-hit-back-say-limit-to-accepting-misgovernance/story-CzHxlMXJgajNSG4zSAtj4O.html

The resolution later came to be known as Palampur resolution.“According to available records, Mughal emperor Barbar visited Ayodhya in 1528, destroyed the temple situated at the site believed to be Ram-Janamsthana, and constructed a mosque,” states a part of the Palampur resolution.BJP asserted claim of the Hindu community over the disputed Shrine. The Palampur resolution vaulted the BJP to the centre stage as the movement for Rama Temple gained momentum.“Of course this is a great day not only for India but for Himachal and Palampur also. It was here that the party adopted the Rama Temple demand as its political agenda,” said BJP veteran and former union minister Shanta Kumar.He was the president of Himachal BJP and main organiser of the working committee meeting in which the resolution was passed.“It was after this resolution that the movement gathered steam,” said Shanta, adding that after years of struggle and sacrifices the dream is finally being realised. He further says that the Lord Rama was not only a religious leader but founder of cultural nationalism, which makes the core of the Hindu ideology.KULLU REJOICESThe hill-town of Kullu, formerly a princely state, has also a unique connection with Ayodhya. The idol of Lord Raghunatha at the temple owned by the Royal Family of Kullu, is believed to be brought from Ayodhya in the 16th century.As per the story, to ward off a Brahmin’s curse, the then king of Kullu Raja Jagat Singh was advised by a sage to bring the idol of Lord Raghunatha from Ayodhya and setup a temple at Kullu.Maheshwar Singh, the scion of Kullu Royal Family and chharibardar of Raghunatha Temple said the temple premises has been illuminated to celebrate the occasion. “A big function will be organised once the Covid-19 pandemic is over,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rama-temple-foundation-ceremony-brings-palampur-into-limelight/story-ccBxdSX3OvCkieagPKC6rJ.html

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal apple growers scout for online buyers||With the apple economy in doldrums amid the coronavirus crisis, Himachal orchardists are scouting for online buyers. Orchardists had to grapple with issues such as acute labour shortage and transportation difficulties this season. The produce was also leaner as compared to previous years. Labourers from Nepal form a major chunk of the workforce in apple growing areas. But this year due to travel restrictions imposed to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, Nepalese labourers could not return. There are 40,000 Nepalese labourers registered with the government. The Nepalese workforce is primarily concentrated in the Shimla-Kullu-Kinnaur belt, a major apple-growing areas in the state. The Nepalese labourers are also scattered in areas where hydel projects are located. After Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal is the second-highest apple-producing state in the country. More than two-thirds of the market is captured by apples from Kashmir, while Himachal apple has a 20% share. Apple growers say this harvest season was one of the toughest seen. Farmers are trying hard to rope in local labourers besides arranging labourers from Motihari in Bihar and Lakhinpur kiri in Uttar Pradesh. “Labourers from Jharkhand are not trained in working in apple orchards. Only Nepalese labourers can handle manual operations in apple orchards,” said Mahijit Singh Rathore, president, Nawar Valley Apple growers. “ My seasonal labourers are struck in Nepal. I have made several attempts to get them over to India but the Nepalese government has imposed strict restrictions and are a not allowing them to cross the border in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. I had to arrange labour from Sirmaur district,“ says Naresh Chauhan an apple grower from Dhraonk village in Kotkhai . Like many others, Chauhan has also set up his own grading unit for sorting apples . ‘NOT MANY BUYERS INTERESTED’“ I have tried to contact many online buyers to purchase apples but they have not shown much interest,” says Raman Prakash an apple grower in Kotgarh region, which is known for its quality apple produce. Labour shortage has also forced the apple growers to shell out more money to pay the daily wages . The daily wages during the apple season vary from ₹400-₹500 per day. However, areas facing labour shortage are having to pay more. Many areas facing labour shortage have jacked up the rates and apple owners are paying upto ₹800 per day. Apple harvest is gradually picking up and the labour problem is likely to get more acute in the coming days. Also, not many bulk buyers from outside the sate have shown interest in purchasing apples . “So far, 1.25 lakh apples have been transported outside the state, the transportation will go up in the coming days,” says Naresh Thakur managing director Agro Produce Marketing Corporation ( APMC). Then horticulture department is projecting estimates of ₹2.5 crore apple boxes but growers say the crop is lean this time .

The invitation, sent by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, was delivered by the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, the Sikh wing of pro-Hindutva organisation, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Monday afternoon. When asked if he would be attending the event on August 5, the jathedar said, “I have not read this invitation.” When told that the contents of the invitation had been published in the newspapers, he said, “I have not read the newspapers.”Many are seeing his response as an indication that he won’t go to the event. Rashtriya Sikh Sangat general secretary Sandeep Singh, who delivered the invite, said, “Though we gave the invite on Monday, our national president had sent it to him on Whatsapp two or three days ago. We can only request his presence. It’s up to him to attend or not,” he added.Notably, the trust planned to ensure the presence of jathedars of all five Sikh Takhts at the event. However, there is no possibility of attendance of the jathedars as a considerable section of the Sikh community is against it. In October 2019, Giani Harpreet Singh had demanded a ban on the RSS while terming the ‘Hindu Rashtra’ statement of its chief, Mohan Bhagwat, divisive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akal-takht-jathedar-shrugs-off-invitation-to-ayodhya-bhoomi-pujan/story-cSwtHoZjchXliBnFankZsL.html
04-08-2020||City||Ludhiana man succumbs to Covid-19 in absence of ventilator at Civil Hospital||The acute shortage of ventilators in city hospitals for the treatment of coronavirus patients has led to the death of a Covid-19 patient on Tuesday. Joginderpal, 54, died on Tuesday afternoon in absence of ventilator facility at the Civil Hospital. The four ventilators that were installed at Civil Hospital are currently being managed by Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H) to treat Covid-19 patients. The victim’s son Vishal accused the hospital authorities of his father’s death. A resident of Dholewal area, Vishal said that on Monday evening the condition of his father, who had contracted Covid-19 deteriorated. “As my father developed flu-like symptoms, the private hospitals refused to admit him citing unavailability of beds. We took him to the Civil Hospital where he was left unattended. He was later tested positive for coronavirus and was kept on oxygen support. Due to no ventilator bed available at the hospital, my father died on Tuesday,” said Vishal. However, senior medical officer (SMO) at Civil Hospital Amarjeet Kaur said that the patient arrived at the hospital in a critical condition. “The patient arrived at the hospital at 4.30 am and soon the staff tried to stabilize him. As the ventilator was not available at the Civil Hospital, we contacted the authorities of Government Rajindra Medical College in Patiala. We tried shifting two patients on Advanced Life Support (ALS), but their relatives objected. Meanwhile, the patient had died. We have been urging people to admit patients at an early stage when they show signs of flu-like symptoms. But sadly the patients arrive at a very late stage,” Dr Amarjeet Kaur. On Tuesday, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma set-up a help desk at DMC&H so that patients with level-1 ailment could be referred to isolation facilities, and ICU facilities could be reserved for critically ill patients. Recently, MP Ravneet Singh Bittu had demanded level-3 facilities at Ludhiana Civil Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-man-succumbs-to-covid-19-in-absence-of-ventilator-at-civil-hospital/story-YWpMgIeQzK7OaGdbMnFvDK.html

04-08-2020||City||Pune divisional commissioner reduces paperwork of pvt hospitals for Covid cases||PUNE: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has streamlined the admission procedure for Covid patients at private hospitals. The hospital management has to fill 4-5 forms against the previous practice of 17-18 forms. Rao said, “At every review meeting, private hospitals raised the issue that time was lost in filling various forms. Even manpower was unnecessarily needed to fill 17-18 forms for Covid patients.” The senior official said that the administration appointed a three-expert committee to address the issue. The panel found that private hospitals need to fill and submit the same information at various offices, including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), district collector, municipal corporation and charity commissioner. The experts suggested that these agencies can also get the information from a single platform.” Rao said, “Based on the panel’s recommendations, the form-filling exercise has been reduced to four and five.” The commissioner said that private hospitals are voluntarily approaching the administration to convert their hospitals into Covid care centres. Rao said, “A private hospital had to use its beds to quarantine 45 staff. When I suggested that the infected staff will be shifted to a civic-run quarantine facility, the hospital agreed to turn the hospital into a Covid care centre. Hence, we got 45 beds for critical patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-divisional-commissioner-reduces-paperwork-of-pvt-hospitals-for-covid-cases/story-oMO7o6SSS2CbtHVv7k0lHO.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Jakhar seeks expulsion of Bajwa, Dullo, says they crossed ‘lakshman rekha’||A day after Congress MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo sought CBI, ED probes into illicit liquor trade in the state, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar demanded their immediate expulsion from the Congress for crossing the ‘lakshman rekha’ of party discipline. Jakhar said he will write to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to seek “strict action” against the brazen indiscipline of the two Rajya Sabha MPs, who have attacked their own government. While extending his sympathies to the families of those who lost their lives in the horrific, he said such tragedies do not give license to any individual to indulge in indiscipline. Bajwa and Dullo, both former presidents of Punjab Congress, had met Governor VP Singh Badnore and alleged “clear-cut failure” on the part of the state administration. Jakhar, in a detailed riposte, said it was time to stem the rot and save the Congress from the “petty machinations” of the likes of Bajwa and Dullo. “Ye jis thali mein khatey hain ussi mein chhed kartey hain (They are biting the hand that feeds them). They are only interesting in fulfilling their vested interest,” he said, describing their actions as a ‘copy-paste job’ of what happened in Rajasthan in January, in the wake of 107 infant deaths over which Sachin Pilot had flayed his own government. Asserting that the actions of Bajwa and Dullo could not be tolerated any longer, the Punjab Congress chief said men like these, who did not have even the courage to face elections, were no asset to the party. Such back-stabbing members should be shown the door before they can cause any serious damage, he said, adding that “enough is enough now”. Jakhar said Bajwa and Dullo had been engaging in such anti-party activities for quite some time by talking against their own party and targeting the Congress government in Punjab. He said their attacks had increased after Amarinder Singh announced his decision to contest the 2022 assembly elections. “Having probably seen the 2022 polls as their last chance to make it big in the corridors of power, the duo saw their hopes shattered and, out of sheer frustration, are knocking at all possible doors to sneak their way to the top echelons of power,” he said. Complimenting Union home minister Amit Shah for his “uncanny ability” of gauging a person’s worth, Jakhar alleged that the centre scaled up the security of Bajwa from ‘Y’ to ‘Z’ category, giving him four extra security guards, while curtailing the security of top Congress leaders and won him over. “Bajwa and Dullo want to meet the Prime Minister and home minister. Why didn’t they meet them to demand funds for the state government for Covid-19,” he asked. He said the two MPs were surviving politically only due to the largesse of the Congress high command, which had nominated them to the Rajya Sabha since they were scared of contesting the assembly or parliamentary elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jakhar-seeks-expulsion-of-bajwa-dullo-says-they-crossed-lakshman-rekha/story-GZJJ3BHY6Vl6e2o7iCZP9M.html

Before it closed its gates in March, the zoo was earning Rs 1.8 lakh a day with the help of 3,000 visitors daily and was hoping to become self-reliant in the next two years. On the flip side, it will now take the zoo six months to help its accounts tide over the losses.The Punjab government had planned a Dinosaur Park on two acres in the zoo at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore. Completed 50% so far, it is being developed on public-private partnership (PPP) mode.As part of an exotic animal exchange programme, the zoo was to import animals from Africa, including zebras, giraffes, chimpanzees and gorillas.“Last year, we collected a revenue of Rs 6.5 crore. This year, we have already suffered a loss of Rs 3.5 crore. There is no certainty on when the new projects will see the light of the day, while it will take at least six months to recover from the losses,” said zoo field director M Sudhagar. Over the past few months before the lockdown, the zoo was equipped with numerous new features to attract visitors, such as an aviary and new ticket counters, besides road maintenance.The zoo spends about Rs 30 lakh a month on meat, fodder, grains, fruits and vegetables for the animals. Its revenue comes from outsourcing the parking, canteen and lion safari – all of which have been closed due to the pandemic. The tickets are priced at Rs 80 for adults and Rs 40 for children, which, on an average, contributes to a daily revenue of Rs 1.8 lakh. Lion and deer safari tickets cost Rs 75 per visitor. “We were aiming at becoming self-reliant in two years, but that seems a pipe dream now,” said a zoo staffer, not willing to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/projects-take-a-backseat-as-chhatbir-zoo-suffers-loss-of-3-5-crore-amid-pandemic/story-yZyJz8ZXxd9ShLrxxiseyH.html

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||2017 graft case: Chandigarh DIG declines sanction to prosecute suspended SHO||Stating that “no substantive evidence” has been placed on record by the investigating agency – the CBI, the UT deputy inspector general has refused to grant sanction to prosecute suspended SHO Jaswinder Kaur in a 2017 graft case. A special CBI court on Tuesday adjourned the case to August 5.Currently in judicial custody, the graft-tainted inspector had surrendered before a Chandigarh court on July 25 in another Rs 5 lakh graft case from May this year.In October 2017, sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Singh was arrested for accepting Rs 2 lakh in bribe, allegedly on the directions of the then Sector 31 SHO, Jaswinder Kaur.Prem Singh Bisht, the complainant, had alleged that the SI, who was the investigating officer in an attempt to murder case, demanded Rs 9 lakh to drop the names of three of his employees from the FIR.Bisht had alleged that the SI had told him that Rs 8 lakh were for the SHO and remaining Rs 1 lakh for him. The CBI had arrested the SI while accepting Rs 2 lakh bribe, but the case was closed against Kaur as the agency could not find any evidence to implicate her.However, in the CBI court, the complainant had said that he was taken to SHO Kaur by the SI at Old Car Bazaar in Hallomajra, where a meeting had taken place and SHO had demanded money.In 2019, Bisht had moved an application to declare Kaur an accused in the case, followed by another application in February 2020, where he stated he was being pressured by the SHO.Taking cognizance of the applications, the court had directed CBI to place before the sanctioning authority (SSP, Chandigarh) all evidence, so that the authority could apply its own mind whether to give sanction for prosecution.DIG’S RESPONSEResponding five months from the date of order – February 13, DIG Omvir Singh Bishnoi stated that he had gone through all documents and was of the view that the “perusal of chargesheet also reveals that after laying the trap, accused Mohan Singh did not disclose that bribe was obtained by him on behalf of Jaswinder Kaur and he even refused to make call to her.”He added, “As per chargesheet filed by CBI, there is no independent, oral, documentary or scientific evidence on record regarding direct demand of bribe by Kaur or on her behalf. The investigating agency further reveals that there is no evidence regarding her meeting with the complainant.”The DIG mentioned that even in the contents of the application moved by Bisht, “no new fact has been brought into light”. Therefore, no substantive evidence has been placed on record by the CBI to prove her involvement.“Thus, the prosecution sanction under Section 19 of Prevention of Corruption Act is hereby declined,” his response stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2017-graft-case-chandigarh-dig-declines-sanction-to-prosecute-suspended-sho/story-2RBnDPVncdBp4YzdqRn9BN.html

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Riddhima and Darpan from Chandigarh tricity bag spots in UPSC Top 100||Beating all their male counterparts, Riddhima Shrivastava and Darpan Ahluwalia have emerged as the only duo from the Chandigarh tricity area to figure in the Top 100 candidates selected for the prestigious civil services.Of the 829 candidates, who cleared the stringent process of the civil services exam (CSE), conducted by the Union Public Service Commission, no men from the tricity could make it to the Top 100.LIKE MOTHER LIKE DAUGHTERRiddhima Shrivastava, who lives in Sector 24, Chandigarh, secured the 74th rank to clinch the top spot in the tricity.Only child of her parents, the 24-year-old cleared the exam in her second attempt.Her mother Raji Shrivastava is also an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and is currently working as principal secretary, social security women and child development, Punjab. Her father, Pramod Shrivastava, is a retired Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer.Irrespective of her parents being civil officers, Riddhima said her parents always gave her the freedom to choose her own path and follow her dreams. “They are happy with the result, and have been immensely supportive throughout my journey,” she said.An alumna of Punjab Engineering College (PEC), Riddhima completed her engineering in electronics and communication in October 2017, before starting preparations for UPSC.However, rather than following in her parents’ footsteps, Riddhima wants to join the Indian Foreign Service (IFS): “It was always on my mind, but I made up my mind to prepare for UPSC only after passing out from PEC.”On her success mantra, she said, “More than motivation, it was discipline that paved the way for me. I stuck to rigorous preparations, while following a strict schedule. I revised all concepts holistically.”MOVE OVER MEDICINE, DOCTOR EYES IASSecond in the tricity at the 80th rank, Darpan Ahluwalia, a 26-year-old MBBS graduate from Government Medical College, Patiala, and a resident of Phase 10, Mohali, aims to be an IAS officer.“This was my second attempt. In 2018 also I had cleared the UPSC preliminary and main exams and had reached the interview stage,” Darpan said, adding that this year’s result had taken her by surprise as she did not expect to get through. “I was already preparing for my third attempt when the results were declared on Tuesday,” she added. After her previous attempt, she chose medical science as her optional subject, which she feels worked in her favour. “Usually candidates opt for a high-scoring and easy optional subject. But, I didn’t want to lose touch with what I had studied, so I opted for the harder subject. I scored well in it, which made a huge difference.”While IAS remains Darpan’s first choice, she would not mind either of the Indian Police Service (IPS) or the IFS. Darpan’s father Gurinder Singh Walia is a joint director with the Punjab department of animal husbandry. Her mother, Navneet Walia, who holds an MPhil degree in economics, teaches underprivileged children pro-bono. Her younger brother, Aaftab Singh, is pursuing a BTech in information and technology engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/riddhima-and-darpan-from-chandigarh-tricity-bag-spots-in-upsc-top-100/story-YsatdFZIToO3mexqSlKkoM.html
04-08-2020||City||Fearing shutdown, Ludhiana wedding hall owners ask govt to ease gathering curbs||Dreading a business shutdown, the owners of marriage halls and hotels with banquets on Pakhowal Road here have appealed the state government to increase the gathering limit of guests in weddings and other events.Overburdened by fixed charges such as salaries and electricity bills, the owners rued that they were getting no business due to the restriction that only 30 guests can participate in a wedding function.Addressing mediapersons here on Tuesday, hotel association members said there are around 200 resorts and hotels with banquet halls on Pakhowal Road and all are on the brink of shutdown, as the state government is not paying heed to their problems.Kohinoor Hotel owner Pritam Singh said, “The state government has failed to focus on the hospitality sector while announcing relief amid the ongoing pandemic. We are reeling under losses as there is no relief in terms of fixed charges, including electricity bills, even when no events are taking place. We are retaining our employees and are paying salaries to them, but we would not be able to continue like this for long and the government should increase the number of guests allowed to participate in events.”Taranjit Singh, who owns a resort here, said, “The government is allowing buses to run with full capacity, but no announcement has been made to increase the number of guests in events, rather the number has been decreased from 50 to 30 in the past. The restriction has also increased the cost of organising an event, due to which the residents are refraining from making bookings. We are expecting a good response from the public in the months of October, November and December, but if the government fails to announce any relief, the sector would not be able to revive itself. The government should allow 50% guests as per the capacity of a resort or banquet hall.”The owners also highlighted that a large number of trades associated with weddings, including caterers, brass band groups, valet service providers among others, were facing a tough time.Association president Vikas Shrivastava said, “The slowdown in the hospitality sector is taking a toll on a large number of trades and this would also lead to large scale unemployment if no relief is provided in the coming time. The government should at least waive off the fixed charges from power bills as no event is taking place in the resorts. Also, the number of guests allowed to participate in the event should be increased.”“With these restrictions, most of the events are taking place in temples and gurdwaras where they do not have proper staff to manage things. We can provide trained staff at the resorts and can maintain social distancing with ease. The revival of this sector would also generate revenue for the government in terms of goods and services tax,” said Shrivastava.HOTELIERS WARN OF STATEWIDE CLOSUREReeling under losses due to low footfall and gathering restrictions imposed by the state government in wedding events, Punjab restaurants and hotel association has warned of shutting down hotels if the government fails to provide them relief by the end of this week.The announcement was made by the members during an online meeting on Tuesday, wherein they decided to take up the matter with the chief minister on Thursday.They rued that the hotel business would not revive until interstate movement is allowed and railway services start across the country, but the government should at least increase the number of guests allowed to participate in events to provide some relief to the sector.Leading a group of around 1,750 restaurant and hotel owners, association president Amarvir Singh said, “The government has failed to provide any relief in terms of fixed charges in power bills etc. Further, the number of guests in a wedding event has been restricted to 30 even when the Union government has allowed 50 persons. Fifty passengers are allowed in a bus, but not in a banquet hall with much more capacity. We will take up the matter with the CM on Thursday and if the government fails to provide any relief, we will start shutting down hotels across the state from Monday onwards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fearing-shutdown-ludhiana-wedding-hall-owners-ask-govt-to-ease-gathering-curbs/story-4QGuhTfiiF4imiHDtQfejL.html

Ram, a 2008-batch IAS officer, has been at the helm of handling the Covid-19 situation in Pune district, which has seen over 92,000 cases till Monday. “This is a challenging opportunity for me and I am looking forward to it. I will follow further instructions from the government when taking charge of my new assignment,” said Ram after receiving the order. Ram will be deputy secretary for a period of four years from the date of taking charge under the central staffing scheme, a note issued by department of personnel and training written to Maharashtra chief secretary, stated. In Pune, Ram was leading the team formed to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in rural and semi-rural parts of the district, along with the smooth migration of workers back home during the lockdown. Ram is the third key officer in Pune district to have been transferred within a month amid the Covid-19 crisis and the administration busy in increasing the bed capacity by setting up three jumbo facilities. Earlier in July, the state government had transferred the then civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad and replaced him with Vikram Rao. On August 1, the government appointed Saurabh Rao, a 2003-IAS officer, as the Pune divisional commissioner after incumbent Deepak Mhaisekar retired on July 31. While Rao has been given time of three weeks to join the new position, the government is yet to announce a new collector for the district. The government is likely to issue an order in a day or two, said officials at the collectorate. In Pune, Ram had been tasked to ensure a peaceful gathering at Bhima Koregaon in 2019, a year after the village near Pune witnessed caste clashes during the anniversary of the war fought between British rulers and Peshwas. At least 10 lakh people had gathered at the obelisk to commemorate the Bhima Koregaon battle. Ram has also been credited with successfully handling the aftermath of the flash floods in Pune during September 2019.Before taking charge in April 2018, Ram had been posted as the Aurangabad district collector and also Beed collector. Before Ram, the then Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited managing director Shrikar Pardeshi and former PMC commissioner Kunal Kumar were transferred to the PMO from Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-dist-collector-naval-kishore-ram-gets-pmo-posting/story-MMXs9uEkJ0NU5WmwULKRyH.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Eviction of encroachers from acquired land not condition for compensation payment: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday held that railway bodies which want to acquire land, cannot insist that landowners shall remove encroachments and hand them over vacant possession, before compensation is paid for the land acquired under the Railways Act, 1989.“From a minute and careful examination of the two provisions [sections 20-H and 20-I of the Railways Act], what is discernible is that payment of compensation to the person(s) entitled, is not dependent upon handing over of possession of the land,” said the bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice NR Borkar.The bench said there was no negative covenant in the law that empowered the acquiring bodies to insist on encroachment-free possession of the land and withhold compensation on those grounds.HC said the legal provisions made it clear that before taking over possession of the land, the Central government has to deposit compensation with the competent authority, and as soon as the deposit is made, the competent authority shall make the payment to the person(s) entitled. However, a period of sixty days is prescribed for surrendering or delivering possession of the land.“This is clearly indicative of the fact that payment of compensation is not contingent upon handing over possession,” the bench said.The court was hearing a petition filed by Premier Limited, seeking a direction to Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL), a subsidiary of Indian Railways, to release the compensation amount of ₹21.71 crore for 28,672sqm of the petitioner company’s land at Bhopar in Thane district. The piece of land has been acquired by DFCCIL for the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, a special railway project with a route length of 1483km, from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) to Dadri in Haryana.Premier Ltd complained that though the final award was passed as regards the piece of land on May 6, 2017, and the land was transferred in revenue records to DFCCIL, compensation was not paid to it on the grounds that it failed to clear encroachments on the land. The company contended that nowhere in the law was such a condition stipulated, and it was legally unsustainable.DFCCIL, on the other hand, maintained that the land was well-protected until the publication of the first notification for its acquisition, but thereafter, the petitioner company permitted encroachments. “This is out of mala fide desire of the petitioner to extract more money as compensation from the second respondent, being hand in glove with the encroachers,” said the lawyer for the railway subsidiary. “Since the land has been acquired for a public purpose, the petitioner ought to clear the encroachments first, and handover possession of the vacant land, free from all encumbrances,” the lawyer added.HC, however, refused to accept the argument. The bench said in the backdrop of the legal position, the stand taken by DFCCIL was not justified. “Calling upon the petitioner to evict encroachers and to hand over vacant possession of the land, as a condition precedent to payment of compensation, is legally unsustainable,” said the bench.The court has now directed the sub-divisional officer at Kalyan, through whom the land was acquired, to pay the compensation amount to Premier Limited in six weeks, along with interest at the rate of 6℅ per annum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eviction-of-encroachers-from-acquired-land-not-condition-for-compensation-payment-hc/story-SbfBx5Y6hwpktW806E1WJP.html

The senior Shiv Sena leader is currently the urban development and public works minister in the state cabinet. The party workers of Thane came across the comments targeting Shinde and informed the Lokmanya Nagar vibhag pramukh (area head) Ramchandra Gaurav. Gaurav submitted his complaint to the Vartak Nagar police station on Sunday. Gurav said, “We do not know the person who posted such comments. It was our duty to file a police complaint.” “We have filed a non-cognisable complaint. The accused appears to have used a fake profile to post the objectionable comments,” said SB Gaikwad, senior inspector at Vartak Nagar police station. Meanwhile, Thane corporator Eknath Bhoir told media persons that the Shiv Sena will not tolerate such comments against the state leader. “If someone behaves in such a way, the Shiv Sena will not shy away from getting down on roads. The mayor has asked us to show restraint, but if someone continues to commit such acts, then we will respond to them in the same way. The entire state knows how the Thane Shiv Sena gives a response,” Bhoir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/complaint-against-man-for-defaming-sena-leader-on-social-media/story-eD0jq6PJwyqKQKpDbL0wTJ.html

There is no discrimination with Kangra,” he added.He said the district leadership has got enough representation in the government as well as organisation.“Besides, Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar, two ministers Bikram Singh and Sarveen Chaudhary come from Kangra. Senior MLA Ramesh Dhawalais is deputy chairman of state planning board,” he said.On the development front, Pathania said, several projects exclusively for Kangra district are in the pipeline. Citing an example, the Nurpur legislator said, a mango plantation project in collaboration with Israel, Maharashtra and Rajasthan will be implemented in the district.Under the project, a hybrid verity of mango that gives two crops in two year will be planted in the district. Besides, fruit plants of hybrid quality will be imported from Italy.He said ₹40 crore have been sanctioned for Kangra under horticulture project and two forestry projects will also be implanted in the district.Setting up of a National Sports University in Kangra is in pipeline and I have taken up the matter with the Union minister as well as BJP chief JP Nadda, he said.He said chief minister Jai Ram Thakur will be on a four-day tour to Kangra from August 6 to inaugurate and lay foundation stones of various projects in the district.Pathania, also took a dig at the opposition Congress terming it a ship without a captain.“BJP is clear about contesting the next assembly election under the leadership of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Hooch deaths: Capt talks tough, says guilty will not be spared||Asserting that he will finish the liquor mafia in the state, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that no one, whether a politician or a public servant, will be spared if found complicit in the hooch deaths. Amarinder said nobody will be allowed to get away with killing people with liquor. “I have put the entire force of the Punjab Police to crack down on the mafia. Some unscrupulous elements took advantage of the police focus on the pandemic to satiate their greed at the cost of the lives of Punjabis,” he said in a statement, terming the deaths due to spurious liquor as “sheer murder”. Accusing the opposition of exploiting the tragedy for their “petty political interests”, the chief minister said this is not the time to play politics but to stand by the government in its efforts to eliminate the mafia. He flayed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over its dharnas against the hooch tragedy, and asked how this would help in battling the mafia or supporting the bereaved families. The chief minister said that such tragedies have been taking place through the years across states, under different political dispensations. “Mafias and criminals do not have any political affiliation, their only interest is to earn money by hook or by crook,” he said, noting that 2019 had seen three hooch tragedies, all in the BJP-ruled states of Assam, UP and Uttarakhand, where 168, 97 and 30 people lost their lives, respectively. In 2016, 16 people had died in Janata Dal-ruled Bihar while in 2015, BJP-led Maharashtra had lost 102 lives to hooch in Mumbai and under the Trinamool Congress rule in West Bengal, as many as 167 people had died due to consumption of spurious liquor, he added, listing similar tragedies in other states. He urged the opposition parties to stop playing politics over the lives of innocent Punjabis. People do not care which party is ruling the state and all they want is justice, he said, adding that Punjab had also witnessed similar tragedies under the SAD-BJP regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooch-deaths-capt-talks-tough-says-guilty-will-not-be-spared/story-O72OQyiymvXV12bD0MZpWJ.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress chief to write to Sonia for strict action against ‘backstabbing’ MPs Partap Bajwa, Shamsher Dullo||Chandigarh: Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday said he will be writing to party president Sonia Gandhi to seek action against the brazen indiscipline of the two Rajya Sabha MPs Pratap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, who had chosen to attack their own government. The Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief extended his sympathies to the families of those who had lost their lives in the hooch tragedy but said such tragedies do not give licence to any individual to indulge in indiscipline. “It’s time to stem the rot and save the Congress from the petty machinations of the likes of Bajwa and Dullo, who had no shame in biting the hand that feeds them,” Jakhar said, adding “Ye jis thali mein khatey hain ussi mein chhed kartey hain.” He said he would seek strict action against the two MPs who were disgracefully exploiting a tragedy to further their own political ambitions and interests. Asserting that the actions of Bajwa and Dullo could not be tolerated any longer, Jakhar said: “Men like these who do not have even the courage to face elections, are no asset to the party. Such backstabbing members should be shown the door before they can cause any serious damage. Enough is enough. I’m going to clearly demand action against them from the party president.” Jakhar described the action of the two MPs, who had approached the governor on Monday to demand a CBI and enforcement department (ED) probe into the liquor deaths, as a manifestation of their desperate desire to grab power by hook or by crook. “How many times in all these years did they ask for expediting the CBI inquiry into the sacrilege cases (which has since been taken over by Punjab Police) or the ED probe into drugs, launched during the SAD-BJP government?” he asked. ‘ENGAGING IN ANTI-PARTY ACTIVITIES’Pointing out that Bajwa and Dullo had been engaging in such anti-party activities for quite some time by talking against their own party and targeting the Congress government in Punjab, Jakhar said their attacks had increased after Captain Amarinder Singh announced his decision to contest the 2022 elections. “Having probably seen the 2022 elections as their last chance to make it big in the corridors of power, the duo saw their hopes shattered and, out of sheer frustration, were knocking at all possible doors to sneak their way to the top echelons of power,” he added, citing rumours of the two MPs being in touch with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). TAKES SWIPE AT SACHIN PILOTJakhar described the attack of the two MPs on their own government as a ‘copy-paste job’ of what happened in Rajasthan in January, in the wake of 107 infant deaths over which Sachin Pilot had flayed his own government. “Had action been taken against Pilot then itself, what is happening today in Rajasthan could have been avoided,” he said, adding that he will bring to Sonia’s notice the dangers of letting Bajwa and Dullo get away with “their detestable act of expressing their dissent/concern not in the party or government forum but in public”. The PPCC president pointed out that the “two MPs are surviving politically only due to the largesse of the Congress high command, which had nominated them to the Rajya Sabha since they had run scared from contesting assembly and parliamentary elections”. He recalled that Rahul Gandhi had helped Bajwa by making him PCC president in the face of opposition, but his betrayal of Rahul’s and the party’s trust had exposed his petty political ambitions which he was bent on pursuing to the detriment of the Congress itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-congress-chief-to-write-to-sonia-for-strict-action-against-backstabbing-mps-partap-bajwa-shamsher-dullo/story-IidVuolC9CcgWjZQJjjPHM.html

It was his vision that the state’s agrarian economy, particularly horticulture sector, made rapid strides.”He said Dr Parmar was a multi-faceted personality who left indelible mark in the hearts of people of Himachal with his simplicity and down-to-earth approach. “It was his tireless efforts that Himachal became 18th state of the Indian Union,” he added.The CM said Dr Parmar stressed upon development of road infrastructure in the state and also promoted the cultivation of cash crops.“The initiatives taken by him has led Himachal to become a ₹5,000 crore fruit economy,” he added.Earlier, the CM paid floral tributes to Dr Parmar at the Vidhan Sabha Complex where he was joined by speaker and deputy speaker, leader of opposition, cabinet ministers, MLAs and former legislators.Speaking on the occasion, Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar said Dr Parmar apprised the then Union government that the developmental needs of the hill state were different from other states of the country.He said Dr Parmar laid special emphasis on construction of roads, power generation and giving boost to horticulture and agriculture sectors to ensure overall development of the state.Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said Dr Parmar shunned all luxuries of life and chose a path of struggle for maintaining separate identity of Himachal Pradesh. He said January 25, 1971 was indeed the red letter day in the annals of state as it was due to the efforts of Dr Parmar that Himachal Pradesh was granted statehood.He said the Land Reforms Act was one of the biggest contributions of Dr Parmar. A documentary on life of Dr YS Parmar produced by information and public relations department was also screened on the occasion.Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, agriculture minister Virender Kanwar, health minister Dr Rajiv Saizal, deputy speaker Vidhan Sabha Hansraj and several MLAs of both ruling and opposition were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-govt-committed-to-realise-dr-parmar-s-dream-of-developed-prosperous-himachal-cm/story-80hfOCSjnLFVlPerfoloiM.html

Vikram Kumar, Pune municipal commissioner, said, “Trials for centralised bed management system are going on at all the 15 ward office levels. It will help to avoid confusion and would have better coordination.” District collector Naval Kishor Ram said, “The impression had been created that the city would have less beds, but the situation is not that difficult. We are getting two to three complaints every week.”Shravan Hardkiar, commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “PCMC had completed trials in all the eight wards. Now municipal corporation and district administration would get immediate information of the critical and positive patients and they would allocate the beds to the patients.”Arrangements for students coming from rural partsMaharashtra Public Service Commission’s (MPSC) prelims examination is scheduled on September 13 in the city.

The most common comorbidities are diabetes, hypertension, obesity and kidney ailments.However, of the total 78.70 per cent of the deaths reported due to Covid-19, were from the above group. Despite low infectivity among the group, the case fatality rate is too high, say officials.Dr Bhagwan Pawar, the district health officer, said, “Maybe due to awareness among the public about the spread of the virus among people with comorbidities or above 50 years of age many people stayed indoors, so the infection rate among this population is less.”“But for such patients once infected, it is hard to recover,” he added.Dr Sanjay Dabhade, a member of Jan Aarogya Manch, said, “It is true that those with co-morbidities or in the vulnerable age group are seen to take more precaution and so the infectivity rate in this group is less. It could be that the so-called healthier population who are young or do not have any reported co-morbidities are acting as carriers of the virus and spreading it to their close contacts.”“It is also a global truth that the case fatality rate among those infected in this vulnerable group is high,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/those-above-55-years-and-with-comorbidities-comprise-78-of-total-covid-deaths-in-pune/story-UyiDJKPFoSvHlna1F44YFL.html

04-08-2020||Pune||Demand for rotational shifts after PMC teacher on Covid duty gets infected, dies||A 44-year-old music teacher and frontline Covid warrior died after being infected by Covid-19 on Sunday, prompting sharp reactions from teachers deputed on Covid duty. There are around 2,700 teachers in the city and adjoining rural areas working as Covid warriors conducting home to home surveys with safety gears like masks and gloves. Govind Bhilare worked as a Covid warrior for home-to-home surveys and contact tracing work in PMC jurisdiction for the past three months. This is the first death of a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) appointed teacher in the city who was on Covid duty, according to civic officials. Following Bhilare’s death, the Maharashtra state teachers association has demanded that PMC teachers should not be given Covid duties citing they are already overburdened with work. The teachers’ body said many of the PMC teachers are working in Covid teams and also taking online classes and additional school work. Bhilare, a Pakhwaj player, was working as a music teacher in PMC for the last 15 years and would go for classes to PMC schools in Katraj division on a rotational basis. He is survived by his wife, daughter, son and parents. He has played Pakhwaj with several prominent artists like Ustad Jhakir Hussain, Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi and many others at classical music programmes like the Sawai Gandharv, and also at some international music events. “Due to the mismanagement of the PMC, we have lost one of our best music teacher and a great artist from Pune city. He was working tirelessly for the society for the last three months as Covid warrior. He didn’t have any health issues prior to the Covid infection. A few days back, he tested positive and was admitted to the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and on August 2, he took his last breath while undergoing treatment. Until now, around 18 of our teachers performing Covid duties have tested positive for the infection and Bhilare is the first casualty among PMC teachers,” said Sachin Dimble, Pune division association head. On Monday, a four-member committee of primary teachers association, Pune division had a meeting with PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar about the duties issue. “For the 3 to 4 months 2,700 PMC teachers have been given duties of Covid related work. It includes right from swab testing of people, contact tracing, area surveys, disaster management works, and taking information about positive patients. In this, there is direct contact with Covid positive patients. The main thing which was disappointing for us was that duties were given throughout the three months without any rotational method. Today, we meth the PMC commissioner and demanded that all our teachers should be given rotational duties of 14 days according to the state government guidelines. We are ready to work for the Covid duties but in a rotational method. Physically, our teachers are exhausted now but due to the fear of losing their job they are performing Covid duties,” added Dimble. When the association representatives met PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar on Monday, they demanded to immediately change duties pattern to a rotational method. Kumar said, “Currently, due to a shortage in staff we cannot change allotted duties to teachers immediately but I will look into this issue personally and do the needful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/demand-for-rotational-shifts-after-pmc-teacher-on-covid-duty-gets-infected-dies/story-Sz1S8wZX7CXiLJV7R4WnMM.html

Earlier the dates were August 5, 8, 16, 17, 23, 24 and 31.The state government had on July 28 withdrawn the complete lockdown on August 2 and 9 paring down the number of lockdown days from nine to seven.Also Read: Lockdown dates change in Bengal for the fourth time since July 28The government order said the changes had been affected after receiving requests from different communities seeking relaxations on dates coinciding with festivals.The suspension of operations at Kolkata airport will impact several domestic flights that are already under stress due to curtailed domestic operations since resumption of flights on May 25 after two months of complete suspension due to nationwide lockdown in late March.The aviation minister had yesterday suggested that the situation was continuously improving.“Domestic operations continue to soar. 3rd August 2020, Day 72 till 23:59 hrs. Departures were 849. 78,155 passengers handled. Arrivals were 846. 77,558 passengers handled. Total movements were 1695. Footfalls at airports were 1,55,713. Total number of flyers was 78,155,” he tweeted.Also Read: Many gyms in Kolkata will open on August 6The lockdown dates in West Bengal have run into controversy since BJP has accused the TMC government of disrespecting sentiments of Hindu community by not lifting restrictions on August 5, when the ground breaking ceremony for construction of a grand Ram Temple will take place in Ayodhya.Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the decision for the lockdown on August 5 reflects the ruling party’s strategy to turn “West Bengal into Bangladesh”.He has demanded that the August 5 be dropped from the lockdown-days list like it was done for Eid festival on August 1.“We had no problem with the state government changing dates for the lockdown due to the Eid festival. Similarly the sentiment of the Hindus over the construction of Ram Mandir should not be ignored,” Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-airport-operations-will-be-suspended-for-7-days-in-august-due-to-bengal-lockdown/story-MwlAlr6H79oxXhrFycTLLK.html

04-08-2020||Kolkata||Many gyms in Kolkata will open on August 6||Many gyms in the city are conducting online demo sessions to tell their patrons about the safety measures in place before opening on August 6.The Centre has declared gyms, which are closed since March end, can open during unlock 3.0 phase from August 5 but the biweekly lockdown falling on that date in West Bengal, many gyms have decided to function from August six while others have preferred to wait a little more.The safety measures by the gyms include a self- declaration form by patrons that they have not been infected by C-Covid-19 virus.Core Gym’s Tuhin Bhattacharya told PTI on Tuesday that “self declaration form will have to be signed by each member which will be renewed every 15 days to know whether he/she have been exposed to Covid infected people.” This will be in addition to all the trainers and non- training staff wearing face masks all the time and keeping a minimum of 6 feet distance with members during workout.There can’t be any touching the members for support by the trainers during workout, Bhattacharya said.A limited number of people will be allowed to workout and divided into separate slots of 1 hour each, he said.Neeraj Surana of Rush Gym will, however, said he will wait for a few more days, preferably my mid-August to open his facility but only one floor for workouts.“From installing hand sanitizer dispenser, sanitizing after each slot and thermal checking of everyone, we will be taking all necessary protocol before opening so that once we open facilities there is no going back,” Surana said.Turning to the lockdown days, both recall how there was no income in that time while, “we had to pay electricity charges, salaries, and some other miscellaneous expenses like marketing, etc.” They said “economically it was like hell. But we felt more repressed as gyms and fitness centres play a vital role in building and developing immunity and a healthy lifestyle, which is the most crucial in fighting against COVID-19.” Both recall how the turnout in pre-covid times was good.“We were having our floor crowded at all the peak time when suddenly everything came to a pause mode. We expect the footfall to rise as we are receiving calls from our members as well as new admission enquiries. We feel people are frustrated by just sitting at home and watching their health declining,” Surana said.The gyms, however, don’t foresee any dramatic surge of members in the ensuing festive season as “purchasing power of people has come down drastically,” Bhattacharya said.

In the 10-hour downpour, 230 mm of rainfall was recorded in Mumbai. The Mithi river had swelled up in the morning because of the heavy rains and went above the prescribed danger mark of 27 meters. In the morning it had gone up to 34 meters and we had started to evacuate people in the low-lying slum areas. The water levels have come down to 24, so we have ceased evacuation for now,” Chahal told ANI. The Commissioner also said that over 163 pumps were being used to ease the inundation in different parts of the city. “In the saucer-shaped areas of the city like Hindmata, King’s Circle, Milan and Andheri Subway, we cannot use the pumps till the water levels reach a certain level. As soon as the water levels reached the limit, we started to clear it out with the pumps. We are currently using 163 pumps to clear out the rainwater in these low-lying areas,” he added.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) informed that between 8:30 am to 11:30 am on Tuesday, Colaba and Santacruz recorded 6 mm and 19 mm of rain respectively, while Thane recorded 16 mm. “Intense to very intense rainfall likely to continue in many parts of Mumbai during next 3 hours,” the IMD added.

04-08-2020||Ranchi||State’s unemployment rate drops to 8.8% in July||The state’s unemployment rate has dropped significantly to 8.8% in July compared to 21% in June, reflecting the improvement in employment prospects due to relaxations given during the two Unlock phases. With this, the unemployment rate has almost returned to that in the pre-lockdown period, according to the monthly data of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Jharkhand’s unemployment rate had shot up drastically after the nationwide lockdown came into effect from March 24 this year, when it increased from 8.2% to 47.1% in April due to the lockdown. In May, the state recorded the highest unemployment rate at 59.2%. However, the situation improved after Unlock-1 began from June 1, when the unemployment rate stood at 21.0%. It further dropped to 8.8% under Unlock-2 in July. State economists said Unlock activities have helped reduce the unemployment rate. However, the Kharif season has been the major rider, which gave a boost to economic activities just after beginning of Unlock activities. Renowned economist and director-in-chief of Centre of Fiscal Studies, Jharkhand, Harishwar Dayal said, “People’s participation increased in agriculture activities with the beginning of Kharif season. Besides, rural development works, including MGNREGA, and infrastructure development activities have generated a decent number of jobs.” State rural development minister Alamgir Alam recently said they have provided a record number of jobs under MGNREGA. Earlier, an average of three to 3.5 lakh workers used to get jobs under the scheme, which has now reached seven lakh, he said. Besides, a large number of people, including migrant workers, have also returned to agriculture activities. Interestingly, the unemployment rate dropped more in urban areas compared to rural areas. The unemployment rate in urban areas for the month stood at 5.6%, while it was recorded at 9.9% in rural areas. “Generally, migrant workers return to rural areas from urban areas during Kharif seasons to participate in agriculture activities. This is why unemployment rate is higher in rural areas,” Dayal said. Moreover, Jharkhand’s unemployment rate has improved as compared to Bihar and Chattisgarh. The unemployment rate in Bihar for the month stood at 12.2%, while it was registered at 9.0% in Chattisgarh. However, the state still lags behind West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, where the unemployment rates stood at 6.8%, 5.5% and 1.9%, respectively in July. Dayal said, “The data of CMIE is considered to be authentic, as they use scientific methodology in collecting the data.” Unemployment rate in Jharkhand Month Unemployment rate Urban Rural March 8.2 16.4 5.0 April 47.1 61.5 41.7 May 59.2 70.2 55.1 June 21.0 19.4 21.5 July 8.8 5.6 9.9 (Source: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) Website) EOM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/state-s-unemployment-rate-drops-to-8-8-in-july/story-YqJbWYzh0uczh0xKoXBLzO.html

04-08-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena says Covid-19 won’t deter Shah from posing a threat to Gehlot’s govt||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday took a dig at Union Home Minister Amit Shah stating that despite being infected with Covid-19 and staying in isolation he will continue posing a threat to the Rajasthan state government. “Corona has attacked Home Minister Shah and as a result, he had to go into isolation. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot should not get too happy over this. Wherever Shah is, he can continue his political operations from there only and, therefore, the danger on Gehlot government still persists,” an article in Saamna, the party mouthpiece, read.“The Home Minister went into isolation and Gehlot too had to take his MLAs into isolation means the danger still persists,” it added.Wishing Union Home Minister Amit Shah a speedy recovery from the infection, Sena said that his absence will be felt on August 5 during the ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.It also suggested that the whole Union Cabinet would have to be isolated as per Shah’s appeal to people who had met him.“It is true that the government followed social distancing but now Home Minister Shah has himself appealed to all those who came in contact with him to isolate themselves and get themselves tested for corona. If the Home Minister says so then all the Ministers in the Cabinet will have to be isolated,” the Shiv Sena said through an editorial published in party mouthpiece Saamna.It further said that Shah and multiple BJP Chief Ministers and Ministers in state governments, including Uttar Pradesh, testing positive for Covid-19 revealed a frightening picture of the pandemic in the country, and added the names of the priest and other functionaries of the Ram temple in the list.“It is being seen that Uttar Pradesh has become a big hotspot for corona and Ayodhya is no different. A senior Minister of the Uttar Pradesh government passed away due to corona on Sunday. Three other Ministers and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh are also in the grasp of the disease,” the editorial read.It further added that the Prime Minister laying the foundation stone for the Ram temple in Ayodhya tomorrow would be a sight worth remembering for all and said that the ceremony would mark the satisfactory end of the fight for the Ram temple started by senior leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, who would take part in the ceremony through video conferencing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-says-covid-19-won-t-deter-shah-from-posing-a-threat-to-gehlot-s-govt/story-y3ZPYKGqAr7kduJE0fZQLN.html

Khattar said Monday’s programme was initially to announce 10 colleges, but on the request of the minister of state for woman and child development, Kamlesh Dhanda, 11 colleges will be opened, including one in Rajod village of Kalayat constituency. “This is a special gift of Raksha Bandhan for the women of the state,” he said. The state government, Khattar said, aims to set up a college in every 10km radius. The chief minister said on the lines of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, every constituency from Panchkula to Nuh and Jagadhri to Dabwali has a college. He said at present, there are 161 government colleges in the state. “However, it is surprising that when the Congress was in power, not a single college was opened in Baroda constituency. Thus, two colleges have been announced for Baroda,” he added. Khattar said 50% seats will be reserved for women candidates in the upcoming panchayati raj elections. ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign made a difference and bore fruitful results with the cooperation of people, he said, adding that the gender ratio had currently reached 923, which was merely 871 earlier. Vidhan Sabha speaker Gian Chand Gupta also spoke on the occasion. Union minister of state for Jal Shakti, Rattan Lal Kataria, and education minister Kanwar Pal were among others present. New colleges will come up at Morni Hills (Panchkula), Isharwal (Bhiwani), Goriwala (Sirsa), Firozpur Jhirka (Nuh), Chhatar (Jind), Ladna Chaku and Rajaund (Kaithal), Pratap Nagar (Yamunanagar), Agroha (Hisar), Bhainswal Kalan and Baroda, both in Sonepat district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/11-new-colleges-for-women-to-come-up-in-haryana-khattar/story-qXBcFKpSMQUV06ubTT940L.html

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Diabetes emerges as single biggest comorbidity factor in Covid deaths||Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder in which blood sugar levels are abnormally high, has emerged as the single biggest comorbidity factor (an existing medical condition) in the deaths of patients infected with coronavirus in Haryana. About 62% of the total infected persons who died till August 2 in the state due to the virus had comorbidities. Data analysed by the health department on comorbidity factor in Covid-19 patients showed that about 8% of the 433 infected persons who succumbed to the viral illness till August 2 had diabetes. Statistics show that about 30% of the infected persons who died had multiple comorbidities. Dr Usha Gupta, director, health services, integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP), said that multiple comorbidities means that the patients had more than one existing medical condition such as hypertension and diabetes or renal function impairment which affected their conditions. “Patients with comorbidity are immunocompromised and their organs are also not in a good shape,” she said. While about 5% patients who died had an existing respiratory disease, 4% patients each had heart disease and high blood pressure, statistics reveal. About 3% of the dead had kidney disease, about 2% patients each had neurological disorder, cancer and liver disease and 1% were anaemic. The health department is investigating the comorbidities leading to the death of 5% Covid-19 infected persons. Head of the pulmonary and critical care medicine at PGIMS, Rohtak, professor Dhruva Chaudhary, said he gets extremely worried if a coronavirus infected person is pre-diabetic or diabetic. “Our experience is that a number of coronavirus infected patients admitted in hospitals have quite high levels of blood sugar. This is because either they have diabetes or pre-diabetes. Also, the stress of the Covid-19 infection in a patient can result in an adrenaline surge, thus increasing the blood sugar levels. The infection can also lead to fall in insulin level due to the steroids given to patients,” said Dr Chaudhary, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana. He said he would suspect the virus of doing mischief if the blood sugar levels were elevated in an infected person who otherwise had controlled blood sugar and was not being administered steroids. 4 northern districts get ‘critical’ tag Northern Haryana districts of Panchkula, Kurukshetra, Karnal and Panipat have also bagged the critical tag in the last fortnight for having more than 200 coronavirus active cases, a critical value as per the parameters recommended by the Union ministry of health. The total number of districts having more than 200 active cases is now 11. Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panchkula and Palwal have also got more than 15 active cases per lakh population in the last fortnight. As per the health department statistics, the total number of such districts is 13. While the sample positivity rate (confirmation rate) in Sonepat fell down to 5.8% last week, Panipat with a confirmation rate of 6.3% has earned the ‘critical value’ tag. The total number of districts having more than 6% confirmation rate are four. BoX: 10-day forecast Cumulative infections by Aug 13: About 45,600 Recovered patients by Aug 13: About 37,800 Active cases by Aug 13: About 7,700 New infections reported last week (July 27-Aug 2): 5,187 (Source: Health department, prediction as per average daily increase in cases)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/diabetes-emerges-as-single-biggest-comorbidity-factor-in-covid-deaths/story-4iruCHZKlcD0XmDGIGZGpJ.html
04-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Chasing the monsoon sights||It comes unexpected. Suddenly the grim, grey sky disappears to be replaced by a haze of deep shades of blue, with hints of pale red or pink.This is an extraordinary evening sight.Surprisingly, no masked shopper here on Khan Market’s front lane cares enough to look up at the phenomenon. (Not that there are as many people strutting around as in the BC — before coronavirus — era, but yet.)A masked parking attendant, sitting idly on a scooter at the market’s entrance, looks up after his attention is directed towards the surreal colours of the sky. He observes them for some time. Then he bows down his head, and murmurs, “Never seen anything like this.”It might be true for him, but Delhi sees these kind of skies every year during the monsoon months. In the day, the sky remains somewhat ordinary, cloaked in boring rain clouds. But as the evening unfolds, the sharp colours of the sunset (the sun being invisible all this while) often manages to break through the clouds, and drenches the air with hues of red, pink, orange and blue, so ethereal that it overwhelms the senses of the lucky few who manage to register this passing beauty.Just a little bit later, just a little bit farther, the reddish-blue heaven is behaving differently. At the Kasturba Gandhi Marg traffic intersection, the sky looks as sublime but more vulnerable too, for its multicoloured glow is being challenged by the brighter red of the traffic light. As the red turns to green, the canvas suddenly gets tainted, as if the painter had accidentally dropped a drip of green on it — or the Instagrammer used a greenish filter.Another evening, in an empty ground in Ghaziabad’s Vasundhara neighbourhood, a similar setting — colours and shades so beautiful and fragile that maybe, just by exhaling, you’ll chase them away. It has rained earlier in the afternoon and a large puddle—like a lake on the top of a volcanic mountain—had formed in a still-empty real estate. As the sun starts to go down somewhere in the unseen west, it bleaches a leftover cloud in smoky red. The cloud is reflected onto the monsoon puddle, which looks like a pit of frozen fire. It is a scene particular to the spot and couldn’t be replicated anywhere else. It has more beauty than it probably deserves, because one knows that this place is normally just another piece of dusty Ghaziabad. Soon afterwards, it becomes dark.In these times of coronavirus pandemic, it is difficult to freely go about town—and just forget about flying to a far away holiday. But looking up at the evening skies might give you a sense of escape—no matter where in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-chasing-the-monsoon-sights/story-yrNMBcaFH8Wkb9XOpPc4FM.html
04-08-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad suitcase murder: ‘Victim’ found alive||On July 27, the police in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad found a woman’s body stuffed in a suitcase. They shared photographs on social media as part of an identification drive. A man and his mother from Aligarh came forward. The elderly woman identified the victim as her 24-year-old daughter, Warisha, who goes by one name. They took the body to Aligarh, where the burial took place on July 29. Warisha’s husband and in-laws were booked for dowry death and sent to jail. A police team from Ghaziabad got a reward of ₹15,000 for successful tracking of the family. The case was shut. But there was a twist. A big one. On Monday, Warisha bumped into a police constable in Aligarh and narrated her story. Only then, the realisation dawned on the police. The woman in the suitcase was someone else; she is yet to be identified. “After the Ghaziabad police circulated the photographs of the body, Warisha’s family took notice and approached the police. Along with our officers, they went to Ghaziabad and identified the body...her husband and in-laws beat her up and harassed her for dowry; she fled their house on the afternoon of July 23,” Santosh Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bulandshahr, said. Warisha was married to one Amir Khan, a Bulandshahr resident, on June 1. Warisha came to Noida, where she earlier worked with an electrical equipment company, and stayed there for couple of days. She returned to Aligarh on Monday. The police said they will scrap the dowry death charge from the first information report (FIR). “...other sections will remain as the in-laws harassed her. Her husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law are in jail. We will inform the court about the development,” Singh said. In Ghaziabad, the police said the identification was done by Warisha’s family members and the body was handed over to them by medical officials, who conducted the autopsy. “...we will now register a case of murder and destruction of evidence, and probe the murder of the woman whose body was found in the suitcase,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, SSP Ghaziabad. “Our officials, however, got the viscera and the DNA of the deceased preserved...this will help us in tracing the identity of the woman whose body was found in the suitcase,” he added. Bulandshahr SSP Singh said the cause of death of the woman found in suitcase could not be ascertained in the autopsy. The police in Bulandshahr filed the FIR on July 28 against Warisha’s husband and her in-laws. They were booked for dowry death and cruelty, among other charges. The three were arrested on the same day and sent to 14 days’ judicial custody by a court in Bulandshahr.“...it will be up to the investigating officer of the Ghaziabad police to investigate and trace the identity of the woman who was actually killed. The body can be exhumed...we may take legal action against Warisha’s mother and brother for identifying a wrong body,” said Diksha Singh, circle officer (city), Bulandshahr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-suitcase-murder-victim-found-alive/story-Or83Xp4u93k2bWukxeIGxN.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn declares two micro-containment zones in Manimajra and Dhanas||The UT administration has declared a few houses in Pipliwala town in Manimajra and a residential block of the EWS Colony in Dhanas as micro containment zones.The decision was taken in the war room review meeting, chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator, here on Monday.UT adviser Manoj Parida, in his capacity as the chairman of the State Disaster Management Authority, designated six houses in Pipliwala town in Manimajra and the top floor of a block in EWS Colony, Dhanas, as containment zones.In view of the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in July, the UT administration had last week decided to demarcate micro containment zones and directed the Affected Area Committee to identify such areas. Under the policy, even three to four houses within a sector or colony can be designated as micro containment zones.CROWDING AT PGIMER DISCUSSEDDuring the meeting, officials of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) said that many patients from Punjab, Haryana and other neighboring states were coming into emergency wards, adding that if found positive, the patients were being accommodated at Nehru Hospital Extension.The officials requested the administrator to take up the issue of overcrowding at PGIMER with the neighbouring states, and added that those who could be treated locally should avoid coming to Chandigarh.The administrator advised the director of PGIMER to hold regular meetings with health directors of neighbouring states and stick to proper protocol in receiving patients from other states. The administrator then directed Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, health, to begin a dedicated dialysis facility for Covid patients. This, he added, will reduce the burden on PGIMER.Badnore asked the deputy commissioner, Mandip Singh Brar, to find additional facilities where Covid patients could be accommodated, as and when required. Badnore suggested that community halls located away from residential areas could be utilised for the purpose.Meanwhile, KK Yadav, MC commissioner, said they had started a large-scale sanitisation campaign in the city to prevent the outbreak of vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue. He also stated that the quality of water in various tubewells was being checked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-declares-two-micro-containment-zones-in-manimajra-and-dhanas/story-EKW3dzKI1PhhRNLCsjdfII.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Hooch Tragedy: Congress MPs Bajwa, Dullo target Capt govt; seek CBI, ED probes||In a joint offensive against the Capt Amarinder Singh government after Punjab’s worst hooch tragedy, Congress MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo on Monday demanded an “impartial and thorough” probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate into the illegal liquor business in the state. Bajwa and Dullo, both former presidents of Punjab Congress, met Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore and alleged “clear-cut failure” on the part of the state administration and claimed the tragedy could have been averted had the chief minister acted in time on their complaints about illegal liquor businesses. “Had CM acted in time, the hooch tragedy would not have taken place.... We have been highlighting this issue since 2017,” Dullo said, adding that it was the responsibility of the state government to act tough against liquor smugglers. The two Rajya Sabha MPs requested the government to send a recommendation to the Centre for inquiry by the two central agencies into the production and distribution of illegal liquor in the state. “We had initially requested for an inquiry by a judge of the high court but now evidently a much deeper investigation is needed by a central investigative agency,” they wrote in a four-page letter to the governor, expressing lack of confidence in officers of the state departments. The two leaders said they would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and, thereafter, take up the issue with the prime minister and the Union home minister. “We will also raise the issue of deaths of people in Parliament,” said Bajwa. The two MPs said they had written letters to the chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh) as well as spoken publicly about the loss to the public exchequer due to smuggling of liquor by licensed distilleries, functioning of illegal distilleries, and production of spurious liquor and sought action against the people guilty of committing these offences but no action was taken against the real culprits till date. “The losses in revenue generation caused due to the smuggling of liquor are to the tune of ₹2,700 crore. This could not have been done without the consent/connivance of bureaucrats including police, excise officials and politicians in power,” they wrote.

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Fate of Sector-53 general housing scheme to be decided by Chandigarh Housing Board on August 6||The final decision on the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) general housing scheme, Sector 53—whether to scrap it or float a revised scheme—will be taken at the board of directors’ meeting scheduled for August 6.The development comes after the UT urban planning department rejected the board’s request for allowing an increased floor area ratio (FAR) in the scheme. With CHB struggling to attract buyers owing to high pricing, the board had hoped that the increased FAR would help reduce the price. Twice had the CHB proposed to the urban planning department to increase the FAR.The department, however, had contended that increasing the FAR for CHB’s general housing scheme could set a bad precedent for other housing schemes. Also, increasing the FAR at such a late stage when all the approvals for the project had been finalised would waste all the earlier work, the department added.Due to a poor response from the public, the CHB in March this year had decided to refund the processing fee of all applicants and planned the scheme afresh in order to make it more attractive.Only 178 applications were received against the 492 flats on offer in March this year. The scheme offered 3HK flats for as high as ₹1.8 crore, 2BHK flats for ₹1.5 crore and 1BHK flats for ₹95 lakh. The CHB had slashed the proposed rates by 15% to attract more buyers but it did not work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fate-of-sector-53-general-housing-scheme-to-be-decided-by-chandigarh-housing-board-on-august-6/story-KBolUcm2UZT4nWhnN7uFgP.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown hit more workers from lower castes, reveals study by university in Haryana||The lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 has affected employment prospects of workers from lower castes more unfavourably than those from upper castes, according to a study by Ashoka University, Haryana. Released on Friday, the paper, titled “Is COVID-19 ‘The Great Leveller’? The Critical Role of Social Identity in Lockdown- induced Job Losses”, analyses the drop in employment for workers from communities ranked low in the caste hierarchy – scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), and other backward castes (OBC). The study uses data of skilled and unskilled labour from across India, gathered by the independent think tank, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. The researchers found that compared to workers from upper castes, the probability of job loss was three times higher for those who are SC and two times higher for OBC workers. “We have tried to understand the effect of the pandemic on the employment situation of lower caste workers in relation to upper caste workers. We have compared employment data over December 2018 and April 2020,” said Ashwini Deshpande, professor of Economics at Ashoka University, who co-authored the study with Rajesh Ramachandran from the department of microeconomics and management at Goethe University in Germany. The proportion of employed persons in all caste groups remained fairly stable from August 2018 to December 2019. However, between December 2019 and April 2020, there was a steep fall in employment of all caste groups, indicating that the lockdown had affected employment of workers across all castes, but in varying degrees. In December 2019, 39% of upper caste workers were employed and by April 2020, the percentage had dropped to 32%. The fall was more pronounced for SC workers, 44% of whom were employed in December 2019, but only 24% were employed in April 2020. For OBCs and STs the fall was from 40% to 26% and 48% to 33%, respectively. Ajit Ranade, Mumbai-based economist and political analyst, who was not a part of the study, said the findings were important as they show the impact of the pandemic through the lens of caste. “Researchers find that there is a difference between upper caste and lower caste, especially the scheduled caste, in terms of the severity of the negative impact on employment. The upper castes are endowed with higher human capital, i.e. educational achievement, and are in jobs less vulnerable to pandemic disruption. What is surprising is that the impact on scheduled caste is three times worse. Not only has the pandemic exposed the pre-existing inequities but has amplified them. Hence relief and welfare measures have to pay extra attention and compensate for this unequal impact across caste divisions,” said Ranade. The study also found education emerged as a key element in job security. The researchers mapped the share of individuals with 12 or more years of completed schooling and the proportion holding daily wage or casual jobs (jobs contracted on a daily basis). “The share of individuals with more than 12 years of schooling is 37% for upper castes and 17% for SCs. It shows that stigmatised caste groups are also disproportionately more likely to hold daily wage jobs, which provide no job security or tenure,” said the paper. While only 3% of daily wage earners are from upper castes, 16% are from SCs. The researchers also found that stigmatised groups with lower levels of education were further impacted by differences in the type of employment contracts they were given. “However, while caste differences are minimised among the better-off workers [those with more than 12 years of schooling and those without daily wage jobs], they are not completely eliminated,” said Deshpande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-hit-more-workers-from-lower-castes-reveals-study-by-university-in-haryana/story-wkIfltjnSCQv8p0vE01XAP.html

04-08-2020||City||Amid Covid-19 outbreak, Sewri TB Hospital in Mumbai sees drop in patients visiting OPD||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of tuberculosis patients visiting the outpatient department (OPD) at Sewri TB Hospital, the largest TB facility in India, dropped to 562 in July, from 1,418 in January. The number of admitted patients, too, dropped to 216 last month, from 493 patients in January. Every year, on an average, over 5,000 people die of TB in Mumbai, according to the civic body’s data. Similar to Covid-19, TB affects the lungs, is highly infectious and spreads when an individual with active disease coughs or sneezes and expelled droplets that contain TB bacteria are inhaled by another person. With every undiagnosed case, the chance of spread increases. Despite the severity, detection of new cases has drastically reduced since March, when the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Mumbai, claim activists, adding all efforts are directed towards containing Covid-19. Doctors, however, said TB cases have declined due to social distancing norms. Activists alleged inaccessibility of drugs and lack of transportation to reach the hospital prevent many patients from following-up. They said irregular treatment can lead to a spike in TB cases post the pandemic. “Patients with drug-resistant TB suffer the most. These patients need to take injections regularly. Sometimes either drugs aren’t available or medicos aren’t available to administer it,” said Ganesh Acharya, a TB activist. “One can’t expect all TB patients to travel in a bus to reach a hospital. Trains are running only for government employees and essential service staff. If patients lose out on their medicines, they not only fall behind their regime, but also develop further health complications.” Poornima Nair, director (health) at a non-government organisation, Apnalaya in Govandi, which is home to the highest number of drug-resistant TB cases, said, “There are possibilities that many individuals with active Mycobacterium (the bacteria that causes TB) may go unidentified as they aren’t visiting hospitals for check-ups. NGOs along with the civic bodies are trying to give the drugs at their doorstep.” Doctors give other reasons. “Due to Covid-19, people are taking all kinds of precautions like wearing masks and maintaining social distance. How will new people get infected with the bacteria of TB,” asked Dr Deepak Baid, president, Association of Medical Consultants, who works at the Covid ward of Rajawadi Hospital. A senior health officer from BMC on condition of anonymity said, “Through anganwadi and social workers, we are following up with patients daily. Instead of providing dosage for one month, we have given drugs for two months, so patients don’t have to visit health centres often.” Dr Salil Bendre, head, pulmonary medicine, Nanavati Hospital, said despite restrictions during the lockdown, patients have been allowed to visit hospitals for treatment. “Even though many hospitals are being converted into dedicated Covid hospitals, there are several other medicine centres where TB patients are being treated. It would be wrong to say that TB treatment has been affected due to Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-19-outbreak-sewri-tb-hospital-in-mumbai-sees-drop-in-patients-visiting-opd/story-M6EVf0nlD96BhA0ASFNyCP.html

I was missing my sister a lot and had just finished speaking to her over the phone, as we cannot celebrate Raksha Bandhan this year. The gesture made by the medical staff was so overwhelming for most of the patients,” said a 33-year-old patient. Similar scenes were witnessed at the Tata Amantra and Sai Nirvana Covid-19 facilities. “The patients might be missing the celebrations with their sisters and so we decided to help on this special occasion. The medical staff are the real protectors actually. Such celebrations make festivals meaningful,” said Madhavi Pophale, public relations officer, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC). In another similar gesture, Sanskriti Patil, 13, sent a rakhi with a thank you note to Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) commissioner Raja Dayanidhi to express her gratitude to the civic chief and his team for their fight against the outbreak. “During lockdown, Sanskriti’s school gave her several activities and one of them was to send rakhis to Covid-19 warriors. She decided to send one rakhi to the person who heads the city and manages all the teams. She also sent three more rakhis to a police officer, a health officer and a bus depot manager in our area,” said Rajendra Patil, 39, the father of the Class 7 student. UMC public relations officer, Yuvraj Badhane said that the civic commissioner was overwhelmed when he received the rakhi and the thank you note. “He in return also sent a note thanking the child for the motivational gesture,” said Badhane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/medical-staffers-in-kalyan-dombivli-covid-centres-tie-rakhis-to-patients/story-Y29GvlNjSajXWMBPZcEZrK.html

Despite repeated attempts, the hospital did not respond to HT’s calls or messages. “An audit conducted by the civic body’s committee found that the hospital did not follow the directions by the state government on charging Covid-19 patients. The committee acquired all the bills and documents from the hospital since July 7 and on studying them discovered the hospital overcharged the patients. Hence, the civic body chief served a show-cause notice to the facility,” said Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC. The hospital needs to respond to the notice in seven days, citing an explanation for the alleged overcharging of bills or face legal action under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897; the Disaster Management Act, 2005; the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance (Amendment) Act, 2011, and the Mumbai Nursing Home (Amendment) Act. “If the hospital fails to respond, the civic body will initiate legal action against it for not following the state’s directions on treatment of Covid-19 patients,” said Badhane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ulhasnagar-civic-body-acts-against-private-covid-hospital-for-overcharging-36-lakh-from-82-patients/story-KpCcYrRHNk8JgNfYCrtxJO.html

Currently, the hospital, which operates as a Covid-19 facility, collects the swab samples and sends them to government-run hospitals in the city for testing. Recently, Western Railway (WR) had manufactured swab sample collection kiosks at the facility. The kiosks were manufactured at the railways’ Lower Parel workshop to help healthcare workers collect the swab samples without exposing themselves to the virus. In its fight against Covid-19, the railways had also manufactured intubation boxes, which act as a shield between patients and doctors, thereby limiting the doctor from virus exposure while intubating a patient. The railways has also installed vending machines for masks, sanitisers and gloves for passengers at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) and Dadar station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/railway-hospital-in-mumbai-to-get-covid-19-testing-lab-in-november/story-444Z6GtQsHZcAvkWQIpXmL.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||From Wednesday, Mumbaiites can buy liquor from shops||Four days after the state government eased some more restrictions in the ongoing lockdown, civic commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday issued a circular permitting market complexes and shopping malls in the city to remain open between 9am and 7pm from Wednesday.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also scrapped the odd-even rule meant for shops selling non-essential, and permitted them to remain open on all days. The civic body, which earlier only permitted home delivery of liquor, allowed its over-the-counter sale from Wednesday.“It is directed that the liquor shops are allowed to remain open for sale across the counter but shall strictly adhere to national directives of Covid-19 for safe distancing and covering of masks mentioned. It is further directed that all shops shall remain open on all days on all sides of the road irrespective of the even and odd days rule,” the circular stated.However, the civic body said citizens cannot travel far to buy non-essential items or in the case of non-emergencies.Stating that around five million people employed in the modern retail sector would suffer if the state delays reopening of malls, the Shopping Centres’ Association of India (SCAI) urged the Maharashtra government to take concrete steps to ensure their urgent reopening. Maharashtra has more than 75 malls of which 50% are located in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, while 20% is in Pune, and the rest in Amravati, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Nashik and Nagpur.However, the theatres and restaurants inside city malls will remain closed. “Malls and market complexes will be operational from 9am to 7pm with effect from 5th August, 2020, without theatres, food courts / restaurants. However, the kitchen of restaurant and food courts will be allowed to operate in malls, wherein only home delivery through aggregators will be allowed,” the circular stated.The circular also permits e-commerce companies to deliver all types of goods and private offices to function with 10% attendance. As per the new rules, garages can remain open but clients can visit only after taking prior appointments. The circular also stated that self-employed people such as plumbers, electricians, pest-control companies and technicians can work commence their work.The civic body also allowed venues for non-team sports such as golf courses, firing ranges, gymnastics, tennis and badminton courts to operate from Wednesday but owners and visitors must ensure that sanitation measures and social distancing norms are maintained.However, gyms in the city will remain closed.Viren Shah, president of Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association (FRTWA), welcomed the civic body’s decision. “It was not practical for us to follow the alternate-day rule as we need to pay wages to our workers and rent to landlords. We have been requesting the authorities to permit shops to operate on all days from the past 20 days. We would like to thank the civic body and the Maharashtra government for allowing it now. More than 3 lakh shop owners in Mumbai can now heave a sigh of relief as they can remain open on all days. We have asked all the shops to ensure social distancing and follow sanitisation and other precautionary measures in shops,” said Shah.The circular was issued as part of the state government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative that envisages phase-wise relaxations to the lockdown. Like the state, the city will also be under lockdown till August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-wednesday-mumbaiites-can-buy-liquor-from-shops/story-0wz2pqraEgkbPP3BgQswGN.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Residents’ body demands separate wards for rural and urban Manimajra||The resident welfare association (RWA) of the Modern Housing Complex (MHC) in Sector 13 (Manimajra) has written to the UT adviser asking that ward number 25 be split into two separate parts with the rural part of Manimajra in one and the urban part in the other.Speaking about this, president of the RWA Colonel (retd) Gursewak Singh said, “The existing ward 25 comprises, on the one hand, the bulk of rural area, and on the other, the new urban modern colonies of MHC, Rajeev Vihar and Uppal Marble Arch. Civic amenities and need-based development of these residential areas are and would be basically different from those of the old, rural areas and these entities must be clubbed together to form a new ward in Sector 13.”Colonel Gursewak added that without the bifurcation, many development works including construction of bus shelters and e-sampark centres had been delayed for more than three years.General secretary of the RWA, SA Qureshi, said all the past municipal corporation (MC) councillors including the current one from their ward were from Manimajra village, so it was seen that the urban parts of Manimajra were being neglected as compared to Manimajra village.The RWA is asking that a separate urban ward be made of Manimajra pockets 1 to 6, comprising urban residential colonies like MHC, Rajeev Vihar, Uppal Marble Arch, Shivalik Enclave, NAC and adjoining residential colonies.On the other hand, MC councillor Jagtar Singh Jagga said, “True, we have a big ward, but most development work is being done for the urban areas only. They have the best water supply and working lights. They have recently gotten a railway under bridge (RUB) installed. Meanwhile, the village paints a contrasting picture and I have been working towards solving the problems of the village residents as well.”In 2019, the MHC RWA had written to the UT administration for the renaming of Manimajra as Sector 13. The suggestion was first floated on the occasion of Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary, citing the auspiciousness of the number 13. It was following their letters that the area was renamed Sector 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-body-demands-separate-wards-for-rural-and-urban-manimajra/story-up3H8EooDIzUAYnMOGMojL.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Rajput suicide: CM supports Mumbai Police||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh are determined to not hand over the investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) despite mounting pressure. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised the state government for its handling of the case, there is division within the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance with Congress leaders favouring the transfer of the case to CBI and Shiv Sena supporting Mumbai Police’s investigation. Thackeray held a high level meeting with police officers on Sunday evening, in which he was briefed on the progress made by Mumbai Police in its investigation. Thackeray was reportedly satisfied with how the probe into the actor’s suicide is being handled. Deshmukh, who has previously said there is no need to hand the case over to CBI, on Monday morning said, “Mumbai Police is investigating the case professionally.” Following rumours and allegations on social media that claimed a state minister is implicated in the case, the state government has decided to take action against those attempting to defame the government. “Through social media and a section of media, it is being repeatedly projected that the son of a minister had attended the party at Sushant’s residence a day before he died. It’s false propaganda to transfer the case to the central agency. We have decided to take a serious note of and action against it,” said a state government official who was at the meeting. Some in the bureaucracy and the state Cabinet feel the Maharashtra government has struggled to tackle how the episode has been politicised by the Opposition. “Right from a case in Patna to a strategic movement of creating suspicion about involvement of a Maharashtra minister, it was a well thought out strategy by the Opposition. Instead of giving a fitting reply, the government seems to have fallen prey to it. We could not even take advantage of the doubtful integrity of the director general of Bihar Police who has been blaming Mumbai and Maharashtra Police. Goof ups at the local level by stamping the Bihar Police officer with a quarantine mark has further damaged our image. Our opinion is that the case should be handed over to CBI as it appears to be just a suicide with no foul play involved,” said a senior Congress leader requesting anonymity. After Vinay Tiwari of Patna City police was quarantined by BMC on Sunday, former chief minister of Maharashtra and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis had questioned why Tiwari had been singled out for quarantine and described the state government’s decisions regarding the investigation into Rajput’s death as “really strange”. BJP leader Ram Kadam has questioned if the state government was trying to “hush up” certain incidents and referred to a conspiracy theory that Mumbai Police has since debunked, which claimed a state minister had attended a party at the residence of Rajput’s former manager Disha Salian, who died by suicide on June 8. Mumbai Police has said there is no evidence to connect Salian and Rajput’s deaths. On Monday, the commissioner of Mumbai Police said in a press conference that Bihar Police has no jurisdiction over Rajput’s suicide case, but senior officials in the home department speculated that the Centre could take over the case using the first information report (FIR) filed in Patna. “Mumbai Police has not filed any FIR so far as they have not found any substance to convert the accidental death report into an FIR. Patna Police has already filed an FIR and it can be handed over to the CBI for which Maharashtra government’s consent is not required. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has already expressed his willingness for the transfer. The hearing in the Supreme Court on Wednesday now bears great significance, but it will paint Maharashtra and Mumbai Police in poor light,” said an official. The Supreme Court will hear actor Rhea Chakraborty’s plea to transfer the FIR lodged against her in the case of Rajput’s suicide from Patna to Mumbai, today. Police officer turned lawyer YP Singh said, “Without state consent or an order from the Apex or high court, the transfer cannot take place. If Mumbai Police has not lodged an FIR, it is right on its part as it may not have found adequate evidence against anybody.” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant accused the BJP of defaming Mumbai Police. “Maharashtra BJP leaders, on the orders of their high command, are defaming our police. Director general of police of Bihar is at the forefront in the attempt. The DGP is facing serious charges in a case, which was being investigated by the CBI. The officer wanted to contest election as a BJP candidate in the past,” he said. Sawant also questioned why Rajput’s father had not registered a complaint with Mumbai Police. In their signed statements, none of Rajput’s family members, including his father, had mentioned any suspicion of foul play, said Mumbai Police. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday also came out in support of Mumbai Police. “If Mumbai Police is already investigating the case, anyone not related to the Maharashtra government and not related to the case should not comment on it as Mumbai Police is capable of conducting the probe on its own,” Raut said. He said anyone claiming the police investigation was compromised because a state minister was involved in the case should come forward. “They should openly name the person. Saying such baseless things is not even politics, I think. People know everything. This should be stopped immediately. Mumbai Police should be allowed to carry on with its work,” he said. Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant on Monday alleged Bihar Police officers had used luxury cars owned by BJP office bearers while in Mumbai. Speaking to ANI, Sawant said, “Whose vehicles were those? The BMW belonged to a BJP office bearer. If Bihar Police travels in it, you can understand the politics.” Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The post mortem declared he had died by suicide. A police investigation into the circumstances of his death is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rajput-suicide-cm-supports-mumbai-police/story-WRJVHRMs6RywdJ7zgNY1JN.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||No hawkers in Maharashtra as of now: State reiterates its stand before HC||The Maharashtra government has reiterated its stand before the Bombay high court that it cannot allow street vendors to resume their businesses as of now.In an affidavit filed in HC, the state government has stated that there is no occasion even to consider allowing street vendors and hawkers to resume business in containment zones and areas where lockdown will continue to be imposed.As of now, they will also not be allowed to resume businesses in other areas outside lockdown areas and containment zones. “This is particularly because, these sectors (street vending and hawking) fall under unorganised sectors and it is very difficult, if any and if at all, imposed for conducting such businesses,” said the affidavit filed by Kishor Nimbalkar, secretary, disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department.Huge manpower including police and civic staff will be required to ensure compliance of guidelines issued for the conduct of these businesses and but the ground reality is that all these agencies are over-burdened and already exhausted, it added.The affidavit is filed in reply to public interest litigation filed by activist Manoj Oswal, for a declaration that the imposition of a complete ban on the sale of products or food by street vendors to be illegal or unconstitutional and violative of the rights of the people to conduct legitimate business.In his petition filed through advocate Ashish Verma, the 43-year-old activist from Pune said the nationwide lockdown has led to serious issues for the survival of the large population, including street vendors and traders who own very small informal shops and vends and the only possible relief for them was that they were allowed to conduct their daily business with reasonable restrictions. Oswal has termed the state’s stand as “extremely high handed and insensitive.”“The assumption that the street vendors can cause more Covid-19 infections than the store or shop owners is not supported by science or findings by any research,” said his rejoinder. “Merely because these people are poor, they are being treated as more infectious and responsible for causing infections. This is a clear prejudice and nothing else,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-hawkers-in-maharashtra-as-of-now-state-reiterates-its-stand-before-hc/story-25VfSgGKoHwf76PMtVoyAO.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||KYC fraud: Senior citizen duped of ₹3.18 lakh||Borivli police have booked an unknown person for duping a 67-year-old senior citizen of ₹3.18 lakh. The accused posed as an executive from a popular eWallet service provider and under the pretext of updating the KYC (know your customer) details, tricked the old person into sharing his banking details, including the OTPs (one-time Passwords). The accused then fraudulently transferred money in the desired bank account.According to the Borivli police, the complainant is a retired government employee and resides in Borivli (West). On Sunday morning he received a call from an executive who identified himself as Abhishekh Choudhary. He told the victim that he will no longer be able to use the eWallet service as his KYC details were not updated.“He told the complainant that he needed to pay a fee of ₹10 if he wants to update the KYC detail. The old person paid ₹10 four times as per the instructions of Choudhary and also shared OTPs with him” said an officer from the Borivli police station. When the accused (Choudhary) asked the complainant his debit card details, he sensed something wrong and disconnected the phone call, states the FIR.The complainant immediately checked the balance in his bank account and discovered that ₹3,17,800 is missing from his account. The complainant approached police and registered an FIR against Choudhary.The police have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code and 66d (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of Information Technology Act against an unknown accused.The police have begun an investigation and are in the process of obtaining details of the unauthorized transactions from the bank and the eWallet service provider.The state cyber police recently issued an advisory about how such frauds are being done regularly and have also given following tips to citizens to prevent themselves from such frauds.- Do not to believe the messages or calls that ask you to update KYC documents.- KYC is only done face-to-face at authorised centres, and not via phone or SMS.- Never share OTPs with anyone, not even with the bank executives. No bank ask for OTPs from its customers- While doing every transaction on eWallet or UPI platforms always carefully read the message before making the transaction. Fraudsters trick you into clicking some options for fraudulent transactions by distracting your attention.- Avoid making your phone number public on social media sites.- Always use genuine software on your smartphones.- If you ever come across a suspicious message take your time to think and never click the links given in such text messages.- Do not share bank account credentials on Google view forms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kyc-fraud-senior-citizen-duped-of-3-18-lakh/story-KNel0cRRSypkzKPZYqbbdP.html

Suraj Pandey, a 21-year-old pharmacy student, spotted the dehydrated and tired bird which was being attacked by crows, and rescued it. Pandey informed forest department officials who took custody of the bird. The brown booby is now being treated at Transit Wildlife Rescue Centre,Shilphata in Kalyan which is run by the forest department, and will be released in the Arabian Sea when the bird is in a better shape to fly, said Namrata Pawar, range forest officer, Virar.Brown booby or Sula leucogaster (scientific name) is a large seabird of the booby family, Sulidae, and is found on the islands and coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in Australia and the United States, said Pandey who also rescues snakes.Brown booby birds frequent breeding grounds of the islands in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and nest in large colonies, said Bhushan Bhoir, zoology professor at Sonopant Dandekar Shikshan Mandali, popularly known as SDSM College, Palghar. Bhoir added that the bird, which eats only small fish or squid, may have flown from Australia to Kerala or Karnataka in search of food and ended up in Palghar. He also added that there’s a chance that the bird might have lost direction. “The bird could have been tired from flying as it can fly only when there is high wind speed due to its aerodynamic wings,” said Bhoir adding that the bird floats on the water when it gets tired.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/21-year-old-pharmacy-student-rescues-rare-seabird/story-oGHvrSgJ24ZPoWW8IEYtjL.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Virar-Alibag corridor: ‘Reconsider its alignment to save mangroves’||The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has asked authorities to reconsider the Virar-Alibag multi-modal corridor alignment to minimise the cutting and destruction of mangroves. The proposal was deferred in a meeting held on July 7, 2020, stating that MCZMA requires a detailed survey of “quantification of mangroves” to be affected owing to the alignment.In the meantime, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which was handling the project until recently, said that it is in the process of handing over the project to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). AB Gaikwad, chief engineer, MSRDC said, “Since MSRDC is already looking at constructing the Konkan Expressway and the Samruddhi corridor, it was considered apt to take over the project for integrated planning. However, since the handover is still under process, we cannot comment on the (MCZMA) decision as of now.” BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “MCZMA has asked to look at an alternate alignment between Chirner to Balavali only. The decision to hand over the project to MSRDC was taken in an authority meeting held in July and is under process.”MSRDC, on the other hand, said it is too early to comment on the alignment.Anil Diggikar, chairman of MCZMA, in an earlier interaction with HT had confirmed that clearance for the multimodal corridor has been deferred. The project is pending a go-ahead from MCZMA since 2018. As per MMRDA’s submission in 2019, the project is passing through mangroves and its 50-meter buffer zone, which is around 19.95 hectares.MCZMA had asked the state mangrove cell to conduct a site visit to assess the damage in 2019. The cell, which visited 5 villages, in its report to MCZMA stated that it is necessary “to determine exact affected mangrove area and clearance under Forest Conservation Act, 1980 needs to be obtained.” It’s report states that mangroves will be affected in the villages of Rave, Dighati, Vidhane, Dighode and Koper.MCMZA’s minutes of the meeting state that it also passes through the greenfield areas under the City Industrial and Development Corporation’s ambit. The minutes further reveal that the project will pass through 3.68 lakh square meters of CRZ area.MMRDA was looking at commissioning the project in two phases - Phase I - 80km stretch from Navghar to Chirner (near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust - JNPT), Phase IA - 18km stretch from Chirner to Balavali and Phase-II - 28km stretch from Balavali to Alibag. The corridor will be an eight-lane stretch with separate lanes for metro and bus rapid transit system. The authority has been seeking coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance for Phase IA.One of Maharashtra government’s most ambitious projects, the 126-km corridor, will pass through emerging nodes of Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Panvel and Pen. It will have 13 interchanges, 48 underpasses and 41 bridges. The access-control highway is also expected to have a metro on its central median. MMRDA had got administrative approval for its construction cost at ₹19,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/virar-alibag-corridor-reconsider-its-alignment-to-save-mangroves/story-CJaHcJsYOncmf8fWqqsOJK.html
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Day 1: Online classes in Panjab University on to low-key start||Teaching and learning at Panjab University went online on Monday, but the varsity met with a mixed response as participation remained low key on the first day.As per the new academic calendar of the university, the first term of the next session will end on November 28 and the semester examinations will be conducted from December 2 onwards for 20 days.Many students said no classes were held for them on Day 1 and others said they hadn’t even received the time table yet. The teaching process was not seamless in many departments and classes were marred by technical glitches. In many departments, classes were held late in the morning due to Raksha Bandhan.A student of the English department seeking anonymity said, “We were provided a WebEx link, but due to technical glitches our class was not held on Monday.”The Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) had earlier sought that teachers be allowed to conduct online classes from home as well. Professor Navdeep Goyal, who is heading a special panel of the university, said, “We are getting many queries and we may decide to allow teachers to conduct online classes from home in the coming days.”PU’s dean of university instructions (DUI) RK Singla said, “We are approving the time table of many departments. We are working at a good pace and it will take a few days to streamline the online teaching process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/day-1-online-classes-in-panjab-university-on-to-low-key-start/story-mJx7aj0D78Kkc6jqUrKLNP.html

04-08-2020||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: 65K students get their forms verified in 2 days||Around 65,000 students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) got their forms verified on the online portal for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions while more than 2 lakh students could successfully register themselves until Monday evening, two days since the portal was launched on August 1. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown, the entire admission process is online. After students submit the part 1 of their admission forms, these forms have to be verified online either by their respective schools or the guidance centres appointed by the education department. While students said that the overall process of registration and form filling was smooth, some reported issues with the payment gateway. “We could fill the form in 15 minutes but it took almost an entire day to make the payment. The gateway would show failed payment attempts again and again. This is one thing that needs to be fixed,” said a parent of a student who has registered on the portal. An official from the education department said the payment issue only existed for a brief period on the first day and has been resolved since. “Parents should wait in case the gateway shows failed payment. If an excess amount is deducted, the payment gateway would reverse the amount to the account within 3 working days,” a notice put up on the admission website stated. The education department is yet to put up a schedule for filling part 2 of the form, which consists of students’ marks and college preferences. KC College offers seat to juice seller’s daughter Asma Salim Shaikh, whose father sells lime juice near Azad Maidan and who had cleared her Class 10 exam with 40% marks, has been promised a seat in Churchgate’s KC College. Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, said, “We are very proud of Asma’s achievement and have offered to take her in our college through the management quota. We have helped such needy students even in the past and it is good to see their happiness after getting to be in the college. She will complete the due process of online admission and would then be allotted a seat.” On Monday, Congress leader Milind Deora, who had earlier shared Asma’s achievement on his Twitter handle, congratulated her for being assured a seat at KC college. “Delighted that Asma has secured the option to study at Mumbai’s prestigious KC College”, he tweeted. Asma said she would fill up the online form for FYJC admissions and put KC College as her preference. “I want to pursue Arts and I am happy that such a big college is willing to take me,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admissions-65k-students-get-their-forms-verified-in-2-days/story-ibtoXtvxSHjKFqfqGMMl5M.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Row erupts over Bihar cop being quarantined||After facing allegations of forcing Bihar Police officer Vinay Tiwari into quarantine, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) clarified on Monday that it has guided Tiwari to file an exemption. On Sunday, when Tiwari reached Mumbai to investigate a case filed in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, Bihar’s director general of police Gupteshwar Pandey had alleged BMC had forced Tiwari into quarantine and that Tiwari had been denied accommodation. Pandey tweeted, “IPS officer Binay Tiwari reached Mumbai today from Patna on official duty to lead the police team there but he has been forcibly quarantined by BMC officials at 11pm today. He was not provided accommodation in the IPS Mess despite request...”. However, BMC in its statement clarified that its team had been following standard guidelines. “BMC received information stating that the said officer arrived in SRPF group 8 Guesthouse, Goregaon (East). Being a domestic air traveller, he needs to be guided for home quarantine as per the State Government Guidelines. Accordingly, BMC team approached him at the guesthouse yesterday evening [Sunday],” said BMC in its statement. The statement went on to clarify Tiwari has been guided to apply for exemption from quarantine. “The team explained to him the entire procedure applicable to a domestic air traveller, including home quarantine, which is fixed by the state government notification dated May 25, 2020. He has also been guided to apply to the competent authority of MCGM [Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] for exemption in the home quarantine period as per the state government notification,” it said.BMC did not comment on why four officers who had come to Mumbai from Bihar on July 27, in connection with the same case, had not been quarantined. Leader of the Opposition and former chief minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis tweeted on Monday, “It is really strange why Maharashtra government is coming under unnecessary suspicion by not allowing Bihar police to perform their duties. The movement of officers doing official public service can’t be stopped by putting them in quarantine in these testing times of Covid-19 pandemic. A medical team from Kerala visited Mumbai, UP police came to investigate Vikas Dubey case, a team from Bihar police is already working since 4 days but none of them was quarantined then why only an SP rank officer is treated differently?” Fadnavis added, “Instead of solving the mystery of #SushantSinghRajput’s death, such behaviour will only result in huge public outcry and disbelief amongst people about the investigation in the case.’’ Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kirit Somaiya also said, “The Circular DMU/2020CR of 25 May, categorically stated that no home quarantine for a person intending to stay in Mumbai for less than 7 days and government servants are given an exemption for such govt work. All such government officials have been, are exempted since 25 May.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-row-erupts-over-bihar-cop-being-quarantined/story-Oj45iWAU3dpNH132cm9C4J.html

He put forth the demand, while interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union health minister Harsh Vardhan at the virtual launch of Covid-19 testing facilities in Noida, Mumbai and Kolkata.Mumbai, meanwhile, continued with the trend of clocking fewer cases on the first two days of the week. On Monday, it recorded 970 new infections, taking its tally to 117,406. With 46 fatalities reported in the city, Mumbai’s toll due to the infectious disease stood at 6,493. Mumbai now has 20,528 active cases.Though the absolute number reported on Monday is lower than the previous days, the positivity rate saw a significant rise from the numbers reported on Sunday. As per the state health department’s data, 43,022 samples were tested,On Monday, the positivity rate jumped by 5.19 percentage points in comparison to the previous day though the absolute numbers were lower. The number of samples tested on Monday was 43,022, of which 8,968 were positive, which is a positivity rate of 20.84%. On Sunday, 60,758 samples were tested and 9,509 came out positive, which was a positivity rate of 15.65%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 19.58%.Maharashtra is the most affected state by the Covid-19 outbreak and has the second-highest case fatality rate (CFR) in the state after Gujarat. The volume of the outbreak and the absence of robust health infrastructure in the state has prompted the state government to set up makeshift facilities and subsequently plan permanent infrastructure.While speaking at the commissioning of a 371-bed dedicated Covid-19 facility in Mira-Bhayander, Thackeray said that along with development work, the state will focus on strengthening public health infrastructure“There is an urgent need to set up permanent dedicated infectious hospitals across the state to overcome an epidemic in the future and the state government is making efforts for this,” Thackeray said, who inaugurated the two dedicated Covid facilities in Bhayander east on Monday afternoon through video conferencing. The CM also assured that there will not be a dearth of funds for the municipal corporations in the state in the battle against Covid-19.Thackeray also inaugurated a 200-bed dedicated Covid facility in Mahad, Raigad district. The CM said that the facility will help rural areas in the surrounding areas. Thane and Raigad districts have 32,191 and 4,872 active cases.The CM called for increased coordination between agencies and government machinery to tackle the outbreak and to control the death rate. “To stop the spread of Covid-19, coordination between the government machinery is crucial. With erecting quarantine facilities, tracing, testing and tracking should be done. The state machinery should work even harder to control the CFR,” he said.Meanwhile, Pune district is expected to cross 1 lakh total confirmed cases by Tuesday as the tally on Monday stood at 96,669. As per the data, 43% or 41,664 of the total cases in the district are active cases. On Monday, Pune city reported 796 new infections and 40 deaths. Pune district reported 231 new cases and nine fatalities, while Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 731 new infections and 13 deaths.The infection in the rural and semi-urban areas of the state continued to spread at a brisk pace. With festivals, including Ganeshotsav, approaching, the state health department is anticipating a rise in the number of cases across rural areas.On Monday, Nashik city reported 323 new infections, taking city’s tally to 10,559. Solapur district, another hotspot in the state, saw 202 new infections, taking tally to 4562. Kolhapur district recorded 395 new cases, taking its tally to 5,196. Sangli-Miraj reported 365 new cases, pushing its tally to 1,881.Aurangabad city reported 237 cases pushing its tally to 10,609. Nagpur city reported 176 new cases, which took the city’s tally to 3,850, while the district reported 108 new cases. Hingoli reported 100 cases, while Nanded district and Nanded city reported 123 and 103 new cases, respectively.

04-08-2020||Mumbai||Wet spell begins in Mumbai: Red alert for August 4 and 5||The city can expect extremely heavy rain across isolated areas on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the weather bureau’s revised forecast issued on Monday.A red alert (possibility of over 204.5mm rain over 24 hours across isolated areas) has been issued for Mumbai, Thane and Raigad for Tuesday and Wednesday, with the possibility of waterlogging and disruption of traffic. A red alert has also been issued for Ratnagiri for Tuesday and Palghar on Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The city and suburbs saw partly cloudy conditions with spells of sunshine through the day on Monday, but light to moderate rain was recorded from early evening with intermittent intense spells in some areas. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs, recorded 17.6mm (moderate) rain between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Monday, while Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 38.2mm (moderate) rain during the same time. Majority of this rain was recorded over three hours between 5.30pm and 8.30pm. Location-wise rain showed Mazgaon recorded maximum rain at 31.2mm, followed by Malad at 28.6mm and Worli 25mm.“The active wet spell for the Konkan coast, including Mumbai, commenced from Monday evening and is expected to continue till Thursday. Intense rain activity is expected on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the formation of a low pressure weather system over Bay of Bengal on Tuesday. This will enhance rain bearing factors along the west coast strengthening westerly winds and allowing increased moisture incursions leading to extremely heavy showers,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. Maximum and minimum temperatures were close to the normal mark on Monday.From June 1 to August 3 8.30 pm, Mumbai recorded 1,918.6 mm rain, which is 85% of its seasonal average rain (2,260.4mm). However, water stock across seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai was 34.7% of the required amount on Monday. It was 91.5% last year by August 3.“Very heavy showers, ranging to the amount of 500mm or more, are expected over catchment areas between Wednesday and Thursday,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-B), Bombay.From Sunday evening itself, wind speed over the city picked up with 22-25kmph winds, according to IMD. “The combination of factors, including a cyclonic circulation in the lower troposphere and a developing monsoon depression over the Bay of Bengal, is allowing the offshore trough to intensify and enhance south-westerly winds over the Mumbai region. The wind speed is likely to further increase to around 40kmph on Tuesday before decreasing from Tuesday night,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also issued a high alert warning for Mumbai on August 4 and 5, owing to IMD’s warning that parts of the island city and suburbs will experience heavy rainfall on these two days. BMC has urged Mumbaiites not to visit beaches or venture into areas if they are water logged.In a media announcement made on Monday, BMC informed that all 24 disaster-control rooms at ward levels have been put on high alert, six regional offices of the Mumbai fire brigade are on standby and three units of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are also on standby for Mumbai. BMC has ensured all six pumping stations, and the 299 dewatering pumps set up temporarily across the city are functional.The electric substations of BEST and Adani, etc, are also on high alert. Moreover, assistant commissioner of the L Ward in Kurla, with jurisdiction over areas adjoining the banks of Mithi river, is on alert to evacuate residents of these areas, in case the water levels of Mithi increase to dangerous levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/august-s-wet-spell-begins-red-alert-for-august-4-and-5/story-gowCQEMMJLQUyBddWaS6kL.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Trial court must record signs, gestures of hearing and speech impaired witnesses: HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has held that while recording testimony of a hearing and speech impaired witness, trial courts must also record the signs and gestures made by the witness along with the interpretation of the same.Justice VK Jadhav said recording details of signs and gestures made by the witness was mandatory under section 119 of the Evidence Act, 1872, which lays down the procedure for recording testimony of a hearing and speech impaired witnesses.The judge granted bail to a gang rape convict, Abdul Salim, after noticing that the trial court did not record, in its evidence of the hearing and speech impaired survivor, the details of signs and gestures that the survivor had made before the court along with the interpretation by a special teacher.“On careful perusal of prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the victim and evidence of the special teacher, it appears that the learned judge of the trial court has not taken any pains to record the gestures made by the victim during the course of recording her evidence nor there is any reference as to how those gestures came to be interpreted by the special teacher.”Salim moved HC after Nanded sessions court on October 3, 2019, after he was convicted for gang rape along with two juveniles and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.He filed a plea for bail during pendency of his appeal and his lawyer pointed out the lacuna in recording evidence of the survivor while urging HC to suspend the substantive sentence headed down to the convict and release him on bail. Justice Jadhav found substance in the argument that the trial court had failed to comply with the mandate of section 119 of the Evidence Act. Besides, the judge also took note of the fact that the evidence of the doctor who examined the survivor was not clear and the medical evidence did not support the prosecution case of gang rape.HC also noted that though the opinion of the doctor about possibility of forcible intercourse was confusing and unclear, he had stated in clear terms that he did not find any marks of struggle on the survivor.Justice Jadhav was also displeased with the manner in which identification parade was conducted by the investigation officer. Allegedly the officer called some boys in the age group of 18-20 years (age group of the accused) to the police station and asked the survivor to identify three culprits. “This particular procedure is unknown to the criminal law, violating all norms and guidelines for conducting identification parade,” said the judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trial-court-must-record-signs-gestures-of-hearing-and-speech-impaired-witnesses-hc/story-yvlN7EFs4YM4Av4DU49UwN.html
04-08-2020||Mumbai||Doc with diploma seeks HC intervention to attain degree status||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed a doctor to amend his petition to challenge the June 2018 notification of the state which changed the status of diploma courses for post-graduate (PG) medical education to degree courses. The doctor in his petition claimed that he completed the two-year diploma course in March and is asked to continue his practice amid the Covid-19 outbreak under the diploma status. He also submitted that as there is a possibility of continuing being on Covid-19 duty as a diploma student for nine more months, he should receive the benefit of being a degree holder. A division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Milind Jadhav, while hearing the petition of Dr Shashikant Morale, was informed by advocate Vijay Thorat that his client took an admission in the PG diploma course in May 2018. A month later, the state government came out with a notification which changed the status of PG medical diploma courses into degree courses. Thorat submitted that when his client sought to be given the benefit of the degree status for the course, he was refused on the ground that the notification could not be applied retrospectively. Aggrieved by the refusal, he approached the court, seeking direction to the Medical Council of India to extend the benefit of the change for him. Thorat submitted that his client was asked to continue his duty as a diploma student amid the outbreak. Thorat submitted that as Dr Morale had already completed three months in excess of the two years needed for the diploma course and was willing to serve another nine months, he should be given a degree certificate at the end of his duty instead of a diploma certificate. The counsel for the doctor also said that the notification was discriminatory and violated the provisions under Article 14 of the Constitution and so should be struck down. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as the petitioner did not challenge the notification, the court granted liberty to him to amend the petition and include the challenge to the notification itself and posted the matter for hearing on August 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/doc-with-diploma-seeks-hc-intervention-to-attain-degree-status/story-Aeb8XgDMeERXKOJ70JGMfN.html

04-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Case not under Bihar police’s jurisdiction, says city police chief||Commissioner of police Param Bir Singh said on Monday that Bihar Police does not have jurisdiction to probe the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput who died by suicide in his Bandra home on June 14. He clarified that Mumbai Police has found no misappropriation of Rajput’s funds and his family had not mentioned they suspected anyone of foul play in the signed statements they gave to Mumbai Police on June 16. This is the first time Singh has commented on the matter. At a press conference held on Monday, Singh said, “The law is clear. If the incident has not happened in our jurisdiction, we register a ‘zero’ first information report (FIR) and transfer it to the concerned state police. We do not know how Bihar police is investigating the case. They approached us and asked for some documents. We asked them under what section they were asking for the documents.” Singh added that Mumbai Police was taking legal opinion to understand if Bihar Police could also investigate the case. Singh said the investigation was being handled in a professional manner by Bandra police, under the direct supervision of deputy commissioner of police (Zone 9) Abhishek Trimukhe. Rajput was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14 after which the police punchanama was conducted and the flat was sealed. On June 15, a team from the Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories in Kalina and a team from Cooper Municipal General Hospital collect evidence from the flat, which was unsealed and handed over to Rajput’s family. “The investigation is still going on. All the points at various stages including personal rivalry, financial distress and health-related issues have been verified. We have not spare anyone in the inquiry related to the incident and called every person and recorded their statement,” said Singh. He said that in the course of the investigation experts were consulted and gadgets, including phones, were examined. So far, police have recorded the statements of 56 people including Rajput’s three sisters, brother in-law and others present in his house. Singh said the statements of Rajput’s family members, including his father, sisters and brother in-law, were recorded on June 16. “No one expressed any suspicion on the actor’s death and had stated that it could be financial issues or issues related to his mental health had caused the unfortunate incident. It is the very first statement given by them which holds legal value because it is the uncorrupted version,” said Singh of statements given by Rajput’s family. Later, members of Rajput’s family, including his sisters, had visited joint commissioner of police (law and order) Vinoy Kumar Chaubey and Trimukhe. “Even at that point, none of the family members expressed any suspicion,” said Singh. Responding to rumours that have circulated around circumstances preceding Rajput’s death, Singh said there was no evidence of a party in the actor’s home on June 13 or June 14. “We have examined CCTV [closed circuit television] footage of the building and recorded statements of every member in the house, but we have not found any evidence of any party being held in his apartment,” said Singh. The police commissioner also clarified that so far, no connection has been found between Rajput’s death and that of Rajput’s former manager Disha Salian, who also died by suicide. An investigation into Salian’s death is also underway. “Disha Salian died between the night of June 8 and June 9, and we have recorded statements of the six people present at the party, and also of Salian’s parents. None of them have expressed any suspicion. We have also examined CCTV footage of the apartment and nobody apart from the six people including her fiancé was present,” said Singh, adding that Salian and Rajput had met in March, but the meeting is not significant to either of their suicides. However, Singh said Rajput may have been “emotionally disturbed” by the articles that he read online that linked him to Salian’s death. Singh further said that prior to his death, Rajput would regularly look himself up on Google. He also searched for “painless death”. “We are in touch with the five doctors whom he consulted and was under treatment. We are also in touch with chartered accountant,” said Singh. Singh said so far, Mumbai Police has not found any misappropriation with respect to Rajput’s finances. “There was around Rs 18 crore in his account and the account still has around Rs 4.5 crore. We have not found any transaction to Rhea Chakraborty’s account. We have also found detailed transaction on where the remaining money was found. But we are still conducting a detailed inquiry into each of the transactions,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-not-under-bihar-police-s-jurisdiction-says-city-police-chief/story-ydK69dBcxc824TndFqFoNN.html
04-08-2020||Gurugram||‘Beef’ in truck row: Prime suspect, one other nabbed, hunt intensifies for others||Three days after a 25-year-old man was beaten up by a group of men on the alleged suspicion of transporting beef in his pick-up truck, the police on Monday arrested two persons, including a prime suspect who was seen raining hammer blows on the victim in a video that had surfaced online. So far, the police have arrested four suspects in this case. Investigators said that at least seven more have been identified and raids are being conducted to arrest them. Police identified Monday’s arrested suspects as Monu, who owns a dairy in Badshahpur, and Anesh, a resident of Sohna, both of who were nabbed by a team of crime branch officers, sector 10. Monu was allegedly among the suspects who had cornered the victim, Lukman, near Trunk Market when he was on his way to a meat shop near Jama Masjid. In a three-minute video shot by an eyewitness, a man wearing a blue T-shirt could be seen dragging the victim on the road before kicking him and then beating him with a hammer. In the video, at least two more suspects take turns and assault Lukman with a hammer and sticks before he is bundled into the pick-up truck. A uniformed police official can been seen standing next to the suspects, as he is being assaulted. Police said Anesh was also among the suspects who had beaten up the victim in Trunk market. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “Based on evidence and questioning other suspects, two more men have been arrested, including the one who had beaten the complainant with a hammer. Prima facie, they do not have a criminal record and we are checking if they were involved in any such activities before.” Police had earlier arrested Mahesh, 30, from Rithoj, and Pardeep Yadav, 28, a Rajiv Nagar resident, in the case. According to a statement by the police, all the four accused men have told the police that they suspected that the complainant was carrying cow meat in his pick-up truck and had tried to stop him. When Lukman did not halt his vehicle, they cornered him and assaulted him. A police official, requesting anonymity, said, “Another suspect, who had passed on the initial information that the complainant was coming from Nuh has been identified but is still at large. The meat recovered from the truck was sent to a laboratory for testing and the results are still awaited.” The case was transferred to crime branch after a preliminary enquiry, in which departmental action was taken against four police officials. Three officials were suspended on Sunday for ‘failing to take action on the spot’ while on Saturday, the station house officer (SHO) of Badshahpur police station was transferred to police lines for negligence and failing to control the situation. The incident took place around 9.30am on Friday, when Lukman, a native of Ghasera village in Nuh, was transporting some meat in his pick-up truck to a shop near Jama Masjid. In the FIR registered at Badshahpur police station on Friday, Lukman has said, “As I reached near a traffic signal in Badshahpur, several men on 4-5 motorcycles started following me. They tried to stop my vehicle but I sped towards the mosque. A few lanes from the mosque, near the Trunk Market, the men cornered me and assaulted me with rods. They broke the window panes of the truck. They later bundled me into my truck and took me to Jail road in Badshahpur, where they assaulted me again, before a police team rescued me.” On Sunday, Lukman’s father, Hafiz Bilal had said that the suspects had continued to beat his son despite his repeated pleas stating that he was transporting buffalo meat. “He told them that if it was proved that he had beef in his truck, they would be free to hit him. But they continued to beat him with rods and a hammer. He started praying but the suspects forced him to chant ‘Jai Siya Ram’ and then threatened to burn him alive,” he said. Lukman is recovering from injuries sustained on his head, legs and arms at a hospital in Nuh, his family said. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “There is no mention in the FIR that the victim was forced to chant these slogans. No such link has come out in the investigations so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/beef-in-truck-row-prime-suspect-one-other-nabbed-hunt-intensifies-for-others/story-eVTg13REi3nFlHF6JR9APJ.html
04-08-2020||Gurugram||Daily positivity rate in Gurugram dips to 3.5%, officials say Covid-19 past its peak now||For the first time in over two weeks, the district’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) dipped to 3.5 percent on Monday, with just 43 of the 1,217 new samples testing positive for Covid-19. For at least three days now, the TPR — defined as the ratio of positive cases to the total number of tests conducted — has inched below the 5% mark, which is the World Health Organisation’s recommended benchmark for lifting restrictions on public mobility (if sustained for over two weeks). On July 15, Gurugram’s daily TPR hit a record low of 3.2 percent. However, at the time, the improvement was not consistent. “We were still seeing an average positivity rate of about 6 to 8 percent, but now the number is reducing daily. Even in hotspot areas such as Sohna, where the TPR was 11 percent in mid-July, the positivity rate has now been brought down to about six percent now,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer in the Gururgam.Health department data showed a steep dip in test positivity rate beginning mid-June, which coincides with an increase in RT-PCR tests and the district opening its own laboratory for testing of samples. Until then, nasal swabs taken from patients were being sent to one of the six other government labs in the state, with most samples being tested at PGIMS Rohtak. From an average positivity rate of 60 percent in the first week of June — when as many as 200 new cases were emerging each day — the number dipped to 26 percent around June 25, after an upgrade in Gurugram’s testing capabilities. Then, with the introduction of rapid, point-of-care antigen tests in late June, which allowed authorities to more than double the number of daily tests, Gurugram’s TPR (taken as a seven day moving average) saw a sharper dip over subsequent weeks, to as little as 5.35 percent by July 19. Authorities cited this trend as evidence that Gurugram is past its first epidemiological ‘peak’ of the outbreak. Health department officials, including the district’s chief medical officer, compared the district’s trajectory of infection to that of larger metropolitan cities, which experts now believe are past their peaks. “Delhi and Mumbai too have seen almost simultaneous dips in their growth rate and positivity rates. In terms of the severity of the outbreak, Gurugram’s absolute numbers are not that high, but we also have a population that’s 20 times less than Delhi’s. We have seen the same trend in terms of how the epidemic has progressed, but at a smaller scale,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, adding that transmission of the virus itself has been halted to a significant degree. The challenge ahead lies in sustaining the prevailing positivity rate so that normal life can resume, albeit with strict social distancing measures. The WHO’s recommendation for lifting curbs on mobility is a daily TPR of five percent or less, over a period of at least two weeks. “We are confident of being able to meet this benchmark, but it means that we cannot falter on testing at all now, otherwise it will skew the progress that we are witnessing. The second thing is social distancing, which is more important for people to understand. The pandemic is not over. Our behaviour still needs to be vigilant,” said Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram.Cumulatively, a total of 8.6 percent of all samples tested from the district have come out positive for the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This, officials said, is an improvement from about 17 percent in mid-June, while Gurugram’s peak was underway. While other cities like Delhi and Mumbai have since released comprehensive serological studies mapping the prevalence of Covid-19 among the community, a similar analysis for Gurugram is awaited. While at least 361 IgG antibodies tests were conducted last month — on subjects belonging to 18 vulnerable demographic categories specified by the ICMR — only 25 of them (or 7 percent) were found to be seropositive. “This is still a small sample. We will be able to make a concrete statement on prevalence and infection fatality rate once a wider study is done,” Dr Jai Prakash Sharma said.

04-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi police anti-riot gear in dire need of upgrade, show records||The Delhi Police’s armoury of anti-riot gear is in urgent need of an upgrade with nearly 70% of all tear gas shells and grenades, and 30% of bulletproof vests deemed “condemned (discarded)” or on the “verge of condemnation (declared unusable)”, data from a recent police inventory shows.That’s not all. About 36% of all helmets, 19% of lathis (batons), and 13% of poly carbonate body shields have been put in the category of “to be condemned”, the data further shows. Since the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was passed in Parliament last December, the city has witnessed numerous protests, many of them violent, and a communal riot in north-east Delhi in February that left 53 dead and over 400 injured. Also read: Tahir Hussain was given task of collecting glass bottles during Delhi violence: ReportBetween December 15 and 19, 2019, the city police fired nearly 450 tear gas shells to quell anti-CAA protests in Jamia Nagar and Seelampur-Jafarabad. Nearly 3,500 tear gas shells and gas grenades were used against rioters during the communal violence that ravaged several parts of north-east Delhi between February 24 and 26, a senior officer in the know of the matter, on condition of anonymity, said. As tear gas shells, their launching guns, gas grenades, bulletproof vests, body shields, lathis and helmets are key anti-riot equipment and hundreds of demonstrations are organised every year in the national capital, the Delhi Police is gearing up to strengthen its armoury. Towards that end, the force recently carried out an inventory of anti-riot equipment available in all 15 police districts of Delhi and as many other units of Delhi Police. After the evaluation, a list was drawn up on the equipment required and a proposal was drafted for the procurement of these items, said officials from provision and logistics (P&L) department that deals in the sale and purchase of items for the Delhi Police. “The assessment of arms, ammunition and anti-riot equipment is done periodically to ascertain the status and condition of such items. On the basis of the assessment, we prepare a list of items required, and send the proposal to the ministry of home affairs for release of funds. A proposal to purchase anti-riot equipment is in the pipeline,” Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said.Also read: Former JNU student Umar Khalid questioned in Delhi riots case, cellphone seizedData accessed by Hindustan Times shows that the police presently have 61,279 tear gas shells and gas grenades but about 70% of them have either expired or are nearing expiry date. Similarly, of the 16,607 bulletproof vests with the force, 5,104 (nearly 30%) are to be disposed of. The police have 18,685 helmets of which 6,718 are not fit for use. Of the 16,486 poly carbonate body shields and 23,195 lathis, 2,230 shields and 4,531 lathis have been declared unusable, shows the data. “Poor maintenance and storage in unsuitable conditions are the prime reasons for the gear going to waste. The purchasing is vendor-driven and so the items procured are of poor quality. The ideal way would be to choose a vendor on the basis of quality and specification of items required as ascertained by the technical committee,” Vikram Singh, former director-general (DG) of Uttar Pradesh Police, said. Many serving officers of the Delhi Police supported the former UP Police chief’s view and said anti-riot items are usually stored in malkhanas (storage room where recovered goods as well as arms and ammunition are stored) of police stations and these spaces are not temperature controlled. “There is no fixed life span for a bulletproof vest. The vest armour is damaged only by gunshots. It’s the cloth and fitting buckles that decay because of poor storage and maintenance. The vests get mildewed from the sweat of the wearer and the damp and humid conditions in malkhanas,” an officer, who did not want to be named said. Another officer from the P&L department said tear gas shells and gas grenades come with an expiry date, which is between three and five years. “The expired shells are used for training sessions at the police training college,” the officer said, adding that lathis and body shields sustain damage either during their use or because of poor maintenance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-anti-riot-gear-in-dire-need-of-upgrade-show-records/story-WKujp0GUSjap7XeuX7PyrI.html
04-08-2020||Delhi||New footover bridge to be constructed in place of the old ‘lohe ka pul’||A new footover bridge may come up on the Brijmohan Chowk on Netaji Subhash Marg in place of the heritage ‘lohe ka pul’ (iron bridge) that was dismantled in 2011. The 48-year-old bridge, which connected the Jama Masjid side with Ansari Road, was built in 1963. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator from Chandni Chowk Parlad Singh Sawhney said the proposal to construct a new footover bridge on the same location has been sent to the Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) and the “overbridge is likely to be constructed latest by March next year”. “Ever since the old footover bridge has been dismantled, pedestrians in the area face difficulties in crossing the busy road. Netaji Subhash Chandra Marg is a busy road and specially during peak rush hours, it becomes an uphill task for those on foot to cross the road,” said Sawhney. The five-time MLA from the constituency said he had also discussed the possibility constructing a footover bridge on the same location and the “department agreed with the proposal”. The proposal was sent to the PWD but financial clearance for it got stuck after the Covid-19 outbreak in the national capital. A senior PWD official said he can only comment on the plan after the project gets financial sanction. Senior officials of the Delhi traffic police said with the Chandni Chowk main road being redeveloped, the need for pedestrian facility on Netaji Subhash Chandra Marg will be imperative. “We have discussed the possibility of a pedestrian facility on the stretch. After the pedestrianisation plan comes into force, there could be a new traffic movement plan for the entire stretch. However, we are yet to receive a formal clearance request from the PWD for the construction of such a facility,” a senior traffic official said. Old-timers in the area recall that the bridge was originally built on the road to help kids from two orphanages—Arya Orphanage and Bacchon ka Ghar—to reach their schools on either sides of the road. In 2011, however, the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) had dismantled the iron structure after it was deemed ‘dangerous’ for public use because of its decrepit condition. A report of the footover bridge’s dismantling, submitted before the house back then, read that the railings of the old bridge was in “dangerous state” and “portions of the staircase had worn out”. Apart from this, the bridge had also become a hub for anti-social elements, who would camp over and under it, making it unsafe for general public. As per the PWD’s initial proposal for the bridge, which is likely to cost between R2-3 crores, elevators would be provided on both sides of the road, escalators, and disabled-friendly ramps would also be made. The residents of the area, however, are divided over the plan. While some are excited to get a safe facility for pedestrians, others are wary that it will once again see the fate of the old iron bridge, which was under maintained and became a spot for petty crimes. Mohammad Sohail, one of the owners of ‘Jahangeer Foods’, which was among the first shops to be set up under this bridge, said that the family was relieved when the footover bridge was finally removed. “It was in such a bad condition. People would urinate on the sides and drug addicts would camp over it. Regular pedestrians were barely using it. It was a blessing that it was removed,” Sohail said. Sixty nine-year-old Abdul Rehman, who used to run a tyre repair shop under the bridge, however, said that the stretch needed a footover bridge because of the chaotic traffic. “This road is not safe for pedestrians. Even when the traffic signal goes red, vehicles charge at you, without giving you any time to cross the street. Crossing the road is like risking your life every day. A footover bridge will also ease the crowd here,” Rehman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-footover-bridge-to-be-constructed-in-place-of-the-old-lohe-ka-pul/story-gAcC2PwMTYyfSaj079XkdJ.html
04-08-2020||Delhi||Lockdown effect: Peak power demand in Delhi drops by 15%||In a first in 11 years, the peak electricity demand in Delhi has seen a decline of around 15% (1,095 MW) compared to the previous year, data provided by power utilities showed on Monday. The city’s peak electricity consumption this summer has been lowest since 2017 because of the lockdown and also the weather, senior government and discom officials said. This year, the peak power demand met by distribution companies (discoms) so far has been 6,314 MW, recorded on June 29. Going by the trend over the past 11 years, Delhi’s power demand is unlikely to peak any further this year, officials in the state power department said.Also read:  Power demand slump narrows to 2.6% in July beginning“If we analyse Delhi’s peak power demand since 2009, we will see that it has peaked 8 times in the month of July, 4 times in June (including this year) and once in August (August 2, 2011). So, we can say that Delhi, in all likelihood, has passed its peak demand for this year, contrary to initial projection of it crossing the 7,000 MW mark again this time,” said a senior power official who did not wish to be named.Delhi’s all-time high peak power demand was registered on July 2 last year, when it had clocked 7,409 MW - an increase of over 250% from the peak of 2,879 MW recorded in 2002. Government data accessed by HT showed that Delhi, on an average, has seen a year-on-year growth of 5% in its peak electricity demand over a period of 10 years. This means that the city’s peak demand used to increase by at least 5% compared to the previous year’s value. However, it is only this year that the demand has dropped by around 15%. Before this, between 2009 and 2019, the peak electricity demand had dropped only once in the year 2015 — but this dip was only of 1% (from 5925 MW in 2014 to 5846 MW in 2015).“This year, because of the lockdown and the weather, the peak power demand has been muted. Under the fourth phase of lockdown, which started from around May 18, industries, shops and other commercial activities that were shut for the last two months were allowed to operate in full strength in Delhi. But, Covid-19 cases were increasing so rapidly in Delhi that majority of the industries and commercial establishments had voluntarily not resumed business,” explained a spokesperson of the two BSES discoms.The Delhi government said that from July industrial and commercial consumption gradually started to pick up. “But that also is muted because of the favourable weather conditions. The intense heatwave in Delhi remains mostly during June and July, which is the time when the power demand mostly peaks. So, unless there is an intense heatwave coupled with extremely humid conditions, the power demand is unlikely to cross the 7,000 MW mark this year,” said the first power department official. Government reports show that the first month of the lockdown had not only decreased Delhi’s daily average power demand by 35% over the previous year (2019), but it also turned out to be a period with the lowest average electricity consumption in the Capital over the last 11 years at least. Delhi was among the first cities to impose a lockdown which came into effect from March 23. Though, sector-wise data (domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, etc) of Delhi’s power consumption for the months of June and July in 2019 and this year was not available, multiple power utilities operating in the city confirmed that maximum share of electricity consumption this year has been from households or the domestic category.“Since May 18 this year, Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by over 50%. Further, if we compare the peak power demand of April, 2020 with that of July 2020, Delhi’s peak power demand has already increased by over 87%. Since June 1, 2020, Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by over 65%. The maximum consumption in all this has been from the domestic category which is because more people are staying indoors with offices promoting work from home,” another power department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-records-highest-dip-in-peak-power-demand-because-of-lockdown-and-weather/story-q73WY9c1pw5mEPkyyEo5QI.html
04-08-2020||City||Tahir Hussain admits to planning north-east Delhi riots: Police report||New Delhi: Former municipal councillor Tahir Hussain has told the police that he had met student leader Umar Khalid at Popular Front of India (PFI) office in southeast Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh on January 8 to plan the riots in north-east Delhi, according to the interrogation reports submitted to the court by the Delhi police as part of the several charge sheets against Hussain. Hussain’s confession was recorded by police after his arrest in March this year in connection with the murder of Intelligence Bureau officer Ankit Sharma during the communal riots in the Capital in February.The confession is not an admissible evidence in court because it was made in front of a police officer but it has been attached with the charge sheet against him.Hussain’s interrogation reports were widely circulated on social media on Sunday and Monday. According to his confession recorded by police, Khalid had assured them of finances from the PFI, Jamia Cordination Committee (JCC), from some political people, and from advocates and Muslim organisations, the interrogation report reads. Senior police officers refused to comment on the reports, saying the court is already seized of the matter. Hussain’s lawyer Javed Ali said the police are manipulating facts. “Tahir Hussain has not admitted to anything with regard to Delhi riots cases. The reality is he is a victim and has been falsely implicated. Moreover, as far as confessional statement is concerned, it is settled law that statement made by a person to the police before he is accused of any offence is irrelevant. The Indian Evidence Act clearly says that such a statement does not come within the definition of evidence. Only a confession before the magistrate under section 164 of CrPC is admissible in the eyes of law and Tahir Hussain has never given any such statement,” he said. According to the report, Hussain told the police that soon after he was elected municipal councillor from Ward 59 in Nehru Vihar in 2017, Khalid Saifi, founder of ‘United Against Hate’, told him that he should use his influence and money against the Hindus and for the betterment of Muslims. Saifi has also been arrested in a case related to the riots.According to the police report, Saifi introduced Hussain to Khalid. Saifi told them that when US President Donald Trump would be in India, they should do something that will force the Indian government withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Everyone was given different tasks. “While Saifi had to gather mob on he streets, I was asked to collect glass bottles, acid and petrol,” Hussain told the interrogators, as per the report.Harsh Bora, Khalid Saifi’s counsel rubbished the allegations.“Interrogation reports are not evidence in the eyes of the law. The police have made many such false allegations against Khalid Saifi in the past but have repeatedly failed to substantiate even a single one with any evidence whatsoever,” Bora said.On Saturday, Delhi police had questioned Umar Khalid in connection with an alleged conspiracy behind the February violence in northeast Delhi. Khalid was earlier also booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for allegedly giving provocative speeches at different places and appealing to the people to come out on the streets and block roads during Trump’s visit.Khalid’s counsel Trideep Pais said, “Khalid has already clarified publicly that he has never met Tahir Hussain. He also has said he has never been to PFI office and that he was not even interrogated about this by the Delhi police in his first and only interrogation on July 31.”When contacted, Anis Ahmed, general secretary, Popular Front of India said, the reports alleging Popular Front link to the violence in north-east Delhi are “another attempt by the fascist forces and agencies controlled by them to defame their organisation”.“Popular Front cannot be intimidated by such ridiculous attempts. The allegation is a copy of the lie propagated by fascist forces through their sponsored reports to malign Muslims who are the real victims of the Delhi pogrom. As we have earlier stated the Delhi Police itself has become an obstacle in the path of providing justice to the real victims of the pogrom. We would reiterate our demand for an independent enquiry headed by a sitting High Court or Supreme Court judge into the Delhi violence, including the behaviour of Delhi Police during the riots and in probing the riots,” he said.Reacting to Hussain’s alleged disclosure, a member of the Jamia Coordination Committee said it is a baseless allegation.“Jamia Coordination Committee has never coordinated with Khalid Saifi or Tahir Hussain. Police are randomly creating connections and statements(confession) without any evidence to prove fabricated allegations. It will not stand before the court,” the JCC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tahir-hussain-admits-to-planning-north-east-delhi-riots-police-report/story-uruyQ6ew8t3K9V5uzLCAgL.html
04-08-2020||Pune||Sars-Cov-2 virus is showing new emerging pattern of linked mutations: Pune’s NCCS study||PUNE A study conducted by the Pune’s National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), claims to have found evidence that the Sars-Cov-2 virus is showing a newly emerging pattern of linked mutations. These mutations are region specific, apart from also showing age-specific indicators, different for each district from where the samples were taken. The study is based on 90 samples taken from Sassoon hospital and the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) in Pune; and from persons who tested positive for Covid-19 in Satara and Nashik. The study also showed mutations varying in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, the effect of the mutations on symptoms, treatment and development of vaccine, if any, needs need to be further researched, said experts involved in the study. Dr Yogesh Shouche, scientist and principal investigator, National Centre for Microbial Resources, said, “When we say mutations, it means that the genetic material of the virus is changing. However, from our study we cannot say whether or not the mutations impact the spread, or treatment. This needs to be studied further. It just helps us understand how the virus is changing in the local population. If the virus is changing it may help to understand if the vaccine needs to be made from only one virus strain, or should it be a cocktail of the many different types of the mutations.” NCMR is affiliated to National Centre for Cell Science and Dr Shouche was part of the research as it was under NCMR. Dr Shouche also said similar virus types were seen in samples from Europe. He said, “Type 20 A and 20 B, which we saw in the samples we studied, were also found in samples in Europe.” When asked if these similarities were seen in samples found in China and the USA, Dr Shouche said no. The virus sequences studied in Pune were compared with those reported from other Indian and global sources, to identify any variations. According to information released by the National Centre for Cell Sciences, four variations were found to be predominant in most of the sequences. “The genomes could be grouped into four distinct groups based on these. Three mutations found in the major group, appeared to be more frequent in samples from symptomatic patients, and more prominent in samples from women. Some correlations were also observed between sequence variations and patient age, with six mutations found to be frequent in the samples from younger patients, but being absent in those from senior patients,” the study stated. “These analyses, thus, revealed a newly emerging pattern of unique linked mutations in the genome sequences from western India, indicating that region-specific evolution of the virus genome might have occurred during the lockdown period,” the study further concluded. The abstract of the study, named “Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from western India reveals unique linked mutations”, states that the major cluster (cluster 4), distinguished by mutations C313T, C5700A, G28881A, are unique patterns observed in 45 per cent of the samples. The study was carried out by NCCS in collaboration with BJ Medical College and the Armed Forces Medical College in Pune, and the Directorate of Medical Education and Research, (DMER). District-wise mutation A novel and distinct pattern of mutations in the viral strains of each of the districts was observed. The Satara district viral strains showed mutations primarily at the 3′ end of the genome, while the Nashik district viral strains displayed mutations at the 5′ end of the genome. Characterisation of Pune strains showed that a novel variant has overtaken the other strains. Examination of the frequency of three mutations i.e., C313T, C5700A, G28881A, in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients indicated an increased occurrence in symptomatic cases, which is more prominent in females. Age-wise mutation An age-wise specific pattern of mutation is also observed. Mutations found in age group 10-25, were not found in higher age range of 61-80. Dr Shouche further added, “The study shows how the virus is changing as it spreads and now what effect that change has on virus transmission or treatment, needs to be further examined. The impact of the study can help understand the virus even better and this study needs to be taken forward by virologists for how mutations impact infectivity, symptoms and treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sars-cov-2-virus-is-showing-new-emerging-pattern-of-linked-mutations-study/story-OjqmzmLwTQiN3tovIBaBCK.html
04-08-2020||Pune||Mundhwa police book landlord for assaulting tenant||The Mundhwa police have lodged a case against a landlord for physically assaulting his tenant for non-payment of rent for four months. The tenant did not pay rent including power bills totally estimated to be worth around Rs 14,000 during the lockdown period. The victim has been a tenant for nearly five years. The incident comes in the wake of strict warning issued by Pune police regarding action to be taken against landlords harassing tenants for rent. The accused have been identified as Devendra Suresh Bhat, Nargis Bhat and Suresh Bhat based on the complaint lodged by tenant identified as Roshan Suresh Parate, 26. According to police, the complainant and his mother stayed in the house on rent for the last five years but during the Covid crisis, he was unable to pay the monthly rent and total arrears along with power bills which added up to Rs 14,000. Acting Mundhwa police station in-charge Saleem Chaus said, “A case has been lodged against the accused of harassing the tenant during the Covid-19 crisis period and subsequent physical assault.” The first such case was lodged against a landlady harassing a student tenant in June. She allegedly demanded rent from a civil services student during the lockdown and violated the order of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mundhwa-police-book-landlord-for-assaulting-tenant/story-W17bLswkxQaS2LFScjcVQN.html
04-08-2020||City||As HP restricts entry, tourists flood Morni, throw caution to wind||With Himachal Pradesh restricting the entry of tourists, Morni – the hill station of Panchkula – has become the new haunt for holidaymakers. The hill station, which is just five hours from Delhi and 45 kilometres from Chandigarh, has seen a fourfold increase in footfall in the last few weeks.What’s more worrying is that the visitors are often seen roaming without masks and violating social distancing norms, putting themselves and others at risk for infection. This even as Panchkula’s Covid count is rapidly increasing.During weekends, the roads leading to Morni remain abuzz with cars from Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and even Uttarakhand. Youngsters speeding on two-wheelers without helmets or masks are a common sight.In view of the rush, police had barricaded the entry points to the hill station. A cop deputed at the Mandhna T-Point said: “The number of vehicles has increased in the last few weeks. By noon, at least 50 vehicles cross this T-point. This is because Himachal Pradesh has made the process very cumbersome for tourists to enter their state.”The Tikkar Tal Lake, which is a major attraction, sees at least 400 to 500 parked here everyday.When this correspondent visited the spot, groups of young men were seen freely drinking alcohol and dancing to loud music, undeterred by the police presence a few metres away. Some others were seen sitting in close proximity to each other, taking selfies and enjoying their meal and drinks. One such visitor was Gundeep Singh, who had come from Ludhiana with his friends. None of them were wearing masks. When asked, he said: “We can’t go to Himachal, so we planned a one day-trip to Morni. We will leave by evening.”A few steps ahead, two-three families were seen sitting having their meal under a single shelter. Amresh Khajuria from Mohali said, “My son brought us here for a trip. This is the first time that we have explored this place and it’s beautiful. I would like to come here, again.”Two youths, who introduced themselves as resident doctors from Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University), Mullana, were seen enjoying the weather but without masks.Kishan Pal Joshi, the security guard at the parking, was the only one seen covering his face properly. He said: “Earlier, we got around 20 to 30 visitors on weekdays and 50 to 60 more on weekends. But now, we have at least 150 to 200 cars parked here everyday and on weekends, the rush increases by 400-500 cars.”When contacted, Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, “We will be soon picking up samples from tourist spots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-hp-restricts-entry-tourists-flood-morni-throw-caution-to-wind/story-qv90ZGmUKy7ItVDJblUgXN.html
04-08-2020||Lucknow||Amar Singh: A negotiator par excellence||Rajya Sabha member and former Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh’s rise and influence in Uttar Pradesh and national politics ran almost parallel to that of the Samajwadi Party. A negotiator par excellence, Amar Singh was known for making friends. He also ended up making some fierce enemies in politics, especially his own party. Amar’s friendship with Mulayam Singh Yadav began in 1996 when the then Samajwadi Party national president attained prominence in national politics. Mulayam became the Union defence minister in 1996 and soon afterwards inducted Amar Singh (who was earlier in the Congress) into his party and sent him to Rajya Sabha in November 1996. Thereafter Amar’s influence in the party rose to the extent that some top leaders in SP even began to call him de facto SP president. Amar Singh was instrumental in saving the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government when in 2008 the Left Front pulled out of the government over the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement. The Samajwadi Party with its 39 MPs gave outside support to the UPA-1. In between this period, Amar Singh and his influence brought some visible changes in the party. Apart from his strong political connections across various parties, Amar also had links in Mumbai’s film industry. He transformed the Samajwadi Party family’s ancestral village Saifai’s annual festival and made it dazzling by bringing in top Bollywood actors and singers to perform. But he went beyond entertainment. Over the years he also inducted several Bollywood personalities into Samajwadi Party and was the initiator of friendship between the Yadav family and Amitabh Bachchan family. Jaya Bachchan joined SP and is currently SP Rajya Sabha MP, Jaya Prada, Sanjay Dutt ( he came to contest the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat as SP candidate in 2009 but the Supreme Court restrained him), Nafisa Ali and Manoj Tiwari were others. Then it was Amar Singh who was behind making the then chief minister of UP, Mulayam Singh Yadav host the former US President Bill Clinton in Lucknow in 2005. But his relationship with the Samajwadi Party turned sour in 2009. Heavyweight SP leaders and old friends of Mulayam--Azam Khan and Beni Prasad Verma had left the SP citing Amar Singh as the reason. Amar Singh resigned from all party posts (he was a general secretary and parliamentary board member of the party) after SP’s 2009 Lok Sabha polls debacle.Mulayam said that he would not accept the resignations of Amar Singh. In 2010, Mulayam expelled Amar Singh and Jaya Prada from the party. In 2011, ahead of the UP assembly polls, Amar Singh floated Rashtriya Lok Manch. He campaigned against the Samajwadi Party and contested the elections on over 200 UP seats without luck. Soon afterwards, he dissolved the Rashtriya Lokmanch and joined joined Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) with Jaya Prada. He and Jaya Prada contested the Fatehpur Sikri and Bijnore seats and lost. However, in 2016, when the Samajwadi Party family feud between the current SP president Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav began, Amar took Shivpal’s side. Mulayam re-inducted him into the party again and sent him to Rajya Sabha again. Before the 2017 Assembly election, on becoming the national president of the party, Amar Singh was finally out of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/amar-singh-a-negotiator-par-excellence/story-XGQIQa2OkMvr2413Fo6D9O.html

04-08-2020||World||Brazil, hotbed for Covid-19 vaccine testing, may struggle to produce its own||Brazilian officials say they can start making Covid-19 vaccines developed by British and Chinese researchers within a year. Experts say it will take at least twice as long, leaving Brazil reliant on imports to slow the world’s second-worst outbreak.If Brazil’s underfunded medical institutions are unable to meet their ambitious goals, it would mark the latest failure by President Jair Bolsonaro’s government to control the virus. It would also leave Brazil vulnerable to a frenzied global scramble for vaccine supplies.Some of the most advanced Covid-19 vaccine candidates - including from AstraZeneca Plc in partnership with Oxford University, and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd - are undergoing large clinical trials in Brazil, which has more than 2.7 million reported cases and almost 95,000 deaths, second only to the United States. Researchers can get results faster by testing vaccines where active virus spread is rampant.As part of their agreements with Brazilian authorities, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have promised the federal government and the Sao Paulo state government, respectively, tens of millions of doses of their potential vaccines. They also pledged to transfer technology so Brazil can eventually produce them domestically at leading biomedical institutes Fiocruz, in Rio de Janeiro, and Butantan, in Sao Paulo.The institutes say production of new vaccines will begin by the middle of 2021. Brazil’s federal government has said it will invest 1.9 billion reais ($355 million) to process and produce the AstraZeneca vaccine.But three experts told Reuters money alone would not be enough, saying it could take between two and 10 years for Brazil to produce Covid-19 vaccines, due to the difficulty of transferring technology and years of under-investment in the two production facilities. “It’s impossible,” José Gomes Temporão, a former Brazilian health minister, said of the 2021 goal. “This takes a long time. Maybe they can accelerate a bit, but not that much.”A former head of federal health regulator Anvisa, who asked not to be named to avoid professional conflicts, also doubted Brazil could become self sufficient in a timely manner.“A tech transfer process lasts five to 10 years, on average. When Brazil has the complete technology, a Covid-19 vaccine will probably not be necessary anymore,” the ex-Anvisa head said, adding that Brazil is likely to have to purchase vaccines rather than produce them domestically, for the foreseeable future.Brazil’s Health Ministry said such predictions are premature and will depend on vaccine trial results. But officials have admitted the announced timeline may be hard to attain. “Although it seems remote, there is a possibility of delay in the development of the vaccine,” Elcio Franco, Brazil’s No.2 public health official, told reporters on Monday.Sao Paulo’s state government, Fiocruz, Butantan, AstraZeneca and Sinovac did not respond to requests for comment.EXPENSIVE GAMBLEBrazil’s state and federal governments are discussing additional late-stage coronavirus vaccine trials with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, China’s Sinopharm Group and Russian diplomats.But they quickly made big bets on the first two candidates to start testing in the country from AstraZeneca and Sinovac.The Sinovac deal obliges Butantan to invest 85 million reais ($16 million) to conduct trials of the Chinese vaccine. In exchange, the Sao Paulo government, which runs Butantan, will get enough doses to vaccinate 60 million people.The federal government’s memorandum of understanding with AstraZeneca requires it to buy 30 million doses of its still-unproven vaccine at a cost of $97 million, even if it fails in pivotal trials. The deal gives Brazil priority to buy 70 million more doses if the vaccine works.As part of that deal, Brazil pledged to invest 1.9 billion reais to produce the vaccine. About 1.3 billion will go toward technology transfer, and 95 million reais for updating Fiocruz facilities. The rest will be spent on processing the vaccine. The former Anvisa chief questioned Brazil’s big bet.“I really think these agreements are too risky vis-a-vis the investment,” said the source. “What will happen if the Phase III (trial) shows that these vaccines are not effective?”Brazil’s government has hedged its bets by joining the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative, which intends to guarantee fast and equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines, and aims to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.“The idea,” said a Health Ministry source not authorized to speak publicly, “is not to put all our eggs in one basket.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hotbed-for-covid-19-vaccine-testing-may-struggle-to-produce-its-own/story-8KeKYlGkGUuGL8hHUzdPMN.html
04-08-2020||World||Turkish doctors dispute official count of coronavirus infections||A leading association of Turkish doctors said on Tuesday that nearly 1,000 people are being infected with the coronavirus every day in Ankara alone, questioning the accuracy of government figures which put the daily nationwide tally of new cases at around the same level.“The number of new cases has gone up significantly over the past week,” said Ali Karakoc, the general secretary of the Ankara Chamber of Doctors, Turkey’s second largest with 13,000 members. Official data “fail to reflect the true state of play in the country.”The Ministry of Health declined to comment when asked about the allegations of discrepancies.Turkey Eases Virus Measures After Declaring #MissionAccomplishedThe intervention caps days of criticism from opposition politicians and some doctors who say the daily case count provided by Health Minister Fahrettin Koca portrays a far rosier picture than the reality. Experts began to raise doubts after the official figures began to conflict with regional and provincial numbers.Aydin Barus, governor of eastern Malatya province, said on Aug. 1 that there had been more than 100 new daily cases there in the preceding four days, according to the Hurriyet newspaper. The government reported fewer than 50 cases during that period for a broader region including Malatya and seven other provinces.Koca has been warning of a potential spike in new cases due to poor social distancing, especially in coastal towns where millions of Turks flocked after the government declared victory against the virus in June and eased restrictions to rescue a deteriorating economy.Even so, the official daily count of new infections has remained stable at under 1,000, while authorities stopped providing a detailed breakdown of patients in intensive care units or on ventilators. Hospitals are fast running out of beds and new patients are being asked to quarantine and take medication at home.“It seems as if they are making an effort to keep the daily coronavirus number below 1,000,” Bulent Nazim Yilmaz, secretary general of the Turkish Medical Association, told Bloomberg by phone. “The numbers we receive on the infected and hospitalized patients are way above the official figures.”On Tuesday, the governor’s office in the capital, Ankara, ordered all coronavirus patients except those with serious conditions to be diagnosed, isolated and treated at home. Hospitals were instructed to reserve at least half of their beds for virus patients, according to instructions sent to healthcare officials seen by Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-doctors-dispute-official-count-of-coronavirus-infections/story-S7lKCeEswNLX5brWHmxawI.html

04-08-2020||World||Malaysia police raid Al Jazeera’s office, seize computers||Malaysian police raided the office of news broadcaster Al Jazeera and two local TV stations on Tuesday, seizing computers as part of an investigation into a documentary on undocumented migrants that enraged the government.Al Jazeera, a Qatari-state owned broadcaster, said in a statement that police seized two computers during the raid, which it called a “troubling escalation” in a government crackdown on media freedom. It urged Malaysian authorities to cease the criminal investigation.Police opened an investigation last month into the Al Jazeera documentary on the treatment of undocumented migrants after officials complained it was inaccurate and biased. Seven Al Jazeera staff members have been grilled by police as part of the probe for alleged sedition, defamation and violating the Communications and Multimedia Act.Police obtained court warrants to search the offices of Al Jazeera as well as local broadcasters Astro and Unifitv, criminal investigation chief Huzir Mohamed said in a statement. The two local TV stations had reportedly aired the video.Huzir said the raids were conducted jointly with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, which is also investigating the stations.He said police seized computers which will be sent for further analysis and took statements from witnesses during the raids. “No individual or entity will be spared from action if they have violated the law,” he said.Al Jazeera said the raid was “an attack on press freedom as a whole” and urged Malaysian authorities to cease the criminal investigation.“Conducting a raid on our office and seizing computers is a troubling escalation in the authorities’ crackdown on media freedom and shows the lengths they are prepared to take to try to intimidate journalists,” said Giles Trendle, managing director of Al Jazeera English.“Al Jazeera stands by our journalists and we stand by our reporting. Our staff did their jobs and they’ve got nothing to answer for or apologize for. Journalism is not a crime,” he said.The documentary, titled “Locked Up in Malaysia’s Lockdown,” investigated undocumented immigrants it said were at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. More than 2,000 migrant workers were arrested during raids in areas in Kuala Lumpur that were placed under tight virus lockdowns.Malaysian authorities also detained a Bangladeshi man interviewed in the documentary after revoking his work permit, and said they will deport him for criticizing the government over its handling of undocumented migrants.“The authorities’ relentless pursuit of Al Jazeera seems to be driven by a desire to punish journalists who aired Malaysia’s dirty laundry rather than a good faith application of the law,” said Matthew Bugher, head of the Asia program of British-based rights group ARTICLE 19.He said Malaysia should investigate the rights violations shown in the documentary instead of targeting the filmmakers.Rights activists have voiced concern over a clampdown on freedom of speech and media independence under new Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who took power in March.Astro was recently fined for airing an Al Jazeera documentary in 2015 about the 2006 murder of a Mongolian woman that allegedly contained “offensive content.”Popular online news portal Malaysiakini and its editor face rare contempt proceedings from the attorney general over comments posted by readers against the judiciary. Police also questioned an activist about a social media post alleging mistreatment of refugees at immigration detention centers.A journalist from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post was also questioned earlier about her reporting on migrant arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-police-raid-al-jazeera-s-office-seize-computers/story-kqEs1fR3CrmSyqquSNLYpL.html
04-08-2020||World||Donald Trump signs $3 billion-a-year plan to boost conservation, parks||President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed into law legislation that will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation and maintenance of national parks and other public lands. The measure was overwhelmingly approved by Congress.“There hasn’t been anything like this since Teddy Roosevelt, I suspect,” Trump said about the 26th president, who created many national parks, forests and monuments to preserve the nation’s natural resources.Supporters say the Great American Outdoors Act is the most significant conservation legislation enacted in nearly half a century. Opponents counter that the money isn’t enough to cover the estimated $20 billion maintenance backlog on federally owned lands.The law requires full, mandatory funding of the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund and addresses the maintenance backlog facing America’s national parks and public lands. The law would spend about $900 million a year — double current spending — on the conservation fund and another $1.9 billion per year on improvements at national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and range lands.Supporters say the legislation will create at least 100,000 jobs, while restoring national parks and repairing trails and forest systems.The park maintenance backlog has been a problem for decades, through Republican and Democratic administrations.The House and the Senate cleared both bills by overwhelming bipartisan margins this summer.Among the bills’ congressional champions are Republican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana. Both are among the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents, and each represents a state where the outdoor economy and tourism at sites such as the Rocky Mountain and Yellowstone national parks play an outsize role.Daines and Gardner persuaded Trump to support the legislation at a White House meeting this year, even though Trump has repeatedly tried to slash spending for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in his budget proposals.Ivanka Trump, the Republican president’s daughter and adviser, also supported the legislation.The legislation’s opponents, mostly Republicans, complain it would not eliminate an estimated $20 billion maintenance backlog on 640 acres (259 hectares) of federally owned lands. The legislation authorizes $9.5 billion for maintenance over five years.Lawmakers from Gulf Coast states also complained that their states receive too small a share of revenue from offshore oil and gas drilling that is used to pay for the conservation fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-3-billion-a-year-plan-to-boost-conservation-parks/story-Eknz3KPFiveywa77O2hJfK.html
04-08-2020||World||Swraj Paul’s US subsidiary wins global steel excellence award||Bull Moose Tube, a subsidiary of the Caparo Bull Moose company in the United States owned by London-based industrialist Swraj Paul, has won the Fastmarkets Global Awards for Steel Excellence in the category of Best Innovation – Product. The award was announced virtually during the 11th annual Fastmarkets Global Awards for Steel Excellence, which is one of the prestigious awards in the global steel industry. The award is for the company’s hydrologic sprinkler pipe.Paul’s office said in a statement on Tuesday that Bull Moose Tube utilised advanced metallurgy that imparts a stainless steel alloy layer onto the interior and exterior diameters of a low carbon steel core creating an ultra-smooth surface that reduces resistance and pressure loss of water carried by the pipe. The product’s development centered on a new spatially optimized diffusion alloy permanently bonded to the steel’s surface. For customers, its use in some applications will mean a reduction in material, labor and associated hardware costs as the product provides high stainless-steel pipe performance in a more economical, easier-to-handle form, the statement added.Thomas A. Modrowski, president and CEO of Bull Moose Tube, said: “We are incredibly honored to be recognized for our innovation in Hydrologic Sprinkler Pipe. The team’s dedication to excellence and innovation earned this honor for our company and demonstrates that success happens in an atmosphere of teamwork and collaboration among employees and with business partners and customers”.Judges for the award looked at contenders using a point-based qualitative approach that produced 71 finalists from around the world in 23 categories. Six finalists competed for the Best Innovation – Product category. Based in Chesterfield, Missouri, the company is part of the Caparo Bull Moose group. The company operates from seven plants – six in the USA (Chicago Heights, IL; Elkhart, IN; Gerald, MO; Masury, OH; Trenton, GA; and Casa Grande, AZ) and one in Canada (Burlington, Ontario).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swraj-paul-s-us-subsidiary-wins-global-steel-excellence-award/story-C3j4B44KIvFYLEb26s22aJ.html

A third security source said there were chemcials stored in the area.Footage of the blast shared around by residents on social media showed a column of smoke rising from the port district followed by an enormous blast. Those who filming what initially appeared to be a big blaze where thrown backwards by the shock.At least 10 bodies were taken to hospitals, a security source and a medical source told Reuters.It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze that set off the blast or what kind of explosives were in the warehouses. The governor of Beirut port told Sky News that a team of firefighters at the scene had “disappeared” after the explosion.“I saw a fireball and smoke billowing over Beirut. People were screaming and running, bleeding. Balconies were blown off buildings. Glass in high-rise buildings shattered and fell to the street,” said a Reuters witness.The health minister told Reuters there was a “very high number” of injured.

04-08-2020||World||French investigation finds evidence of sexual abuse from skating coaches||The French sports ministry said on Tuesday an investigation into figure skating had produced evidence about 21 coaches which was being referred to prosecutors, with more than half accused of sexual harassment.The probe was launched following the publication in January of a book by French ice skater Sarah Abitbol in which she accused her former coach Gilles Beyer of raping her several times between 1990 and 1992. The book sparked revelations by other skaters.Twelve of the coaches are accused of “sexual harassment or sexual assault”, including three with previous convictions and seven are suspected of “physical or verbal violence”. The other two coaches are dead.Didier Gailhaguet, the president of the French ice sports federation (FFSG) for more than 20 years, was forced to resign at the beginning of February. The sports ministry and the General Inspectorate of Education, Sport and Research (IGESR) also launched an investigation into the sport. “Since the investigation found facts that could be classified as criminal offences, the head of the IGESR informed ministers that she would forward the report to the public prosecutor in Paris,” the sports ministry said in a statement.“The volume of cases identified is indicative of repeated practices and behaviours that have been passed through generations of coaches in the FFSG’s main disciplines of figure skating and ice dancing. It is unparallelled internationally,” the ministry said. The investigation also criticised the way the FFSG was run, with “a strong concentration of powers involving only a few managers,” which could only “encourage a form of omerta over the suspicions about coaches and may have led to the absence of disciplinary procedures, or even simple investigations”. Beyer is also under investigation by the Paris public prosecutor’s office, notably for rape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-investigation-finds-evidence-of-sexual-abuse-from-skating-coaches/story-Igo9hB950v6jjos0etHeiK.html

And on Tuesday, the government fixed the date.“These 400 are those who have been convicted in killings from two to 40 people, drug trafficking, those sentenced to death and involved in major crimes, including kidnapping,” Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the president, said.He said a loya jirga, regarded in the constitutional as the highest expression of the Afghan people, was required as the president was not empowered to release prisoners convicted of such crimes.Held under a giant tent, the loya jirga is a centuries-old institution used to build consensus among competing tribes, factions and ethnic groups and to discuss matters of national importance, traditionally convened under extraordinary circumstances.On Sunday, as the government and Taliban were observing the last day of three-day ceasefire for Muslim Eid holidays, Islamic State militants launched a brazen attack at a prison in eastern Nangarhar province and freed hundreds of inmates.The violence comes at a sensitive time for Afghanistan as the U.S. attempts to usher a peace deal between Afghan government and the Taliban to end 19-year-old war. Since the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Febuary, 3,560 Afghan security forces personnel have been killed in attacks by militants, thousands more have been wounded, Ghani said last week.In the same week, U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a report that more than 1,280 Afghan civilians had been killed in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of fighting between Afghan government forces and Taliban insurgents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-grand-assembly-on-fate-of-hundreds-of-taliban-prisoners-set-for-friday/story-YORCypoXxD4BZO7GrMkngN.html
04-08-2020||World||China, WHO in talks on plans to trace coronavirus origin||China and the World Health Organization are discussing plans to trace the origin of the coronavirus outbreak following a visit to the country by two experts from the UN agency, the foreign ministry said Tuesday.Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters the experts conducted “preparatory consultations on scientific research cooperation on virus tracing” during their two-week stay, which ended Sunday.Their talks touched on research in the areas of population, environment, molecules, animal traceability and transmission routes of the coronavirus, as well as plans for further scientific research, Wang said.The two sides also further investigated the possible animal source, intermediate host and transmission route of the coronavirus to “more effectively prevent and control the epidemic,” Wang said.Wang said the two sides worked on formulating a plan for China’s contribution to the global tracing effort under a resolution passed by the World Health Assembly under WHO. No word was given on when that effort will begin in earnest.The virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has been linked to a wholesale food market where wild animals were sold. Scientists think it likely jumped from a wild animal such as a bat to humans via an intermediary species, possibly the anteater-like pangolin.However, China says a full investigation may have to wait until the pandemic is under control and has rejected accusations that it delayed releasing information to WHO at the start of the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-who-in-talks-on-plans-to-trace-coronavirus-origin/story-gWzQvcWXJU9uDw12QsJxdK.html
04-08-2020||World||North Korea has ‘probably’ developed nuclear devices to fit ballistic missiles: UN report||North Korea is pressing on with its nuclear weapons program and several countries believe it has “probably developed miniaturized nuclear devices to fit into the warheads of its ballistic missiles,” according to a confidential UN report.The report by an independent panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions said the countries, which it did not identify, believed North Korea’s past six nuclear tests had likely helped it develop miniaturized nuclear devices. Pyongyang has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017.The interim report, seen by Reuters, was submitted to the 15-member UN Security Council North Korea sanctions committee on Monday.“The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is continuing its nuclear program, including the production of highly enriched uranium and construction of an experimental light water reactor. A Member State assessed that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is continuing production of nuclear weapons,” the report said. North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). North Korea’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN report. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said last week there would be no more war as the country’s nuclear weapons guarantee its safety and future despite unabated outside pressure and military threats.The UN report said one country, which it did not identify, assessed that North Korea “may seek to further develop miniaturisation in order to allow incorporation of technological improvements such as penetration aid packages or, potentially, to develop multiple warhead systems.”‘LUCRATIVE’ CYBERATTACKSNorth Korea has been subjected to UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. While the Security Council has steadily strengthened sanctions in a bid to cut off funding for those programs.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea’s demands for an end to sanctions. In May 2018 North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its main nuclear test site, Punggye-ri, which Pyongyang said was proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing. But they did not allow experts to witness the dismantlement of the site.The UN report said that as only tunnel entrances were known to have been destroyed and there is no indication of a comprehensive demolition, one country had assessed that North Korea could rebuild and reinstall within three months the infrastructure needed to support a nuclear test.The UN experts said North Korea is violating sanctions, including “through illicit maritime exports of coal, though it suspended these temporarily between late January and early March 2020” due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last year the UN experts said North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion using widespread and sophisticated cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.“The Panel continues to assess that virtual asset service providers and virtual assets will continue to remain lucrative targets for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to generate revenue, as well as mining cryptocurrencies,” the latest report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-has-probably-developed-nuclear-devices-to-fit-ballistic-missiles-un-report/story-aB2a9O5l5VXbdhPs1dWQpN.html
04-08-2020||World||American journalists in Hong Kong could be Beijing’s next target||China could take aim at American journalists in Hong Kong, if the US doesn’t renew visas for Chinese journalists, Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin said.“From what I know, given that the US side hasn’t renewed visa of Chinese journalists, Chinese side has prepared for the worst scenario that all Chinese journalists have to leave the US,” Hu said Tuesday on Twitter. “If that’s the case, Chinese side will retaliate, including targeting US journalists based in HK.”The Global Times is a tabloid run by the People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party. Hu’s tweets have become closely watched after accurately forecasting previous moves by China’s government.“Hong Kong is a part of China,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing later Tuesday. “When China is forced to make a necessary and legitimate response, it is within the legitimate diplomatic power of the Chinese government.”Wang said the US restrictions on Chinese journalists had “severely interfered with their normal operations in the US.”“The cause and responsibility for the current situation lies solely with the US,” he said. “If the US continues with its wrongdoings, China will be forced to make necessary and legitimate responses and resolutely safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests.”The US State Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In CrosshairsSuch a move would be an escalation of a tit-for-tat fight that has ensnared media employees in both countries. After the US imposed visa restrictions on Chinese journalists, Beijing in February expelled more than a dozen of their American counterparts, including three Wall Street Journal reporters.The Trump administration then ordered Chinese state-owned news outlets -- including the Xinhua News Agency -- to cut the size of their US-based staff, part of a broader response to Beijing’s restrictions on American journalists.Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong doesn’t issue journalist visas and is supposed to maintain independent control over immigration. But the city’s ability to determine its own immigration policy is being increasingly undermined.In 2018, Hong Kong denied a visa renewal for Victor Mallet of the Financial Times, following his hosting an event with a local independence activist at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club. It also refused entry to Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth. Some of the American reporters kicked out of China earlier this year weren’t allowed to go to Hong Kong.Steps to squeeze journalists in the semi-autonomous financial hub could fuel further tensions between the US and China. The world’s two biggest economies have seen relations worsen in recent months on everything from trade to Hong Kong, on which China has imposed sweeping national security legislation that’s raised fears about basic freedoms -- including of the press.The European Union said in a statement this week that the city’s proposed year-long postponement of key Legislative Council elections previously set for Sept. 6 “would delay the renewal of its democratic mandate and call into question the exercise of the democratic rights and freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong’s Basic Law.”Hu said earlier that a number of Chinese journalists will see their visas expire on Aug. 6, and “none of them” have yet been renewed. Beijing is preparing for a worst-case scenario where the US forces it to withdraw all Chinese journalists, and will retaliate “fiercely” to refusals to renew their visas, Hu wrote on Weibo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-journalists-in-hong-kong-could-be-beijing-s-next-target/story-EIp3SY4yLzb8e3qFi2vgfI.html

04-08-2020||World||UN chief says 1 billion students affected by Covid-19 closures||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday the coronavirus pandemic has led to the largest disruption of education in history, with schools closed in more than 160 countries in mid-July, affecting over 1 billion students.In addition, the UN chief said at least 40 million children worldwide have missed out on education “in their critical preschool year.”As a result, Guterres warned that the world faces “a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities.”Even before the pandemic, Guterres said, the world faced “a learning crisis,” with more than 250 million children out of school, and only a quarter of secondary school youngsters in developing countries leaving school “with basic skills.”According to a global projection covering 180 countries by the UN education agency UNESCO and partner organizations, some 23.8 million additional children and youths from pre-primary school to university level are at risk of dropping out or not having access to school next year due to the pandemic’s economic impact.“We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people,” Guterres said in a video message and a 26-page policy briefing. “The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people, and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come.”According to the policy briefing, “the unparalleled education disruption” from the pandemic is far from over and as many as 100 countries have not yet announced a date for schools to reopen.Guterres called for action in four key areas, the first being reopening schools.“Once local transmission of Covid-19 is under control,” he said, “getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority.”UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Education Stefania Giannini told reporters the Paris-based agency plans to hold a high-level virtual meeting in the fall, likely during the second half of October, to secure commitments from world leaders and the international community to place education at the forefront of recovery agendas from the pandemic.“There may be economic trade-offs, but the longer schools remain closed the more devastating the impact, especially on the poorest and most vulnerable children,” Giannini warned.She stressed that schools are not only for learning but provide social protection and nutrition, especially for vulnerable youngsters.The coronavirus crisis has amplified digital, social and gender inequalities, Giannini said, with girls, refugees, the disabled, displaced and youngsters in rural areas the most vulnerable and facing limited opportunities to continue their learning.Guterres said increasing financing for education must be given priority.Before the pandemic, low- and middle-income countries faced an education funding gap of $1.5 trillion annually, he said, and the gap in education financing globally could increase by 30% because of the pandemic.The secretary-general said education initiatives must target “those at greatest risk of being left behind,” including youngsters in crises, minorities, and the displaced and disabled. And these initiatives should urgently seek to bridge the digital divide that has become even more evident during the Covid-19 crisis, he said.On a positive note, Guterres said the pandemic is providing “a generational opportunity to reimagine education” and leap forward to systems that deliver quality education.To achieve this, he called for investments in “digital literacy and infrastructure” and education systems that are more flexible, equitable and inclusive.UNESCO’s Giannini said innovations made so far during the pandemic, including online learning and education on radio and television, “proves change can happen quickly.”She said a coalition of global organizations launched a campaign Tuesday called “Save Our Future” to amplify the voices of children and young people and urge governments worldwide to recognize that investing in education is critical to Covid-19 recovery and to the future of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-says-1-billion-students-affected-by-covid-19-closures/story-ilq67xAfra52bi6KrZXE6H.html
04-08-2020||World||Indian mission in Israel extends essential support to communities amid Covid-19 movement restrictions||The Indian Embassy in Israel has launched a unique initiative to reach out to the Indian communities in the country to provide essential consular services amid the restrictions on movement and gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Indian embassy staff have been travelling to various parts of the country once a week so that Indians and Israelis of Indian-origin looking for consular support do not face problems with urgently required documents.The service seems to have created an excitement in the Indian community with many of them appreciating the “personal touch” which they feel is creating a “strong bond”.“The idea of regular consular camps grew out of our internal exercise to set quarterly goals for ourselves in the wake of Covid-19. Given the uncertainties and restrictions flowing from Covid-19, we thought it’ll be better to take the consular services closer to those who need them in these trying times, and all over Israel,” India’s Ambassador to Israel, Sanjeev Singla, told PTI.The staff of the Indian mission have so far been to Jerusalem and Beersheba during the past two weeks and have made announcement that they will be in Haifa in the north and even in Israel’s southernmost Red Sea coastal city of Eilat to meet and extend essential consular services to the Indian community.The services are being extended while following the government guidelines in view of Covid-19 pandemic.“I couldn’t believe it when I got a call saying that I could come and collect my passport at a place really close to my student dormitory. I have been worried about it as I have to do all the formalities related to my stay here which was not possible without the passport in hand”, Shashank Shekhar, a researcher at Beersheba’s Ben-Gurion University, told PTI.“We feel cared for,” said 80-year-old Eliyahu Yosef, an Israeli of Indian-origin.Pamela, who is an OCI and immigrated to Israel some 50 years ago, narrates something similar.She needed help with her husband’s application and had been waiting to travel to Tel Aviv for months.The new initiative has brought much needed relief to the Indian students, caregivers and also Israelis of Indian-origin.“I can’t explain to you the impact this gesture has had on the Indians in Israel. It is being talked about. The personal touch has resulted in further strengthening the strong bond we have with India”, Naor Gudker, who has served as the CEO of Israel Cricket Association in the past, emphasised.Indians in Eilat and Haifa welcomed the initiative with several of them waiting to meet embassy officials with their queries.“The students have been particularly concerned about flights and I went to understand how urgent travel could be managed amid these restrictions,” Nishant, a post-doctoral fellow at the Hebrew University, said.The Indian mission’s staff also went around the country providing masks and gloves to people in the community towards the beginning of the spread of the pandemic, assuring the community of all possible help.“The pandemic will not stop us! Our new normal is to reach out & provide consular services as much as possible. Officials from the embassy of India provided consular services at Beersheba. We will soon be visiting Eilat ( August 7) and Haifa (August 14)” a tweet from the official handle of the embassy said.A flight under the Vande Bharat Mission scheme evacuated 115 Indians on May 25 and the embassy and Air India have made announcements of another being planned later this month.Israel has so far reported 74,430 cases of coronavirus and 546 deaths due to the disease, according to Israel Coronavirus Statistics Tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-mission-in-israel-extends-essential-support-to-communities-amid-covid-19-movement-restrictions/story-cayGJdF8zJUtX7K1gWnNpI.html

India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.A two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb appointed the three lawyers on Monday as it held a hearing of the petition filed by the Pakistan government to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav.Amicus Curiae is a lawyer appointed by a court to assist in any matter or case.The court also ordered a larger bench to be set up for the case. It also directed the registrar of the court to fix the proceedings at 2 pm on September 3 before a larger bench.“We appoint Mr Abid Hassan Manto, Mr Hamid Khan, Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court and former presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and Mr Makhdoom Ali Khan, Senior Advocate Supreme Court and former Attorney General of Pakistan, as amici curiae for our legal assistance in general and, in particular, to ensure that the judgement of the International Court is effectively implemented,” the court said in its order.The Pakistan government in its petition has claimed that Jadhav refused to file a review petition or an application to reconsider the verdict against him by the military court.“We feel that in order to ensure the effectiveness of the review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Commander Jadhav, a reasonable opportunity ought to be extended to the latter and the Government of India to arrange legal representation and to file a petition.“We, therefore, at this stage restrain ourselves from appointing a counsel on behalf of Commander Jadhav and advise the Government of Pakistan to extend an opportunity to Jadhav and the Government of India for arranging legal representation in terms of Article 32(1)(c) of the Convention and in accordance with the applicable laws,” the court order said.The court also asked the Pakistan government to communicate the order to the Indian government Responding to the judge’s remarks, Pakistan’s Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan said an ordinance was issued to give an opportunity to India and Jadhav to file a review petition against the sentence.“We will contact India again through the Foreign Office,” he said.He told the court that Jadhav was being taken care of and was in good health. On July 16, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav, but the Indian government said the access was “neither meaningful nor credible” and he appeared visibly under stress.In New Delhi, External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last month said Pakistan has once again exposed its “farcical” approach by denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence which is also in contravention of the ICJ verdict, and asserted that India will explore further options in the case.Srivastava said Pakistan has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available to India in the case, while noting that New Delhi has so far requested consular access to Jadhav for 12 times over the past one year.The MEA spokesperson said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of ICJ, but also of its own ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-appoints-three-senior-lawyers-as-amici-curiae-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-case/story-ulT8u4H0wiDnfEG2yy9sUJ.html

She has two young sons.According to the Dallasnews.com, a person of interest in the case has been arrested on a burglary charge.The suspect is identified as 29-year old Bakari Moncrief and is being held on a USD 1 million bond for the burglary charge.“We have our suspicions, but we have to have proof,” Plano police spokesperson David Tilley said.“And that’s what they’re looking for right now is trying to obtain proof as to whether or not this individual is or is not responsible for her death,” he said.Police say around the same time of the murder, someone broke into a house nearby on the 3400 block of Michael Drive, fox4news.com reported.“This is not something we see and definitely something very very random,” Plano police spokesperson David Tilley was quoted as saying by the WFAA.com.“For something like this to happen, clearly it concerns all of us. And we’re very hopeful that this is going to be an isolated incident,” he said.The medical examiner has not released the cause of death, and police are not saying how Sen died.An athlete, Sen used to run the popular Chisholm Trail nearly every morning before her children woke up, the report in the fox4news.com said.The incident led to an outpouring of grief and support for the family.Her family says she went for her regular run on Saturday morning and never came back.Her elder brother, Sumit Sen, a doctor, has flown in from California after hearing the news.He said that Sen had a go-getter spirit and was an avid runner.“She just immediately connected with anybody she met on a deeply personal level with a very infectious smile and energy,” Sumit, her brother, said.A day after the incident, strangers, neighbours and friends surrounded two trees near the park with flowers and hundreds of running shoes.“It touched me. It’s great when I’ve seen hundreds of shoes because you know what, people care,” Mario Major, close friend of the family, was quoted as saying by WFAA.com.“Why would something like this happen to someone who’s such a great human being?” Major said.Aneesh Chintala, who visited the memorial on Sunday to pay his respects, said, “I’m upset. I feel really bad for the family. My heart goes out to them because I know they were a nice family.” Her neighbours are also planning a memorial run next Saturday in her memory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-woman-researcher-killed-while-jogging-in-us-report/story-kK2P8YYtw9rGmxVu3pzHCM.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe number of new Covid-19 cases reported last week fell 5% from the previous week to about 435,000, according to the Reuters tally of state and county reports. California, Florida and Texas collectively accounted for nearly 180,000 of the new cases, though new infections were lower in all three states compared to the previous week.Cases rose week-over-week in 20 states, including in Oklahoma where cases have risen for nine weeks in a row, in Montana where cases are up for eight straight weeks, and in Missouri where infections have risen for seven weeks.Testing for Covid-19 fell by 6% in the United States last week, the first decline since late May, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. Nationally, 8.2% of tests came back positive for the novel coronavirus, still higher than the 5% level that the World Health Organization considers concerning because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered.Thirty-one states had positivity test rates above 5%, according to the analysis, including Alabama at 22%, Mississippi at 21%, and Florida and Kansas at 19%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-rise-for-fourth-week-new-cases-drop-5/story-eDOstCL8omA5aPUvcyRIgO.html
04-08-2020||World||US teachers protest school reopenings, coronavirus cases down in south, west||Teachers at dozens of school districts protested from their cars on Monday over plans by some US governors to resume in-class instruction during the coronavirus pandemic, while Arizona, Florida, California and Texas saw declines in new cases. The teachers, who painted messages on their cars and formed caravans with other school employees, want instruction conducted online until testing shows that classrooms are safe and districts hire more nurses and counselors.The Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association, the union representing public school teachers statewide, posted pictures on Twitter of protesters making cardboard gravestones with messages such as “Here lies a third grade student from Green Bay who caught Covid at school” and “RIP Grandma caught Covid helping grand kids with homework.” Teachers in Chicago, Milwaukee and Philadelphia honked their horns in car protests. Demonstrators rallied outside the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce building, and in Connecticut about 400 formed a car march that passed Governor Ned Lamont’s home.“I do not want to put my students or myself in harm’s way. I do not want to be an experiment,” Chicago elementary school teacher Andrea Parker told reporters.More than 155,000 people have died nationwide from Covid-19 since the virus was first identified in the United States in January. Cases nationally fell for a second week in a row but rose week-over-week in 20 states, including Missouri, Montana and Oklahoma.Deaths in the United States rose for a fourth week in a row to more than 8,500 people in the seven days ended Aug. 2, a Reuters analysis found. Cases trend down in sunbelt statesArizona, California, Florida and Texas, US states with some of the largest populations, saw fewer cases and hospitalizations.Californian Governor Gavin Newsom said intensive care unit admissions were also down in his state but it was too early to celebrate.“This virus is not going away,” Newsom said at a briefing. “It’s not going to take Labor Day weekend off or Halloween off or the holidays off. Until we have a vaccine, we are going to be living with this virus.” The governor said the decline was not enough to merit a change in his order that Californian schools begin the August term with online learning.The Los Angeles teachers union and education officials on Monday agreed to a plan for resuming online-only classes later this month in the nation’s second-largest school district. [L1N2F52C4]Schools are at the center of negotiations between Democrats in Congress and the administration of President Donald Trump over a coronavirus economic relief bill. Democratic leaders and White House negotiators both said on Monday they had made progress in those talks, though the administration said Trump could act alone if no deal is reached. With Democrat Joe Biden leading in polls ahead of the November presidential election, Trump, a Republican, has made school reopenings part of his re-election campaign.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, said in an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association on Monday that states with spiraling case numbers should consider re-imposing lockdown restrictions on residents and businesses.But Fauci told a news conference with Connecticut’s Lamont that he favored getting students back in class, citing negative psychological impacts of keeping them home as well as the role schools play in feeding children.“The default position should be to try as best as you possibly can to open up the schools for in-person learning,” Fauci said.Previously hard-hit parts of New York and New Jersey with dense populations have seen an increase in new cases in recent days, prompting New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy to reduce indoor limits to 25 people per room from 100.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he would announce later this week whether to reopen schools in his state, which has recorded by far the greatest number of Covid-19 deaths, more than 32,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-teachers-protest-school-reopenings-coronavirus-cases-down-in-south-west/story-cgL9a60pWfTcMxYiBUI84O.html

The building fund is expected to deliver 45,000 new homes and the brownfield program 26,000, the government said.“As we get Britain building we are also laying the foundations for a green recovery by investing in vital infrastructure for local communities, creating jobs and building environmentally-friendly homes,” Jenrick said in an emailed statement.Among the projects that will receive funding is a new high-speed railway station at Thanet, on England’s south east coast, and a new commercial space in Manchester, north west England. Across all the funded projects, the government estimates the investment will create 85,000 new jobs.The details of the Green Homes Grant program, helping 600,000 homeowners to make their properties more energy efficient, were announced at the same time. The grants will cover as much as 5,000 pounds of work. Lower income households can claim as much as 10,000 pounds each.The program will cover insulation and double-glazing, as well as the installation of ground source heat pumps, energy efficient doors and heat controls. Households will be offered a list of approved tradespeople within their local area to carry out the work, and vouchers will be issued from September.The grants will “help to protect and create jobs, while also saving people money and cutting carbon,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-1-7-billion-in-building-projects-to-boost-economy/story-IAIbF9QWTmBujh3WtNnL1N.html

The new restrictions took effect from June 24. The H1B visa, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. “Today I am signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule, higher American,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House before signing the order against hiring H-1B visa holders for federal contracts.Trump told reporters that his administration will not tolerate firing of hardworking Americans in the pursuit of cheap foreign labour. “As we speak, we’re finalising the H-1B regulation so that no American workers be replaced ever again. H-1B should be used for top highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labour programmes and destroy American job,” said the president who was surrounded across the Cabinet Room table with individuals campaigning against job outsourcing. Prominent among them were Sara Blackwell, founder and president of Florida-based Protect US Workers organisation; Jonathan Hicks, a software engineer in the Tennessee Valley Authority; and Kevin Lynn, founder of Pennsylvania-based US Tech Workers.The executive order requires all federal agencies to complete an internal audit and assess whether they are in compliance with the requirement that only US citizens and nationals are appointed to the competitive service. As a result, the Department of Labour will also finalise guidlines to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers’ job sites to displace Americans workers.Trump’s order follows the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) announcement that it will outsource 20 per cent of its technology jobs to companies based in foreign countries. TVA’s action could cause more than 200 highly-skilled American tech workers in Tennessee to lose their jobs to low-wage, foreign workers hired on temporary work visas, the president said.Outsourcing hundreds of workers is especially detrimental in the middle of a pandemic, which has already cost millions of Americans their jobs, the White House said in a statement. Given the current climate of rampant intellectual property theft, outsourcing IT jobs that involve sensitive information could pose a national security risk, it said.According to the White House, Trump’s actions will help combat employers’ misuse of H-1B visas, which were never intended to replace qualified American workers with low-cost foreign labour. One of the participants present during the signing of the order told the president that as many as 70 per cent of the H-1B visa goes to people from India.Trump said he favours a merit-based immigration system that brings in high-skilled people that creates jobs inside the US and not take jobs of Americans.“We are going to be discussing very shortly an immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It will be a very, very comprehensive bill. It’s a word that some people love, and some people hate. But it’d be very comprehensive only in the sense that it covered just about everything. It will be based on merit. It will cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to,” Trump said.The bill, he said, will be signed after the convention. “Immigration will be very merit based, but it’ll be, it’ll be great for the worker. And it’ll be great for people coming into our country, but coming into our country legally and loving the country and wanting to help our country as opposed to people coming in. And they don’t like our country,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-order-against-hiring-h-1b-visa-holders-for-us-federal-contracts/story-qHtIQVSS6eM2tkIJHKBsMP.html

The hurricane made landfall just after 11 p.m. on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (136 km/h).Coastal shops and restaurants closed early, power began to flicker at oceanfront hotels and even the most adventurous of beachgoers abandoned the sand Monday night as newly restrengthened Hurricane Isaias sped toward the Carolinas.The US National Hurricane Center warned oceanside home dwellers to brace for storm surge up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) and up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in spots, as Isaias moved up the coast. The Carolinas weren’t the only states at risk.“All those rains could produce flash flooding across portions of the eastern Carolinas and mid-Atlantic, and even in the northeast US,” said Daniel Brown, senior hurricane specialist at the US National Hurricane Center. A tropical storm warning extended all the way up to Maine, where flash flooding was possible in some areas on Wednesday.The center also warned of possible tornadoes in North Carolina on Monday night and early Tuesday, and from eastern Virginia to southern New England later Tuesday.Isaias (pronounced ees-ah-EE-ahs) was upgraded again from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane at 11 p.m. EDT. The storm was centered about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east northeast of Myrtle Beach. It was moving north northeast at 22 mph (35 kph). The Hurricane Center said it expected the storm to make landfall early Tuesday near southern North Carolina.Isaias killed two people in the Caribbean and roughed up the Bahamas but remained at sea as it brushed past Florida over the weekend, providing some welcome relief to emergency managers who had to accommodate mask-wearing evacuees in storm shelters.President Donald Trump on Monday described Isaias as “very serious.”“Storm surge and inland flooding are possible and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes,” Trump said.Authorities in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, ordered swimmers out of the water to avoid rough surf and strong rip currents. By nightfall, power began to flicker at beachfront hotels as Isaias crossed the last bit of warm water on its path toward the US mainland.Still, on this part of the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts that has been affected to varying degrees by seven tropical storms or hurricanes since 2014, residents weren’t panicking.“It’s just going to be a lot of wind and high tide,” said Mike Fuller, who has lived along the coast for more than a decade.As the storm neared the shore, a gauge on a pier in Myrtle Beach recorded its third highest water level since it was set up in 1976. Only Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 pushed more salt water inland.Oceanfront streets throughout the area flooded as the sea ended up nearly 10 feet (3 meters) above low tide.Up the coast in southern North Carolina, high winds from Isaias’ inner core knocked down trees and power lines, blocking roads. No major damage was initially reported.Shops and restaurants appeared quieter than usual for a summertime Monday in North Myrtle Beach, but locals blamed Covid-19 more than Isaias. No businesses were boarding up their windows, although some moved outside furniture inside.Wayne Stanley and his family came to the city over the weekend from Julian, North Carolina. He’s never experienced a hurricane, but said he never considered canceling his family’s weeklong vacation either.“I was pretty scared to start off with,” Stanley said Monday. “Then we thought maybe it’s not going to be that bad.”Officials in frequently flooded Charleston, South Carolina, handed out sandbags and opened parking garages so residents on the low-lying peninsula could stow their cars above ground. Forecasters had warned earlier of possible major flooding, but the storm passed faster than expected and only about a dozen streets were flooded.Farther up the coast into North Carolina, the hurricane center predicted storm surges of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters) when Isaias moves onshore.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents on Monday that the storm could be dangerous regardless of its strength. He urged those evacuating to turn to shelters as a last resort, citing coronavirus risks and the need to operate shelters at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing.“Whether it’s labeled a tropical storm or a hurricane, you should take this storm seriously, and make sure your family is ready,” Cooper said.Ferry operators wrapped up evacuations from Ocracoke Island in North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Monday, moving more than 3,500 people and 1,700 vehicles off the island over four days. Island officials were taking no chances after taking a beating less than a year ago from Hurricane Dorian. Evacuation orders also have been issued for Hatteras Island north of Ocracoke.Morgan Stewart said many evacuating residents had come into the store where she works in the inland community of Kinston to buy tarps, batteries, flashlights and other supplies.“You can tell they’re worried,” said Stewart, who saw cars parked on higher ground over the weekend as she secured her boat at a marina.Since forming last week, Isaias has been buffeted by competing forces both trying to kill and strengthen it, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.“Of all the places it could be, it found the warmest water it could,” which fuels storm development, McNoldy said. “And yet it is struggling.”That’s because dry air kept working its way into the storm at low and mid-levels, which chokes storms.Isaias’ passage near Florida over the weekend was particularly unwelcome to authorities already dealing with surging coronavirus caseloads. The storm brought heavy rain and flooding to the state, forcing authorities to close outdoor virus testing sights, as well as beaches and parks. Officials lashed signs to palm trees so they wouldn’t blow away.About 150 people had to keep masks on while sheltering in Palm Beach County, which had a voluntary evacuation order for people living in homes that can’t withstand dangerous winds, said emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-isaias-makes-landfall-in-north-carolina/story-MSYXlpxdnBxYa1oxpAaY0H.html

04-08-2020||World||Manhattan DA probing Trump and his business over more than ‘hush-money’ payments||Manhattan’s district attorney on Monday suggested a grand jury subpoena for US President Donald Trump’s tax returns was part of an investigation of “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,” including alleged insurance and bank fraud. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance raised the scope of the probe in court papers filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday. He is seeking to dismiss Trump’s latest challenge to the subpoena for eight years of personal and corporate tax records.Asked about the investigation at a coronavirus press briefing on Monday, Trump repeated that he believed he is the victim of a political “witch hunt,” which he said was “Democrats’ stuff” and started “even before I got in” to office.“There is nothing that I know even about it,” he added.Trump is scheduled to respond to Vance’s motion to dismiss by Aug. 10. In a court filing last week, Trump’s lawyers argued the subpoena was “wildly overbroad” and issued in “bad faith.”Vance noted in the court papers that when the subpoena was issued last August, there were “public allegations of possible criminal activity” at the Trump Organization dating back a decade. He said public reports show a basis for each category and timeframe of documents sought from Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA.Trump’s argument that the subpoena is overbroad “rests on the false premise that the grand jury’s investigation is limited to so-called ‘hush-money’ payments made by Michael Cohen” on Trump’s behalf in 2016, Vance said.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign violations tied to the payments to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former model Karen McDougal, who claimed they had affairs with Trump, which he denies. In a footnote to Monday’s filing, Vance cited media reports on Trump’s alleged role in the hush-money scheme and on the “unorthodox strategies” he used to expand his real estate empire. He also cited reports of questionable financial statements by Trump, such as when he claimed 55 zoned lots ready for sale at his golf course in Southern California when there were only 31; a 2,000 acre Virginia vineyard that is really only 1,200 acres, and 68 stories at his Trump Tower, 10 higher than the Manhattan property.Cohen testified to Congress last year that Trump inflated his assets when it served his purposes, and deflated them to reduce his real estate taxes. He called his former boss a “con man” and “cheat.”Trump has tweeted that Cohen is a “rat” who was lying to reduce his prison time. The dispute over Trump’s taxes already was subject to a ruling from the US Supreme Court last month that the president was not immune from state criminal probes. Vance urged the court to dismiss Trump’s latest challenge to the subpoena “without delay,” arguing the complaint “merely regurgitates allegations and arguments this court has rejected before.” Vance brought in a high-profile lawyer to assist with the case: Former acting solicitor general Walter Dellinger, onetime head of the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel.Last month, the DA’s office warned US District Court Judge Victor Marrero against allowing statutes of limitations to expire on the alleged crimes.A spokesman for Vance declined comment on the court papers. Grand jury deliberations are secret, and the public may not learn what the subpoena uncovers until after the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manhattan-da-probing-trump-and-his-business-over-more-than-hush-money-payments/story-wo4OVtUWHaoi5lRf4cj9NM.html
04-08-2020||World||Trump seeks TikTok payment to US, despite no clear authority||President Donald Trump repeatedly insisted on Monday that any sale of TikTok’s US operations would have to include a substantial payment to the US -- but it wasn’t clear under what authority he can extract a payout.It would be unprecedented, based on recent history, for the US government to collect a cut of a transaction involving companies in which it doesn’t hold a stake. Trump said the money would come from China or an American buyer such as Microsoft Corp.“The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we’re making it possible,” Trump told reporters at a news conference Monday evening. “Whatever the number is, it would come from the sale, which nobody else would be thinking out but me, but that’s the way I think. And I think it’s very fair.”Earlier in the day, Trump said TikTok will have to close in the US by Sept. 15 -- unless there’s a deal to sell the social network’s domestic operations to Microsoft or another American company.Trump set off a furious scramble over the fate of the Chinese-owned app on Friday, when he said he would ban the company’s operations through an executive action on Saturday. But the weekend passed without any official move from the White House, after the president spoke with Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella about his company’s efforts to purchase the viral video application.Clock tickingMicrosoft said in a blog post that it was aiming to complete a deal for TikTok’s operations in the US, as well as in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, no later than Sept. 15. The White House had insisted upon that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. It could prove an uphill climb, with key details for the deal -- including price -- still not worked out, people familiar with the discussions said.Microsoft’s blog post also said it’s committed to “providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.” That language referred to tax revenue and job creation, according to a person familiar with the matter -- rather than some sort of special transaction fee.Trump compared the arrangement to landlord-tenant dynamics. “Without the lease, the tenant doesn’t have the value,” he said. “Well, we’re sort of in a certain way the lease. We make it possible to have this great success.”The US assesses fees associated with deals under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which investigates overseas acquisitions of US businesses. But those charges -- set on a sliding scale and going no higher than $300,000 -- didn’t fit what Trump described.CFIUS has been reviewing ByteDance Ltd.’s 2017 purchase of the lip-synching app Musical.ly that was later folded into TikTok.The White House has said it’s concerned that ByteDance could be compelled to hand over American users’ data to Beijing or use the app to influence the 165 million Americans, and more than 2 billion users globally, who have downloaded it. And Trump has looked to ratchet up pressure on China ahead of November’s election, frustrated by slow implementation of the trade pact inked earlier this year and the spread of the coronavirus for which he blames China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-seeks-tiktok-payment-to-us-despite-no-clear-authority/story-CRw6RjTN5mHJ9nLj0FeM5N.html
04-08-2020||World||Vehicle malfunction sparked Southern California wildfire||A wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles that has forced thousands of people from their homes was sparked by a malfunctioning diesel vehicle, fire officials said Monday.The vehicle spewed burning carbon from its exhaust system, igniting several fires Friday on Oak Glen Road in Cherry Valley, and authorities were asking anyone who may have seen such a vehicle at the time to contact investigators, according to a statement from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The blaze in Riverside County, among several wildfires across California, had consumed more than 41 square miles (about 106 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber since it broke out Friday evening, fire officials said.As of Monday afternoon, it was just 5% contained and the fire along with coronavirus precautions made for added stress at an evacuation center, said John Medina, an American Red Cross spokesman.Volunteers used to “close contact” with evacuees have had to adjust their approach during a time of social distancing, Medina said.“I mean, that’s part of the recovery of a disaster, is that you have to show warmth and love and caring. And that’s hard when you’re standing 6 feet away. So that’s the biggest challenge,” Medina told KESQ-TV.Bill Boehm helped his mother evacuate her home with her three horses and said the pandemic hasn’t stopped people from coming together to assist each other.“Everyone seemed to be wearing masks and such, so that type of precaution was still going on,” Boehm told the news station.The blaze began as two adjacent fires in a rural area near the city of Beaumont, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.Flames raced along brushy ridge tops and came close to houses while firefighters attacked from the ground and air.One home and two outbuildings were destroyed, California fire officials said. No injuries were reported.In Northern California, evacuations were ordered after a wildfire that sparked Sunday afternoon spread quickly and burned near homes near the East Park Reservoir in Colusa County. Complicating firefighters’ efforts were temperatures in the area north of Sacramento climbed to 98 degrees (37 Celsius) by Monday afternoon. The fire was 40% contained.On California’s central coast, a fire in San Luis Obispo County was 60% contained Monday after burning more than 2 square miles (6 square kilometers) of brush east of the community of Santa Margarita. Two structures were destroyed but officials said it was unclear whether they were homes.In Riverside County, officials allowed flames from the Apple Fire to run up the side of Mount San Gorgonio, an 11,000-foot (3,350-meter) peak, because it wasn’t safe to let crews work in such steep, rugged terrain, said Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.Evacuation orders and advisories were issued for about 2,500 homes in mountain, canyon and foothill neighborhoods. Campgrounds and hiking trails were closed in the San Gorgonio Wilderness area of the San Bernardino National Forest.A smoke plume was visible for miles around and contributed to poor air quality.Firefighters fought the blaze in scorching weather. The temperature hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) on Monday in nearby Palm Spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vehicle-malfunction-sparked-southern-california-wildfire/story-oIQPGCoSzxqaSVpjn75QsI.html
04-08-2020||World||Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume dies at 83||John Hume, the visionary politician who won a Nobel Peace Prize for fashioning the agreement that ended violence in his native Northern Ireland, has died at 83, his family said Monday.The Catholic leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party, Hume was seen as the principal architect of Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace agreement. He shared the prize later that year with the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, for their efforts to end the sectarian violence that plagued the region for three decades and left more than 3,500 people dead.“I want to see Ireland as an example to men and women everywhere of what can be achieved by living for ideals, rather than fighting for them, and by viewing each and every person as worthy of respect and honor,” he said in 1998. “I want to see an Ireland of partnership, where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalized and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.”Hume died Monday morning after suffering from ill health for several years, his family said.Born on Jan. 18, 1937, in Northern Ireland’s second city — Londonderry to British Unionists, Derry to Irish nationalists — Hume trained for the priesthood before becoming a fixture on Northern Ireland’s political landscape. An advocate of nonviolence, he fought for equal rights in what was then a Protestant-ruled state, but he condemned the Irish Republican Army because of his certainty that no injustice was worth a human life.Although he advocated for a united Ireland, Hume believed change could not come to Northern Ireland without the consent of its Protestant majority. He also realized that better relations needed to be forged between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and between London and Dublin.He championed the notion of extending self-government to Northern Ireland with power divided among the groups forming it.“Ireland is not a romantic dream; it is not a flag; it is 4.5 million people divided into two powerful traditions,″ he said. “The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real division of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.”While both Hume and Trimble credited the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for approving a referendum that led to power sharing, it was Hume’s diplomacy that offered the impetus to the peace process that led to the 1998 Good Friday accord.Hume won the breakthrough in Belfast’s political landscape in 1993 by courting Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire. That dialogue burnished Adams’ international credibility and led to two IRA cease-fires in 1994 and 1997.Like most Protestant politicians at the time, Trimble had opposed efforts to share power with Catholics as something that would jeopardize Northern Ireland’s union with Britain. He at first refused to speak directly with Adams, insisting that IRA commanders needed to prove they were willing to abandon violence.He ultimately relented and became pivotal in peacemaking efforts.Hume had envisioned a broad agenda for the discussions, arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the British and Irish governments. The process was overseen by neutral figures like U.S. mediator George Mitchell, with the decisions overwhelmingly ratified by public referendums in both parts of Ireland.“Without John Hume, there would not have been a peace process,” Mitchell said at the time the prize was announced. ”Without David Trimble, there would not have been a peace agreement.”Hume and Trimble were said to have had a frosty relationship. But Trimble on Monday described a thawing after the Nobel ceremony in Oslo, recalling that the hotel at which they were staying had suggested the two men chose to relax away from each other.“We didn’t do that. We relaxed and in some sense celebrated the occasion jointly, and that for me spelt out the principle for how we were going to proceed in the years after that,” he told the BBC.Tributes poured in after’s Hume’s death was announced, including praise from Adams, who called him a “giant in Irish politics.” Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was in office at the time the accord was signed, lauded Hume’s “epic” contribution to the peace process.Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement describing their sadness.“Through his faith in principled compromise, and his ability to see his adversaries as human beings, John helped forge the peace that has held to this day,’’ they said.U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Northern Ireland of today is Hume’s legacy.“He stood proudly in the tradition that was totally opposed to violence and committed to pursuing his objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means,’’ Johnson said on Twitter. “His vision paved the way for the stability, positivity and dynamism of the Northern Ireland of today and his passing is a powerful reminder of how far Northern Ireland has come.’’Hume’s family said his funeral would be in keeping with strict guidelines on attendees because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A memorial will be arranged later.“We are grateful for your condolences and support, and we appreciate that you will respect the family’s right to privacy at this time of great loss,’’ the family said in a statement. “It seems particularly apt for these strange and fearful days to remember the phrase that gave hope to John and so many of us through dark times: ‘We shall overcome.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-peace-prize-winner-john-hume-dies-at-83/story-IKpZ4FuT7ewMgQBgTJ7P9J.html
04-08-2020||World||France halts ratification of Hong Kong extradition treaty||France on Monday said it was halting ratification of an extradition treaty with Hong Kong over China’s controversial national security law for the city, just hours after Beijing suspended a similar pact with New Zealand. “In light of the latest developments, France will not proceed as it stands with the ratification of the extradition agreement signed on May 4, 2017 between France and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement.Earlier in the day, China suspended Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with New Zealand. France and New Zealand are the latest to join a string of Western powers including Canada, UK, Australia and Germany that suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong since the controversial law was introduced in late June.China has already hit back by suspending Hong Kong’s extradition treaties with Canada, Britain and Australia. “New Zealand’s practices... grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said while announcing Beijing’s decision to suspend any judicial cooperation with Wellington.Critics say the security law will erode civil liberties and human rights enjoyed by residents in the former British colony, which was returned to China in 1997.New Zealand has also tightened restrictions on military and dual-use exports to Hong Kong.Chinese and Australian diplomats sparred on Twitter over Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea following Australia’s endorsement of a US statement that it would recognise virtually none of China’s territorial claims there.Australia recently filed a memorandum with the United Nations saying the claims were “without legal basis,” plunging Canberra into the controversy that has drawn angry responses from Beijing. Australian High Commissioner Barry O’Farrell tweeted on Thursday he told Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar that China’s moves were “destabilising and could provoke escalation.”Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong responded on Friday by accusing O’Farrell of “disregarding facts,” writing: “It’s clear who safeguard peace&stability & destabilise&provoke escalations in the region.”O’Farrell shot back saying China should follow a 2016 international tribunal ruling that rejected most of Beijing’s claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-halts-ratification-of-hong-kong-extradition-treaty/story-kaYufRuJGYfiIT0XH3Un9N.html
04-08-2020||World||Ex Pope Benedict’s condition ‘not particularly worrying’: Vatican||The Vatican, responding to a German newspaper report that former Pope Benedict XVI was seriously ill, said on Monday his condition was “not particularly worrying” and that he was overcoming a painful but not grave ailment.The clarification came hours after Benedict’s biographer, Peter Seewald, sparked alarm by telling the Passauer Neue Presse that he had found the 93-year-old ex-pope exceptionally frail when he visited him on Saturday.Seewald said Benedict, who has been in shaky health for some time, was now suffering from shingles, a viral infection that causes painful rashes and is common among older people.“The health conditions of the Pope Emeritus are not particularly worrying, apart from being those of an old man of 93 who is overcoming the most acute phase of a painful but not grave illness,” the statement said.Seewald said Benedict’s voice was barely audible - echoing something other visitors have said for months - and that the former pope told him he might pick up writing again if he regains his strength.In June, Benedict, who lives in a former convent in the Vatican gardens, left Italy for the first time since his resignation in 2013 for an emotional farewell visit to his older brother Georg in their native Bavaria.Georg Ratzinger died on July 1 aged 96. The two brothers were ordained priests on the same day in 1951.Benedict, who was elected in 2005 to succeed the widely popular Pope John Paul II after a reign of nearly 27 years, shocked the world and even his closest aides on Feb. 11, 2013, when he announced in Latin he was stepping down.He told a gathering of cardinals that he was too old and frail to lead an institution with more than 1.3 billion members.At the time of Benedict’s resignation the Vatican was mired in a raft of financial woes, sexual abuse scandals and infighting among bureaucrats that led to leaks of important documents.Benedict said his resignation was for exclusively health reasons.Hardline conservatives in the Church who have been alarmed by Pope Francis’ progressive moves have looked to Benedict as their standard bearer. This forced the former pope on several occasions to remind them that there is only one pope - Francis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-pope-benedict-s-condition-not-particularly-worrying-vatican/story-qPJgu9wULTzCJJkodOIUaO.html

04-08-2020||World||Spain to roll out Covid-19 app twice as effective as human tracers in pilot||Spain aims to roll out a Covid-19 contact-tracing app across the country in September after saying on Monday that a pilot showed it could detect almost twice as many potential infections as human trackers during a simulated outbreak on a tiny island. In the absence of a vaccine or cure, states are deploying Bluetooth wireless technology to log contacts and alert people when someone they have been near tests positive.Spain used a new system developed by Google and Apple which holds data on individual devices to ensure privacy, to build an app it tested on La Gomera, an island next to the tourist hotspot of Tenerife in the Canary archipelago, in July.Now the government aims to offer it to regional health authorities who could have it ready by mid-September, and from Aug. 10 to tourism-dependent areas or places where cases are rising, said Carme Artigas, head of the state digital and artificial intelligence unit.“The app sees more than we see because we only remember contacts with people we know, but the app also remembers contacts with strangers,” Artigas said.“It is anonymous and much less intrusive than receiving a call from someone who wants to reconstruct everything you have done for the past 15 days,” Artigas added.Some 3,200 people downloaded the app, just pipping a target of 3,000.Participants anonymously entered randomly distributed codes into the app, some of which falsely indicated a positive Covid-19 test, which then alerted everyone with whom they had spent a minimum of 15 minutes at a proximity of 2 metres (6.5 ft) or less.For every virtual positive diagnosis, the app identified an average 6.4 contacts with others, Artigas’s ministry said in a statement, compared with an average 3.5 contacts identified by human tracers in the Canary Islands. The spread of the disease in Spain slowed as the government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe and as many countries limited international travel, but new cases have started rising again, hitting a post-lockdown record of 1,525 on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-to-roll-out-covid-19-app-twice-as-effective-as-human-tracers-in-pilot/story-GDsiDHQHQbNYwwEnnJwIyN.html
04-08-2020||World||Spain’s new wave of infections hits the young, middle-aged||Like most Spaniards, Emma Gaya thought the worst of the pandemic was behind her.Spain’s government had ended a three-month lockdown after an Covid-19 onslaught that claimed at least 28,400 lives in the European Union nation. To kickstart its stalled economy, Spaniards were encouraged to cautiously resume their lives under a “new normality” based on wearing face masks, washing hands and social distancing.The respite didn’t last long.Outbreaks among farm workers and young people desperate to resume socializing after being cooped up have spread across northern Spain, spawning what some health officials fear could be the start of a dreaded “second wave” of infections.“It pains me to think that we could be right back where we were,” Gaya said after getting tested for coronavirus at her local health clinic in Sant Sadurni D’Anoia, a village near Barcelona. She came in because she had a fever, one of the typical symptoms of Covid-19, along with a dry cough and the loss of a sense of smell.“I think we had done things well. Now I don’t know if we are doing it well at all. I’m not sure at what point we are safe,” Gaya said.On June 22, the day after Spain ended a national state of emergency and restored free movement around the country, the health ministry registered 125 new cases in 24 hours. Six weeks later, the daily count has jumped, hitting 1,525 on Friday.Spain is leading Western Europe’s major countries with an average of 60 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants. While the country’s south and the Canary and Balearic Islands remain in good shape, the regions of Navarra, Aragón, and Catalonia have registered more than 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a 14-day period, making Spain’s northeast the biggest European hot spot along with parts of Romania, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.In contrast to the darkest weeks of March and April, when the virus ripped through Spain’s elderly in nursing homes and pushed the country’s hospitals to the breaking point, the pressure is now on Spain’s neighborhood health clinics. They are trying to screen and isolate the new infections, which are taking place mostly among the young, who in Spain and countries across the world are ignoring social distancing, and the middle-aged.The average age of a virus patient in Spain has fallen from 63 in the spring to 45 now and “the pressure on the health system is low,” said Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa. Since the virus takes a heavier toll on the elderly, younger coronavirus patients means more who have milder symptoms.Spain’s improved testing capacity makes a comparison to the start of the pandemic difficult. In February, March and April, a shortage of tests meant that only the very sick who were admitted to hospitals were tested and that a significant number of coronavirus cases went undetected.Now, local clinics are discovering many more infections among those who don’t show symptoms.“We are in a different situation (than the spring) because right now we have tests available,” said Dr. Miriam Ceña, director of the health clinics in Sant Sadurni D’Anoia, which is seeing a jump in cases like the area around Barcelona, Catalonia’s largest city.“We are in a situation of risk and alert. We don’t want to alarm the population, but we want the population to be responsible,” Ceña said. “In March, there was the lockdown so the situation was under more control. Right now, there is free movement and socializing and those are a risk of contagion.”The surge in new infections is sure to add to the drastic contraction of Spain’s economy by slamming hopes of reactivating the country’s critical tourism sector. The economy has already dropped 18% in the second quarter — its biggest dip since Spain’s 1936-39 Civil War.Britain has placed a 14-day quarantine on travelers returning from Spain, while France, Germany, and Belgium have all issued travel warnings or discouraged trips to northeast Spain.Authorities have for several weeks warned about the danger of new outbreaks, but experts predicted they would likely occur in the colder months. Instead, the surge has come in mid-summer, when Spaniards are eager to reconnect with family and friends, and hotels, restaurants and shops are counting on both domestic and foreign tourists to cushion the pandemic’s blow to their balance sheets.Spain must now pull off the delicate balancing act of managing the health crisis while reactivating its economy. Officials desperately hope they can avoid another full lockdown that would be catastrophic to businesses and jobs despite the expected injection of massive aid from the European Union.Catalonia and many other regions have reintroduced restrictions, making masks obligatory at all times outside the home and reclosing nightclubs due to their links to outbreaks.“We must be obsessive about complying with the protection measures,” said Catalonia’s public health director, Josep Argimon.Catalonia, however, is only now deploying 600 workers to its clinics to help nurses and doctors handle the demands of contact tracing, which has been insufficient so far. That lack of urgency has drawn strong criticism from health workers and mayors.Spain’s government is rolling out a phone app to help contract tracers find and stamp out new infections, while making a renewed appeal for individuals to act responsibly.“There are many citizens who feel anguish upon seeing the outbreaks that are happening in different parts of our country,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Friday. “Because we have all had to make an enormous effort to be disciplined, show resistance and muster the will to defeat the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-s-new-wave-of-infections-hits-the-young-middle-aged/story-yvZBexEX0NpEoGJm4lumwN.html
04-08-2020||World||With loan money gone, restaurants are at mercy of coronavirus||The check has arrived and beleaguered restaurant owners across America are looking down on their empty wallets.Government coronavirus loans in the spring helped eating establishments rehire laid-off employees and ride out the pandemic’s initial surge and wave of shutdown orders.But that Paycheck Protection Program money has now been spent at many restaurants, leaving them in the same precarious position they were in during outbreak’s early days: Thousands of restaurants are being forced to close down again on mandates from state and local officials combating the virus’s resurgence, particularly in the South and West.And even in parts of the country where the outbreak appears contained, restaurants’ revenue is far below normal because social distancing requirements — and wary diners — mean fewer tables, fewer customers and limited hours.John Pepper used a PPP loan to pay employees and reopen four of his eight Boloco restaurants when Massachusetts lifted its shutdown order in early May. But with the money spent and business at the restaurants down as much as 70%, Pepper had to again close two locations. The staff of 125 he had before the virus outbreak is down to 50.“A lot of this is out of our hands at this point,” Pepper says. “At this moment, I don’t see getting my full payroll back.”Congress is debating another relief bill that potentially will have more help for small businesses, but even with more loan or grant money, restaurants will remain at the mercy of the virus that has decimated their business.The virus’s resurgence has prompted officials in California, Texas, Florida and other states to order restaurants shut again. In the Northeast and other parts of the country where infection rates appear more stable, no one expects limits on inside dining to be lifted anytime soon.Restaurants generally have a low profit margin, between 5% and 6%, and they achieve that only if they have a full house virtually every day, says Sean Kennedy, executive vice president for the trade group National Restaurant Association. They also tend to have only about two weeks of cash on hand, making them highly vulnerable when their sales are down.“They aren’t designed to have an on-off switch. They’re designed to be used seven days a week, 14 to 15 hours a day at 100% of capacity,” Kennedy says.Gerry Cea was forced to shut his Miami restaurant, Cafe Prima Pasta, from March into May when the outbreak first began. Now, he has again closed the dining room as local officials try to contain the virus; the Miami/Dade area is one of Florida’s hit hardest by the virus.Cea is still able to serve customers outside, but the intense South Florida heat and frequent summer rains are limiting him to about 40 diners a night instead of the hundreds he served before the pandemic hit. And Cea is mindful that the peak hurricane season is still to come.“With the PPP money we received, we were able to pay 48 employees but that has run out now, so we are left with very few alternatives” for funding, Cea says. He’s hoping for more help from the government, even if it’s a loan that must be repaid.In the meantime, Cea says, “the only reason we are pretty much surviving is because we own the building,” he says.The pandemic has devastated an industry that expected to have nearly $900 billion in sales this year. Before the outbreak, the Labor Department counted 12 million workers in restaurants and bars, and nearly two-thirds worked at small businesses with fewer than 500 workers. In April, employment in restaurants and bars of all sizes had been cut by nearly half as establishments across the country were closed.Restaurants were among the small businesses the Paycheck Protection Program was intended to help, but some owners say it was of limited use.The program so far has given about $42 billion in loans to restaurants, bars and lodging companies. But many restaurants burned through loans quickly because the original terms of the program required them to use the money within eight weeks in order to get loan forgiveness. Many establishments couldn’t reopen but paid staffers not to work anyway. Then when they reopened with revenue limited by social distancing, they couldn’t afford their full payrolls. Congress changed the spending requirement to 24 weeks in early June, but that was too late for many restaurants.It’s not yet known what small business help will be in any upcoming relief package, although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has mentioned the possibility that small businesses with big revenue declines could get a second PPP loan.But restaurants need a long-term solution that addresses their particular needs, Kennedy says. For example, allowing families that get food stamp assistance to use their benefits in restaurants.“We’re going to be limping along or shutting down altogether” without long-term help, Kennedy says.Stephanie Williams still hasn’t fully reopened two of her Bennu Coffee shops in Austin, Texas, and continues to operate with curbside service and delivery only; a third location that opened over the weekend does have socially distanced seating. Williams has spent the PPP money she got in early May — she had recalled furloughed workers but with revenue at one store down by half and the other by nearly two-thirds, Williams had to let 20 staffers go again.“We assumed at the end of eight weeks, this will be over. But here in Texas, things are drastically worse than when we shut down in March,” Williams says. Like other states where the virus is resurgent, Texas saw cases increase after it ended shutdown orders in early May.Even in areas where the virus appears stable and restaurants can have inside dining, they’re struggling. Wolf’s Ridge Brewing, a Columbus, Ohio, restaurant and brewery, has had to close its dining room and return to takeout and delivery, having used its PPP money and not having enough revenue due to social distancing.“What the PPP did was put us in a position where we brought people back before we had enough business to support them,” co-founder Bob Szuter says. He’s trying to figure out new ways to bring in revenue, focusing more on the brewery side of the business until it’s safe to have a full dining room.Jason Brauner’s restaurant, Bourbon Bistro, exhausted its PPP loan, is operating at 50% of capacity and not making enough to cover its expenses. Brauner is worried that the virus’s resurgence will force the Louisville, Kentucky, establishment to close; he had shut completely for two weeks in March before switching to curbside service and then gradually reopened. He’s paid his full staff throughout.Brauner is hoping to get a grant from the city and he’d welcome another PPP loan. A separate economic injury disaster loan from the SBA give him some breathing room, but also presents a dilemma. Like many restaurant owners, Brauner worries about carrying long-term debt when the future is uncertain.“I’m almost tempted to give it back,” he says. “We just have to see how it all plays out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-loan-money-gone-restaurants-are-at-mercy-of-coronavirus/story-sm8YQlvZoqO1ZDRvWA3RPN.html
04-08-2020||World||Vietnam capital short of test kits as national coronavirus cases climb||Vietnam reported 10 new Covid-19 infections and two deaths on Tuesday, lifting its total cases to 652, with eight dead, as the capital Hanoi said it was running short of the rapid testing kits being used to keep a new outbreak at bay.Targeted testing and strict quarantining had helped Vietnam contain earlier outbreaks, but it is battling a new cluster of infections after going more than three months without detecting any domestic transmission.The new outbreak has infected more than 200 people since July 25, the majority in the central city of Danang, but it has spread to at least eight other cities and provinces, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where entertainment venues are closed and gatherings restricted to prevent infections.Danang and Buon Ma Thuot in the coffee-growing Central Highlands have been placed on lockdown. A government spokesman on Monday said Vietnam does not plan a nationwide lockdown. More than 88,000 people have returned to Hanoi from Danang since July 8, but only 70,689 were tested, the health ministry said. Only two of those were positive. The gap is due to a shortage of rapid testing kits used to screen thousands of residents at a time, according to state media.The health ministry said it would assign Hanoi medical institutions and hospitals to boost testing capacity. The rapid test kits, which can diagnose a blood sample in minutes but are prone to inaccuracies, are used to identify potentially positive cases which are then confirmed with the more accurate, swab-based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.Phan Quoc Viet, chairman of test kit manufacturer Viet A Corp, said he was not concerned about stocks.“Vietnam is not short,” Viet told Reuters. “We have enough for two million PCR tests and are willing to provide enough kits for the country to conduct a widespread testing programme”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-capital-short-of-test-kits-as-national-coronavirus-cases-climb/story-mhvGyb9fBuypITHE6jjB2H.html
04-08-2020||India||Lucknow & its people play suitable characters in Mira’s series!||Lucknow plays a character in Mira Nair’s newest series ‘A Suitable Boy,’ that was extensively shot in the state capital over the period of four months last year. Released in the UK recently, the six-part TV series is based on Vikram Seth’s bestseller with the same name. Shot at number of heritage buildings of Lucknow, besides Kakori and Kanpur, the American-Indian director extensively gave roles to the locals with the ensemble cast. We spoke to few of them: Educationist Zarine Viccajee plays actor Mahira Kakkar’s chatty friend Mrs Batliwala in the series. “I got along well with Mira as she is very fond of Parsis and then she is Loretoite (alumna of Loreto Convent) from Kolkata while I am from Lucknow which was the common ground. It was an enjoyable experience and I had a good number of scenes and dialogues during the shoot,” Zaraine said who has earlier featured in Sushain Bhatnagar’s film ‘Monika’ too. Another educationist-career counsellor Amita Dass also features the series. “Being contacted out of the blues and landing the role of a ‘Sweet Lady’ after auditioning for the book reading scene with actor Mikhail Sen, one of the ‘suitable boys’ was the biggest surprise ever! The entire experience of two long days on the sets from 5:30 am to 9:30 pm was purely magical!” Activist Sadaf Jafar plays Biboo, who is a governess of the courtesan Saeeda Bai played Tabu. “Biboo has the control over the household. I have a sizable role and hope to feature in almost all episodes. A lot of prominent people and places are seen in the series. It will be like watching wedding album of the city,” she says. King George’s Medical University, La Martiniere Boys, Moin Saheb’s kothi in Chowk, Zeenat’s House, Oyal House and Takia Sharif mazaar in Kokari, have been distinctly shown,” adds Jafar. “My residence has been displayed as one of the guest houses where one of the suitable boy (Namit Das) meets the girl (lead actor Tania Maniktala). My 1933-model Baby Austain and Ford Jeep (1942) have been used in the series. My wife has featured in the series in one of the scenes,” shares MA Khan. “Our Lucknow house (Narhi) features in practically every other frame. We spotted the staff and friends dressed up as extras in many frame,” said Zeena Raus, sister of Khalid Hameed.Businessman Kiron Chopra is seen as chief justice of state at that period of time. “The court scene has been shot at KKV College. I pronounce a landmark judgment on land reforms. Besides, others, we had actor Ram Kapoor and Vinay Pathak in the courtroom. We have many others locals in the series. Jayant Krishna will also be seen as one of the dancers at the ball room event,” he said. Veteran actor Dr Anil Rastogi features as a jeweler in one of the episodes. “I have two scenes. One of them was without dialogues while the other one has a few lines. Interestingly, its dubbing was done few weeks back at my home,” says the ‘Ishaqzaade’ actor. Ila Kapoor, a teacher at La Martiniere Girls College, is seen as a professor during a literary gathering shot at KGMU. “I shot for two days at the medical college. It was a funny scene where I am in the front row of the professors. More than the length of role it was great working with ace professional’s like Mira Nair.” Since the show had a UK release and it will be later streamed on an OTT platform in India the audience is yet watch the series. “I was surprised that from Dublin someone shared a picture with my niece in Delhi and she sent to me,” adds Kapoor. Her husband Pradeep has also featured as a professor in the series that stars Ishaan Khattar. Only a few having links in the UK have been able to watch the series while others wait for its pan India release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow-its-people-play-suitable-characters-in-mira-s-series/story-CbLraaD1FUBdShDhxBTsFJ.html
04-08-2020||India||3 former CEOs of Patnitop authority among 72 booked for encroachment||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a case against 74 people, including three former CEOs of Patnitop Development Authority (PDA), in connection with alleged illegal constructions and encroachment of land in Jammu & Kashmir’s resort town of Patnitop, officials aware of the matter said. As many as 62 owners, partners of various hotels, resorts, guest houses and cottages in Patnitop have also been booked.Residences and offices of the three, K K Gupta, MA Malik, and SM Sahni, were among the premises the CBI raided at 11 locations on Tuesday in Jammu, Udhampur, Kathua.CBI registered the case on August 1 on the basis of a preliminary inquiry launched in January this year on the directions of Jammu & Kashmir high court to investigate the irregularities.It has also named five public servants, Rakesh Kumar Sarangal, Raman Kumar Kesar, Rajendra Singh, Avish Jasrotia, and Zaheer Abbas, as accused.HT could not locate any of the accused for a comment.CBI spokesman R K Gaur said: “It was alleged that the public servants having dominion/jurisdiction over land in Patnitop, in conspiracy with the owners/proprietors of the hotels/guest houses/resorts, etc. had allowed illegal construction/illegal use of the said land in violation of the law, leading to loss to the government.” Gaur added many constructions were also allegedly carried without PDA’s permission. “It was also alleged that officials did not take any action despite being aware of such encroachment. In some cases, no compounding fee was allegedly deposited by the hotels.”According to CBI’s First Information Report (FIR), out of 59 hotels, guest houses and resorts under probe, only 21 were registered with the tourism department. But their period for registration has expired and they were being illegally run without permission, it added. “Besides, there are eight hotels/guest houses/resorts who have not been issued any registration and the same are being run illegally.”The FIR said around 17 hotels, which have been granted permission to operate as guest houses, were being run like hotels.The high court ordered the probe after Patnitop’s Hotel and Restaurant Association filed a plea alleging violations to the area’s masterplan. The plea claimed 70% of hotels and restaurants were constructed without permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-former-ceos-of-patnitop-authority-among-72-booked-for-encroachment/story-8Qb9rxEOzipRE4Vy3rFfEJ.html
04-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Nothing to do with case, says Aaditya||Mumbai: Maharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday lashed out at “dirty politics” over actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death after his name came up in theories floating online and indirect references to him in speculative news reports. The 30-year-old minister, known to have cordial relations with several personalities in the Mumbai-based Hindi film industry, dismissed the allegations, saying he had no connection with the actor’s death on June 14.Thackeray, in a strongly worded statement in Marathi, termed the campaign against him “mudslinging” stemming from of “frustration” of the opposition party, a reference to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Thackeray, in a statement that he tweeted, said that he was not even “remotely” connected to the case of the actor, who is suspected to have committed suicide on June 14.“Those who are pricked by the success and popularity of the Maharashtra government have started dirty politics over the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. Unnecessary mudslinging is going on me and the Thackeray family. This is nothing but dirty politics arisen out of frustration…,” he said in the statement.This is the first time Thackeray has responded to speculation dragging him into the Sushant Singh Rajput case.Over the past few weeks, speculative news reports also indirectly mentioned a “young” politician’s involvement in the case and said that’s why the Maharashtra government headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was not willing to hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).At least two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs from Mumbai—Atul Bhatkhalkar and Ameet Satam—alleged that the Mumbai police are acting under pressure to save an influential young politician. On August 2, Satam, in a letter to Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police (Zone 9), asked if everybody who attended the party at Rajput’s house, allegedly held on June 13, were questioned. “Why are the Mumbai police not collecting the call data records (CRDs) of all those present at the party?” he asked.Thackeray called the “politics over the dead” an assault on humanity. “I am not even remotely connected to the case. I wish to say as the grandson of Hinduruday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray, that I will never do anything that would hurt the prestige of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena and Thackeray family. The people who are levelling baseless allegations should understand this.” Last week, a photograph of the state environment and tourism minister with an actress went viral. Several people claimed that the actor in the picture was Chakraborty, but it was actually another actress. “The film industry is an integral part of Mumbai. Several thousand livelihoods depend on this industry. I have personal relationships with some from the industry, and it is not a crime,” added Thackeray in the statement.Anil Parab, Sena minister and close aide of CM Thackeray on Tuesday challenged the opposition to show proof of Aaditya Thackeray’s involvement in the Rajput death case.The minister told reporters, “For the past few days, opposition leaders are raising the issue of some links of the young minister in this case. Whoever has evidence that Aaditya Thackeray is connected to the cases, or he went to some party, should come forward. This is nothing but an attempt to malign the image of the young leader.”The Sena minister also took on former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ wife Amruta Fadnavis, who on Monday tweeted that Mumbai was no longer “safe” to live in. Responding to the tweet, Parab said, “When the government changes, the police force does not; it remains the same. The same police provided them security for five years, and they are protected by the same police even today. If they do not have faith in the police any longer, then she should leave the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-nothing-to-do-with-case-says-aaditya/story-kMdmwRyvtHXMTzBmf0DHtK.html
04-08-2020||India||Humbled that I played a pivotal role: Advani||Bharatiya Janata Party patriarch Lal Krishna Advani on Tuesday said he is humbled that destinay made him the device for the Ram Rath yatra which was taken out from Somnath in Gujarat to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh in 1990, and served as a defining moment of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. . In a statement, issued hours before the ground breaking ceremony will take place in Ayodhya to mark the beginning of the construction of the Ram Temple, Advani also referred to the temple’s construction as the fulfilment of a long-pending dream, but completely sidestepped the controversy over his exclusion from the invite list. “Sometimes significant dreams in one’s life take a long time to fruition. But when they are finally realised, the wait becomes very worthwhile. One such dream, close to my heart is now getting fulfilled,” he said. Referring to the temple’s construction he said, “On this auspicious occasion, I want to express my gratitude to the scores of saints, leaders and people from India and the world over who made valuable contributions and sacrifices in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. And I am also very happy that due to the decisive verdict of the Supreme Court in November 2019, the construction of Shri Ram Mandir is getting started in an environment of tranquility. This will go a long way in strengthening the bond between Indians.” Advani who was the face of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, along with senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi is also an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. In December 1992, kar sevaks ( religious workers) demolished the Babri Masjid that stood at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi site. Last month Advani sat through the final deposition in the case through a video conferencing facility; the verdict by a CBI special court is expected to come by August 30. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and a host of other senior RSS functionaries are expected to be present for the ceremony on Wednesday morning.  Advani, Joshi and former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, also a key player in the early years of the movement, will not be present on-site. A functionary at he Vishwa Hindu Parishad claimed invitations were sent out but the leaders were requested to join the ceremony through video conferencing. “Since there is a pandemic and all three of them are elderly and in frail health it was decided that they will be requested to not be physically present for the bhoomi pujan,” said a VHP functionary. HT couldn’t immediately confirm that Advani and Joshi have received invitations. Advani‘s statement itself made no reference to the invitation, he instead expressed hope that the construction of the temple would pave the way for inclusion. “ It is my belief that the Shri Ram Mandir will represent India as a strong, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious nation with justice for all and exclusion of none to truly usher in Ram Rajya, the epitome of good governance.” Former union minister Uma Bharti who was also part of the Rath yatra has already announced that she will pay obeisance at the temple once the ceremony gets over to avoid the risk of infecting the PM during the ground breaking ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humbled-that-i-played-a-pivotal-role-advani/story-kktc4YKvAH535QWAymJNUI.html

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said they discussed the forthcoming meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the five-nation BRICS grouping. It said Shringla and Morgulov also deliberated on preparatory meetings ahead of the India-Russia annual summit later this year. “The foreign secretary and the deputy foreign minister also exchanged views on various regional and international issues of mutual interest reflecting common ground and approaches. Both sides agreed to maintain regular contacts,” the MEA said in a statement. Both the BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) and SCO are important groupings for India. The BRICS represents over 3.6 billion people, or half of the world population and they have a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion. The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea. The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security in the region.

The Hindu parties’ argument of the disputed site originally belonging to a Ram temple, which was demolished to erect a Mosque in its place, was accepted, supported by archeological findings of Hindu religious structures buried under the land beneath the rubbles of the Babri mosque.Also Read: Lord Ram’s will that I attend ceremony: Title suit litigant The court asked the government to form a trust for construction of Ram temple and also ordered awarding of separate land for building a mosque on the outskirts of the temple town. Most of the Muslim organisations have accepted the court’s decision.Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and members of the Ram temple trust have argued that the temple should be seen as a symbol of Indian culture and unity. The temple committee has invited personalities from different faiths for the bhumi pujan ceremony and also indicated that donations from members of other faiths to build the Ram temple were welcome.“Presently, we are amidst an ongoing corona pandemic, but this did not stop the countless Indians with their burning desire of making the Ram Mandir dream come true. I am confident that it’s this very spirit and strength that will pull India out of this coronavirus crisis as well,” Raj Thackeray’s statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-thackeray-lauds-centre-for-legal-battle-for-ram-temple-and-building-consensus/story-YSbkynCNy390aGsIRVsb7L.html

04-08-2020||India||Brothers stab each other to death in late night brawl in Ghaziabad||Two brothers aged 32 and 28 died after stabbing each other in a brawl in Ghaziabad’s Sahibabad area late Monday night, the Ghaziabad police said Tuesday.Both were rushed to a hospital where they succumbed soon after, police said.Mohan Lal (28) and his brother Sagar Kumar (32) alias Mota got into a brawl outside their uncle’s house near their own house in Rajiv Colony. Police said both were drunk and inflicted multiple injuries on each other.“There was some household dispute between the two and soon there was heated exchange of words which resulted in the bloody fight. As both were allegedly inebriated, they picked up knives from the house and inflicted multiple injuries to each other. This resulted in critical injuries and blood loss. After the police were informed they were rushed to the hospital but both succumbed,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).“There was no motive behind the fight but small domestic disputes between the two brothers which finally ended in two murders. There is no issue about the property as their house is small, about 50 square yards,” he added.The police said that Sagar was married and had a two-year-old son and a daughter born 10 days ago. His younger brother Mohan Lal was unmarried but used to stay in the same house with Sagar.“Soon after the incident, their cousin lodged a complaint and we registered a case of attempt to murder. But later the men died so the case will have no suspect or victim now,” said an officer from the Sahibabad police station.The two men were the second and third among four siblings in the family and worked as daily wage earners. Their elder brother, Ujagar Lal, stays in Nandgram while the youngest brother stays in the same house with the two victims besides their father.Family members refused to speak to reporters. “There had been altercations between the two brothers in the past but the one which ensued on Monday night turned fateful for the family.

04-08-2020||India||Human clinical trials of indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidates move to Phase 2: ICMR||The Phase 1 human clinical trials of two Covid-19 vaccine candidates developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR and Zydus Cadila Ltd have been completed and the trials have moved to Phase 2, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday.Addressing a press briefing, he said once a safe and effective vaccine is developed, the focus should be on prioritisation and its fair distribution, roll-out and cold chain logistics, stockpiling and training of people who would be administering the vaccine.There are about 141 candidates that are being studied worldover and 26 are in different phases of clinical trials, he said.“At the present moment, there are three vaccines which are in different phases of clinical testing in India. The first one is the inactivated virus vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech which has completed its Phase 1 study in 11 sites and has started its Phase 2 study. Phase 1 and 2 are safety and very early efficacy studies.“Similarly Zydus Cadila’s DNA vaccine has also completed Phase 1 studies in 11 sites and started its Phase 2 trials which is also progressing. Recombinant Oxford vaccine to be manufactured by Serum Institute of India, Pune was given approval yesterday for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials which would start within a week at 17 sites,” Bhargava said at the briefing.Underlining the urgency for the need of a vaccine, the ICMR official said though the pandemic is progressing rapidly, developing a vaccine takes time “not only from the science aspect, but also from the social, cultural and regulatory aspects”.He, however, emphasised that till a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, sustained behavioural change, physical distancing, wearing masks and proper hand hygiene, is probably the best vaccine available at the moment, and even these measures have to be continued absolutely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-clinical-trials-of-indigenously-developed-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-move-to-phase-2-icmr/story-UslelmRuWk1SmZe7FELK5J.html

He said that earlier the single bench of HC had issued notice to the six MLAs, who are at present in a private hotel in Jaisalmer, and had sought a reply from them by August 11.Also Read: Rajasthan’s SOG drops sedition charge, transfers horse trading cases to anti-corruption bureau“As per the news published in the daily newspapers that the six MLAs were staying at a hotel in Jaipur and have now shifted to Jaisalmer in some hotels and therefore, service of the notices upon the respondents is not possible. The Rajasthan assembly session is proposed to start on August 14. If the stay prayed for is not granted, the present matter would be rendered infructuous and it will defeat the whole purpose of filing of the present writ petition before the court,” Garg said. On last Thursday, the a single bench of HC had issued notices to the assembly speaker C P Joshi, secretary of assembly secretariat and six legislators, who won the 2018 elections on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) tickets and joined the Congress in September 2019, on two petitions seeking disqualification of the six MLAs.

The victim, Kanukuntla Rajitha, mother of a two-month old baby girl, succumbed to injuries at a private hospital in Karimnagar town on Monday night. “We have arrested the accused, Doggala Shyam and booked a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) on him. He was handed over to the Jaypur police station in Mancherial district, where the incident happened,” Karimnagar commissioner of police V B Kamalasan Reddy told Hindustan Times.The woman’s uncle Pulikota Ravinder, who engaged the sorcerer, was also arrested. “The accused were produced before the court and sent to 14-day judicial remand,” Reddy said.A video of Rajitha being beaten indiscriminately by Shyam on the pretext of driving away evil spirits from her surfaced in the social media on Monday.Inquiries by the police revealed that Rajitha, an orphan, who pursued her graduation while staying in a social welfare hostel in Karimnagar, had been working as a salesgirl in a supermarket in Hyderabad since 2018. She came in contact with Mallesh from Gaddapaka village of Mancherial district, also a salesman and married him last year. Two months ago, Rajitha delivered a baby girl. Since then, she had not been keeping good health. As she failed to recover even after treatment in the government hospitals at Mancherial and Karimnagar, her in-laws approached sorcerer Shyam, a native of Gaddapaka, through Ravinder. On the request of Ravinder, Shyam visited Mallesh’s house four days ago and thrashed Rajitha severely stating that she was being troubled by evil spirits. He even got the “treatment” recorded in a mobile. Unable to bear the torture, Rajitha fell unconscious. Her husband and in-laws brought her to Karimnagar for treatment. They admitted her in a private hospital, where she succumbed on Monday night. “The body was handed over to the family after post-mortem, which mentioned that she died of internal bleeding in the head,” the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-dies-in-brutal-exorcism-ritual-in-telangana-s-karimnagar-sorcerer-arrested/story-02KCRobMW8QUmQ4uyzLbsI.html

The meeting was attended by the district magistrate of Champawat, superintendent of police (SP), Champawat and commandant of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) from the Indian side. The Nepalese side was represented by chief district officer (equivalent to DM in India) of Kanchanpur district adjoining the border in Nepal, SP Kanchanpur and SP Armed Police Force (SSB’s counterpart). “Both the sides discussed the border issue and agreed upon taking measures to not allow it (tensions) to escalate. We also agreed on not carrying any activity on the disputed land till the border is clearly demarcated,” said Surendra Narayan Pandey, district magistrate Champawat district. Watch: One Indian national among ten killed in landslides in NepalPandey added that the two sides also agreed to restore the state quo at the no man’s land during the meeting. The meeting was meant for confidence-building and maintaining harmony between the two sides, Pandey said. “We both stressed on ending the border dispute permanently by involving the agencies concerned in both the countries to conduct a survey of the disputed area so as to demarcate the border clearly. We all also agreed to end the dispute and restore the status quo as it was earlier before the recent encroachment by Nepalese people on no-man’s land,” said Pandey. ‘Make sure differences do not escalate into disputes’: China to India on border rowThe India officials said that their Nepalese counterparts had assured that the fencing pillars erected in the no-man’s land will be removed.“Nepalese authorities assured that they will soon work on it and remove them. Till the border is not demarcated, no objectionable activity will be carried by any side at the border,” said DM Champawat.The two sides also agreed to soon hold a formal meeting on the border issue to resolve it soon. The genesis of the current row along the Indo-Nepal border in Champawat district lies in Nepalese people erecting fencing pillars on the no-man’s land near the border on July 22. Following the development, India’s border patrolling agency SSB held a meeting with Nepal’s APF on July 23, in which the latter assured to remove the encroachment which was not fulfilled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-agrees-to-remove-encroachment-in-no-man-s-land-near-uttarakhand-border/story-2jubjCWo4bWjvwbzNxuQ0J.html

Hence, the petition should be considered as infructuous.” SOG’s additional director general of police, Ashok Rathore, said facts related to corruption surfaced during the preliminary probe. “We took suggestions from legal experts and on the basis of their advice, we are sending all documents related to cases in FIR Nos. 47, 48 and 49 to the ACB,” he said. The SOG has so far registered three FIRs on the complaint filed by Congress chief whip in Rajasthan assembly, Mahesh Joshi, related to the horse-trading allegedly aimed at dislodging the Congress government in the state.The first FIR, number 47, was registered on July 10, in which two accused, Ashok Jain from Banswara and Bharat Malani, were arrested. They are presently in judicial custody.The second and third FIRs, numbers 48 and 49, were registered on July 17. In the FIR number 48, Sadulshahar MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, Sanjay Jain and Gajendra Singh were booked. Jain was arrested on July 17. The SOG reports to chief minister Ashok Gehlot.Sanjay Jain’s counsel Vivek Bajwa said that the SOG filed an application in the court of the chief judicial magistrate court saying that evidences found so far do not make out 124-A (sedition) charges and the investigation should be done by the ACB.“We have requested the court that in the SOG FIRs charges of only criminal conspiracy are left which is a bailable offence. We have requested the local court to grant bail to my client Sanjay Jain and the hearing on the bail application would be held tomorrow,” said Bajwa.An MLA from the Sachin Pilot camp said the sedition charge was dropped because of the petition by Bhanwarlal Sharma in the high court to transfer the case to the NIA.Legal expert Akhil Choudhary said that Indian Penal Code does not criminalize actions of destabilsing Government, but if the Government wanted to at all criminalize such actions, as is happening in Rajasthan, and have happened earlier in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, then the sections of Prevention of Corruption could have been used against receiving or attempting to receive bribes. “MLAs are public servants under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and they can be prosecuted for such offences,” he said.State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Satish Poonia said that the party had maintained that sedition provisions in the IPC were very old and were used by British to suppress the freedom fighters.“There were no legal grounds to get the FIR registered under sections of sedition. Congress was afraid that the FIR may be quashed by the HC. The withdrawal reveals the moral defeat and exposure of Congress’ plan to create fear in independents and MLAs of an independent party. It has also revealed that the ACB and SOG are being misused,” Poonia said.Reacting to the allegations of Poonia, state Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said that it is a moral victory for chief minister Ashok Gehlot because the investigation revealed that the MLAs were offered money. “This is a moral victory for the Congress as preliminary investigation reveals that facts regarding the offering of money were true,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-s-sog-drops-sedition-charge-transfers-horse-trading-cases-to-anti-corruption-bureau/story-MwnTqx0wdSoIXP5m13cccO.html

All religious places and places of worship to open in Jammu & Kashmir from August 16, 2020. Religious processions and large religious gatherings remain strictly prohibited,” principal secretary and government spokesperson Rohit Kansal posted on his Twitter handle this evening. A senior official of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board said, “since the government has taken a decision to open religious places, we shall be strictly adhering to the Covid-19 SOPs before re-opening the shrine to devotees.” It may be recalled the Centre had given its nod to re-open religious places from June 8 but following a spike in Covid-19 cases and death toll the decision was put on hold. Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, however, has done all the spade work. “Sanitisation drives were being conducted on twin tracks, sanctum sanctorum and at Katra town. Circles are also being marked outside Yatra Parchi counter, at the Bhawan and two helipads at Katra and Sanji Chhat to ensure social distancing,” said official sources. It has also been learnt that initially, local pilgrims will be allowed to visit the cave shrine. The pilgrimage remains suspended since March 18. Apart from helicopter service, the shrine board also provides battery car and ropeway services to the pilgrims. Vaishno Devi cave shrine at an altitude of 5,200 ft in Trikuta Hills of Reasi district, a pilgrimage tourist destination that attracted 104.95 lakh pilgrims (10.4 Million) in 2012, 93.24 lakh in 2013, 78.03 lakh in 2014, 77.76 lakh in 2015, 77.23 lakh in 2016, 85.87 lakh in 2018 and 79.40 lakh in 2019. Earlier, the J&K government had to cancel the annual Amarnath pilgrimage in south Kashmir Himalayas due to Covid -9 pandemic.

04-08-2020||India||Governor approves CBI probe in Sushant death case amid Bihar-Maharashtra turf war||Bihar governor on Tuesday evening gave his assent to state government’s recommendation to hand over probe in Sushant Singh Rajput death case registered in Patna to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) amid fierce opposition of the move by Maharashtra government.Earlier today Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had made the recommendation to hand over the case of abetment of Rajput’s suicide registered against his former live-in partner and actor Rhea Chakarborty to the CBI following a request from Sushant’s father KK Rajput. Announcing the decision, the Bihar CM had said that his government will finish all formalities for sending the recommendation today itself. The Bihar governor’s approval to the recommendation by the state government follows questions being raised on Bihar government and police’s locus standi in an incident that took place in the state of Maharashtra.Some prominent Maharashtra ministers have said that while Bihar police had the right to seek information from Mumbai police in the case; it had no right to investigate the case in Maharashtra. Maharashtra ministers have also extended the argument to question the legal sanctity of Bihar government’s recommendation for a CBI probe into the case, which is already being investigated by Maharashtra police.“In the past 5 years, many incidents of suicides and deaths took place, were all the cases transferred to CBI? Mumbai Police is competent enough to handle the Sushant Singh Rajput case and we support them,” Maharashtra minister Anil Parab was quoted as saying by ANI.Anil Parab also termed Bihar government’s decision to be “politically motivated”. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had earlier claimed that the decision was influenced by the state assembly polls to be held in Bihar later this year.The turf between the two states started with allegations that Mumbai police was engaged in a cover-up of the case under pressure from influential people. Soon, Sushant’s family filed a case of abetment of suicide against actor Rhea Chakarborty in Patna alleging they had no faith in Mumbai police’s probe. Sushant’s father further claimed a few days ago that Mumbai police had taken no action on his complaint made in February this year alleging there was a threat to Sushant’s life. Mumbai police have denied receiving any written complaint.The demand for a CBI probe in Sushant’s death case has been supported by almost all political parties in Bihar across the political spectrum.The alleged conspiracy theory behind Sushant’s death received a fresh shot in the arm on Tuesday with prominent BJP leader in Maharashtra, Narayan Rane claiming that the budding actor was murdered and his death could also be linked to the death of his former manager Disha Salian.34-year old Rajput was found dead at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 and since then conspiracy theories alleging involvement of influential Bollywood and political personalities have been made.Earlier today, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s son and a minister in his cabinet, Aaditya Thackeray released a statement distancing himself from rumours linking him to Rajput’s death. He hit out at BJP leaders saying there was an attempt to politicize the death by frustrated people who were jealous of Maharashtra government’s popularity.On Monday, former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis’s wife Amruta Fadnavis tweeted that Mumbai had lost its “humanity” and was “no more safe to live” looking at the way the metropolis’ police was handling the Sushant Singh Rajput case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governor-approves-cbi-probe-in-sushant-death-case-amid-bihar-maharashtra-turf-war/story-Uk7h5aqVqBCi3fGSGga6UL.html

AMU Mohd. Wasim Ali proctor issued a denial on Tuesday and said that a complaint would be lodged with the police to trace the fraudster who had played this ‘mischief’. On Monday, there was an advertisement on OLX, an online sale-purchase platform, for sale of the MiG-23 aircraft placed in front of the Engineering College on AMU campus. The price quoted was Rs. 9,99,99,000 and the photograph of the aircraft was also uploaded. “This MiG-23 aircraft was gifted to AMU in 2009 after the Kargil War to motivate students of engineering. There was no such sale offer by AMU and this is an act of mischief aimed at maligning the image of the varsity,” Ali said.“We are probing the matter although it is learnt that the mischievous sale offer has now been removed from OLX. The guilty could be anyone and we are shortly going to make a police complaint in this regard,” he said. Public relations officer (PRO) of AMU, Omar Peerzada too condemned the fake sale offer and said that the proctorial department of the university was in action in this regard. The aircraft which saw action in Kargil in 1999 was decommissioned in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mig-23-on-amu-campus-put-up-for-sale-on-olx-varsity-calls-it-mischief/story-YSZ5EFeSFsOoEFPnsQutoJ.html

He was 77.He is survived by his wife Vijayalakshmi, three sons and a daughter. “He had been ailing for quite some time. He breathed his last in the early hours,” said his daughter Vangapandu Usha, who is heading Andhra Pradesh’s Creativity and Cultural Commission.He had worked as a technical worker at Hindustan Ship Yard, Visakhapatnam, between 1976 and 1999.Hailing from Pedabondapalli village of Parvathipuram block, Vangapandu was inspired by Adibhatla Kailasam, and took to writing folk songs that inspired thousands of youths in the region.Vangapandu, along with another popular revolutionary balladder of Telangana Gaddar, founded Jana Natya Mandali, the cultural wing of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) People’s War Group (which later became CPI (Maoist) in 2004).Like Gaddar, Vangapandu, too, was known for singing his own songs with his typical north-coastal Andhra style, that used to mesmerise the audience. He gave more than 2,000 performances not only in undivided Andhra but also various parts of India.He, however, distanced himself from the active revolutionary movement, but continued to take up the cause of the peasants, industrial labour and the oppressed sections of the society. Several of his songs – Jajjanakari Janaare Janaku Jana Janaare and Em Pillado Eldamostavaa – were used in Telugu films and have become runaway hits.Vangapandu was a recipient of the prestigious Kala Ratna award in 2017 for his work in the tribal arts.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu and others condoled the demise of Vangapandu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revolutionary-balladeer-vangapandu-prasada-rao-dies-at-77/story-O5pIR5QuCJH0sjzklEF3LL.html
04-08-2020||India||‘Dream close to my heart getting fulfilled’: LK Advani on Ram temple event||Bharatiya Janata Party patriarch LK Advani on Tuesday said he feels humbled that during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement destiny made him perform a pivotal duty in the form of the Ram Rath yatra which was taken out from Somnath in Gujarat to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh in 1990. Advani, in a statement issued a day before the ground-breaking ceremony will take place in Ayodhya to mark the beginning of the construction of the Ram Temple, also referred to the temple’s construction as the fulfilment of a long pending dream. “Sometimes significant dreams in one’s life take a long time to fruition. But when they are finally realised, the wait is worthwhile. One such dream, close to my heart is now getting fulfilled,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and a host of other senior RSS functionaries will be present in Ayodhya for the mega ceremony on Wednesday morning. Referring to the temple’s construction, the veteran BJP leader said, “On this auspicious occasion, I want to express my gratitude to the scores of saints, leaders and people from India and the world over who made valuable contributions and sacrifices in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. And I am also very happy that due to the decisive verdict of the Supreme Court in November 2019, the construction of Shri Ram Mandir is getting started in an environment of tranquility. This will go a long way in strengthening the bond between Indians.” The day, he said, is historical and emotional not only for him but all Indians. Advani, along with senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, is also an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. In December 1992, Kar Sevaks had demolished the Babri Masjid that stood at the disputed site for over 400 years. Last month, Advani sat through the final deposition in the case through a video conferencing facility; the verdict by a CBI special court is expected to come by August 30. A controversy was also stoked about the invitation to attend the ceremony not being sent to Advani, Joshi and former Uttra Pradesh CM Kalyan Singh. A functionary of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, however, said the invitations were sent but the leaders were requested to join the ceremony through video conferencing. “Since there is a pandemic and all three of them are elderly and in frail health it was decided that they will be requested to not be physically present for the Bhumi Poojan,” said a VHP functionary. Advani‘s statement made no reference to the invitation, he instead expressed hope that the construction of the temple would pave the way for inclusion. “It is my belief that the Ram Mandir will represent India as a strong, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious nation with justice for all and exclusion of none to truly usher in Ram Rajya, the epitome of good governance,” he said. Former union minister Uma Bharti, who was also part of the Rath Rath yatra, has already announced that she will pay obeisance at the temple once the ceremony gets over as a precaution against the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-laying-foundation-stone-of-ram-mandir-is-a-historical-and-emotional-day-not-only-for-me-but-for-all-indians-l-k-advani/story-8CYXLfIEEx9Bua6AtYy67N.html

Lord Ram (resides) in the heart of all Congressmen,” said Shivakumar while responding to a question at a press conference in Kalburgi district. Another senior Congress leader RV Deshpande said: “The Congress has already welcomed the Supreme Court decision on Ram temple. All Indians should follow the principles propagated by Lord Ram and the construction of the temple should be done by winning everybody’s confidence rather than using it as a measure to divide people.”Shivakumar, who was on a maiden visit to the district after taking over as the KPCC president, repeated the Congress party’s allegation that there was large scale corruption amounting to more than Rs 2,000 crore in the procurement of medical equipment required for the treatment of Covid patients.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has served a legal notice to both Shivakumar as well as leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah for what it has alleged are false, baseless and defamatory charges. It has asked the leaders of the opposition to apologise and withdraw remarks or face legal action.Meanwhile, Siddaramiah too, who has tested positive for Covid-19, has been admitted to the same Manipal Hospital in Bengaluru where Covid-19 positive CM Yediyurappa is undergoing treatment. Leaders across the political spectrum wished Siddaramiah a speedy recovery.A hospital bulletin said that CM Yediyurappa is stable and has been responding to treatment. “He is being monitored closely by an expert panel of doctors,” the release added. Yediyurappa also held a meeting through video conference to monitor the availability of ventilators and beds across the state.Karnataka imposed prohibitory orders in Kalburgi, Mangalore and Kodagu, apart from a few other districts ahead of the mega Ayodhya ceremony tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-in-heart-of-all-congressmen-says-party-leader-ahead-of-ayodhya-event/story-AcUBq63ov9dUXp2KuIJKgM.html
04-08-2020||India||Locust situation grim along Indo-Pak border, some swarms may reach this month: FAO||The current situation remains serious along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border where locust monsoon breeding is underway by spring-bred swarms, including those returning from northern India, and substantial hatching and band formation are expected in August, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) said on Monday. The UN organisation, in the latest update, said a second generation of summer breeding will start in September. Extensive control operations are in progress in both countries. Some of the swarms that continued east across northern Somalia may still reach India and Pakistan in early August. Amidst the outbreak of locusts, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the locust outbreak should be declared a national disaster. Gehlot, in his letter to the PM, he said the decision to declare it as national disaster will be appropriate in view of the forecast by FAO of possible damage to crops of Kharif-2020 and Rabi 2020-21 in other states; and looking to weak economic condition of states due to Corona epidemic. This will further strengthen the capacity of states to deal with locust outbreaks.Pointing out that locust outbreak is an international problem, the Rajasthan chief minister wrote, “In order to place a check on the origin of new locust groups, they must be stopped at their point of origin. For this, the GoI should coordinate internationally and negotiate with all locust-affected countries, so that appropriate measures can be taken for effective control of locust.” The locust has bred extensively in Africa and the Gulf countries. Due to this, locust groups are continuously entering the states including Rajasthan from across the border, he said. Gehlot apprised that locusts entered the state from April 11 and 32 of 33 districts have been affected by the outbreak. In addition to Rajasthan, locusts have been reported in other states including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Now this problem has become a multi-state problem. Locust outbreaks have been seen on such a large scale in the country after several decades. In such a situation, declaring this problem as a national disaster will be in the interest of all the affected states and the farmers.In 2019-20, around 6.70 lakh hectare area of 12 districts in Rajasthan was affected by locust. With the joint efforts of Locust Warning Organization and the state government the locust attack was curbed but then to the farmers suffered a lost about Rs 1000 crore. In 2020-21 also, locust control has been done in about 3.83 lakh hectare area so far, but according to earlier estimates of FAO, the locust outbreak would increase. In such a situation, the GoI should take appropriate steps on time, Gehlot said in his letter sent on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locust-situation-grim-along-indo-pak-border-some-swarms-to-reach-this-month-fao/story-qb1JppEHhWGtNbYWQwDOAL.html

Acting on a petition filed by Rajadhani Rythu Parirakshana Samithi (Committee of farmers to protect the capital), a three-member division bench of the high court comprising Justice Rakesh Kumar, Justice Sesha Sai and Justice Satyanaryana Murthy granted stay on the implementation of the gazette notifications and asked the state government to file a counter within 10 days. The high court ordered that the state government maintain status quo with regard to Amaravati as the capital city and not to proceed with any moves with regard to the shifting of executive capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam. On July 31, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government issued two separate notifications – one on abolition of AP Capital Region Development Authority formed in December 2014 to develop Amaravati as the capital of AP; and the second one on formation of three capitals for the state – executive capital at Visakhapatnam, judicial capital at Kurnool and legislative capital at Amaravati. The notification followed the assent given by Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan earlier in the day for the two bills passed by the state legislature. However, the farmers of Amaravati challenged these notifications in the high court. When the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday, the division bench asked the state government to file a counter affidavit. The state advocate general asked for 10 days’ time for the government to file the counter. When the counsels for petitioners expressed apprehensions that the government might go ahead with the shift of some of the offices to Visakhapatnam during this 10-day period, the high court ordered that status be maintained on the gazette notifications and granted a stay on the implementation of the notifications till August 14. Meanwhile, the farmers of Amaravati continued with their protests over the state government’s move to form the three capitals. The protesters, including women, formed a human chain all along the road leading to the high court and pleaded the judges passing through the road with folded hands. Some of them were carrying national flags and some others were on their knees as the convoy of judges passed by. Some women protestors also offered “aarti” to the high court building before the arrival of the judges, seeking a favourable judgment for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amaravati-to-remain-andhra-capital-till-aug-14-hc-stays-govt-order-on-3-capitals/story-GrM22zNWgQzcROa59V4GDN.html

Murari Meena, MLA from Dausa, said the news had been spread to defame the MLAs with Sachin Pilot, who are currently staying in a hotel in Manesar. “No one from the BJP either met us or plans to meet us. It is an attempt to defame us,” said Meena in a telephonic conversation from Manesar. HT reported on Tuesday that the Rajasthan police investigation into three cases of sedition and conspiracy to topple Ashok Gehlot government has found that state BJP president Satish Poonia met the Sachin Pilot camp of MLAs twice in July. According to the HT report, Poonia met the Pilot camp MLAs twice between July 18 and July 29. Poonia denied this vehemently. “I have never met Pilot or any other rebel MLA. Police are speaking the government’s language,” he said. The Dausa MLA said they had not decided on attending the Assembly session from August 14. “It is still 10 days away. We will sit together and decide about our future strategy,” Meena said. Meanwhile, the special operations group (SOG) dropped the sedition charges in the three cases related to efforts to topple Gehlot government, and transferred the cases to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of the state government.Earlier today, the Congress said it could hold talks with the rebel MLAs of Sachin Pilot camp if they leave the hospitality of Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana.Congress national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala maintained that the only condition for talks with the dissident Rajasthan MLAs is that they leave the BJP’s “suraksha chakra (protection)”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-camp-denies-bjp-leader-met-them-at-haryana-resort/story-MkTyX4vNwzKpM99yEhv1XM.html

We believe stronger solidarity and cooperation between China and India, (the) two largest developing countries and emerging economies will not only inject impetus into our respective development but also stability and positive energy to world’s peace and prosperity,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing.“The two should place the boundary issue in an proper position in bilateral relations and make sure differences do not escalate into disputes. I hope India will work with us in the same direction and safeguard over all interests of bilateral relations with concrete actions,” he said.Also read: India-China expand border talks, to revisit patrolling protocol to avoid skirmishesWang was separately asked to comment on New Delhi considering measures to prevent trade partners mainly in southeast Asia from rerouting Chinese goods to India with little added value.Responding to the query, Wang said: “I want to stress that Chinese products to India met the demands of Indian consumers. The cooperation is mutually beneficial. Artificially damaging such cooperation doesn’t serve India’s own interests.”Jaishankar’s interview and China’s reaction come in the backdrop of the worst state of ties between the two neighbours following the June 15 Galwan Valley clash in eastern Ladakh.The June 15 violence was preceded and followed by a tense faceoff between Indian and Chinese border troops at multiple points along the LAC in Ladakh.Following several rounds of diplomatic and military talks between the two countries, New Delhi has made it clear that for the situation to be normalised, the Chinese will have to completely de-escalate and move back troops to their permanent locations.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava acknowledged last week that there has been “some progress” towards disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC though the process is far from complete.On Sunday, the latest round of commander-level talks were held on the Chinese side of the LAC.Beijing has so far revealed no details of the talks except commenting that the disengagement was complete in most places – a claim refuted by New Delhi.Also read: How the cold will alter the India-China power equation next month in Ladakh“On August 2, China and India held the fifth round of talks at the level of military commanders and exchanged views resolving the remaining issues on the border, and on the ground, (and) continuing to push for a de-escalation of the situation,” the Chinese foreign ministry told Hindustan Times in a statement on the Sunday talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-sure-differences-do-not-escalate-into-disputes-china-to-india-on-border-row/story-wiDbDdWpaKzppsFeAbYUiI.html

Though 11 fisher folks were rescued by another boat, two persons are still missing. Senior inspector Sanjeev Narkar of Gorai police station said the incident occurred around 2 pm and the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and Indian Navy authorities have been informed for search and rescue operations of the two missing fishermen. “A rescue boat has been dispatched for search and rescue operations,” said RK Singh, commandant, ICG. A fishing boat, Lucky Star, carrying 13 fisher folks from Gorai, went into the sea for fishing last Saturday. While returning the boat capsized around 10 nautical miles away from the coast on Tuesday afternoon. Another fishing boat, God King, from Uttan rescued the 11 fisher folks, Narkar said. “Perhaps, the boat capsized because of the choppy waters. It could be a technical snag as well. We will ascertain the cause after we record the rescued fisher folks’ statement,” Narkar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-two-missing-after-a-fishing-boat-carrying-13-fishermen-capsizes/story-sWEKXkKNgodxhsEBsuYreO.html

The court observed that though the health reports sufficed that Ghani-Walsh was in dire need of guardianship, yet it could not decide on the matter until the Centre would take a call on the issue. The petition, filed by advocate Vaishali Dholakia, has said that Mashal (40) is a resident of Charsadda in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. Ghani-Walsh is the grand-daughter of Frontier Gandhi. The petition stated that Ghani-Walsh had married a Canadian citizen, Stanley Arnold Walsh, in 1975 and had become a Canadian national. However, in 1983 she and her husband moved back to India to take care of her uncle PA Narielwalla and continued to live here since. Her husband had died intestate – without leaving behind a Will – in 2013. Her only surviving relatives are her brothers’ three sons, including her grand-nephew Mashal. The petition also stated that she has been suffering from Alzheimer’s disease since 2013, her medical report showed. The petition has stated that after the demise of her husband, Ghani-Walsh appointed Mashal as the executor of her Will in 2013, and as per medical reports, she was not able to sign in a consistent pattern, and as a result, he should be appointed as guardian of her person and property. On Monday, Mashal’s counsel Mayur Khandeparkar informed the two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SC Gupte and Abhay Ahuja, that though there is a statutory provision for the care of a mentally disabled person, there is no legal provision under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, or Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, for the appointment of a guardian for a person, who is completely dependent, physically, and mentally unfit to make decisions. Khandeparkar sought directions that the court declares and accepts Mashal as the guardian of Ghani-Walsh, as he had been regularly coming to India since 2013, and helping her with her property and bank work. Khandeparkar also prayed that the court might issue necessary permissions for him to operate and execute documents on Ghani-Walsh’s behalf and also to take her back to Pakistan with him in a bid to allow her to spend her last days there and also be laid to rest near her loved ones. Public prosecutor, Poornima Kantharia, submitted that the state did not dispute her medical reports. However, she drew the court’s attention to the National Trust Act, 1999, as it provided for a local committee to decide on the guardianship issue. The bench heard the submissions and observed that it could not decide on the petition without hearing the Centre’s response and adjourned the matter for its next hearing on August 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/frontier-gandhi-s-great-grandson-seeks-hc-intervention-to-be-appointed-guardian-of-his-aunt-in-india/story-mD0QyPNrK9lufk7Z8OvVnI.html
04-08-2020||India||2 more kidnapped Indian engineers freed in Afghanistan, 6 released so far||India said on Tuesday two more of the seven Indian engineers kidnapped in Afghanistan in May 2018 had been freed and had returned to the country, taking the number of men released so far to six. The external affairs ministry said in a brief statement the two Indian nationals were “released from captivity in Afghanistan” on July 31 and “returned to India today [Tuesday]”. The statement confirmed the two men were part of the group of seven Indians abducted more than two years ago, but didn’t give details of the circumstances of their release. “Six Indian nationals have now been released so far from captivity,” the statement said. “We thank the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for their constant and unwavering support in securing the release of the Indians,” the statement added. The seven men were working on power projects run by the Afghan government when they were abducted in northern Baghlan province. One of them was freed in March 2019 while three more were released last October. There were no immediate details on the status of the lone member of the group who remained unaccounted for. It was widely believed the engineers – who worked for KEC International Limited, one of the world’s largest companies engaged in building and maintaining power transmission networks – were kidnapped by the Taliban. The militant group, however, hasn’t so far said anything on this issue. Earlier this year, a report from the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team had acknowledged that three of the engineers were freed last October by the Taliban in exchange for 11 members of the militant group,. The report had said that “11 Taliban were released from Bagram Airfield detention facility in exchange for three Indian engineers who had been kidnapped in Afghanistan”. The Taliban members who were released “included former shadow governors Sheikh Abdul Rahim…and Mawlawi Rashid Baluch”. Rahim is believed to have been appointed by the Haqqani Network, which is close to the Pakistani security establishment. Baluch was sanctioned in 2015 by the US treasury department, which emphasised his role in “the Taliban and Al-Qaida nexus”, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-kidnapped-indian-engineers-freed-in-afghanistan-6-released-so-far/story-QaHF8F5Tf2BjarKLWVy21K.html

04-08-2020||India||Women officers asked to apply for PC by August 31||The army on Tuesday set August 31 as the deadline for short-service commissioned (SSC) women officers to submit their applications for permanent commission (PC), days after the government issued a formal order granting them PC following a Supreme Court verdict. “Detailed administrative instructions have been issued to all affected women officers giving out guidelines for submission of applications for consideration by a selection board,” an army spokesperson said. He said the Army headquarters was in the process of convening a special selection board for screening women officers for PC. “Specimen formats and detailed checklists have been included in the administrative instructions in order to facilitate correct documentation,” he added. The government’s July 23 order specified grant of PC to women officers in 10 streams --- Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC). The selection board will be held after the receipt and verification of applications. The Supreme Court in February ruled that women should be considered for command roles and that all women officers are entitled to PC. It asked the army to give them PC within three months in a major boost to gender parity. The Centre got a one-month extension on July 7 to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict after it moved an application before the apex court seeking the extension of the deadline by another six months citing the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread from March 25. The Supreme Court’s judgment was hailed for creating a new equality paradigm in the armed forces. It upheld a 2010 Delhi high court verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through SSC, are entitled to permanent commission even if they have more than 14 years of service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-officers-asked-to-apply-for-pc-by-august-31/story-0WENazJ3JVX75csLN4WrxK.html
04-08-2020||India||As Rajasthan cabinet works from hotel, politics of transfers goes on unabated||Bina Mahawar, a 2011 batch Rajasthan Administrative Service officer, was posted as additional district magistrate of Bharatpur on August 2 in the recent round of reshuffle of junior bureaucracy in the state, almost a year after she was shunted out of the district after a verbal duel with the then tourism minister and now rebel Congress MLA Vishvendra Singh during an official meeting. Mahawar, who was district supply officer of Bharatpur Rural, was shunted to the Board of Revenue as deputy registrar after the showdown in July 2019. Singh is among the rebel Congress legislators backing ousted deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, and political experts see Mahawar’s posting in Bharatpur again as a snub to him. They said while the government posted her back in the district of her choice, another RAS officer, Praveen Kumar, who had been private secretary to Singh, is yet to get a posting. In another politically significant posting, special assistant to former deputy chief minister, Aakash Tomar, was posted as additional commissioner of enforcement in the transport department on Sunday. These are among the few officers transferred in the large-scale reshuffle of the state bureaucracy. According to orders issued by the state government, 379 officers have been transferred since the Rajya Sabha elections on June 19 when chief minister Ashok Gehlot had claimed for the first time that there was an attempt to topple his government by horse trading. The list included 110 IAS, 66 IPS and 144 RAS officers, 128 of whom were transferred last week, apparently on requests of MLAs loyal to Gehlot. Experts said transfer of junior bureaucracy, especially the RAS and RPS officer, has political meanings. “These transfers are mostly done on request of legislators. The MLAs want officers of their choice in their constituencies. This is a normal practice,” said BJP leader and former minister Rohitash Sharma. However, in the current political turmoil, Congress legislators, camping in a hotel in Jaisalmer, are having a field day as Gehlot is accepting all their requests for posting of officers, he added. This is borne out by the fact that two major RAS transfers were carried out on July 31 and August 2. Political expert Narayan Bareth said in principle, it is the duty of the chief minister to consider requests of his legislators because they choose him to be their leader. “Ashok Gehlot is known for conceding to requests of legislators. Sometimes, it also goes against him but that’s the way he is. This time, maybe after the formation of the government he was busy striking political balance and couldn’t focus more on the requests for posting of officers,” he said. Bareth said that at this time when there’s some danger to his government because of rebellion within the party, the CM may be more magnanimous in accepting requests of his MLAs. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said transfer and posting of officers was a routine work of governance and it should not be linked to the political situation in the state. But she conceded that the Congress government valued requests of its legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-rajasthan-cabinet-works-from-hotel-politics-of-transfers-goes-on-unabated/story-y50ODjKz1Ft6Wpz8XjeprJ.html

It also decided to grant Rs 5,000 to plasma donors who help others get better. When the plasma is administered to a Covid-19 patient, it boosts their immunity to fight against the infection.An order to this effect was issued by special chief secretary (medical and health) KS Jawahar Reddy. According to the order, all the district collectors have been authorised to sanction Rs 15,000 towards funeral expenses of each Covid-19 victim.“This amount will be paid to the kin of the deceased for conducting the last rites in a dignified and decent manner,” Reddy said.The order comes in the wake of reports that the bodies of the Covid-19 victims were being carried in municipal vans, earth movers and even autorickshaws to the graveyards for burial and cremation without any dignity and respect.A payment of Rs 5,000 will be made to each plasma donor who voluntarily decides to donate plasma for the Covid-19 patients in various hospitals.“This amount will be paid to the plasma donor towards nutritional supplement charges, as they need good food after donating their plasma,” the special chief secretary said.The government directed the commissioner of health and family welfare Katamaneni Bhaskar to release an amount of Rs 12 crore to the respective district collectors, from budgetary provisions under the scheme to combat Covid-19.A CMO spokesman said the chief minister had instructed the officials to strictly monitor four aspects – medicines, treatment, food and hygiene in all the 138 Covid-19 designated hospitals in the state. He directed the officials to create awareness on Covid and run campaigns through hoardings, posters, TVs and other avenues to remove stigma. He also directed the officials to monitor the news reports being published on Covid-19 and help the genuine cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-govt-grants-rs-15-000-for-funeral-expenses-of-covid-19-victims/story-IKlj8wywChV8zYz3D0U2zN.html

However, the director of a prominent research laboratory said, considering the rising number of positive cases now, the pandemic will be stable in Odisha by the last week of August after reaching its peak. With 29 fatalities in the first three days of August, the Covid-19 death toll in the coastal state has mounted to 216 while the infection tally is 37,681.“At this stage of the pandemic, numbers will rise. We may add another 50K cases in August with around another 200 deaths,” Prof Jayant Panda, technical advisor to the Health and Family Welfare department, said in a tweet. However, people were asked “not to get worried” as more than 23,000 patients had recovered from the viral infection in the state till now, the official said.The projection on fresh cases and fatalities in August was made on the basis of the prevailing trend.The official data released by the health and family welfare department said that the state has been reporting more than 1,000 new cases every day since July 21.“If the present trend continues, one should not be surprised if about 50,000 more cases are added in the month of August,” the official said. Ten Covid-19 deaths had been reported on August 1 and August 2 respectively and nine patients died of novel coronavirus on August 3. On an average, five persons had succumbed to Covid-19 in July, he said.“Lets not get worried... More than 23,000 patients have already recovered. Lets try to save people from Covid- 19,” he said. However, Dr Ajay Parida, the Director of Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), told reporters, “It cannot be said right now as to what would be the total number of positive cases in August as the virus has different strains.” The ILS is a research laboratory under the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, and plays an important role in Covid-19 policy making in Odisha.In Odisha, most of the Covid-19 deaths are linked to pre-existing ailments or comorbidities, Dr Parida said. “Death of symptomatic patients with no comorbidity can be curbed if they are diagnosed and treated early,” the ILS director said.Meanwhile, Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), Health and Family Welfare, P K Mohapatra, said that the state government is improving infrastructure for Covid-19 management in view of the rise in the infection tally.As many as 200 more ICU beds will be added to the existing number of 500 ICU beds in the state, he said.Most of the ICU beds will be in facilities in Bhubaneswar as it receives patients from across the state.Patients from districts having a high load of coronavirus cases may be shifted to districts with less caseloads, he said.Apart from having 35 dedicated hospitals across the state, the state government has developed several COVID Care Centres(CCC), COVID Care Homes (CCH) and Temporary Medical Camps in clusters for treatment of COVID-19 patients, Mohapatra said.While critical cases are being admitted to COVID hospitals, moderate cases are kept in CCCs and mild cases in CCHs. Several PSUs and residential welfare units have been encouraged to set up CCCs with technical assistance from the states health department, the senior official said.At present, 6,760 CCHs are operational in 6,798 gram panchayats, 1,482 cluster level TMCs have been et up with 71,754 beds and 14,094 persons are now in hospital isolation, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-covid-19-caseload-may-increase-by-50-000-in-august-official/story-ufMQ5OEcPlt8YpNtjwQjVI.html

Kamal Nath, who along with several other party leaders and workers, had recited Hanuman Chalisa at his residence in Bhopal on Monday, as part of the party’s statewide programme for the progress and prosperity of MP, made the announcement during a freewheeling interaction with media persons a day ahead of the bhoomi pujan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya to be presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He welcomed the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, but gave its credit to Congress leader and former PM late Rajiv Gandhi. “We welcome the construction of Ram temple. Rajiv Gandhiji made a beginning on this in 1985 and he was instrumental behind laying of the foundation stone for the temple construction in 1989. Had Rajivji been among us, he would have been attended Wednesday’s ceremony,” the veteran Congress leader said. “We are sending 11 silver bricks on behalf of the people of MP for construction of the temple,” he added. However, he didn’t give any further details as to when the bricks will be sent; who will carry them and if it will be donated by him only. He also took the opportunity to attack the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Whenever we do something BJP has a stomach ache. Do they have a patent, contract, or agency on religion?” He said, “I installed a huge idol of Lord Hanuman at Chhindwara. During 15 months of my government, gaushalas were constructed across the state. Hurdles in the way to Ram van gaman path were removed. There were development plans for Mahakal and Omkareshwar temples. But we don’t use religion for politics and don’t make it an event. We are religious in our thoughts, but we don’t mix religion and politics.” State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal rebutted Kamal Nath’s assertions. “The Congress’s state president must make his stand clear on his party’s government’s affidavit in the Supreme Court in 2007 through which it had denied the existence of Lord Ram. But, now, the Congress wants to take credit for the same. Another Congress leader said there should be a Ram temple, but is raising a question on the timing of the foundation stone-laying programme. It’s a double standard of the Congress leaders. No wonder, the voters have rejected the party across the nation,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-congress-to-send-silver-bricks-to-be-used-in-construction-of-ram-temple/story-kIFHU2dZ1sYk0rE0dZrfkK.html

Rane’s claim comes close on the heels of Bihar government recommending a CBI probe into a case of abetment of suicide against Rajput’s live in partner Rhea Chakarborty and her family members.Maharashtra government has vehemently opposed handing over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation claiming the Mumbai police was fully capable of investigations. However, it has been accused of shielding powerful Bollywood interests by Sushant’s family and Bihar politicians including deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi.Rane on Tuesday toed a similar line and accused the Maharashtra government of trying to save someone.“He was murdered. The Maharashtra government is trying to save someone. It is not paying attention to the case,” Narayan Rane was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: Police buying time to ensure evidence is destroyed’: LawyerParties cutting across the political divide in Bihar have demanded CBI investigation in the case expressing their lack of confidence in Mumbai police, which has also been accused of inaction and waylaying the probe by Sushant Singh’s family in Patna.Bihar chief minister and JDU chief Nitish Kumar had earlier today recommended a CBI probe on the request of Sushant Singh’s father and the growing political consensus on the issue.Also Read: Sushant Singh’s death case: Bihar govt recommends CBI probeHis deputy, Sushil Kumar Modi of the BJP had alleged a couple of days ago that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was under pressure from coalition partner Congress to protect the “Bollywood mafia” responsible for Sushant’s death.Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai flat on June 14 and soon after his death, allegations surfaced that he was a victim of an alleged culture of nepotism in the industry that shuts out outsiders. Mumbai police had initially said that Sushant had died by suicide but later started a preliminary investigation that continued for days without registering of even an FIR.Sushant’s family then lodged an FIR in Patna alleging he was driven to death by his former live-in partner Rhea Chakarborty and few of her family members. They also alleged financial irregularities apart from wrongful confinement and mental harassment of the late actor.A team of Bihar police probing the case in Mumbai complained of non-cooperation by the local police as the probe snowballed into a faceoff between two states. The strife escalated after a senior Bihar police official was asked to quarantine himself after he landed in Mumbai for investigations.Following the recommendation to transfer the probe to CBI, Maharashtra minister and NCP Leader Nawab Malik has accused Bihar CM Nitish Kumar of diverting attention from his government’s alleged failures in handling the Coved crisis. Questions have also been raised if the Bihar government has the legal authority to recommend a CBI probe in an incident that took place in Maharashtra. The development came a day before the Supreme Court is slated to hear a petition by Rhea Chakraborty, who has sought transfer of the FIR registered in Patna to Mumbai.A public interest litigation filed in the Bombay High Court seeking transfer of Rajput’s death case to the CBI or a special investigation team (SIT) is also likely to be heard tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-was-murdered-maha-govt-saving-someone-narayan-rane/story-MY10szxN6OHT7jQkPdwWZK.html
04-08-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 testing rate lower than other nations, says WHO Chief Scientist||Noting that lockdown was a temporary measure to contain the spread of coronavirus, a senior official of the World Health Organisation on Tuesday said India has a low testing rate when compared to some of the countries that are successfully trying to curb it. The Chief Scientist of WHO, Soumya Swaminathan, in an interactive session through video conference said,as of now about 28 vaccine candidates for Covid-19 are under clinical trial, of which five are entering Phase-II and over 150 candidates are in pre-clinical trials across the globe. “India as a whole, the testing rates are much lower compared to some of the countries, who have done well like Germany, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan. Even the United States is testing a huge number of people. So we need to have some benchmark and every public health department needs to have benchmarks on what is the rate of testing per lakh or per million, what is the test positivity rate,” she said. Without adequate number of tests, fighting the virus is like “fighting fire blindfolded,” she pointed out. According to Swaminathan, the number of tests being conducted is not adequate if the Covid-19 test positivity rate is above five per cent. Governments need to constantly monitor the availability of beds, quarantine facilities, ICUs and oxygen supplies in district hospitals. “So there is a set of 8 to 10 indicators that the government needs to keep a close watch on. And you can ramp up or ramp down based on what you are seeing on the ground,” she said. Observing that the scientists’ community was still studying the body’s immune response to coronavirus and the next 12 months were crucial to put in place the public health and social measures, she said the virus has spread to every country in the world and “established community transmission”. “We know that lockdowns are temporary measures or a temporary measure which reduces the spread because it prevents people from getting closer together and the idea of the lockdown is to buy time for the government to put in place the system needed to tackle the virus,” the WHO official said. On the ongoing vaccine trials, she said the WHO has issued guidelines on it and if the efficacy rate of the vaccine is 70 percent, then it is considered to be a good one. On the COVAX facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, Swaminathan said by the end of 2021 it is aimed to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification. All the 194 member countries of the WHO need to come together and take a decision on the way they want to proceed for the equitable and fair distribution of vaccine (once successfully comes out) and other products that are being developed for Covid-19, she opined. Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, which is into developing Covaxin, a vaccine candidate for Covid-19,said the Centre needs to decetralise some of the regulating authorities such as Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO for faster approvals. Telangana Minister for IT and Industries KT Rama Rao acted as a moderator for the session titled The Vaccine Race- Balancing Science and Urgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-testing-rate-lower-than-other-nations-says-who-chief-scientist/story-UG4hVS3GsDAU4ldL36MbFJ.html
04-08-2020||India||NIA team may visit UAE as agency widens Kerala gold smuggling probe||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the sensational Kerala gold smuggling case has sought the Centre’s nod to send a team to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as part of the investigation, an official familiar with the probe said Tuesday.The official said the trip may be cleared by the Union Government in a couple of days. He also said two more persons, Mohammad Shafeeq and E Sharfuddin, were arrested from north Kerala for facilitating the distribution of smuggled gold. A total of 12 people have been arrested so far in the case.The gold smuggling racket came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of the yellow metal that was sent on an air consignment to the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was seized at the airport by the Customs. P Sarith, who came to receive the consignment, was arrested by the Customs immediately and two other accused Swapna Suresh and Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was later suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced. The Customs department, which is part of the probe headed by the NIA, has decided to question Sivasankar again because there were many discrepancies in his earlier statements, said a senior official. He has already been questioned by the Customs and the NIA separately. There are also reports that a senior politician will also be questioned for helping some members of the smuggling racket. When two lockers of Swapna Suresh were opened last week, investigators reportedly found Rs one crore cash and two kg gold. These lockers were in the joint name of Suresh and a chartered accountant. The latter told the investigators that he was allegedly asked by Sivasankar to help Suresh to open lockers three years ago.Suresh reportedly gave a detailed statement to the NIA containing vital information about all financial dealings and persons involved in the smuggling, said the official. He said more people will be arrested in a couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-team-may-visit-uae-as-agency-widens-kerala-gold-smuggling-probe/story-WncLNIDWqJAtLmWwelaUEM.html

These candidates have been asked to submit their application forms, option certificate and other documents to Army Headquarters by August 31, 2020, the spokesperson added.In a landmark judgement in February this year, the Supreme Court had ruled that women should be considered for command roles and were entitled to permanent commission. The apex court asked the government to give them PC within three months.The Centre had then filed an application in July before the SC seeking extension of the deadline by another six months citing the Covid-19 pandemic. But it was given a one-month extension to implement the order.The defence ministry then issued a formal sanction letter on July 23, thus paving the way for “empowering women officers to shoulder larger roles in the organisation”.A statement had said “the army is committed to providing equal opportunities to all personnel including women officers to serve the country.”The defence ministry order specified grant of Permanent Commission to Short Service Commissioned (SSC) women officers in all the ten streams of the Indian Army including Army Air Defence (AAD), Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation, Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME), Army Service Corps (ASC), Army Ordnance Corps (AOC), and Intelligence Corps in addition to the existing streams of Judge and Advocate General (JAG) and Army Educational Corps (AEC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-begins-process-of-granting-permanent-commission-to-women-officers/story-uFf2gOJLJgq4pOrvNf7lpJ.html

04-08-2020||India||Kashmir and Article 370: A look at the cases in Supreme Court and where do they stand||August 5 marks the first anniversary of the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir. The move led to numerous petitions in the Supreme Court. Here is a look at where those cases stand. Challenge to abrogation of Article 370 A total of 23 petitions challenging the central government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, thereby revoking Kashmir’s special status, are pending in the Supreme Court. These petitions were heard by a Constitution bench led by justice NV Ramana last December and in January. Some parties to the case requested the case should be referred to a larger bench of seven or more judges. This, they argued, was because two earlier Supreme Court judgments – Prem Nath Kaul (1959) and Sampat Prakash (1968) – are at loggerheads on the scope and intent of Article 370, and whether the provision was intended to be temporary, transitory or permanent. Since both judgments were delivered by benches of five judges, the parties asked the court to refer the matter to a larger bench. The Central government and the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir opposed the reference and said there was no conflict between the two judgments. They maintained Article 370 was temporary. The Constitution bench heard the parties with regard to the reference and delivered its verdict on this limited aspect on March 2. It declined to refer the matter to a larger bench, saying there was no conflict between the judgments in Prem Nath Kaul and Sampat Prakash. The case has not been heard after that. Petitions against lockdown The scrapping of Article 370 was accompanied by a total shutdown of Kashmir to stifle protests which were anticipated. Telephone lines, mobile communication and internet services were stopped and restrictions were imposed on media and transport. A slew of petitions were filed in the Supreme Court challenging these restrictions, which petitioners argued were violated the fundamental right to speech and expression and the right to move freely. The petitioners included Kashmir Times editor Anuradha Bhasin and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court heard the case and ruled on January 10 that restrictive orders suspending internet, telecommunications and movement should be reviewed by the government. It said freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to carry on trade or profession through the internet is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution, and any order suspending internet can only be temporary and not for an indefinite period. Such orders should indicate reasons for such a shutdown, which should be published in the public domain, the court ruled. While the court did say bars on free speech and movement would violate fundamental rights, it didn’t strike down such prohibitions. Instead, it asked the government to review such restrictions. The practical impact of the judgment was scant, though the government subsequently eased many restrictions. Plea for restoring 4G services A petition was filed in the Supreme Court in April, challenging an order by the Jammu and Kashmir administration restricting mobile internet speeds to 2G. The petition by the NGO, Foundation for Media Professionals, said 4G services be restored in view of the Covid-19 crisis. It contended restrictions on mobile internet speed was affecting the people’s right to know the latest information about Covid-19 and medical health services since doctors weren’t able to access latest studies, protocols, manuals and advisories on the Coronavirus. It also pointed out that slow internet speeds rendered telemedicine or online video consultations impossible. The Supreme Court, in a judgment on May 11, refrained from passing directions to restore 4G services and instead constituted a special committee of senior officers to take a call on the issue and to examine the need to allow faster internet speed in certain areas of the union territory. Subsequently, a contempt of court petition was filed by the petitioner in June, pointing out that no action had been taken to comply with the top court’s judgment. The central government told the Supreme Court a special committee was set up in line with the Supreme Court’s May 11 order to review restrictions on mobile internet speeds and it decided against any relaxations for the time being. When the matter came up for hearing on July 28, the petitioner told the court that Lieutenant Governor GC Murmu had told media that 4G should be restored, a stance contrary to the Central government’s. The Central government told the Supreme Court it will verify media reports and respond to the petitioner’s claim. The case will come up for hearing on August 7. Habeas corpus petitions Several habeas corpus petitions were filed in the Supreme Court against detention of individuals. Four such petitions are: Omar Abdullah Former chief minister Omar Abdullah’s detention was challenged in February in the Supreme Court by his sister Sara Abdullah Pilot. The top court on February 14 issued notice to the Jammu and Kashmir administration but the petition became infructuous (pointless) after Abdullah was released on March 24. Mehbooba Mufti Iltija Mufti, the daughter of former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti, challenged the latter’s detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA), saying it was based on vague grounds that demonstrated personal and political bias. Mufti was detained on August 5, 2019. She was initially detained under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers an executive magistrate to order a person to execute bonds “for keeping the peace”. She was in custody for six months and her detention was set to expire in February, when a new detention order was issued under PSA, which allows the administration to detain a person without trial for up to two years. In her petition, Iltija said the February 5 order shifting her mother from preventive custody to detention under PSA was based on a dossier prepared by the superintendent of police, Srinagar, that was replete with personal remarks and in bad taste. The court issued notice to the Central government on February 26 but the matter hasn’t been heard after that. The central government, on July 31, extended Mufti’s detention by three months. Saifuddin Soz This would be the most noteworthy of all habeas corpus pleas from Jammu and Kashmir. Congress leader and former Union minister Soz’s detention was challenged in the Supreme Court on June 1 by his wife Mumtazunnisa Soz. Soz, an octogenarian, is a former member of Parliament who served as Union minister for environment and forests during 1997-99, and as Union minister for water resources during 2006-09. He was detained on August 5, 2019. When the petition came up for hearing on June 8, the Supreme Court sought responses from the Central government and Jammu and Kashmir. The Centre said in an affidavit in July that Soz was never under detention and the petition was misconceived and frivolous. It said Soz had been given security for his protection and was free to go anywhere. The Supreme Court disposed of the case on July 29 after recording the Centre’s stance. However, there was a twist to the tale as Soz was captured on video stating he is under house arrest. The video showed security personnel barring Soz from coming out of his house or not permitting visitors inside the compound. The order passed by the Supreme Court on July 29 disposing of the petition is yet to be uploaded on the court’s website. Mian Abdul Qayoom Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association president Qayoom secured a reasonably favourable order from the top court. Qayoom was detained on August 5 last year under PSA. He was shifted to Agra the same month and then to Tihar jail in Delhi in January. His plea challenging his detention was turned down by the Jammu and Kashmir high court on May 29. The high court said Qayoom’s ideology, which the government termed “separatist”, was like a live volcano and remained unaffected by passage of time. Qayoom then appealed to the top court. A three-judge bench ordered Qayoom’s release on July 29 after the Central government agreed, taking into account his age and deteriorating health. “We are sure that the petitioner (Qayoom) will also adopt a more constructive approach to the future and the Government will consider how to bring complete normalcy at the earliest,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-and-article-370-a-look-at-the-cases-in-sc-and-where-do-they-stand/story-SLNajzn1cL3JNXuHH4eVdO.html

At least 110 people died after consuming spurious liquor, mainly in the three districts-- Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Batala. The Punjab government is facing a barrage of attacks from opposition and even from within the ruling party over allegations of state government’s alleged connivance with the mafia running the illicit liquor trade.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who had ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident and instructed the police chief for a swift crackdown on the spurious liquor network in the state, said no one will be spared irrespective of their influence and position.“Deaths by illicit alcohol are extremely sad and unfortunate. Police and Excise Depts tasked to nab all responsible, irrespective of their affiliations & position. Assure you as CM that no one will be spared & guilty will be punished to ensure justice,” Singh tweeted on Tuesday.Also Read: Six more die due to spurious liquor in Punjab; death toll 110Singh’s tweet follows a Congress MP accusing the state government of being complicit with the accused.“It’s a big tragedy, such a thing has never happened in Punjab. It couldn’t have happened without the knowledge of government & police. That is why no action is being taken. How did raw material for liquor come amid curfew?,” Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Dullo was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Dullo further questioned how the tragedy took place despite him having warned the state government and the party top brass in Delhi about the menace of spurious liquor trade in the Punjab.“I had warned the state government a month back in writing, even wrote to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi & Manmohan Singh... but no action was taken. Govt seems to be in cahoots with smugglers,” Dullo was quoted as saying.Dullo is not the only Congress leader to have attacked the Punjab government, also run by the Congress party. Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa had also hit out at Amarinder Singh government over the tragedy.

Police, however, refuted the allegations of the family and claimed the driver of the vehicle assumed that he also needed a pass for inter-district travel and returned from the check post without informing them about the medical emergency. The Surajpur district collector has ordered an enquiry into the incident and said that action will be taken accordingly. “The incident took place on August 2, when my wife Bihani Devi who was suffering from cold, cough and fever, was being shifted to a hospital in Ambikapur in Surguja district. When we were going from Balrampur district, we were stopped by policemen at a check post under Chandaura police station in Surajpur district,” Ramadhar Painka, the husband of Bihani Devi told reporters.The family members also claimed that they showed the hospital prescriptions but police allegedly refused to allow them to cross the check post following which they returned to Wadrafnagar where Bihani Devi was being treated. She died later in the day in the local hospital. A senior health department official said the woman was a heart patient.Inspector General of Police, Surajpur, KL Dangi said the charges against the police were not correct and the family members had not told police officers deployed at the check post about the medical emergency. “A joint team of police, health officials and revenue officers is deployed at the check post because it is highway which connects Uttar Pradesh. For inter-district commutation, no pass is required. It is only for the people coming from other states the passes are checked and that too by other officials not police,” said Dangi. The IG further said there was a long queue of vehicles at the check post. The family was in a private vehicle along with the ailing woman.“The driver without asking anyone at the check-post told the family members that a pass is required and hence they went back to Wadrafnagar where the treatment of the woman was going on. The woman died there which is unfortunate,” the IG said. The officer further said that everyone knows that for inter-district commutation no pass is needed in the state. Meanwhile, Surajpur Collector Ranbir Sharma said, an enquiry headed by a joint collector has been ordered into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ailing-woman-in-chhattisgarh-dies-after-allegedly-turned-back-from-police-check-post/story-oUWJ4LqleH1REoetwR75HJ.html
04-08-2020||India||‘Read the Constitution’: Nitish Kumar faces pushback for CBI probe in Sushant case||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday set up a fresh row over investigations into Sushant Singh Rajput death, recommending a CBI probe into the actor’s death on June 14. Kumar’s announcement came after Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey spoke with the actor’s father earlier in the day.“The state government has sent its recommendation for a CBI probe into the FIR registered by Sushant Singh Rajput’s father KK Singh,” Nitish Kumar tweeted on Tuesday afternoon after completing the paperwork to make the recommendation.Kumar had earlier in the day announced that his government would seek a CBI probe after Bihar lawmakers across parties demanded that the central investigating agency take up the case.Bihar lawmakers had yesterday again pushed for a CBI inquiry in the state assembly. BJP leader Neeraj Singh, who is also Sushant’s cousin, was the first to raise the demand. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav quickly backed him up, saying Sushant Singh Rajput’s family should get justice.The actor’s suicide in Mumbai has been a politically sensitive case in Bihar, Sushant Singh’s home before he moved to Mumbai. Bihar assembly elections are scheduled later this year and no party wants to be seen standing on the wrong side of the narrative around Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in Bihar.But the attempt by Bihar Police to launch a parallel investigation into Sushant Singh’s death in Mumbai had been a controversial one, right from the beginning over the jurisdiction of the state police for offences alleged to have taken place in Maharashtra.Satish Maneshinde, the lawyer who is representing actor Rhea Chakraborty, was the first to launch a counter-attack at the Bihar government, wondering how it could recommend transfer of a case that it had no business investigating. Maneshinde told reporters that the Bihar police could only register a zero FIR.A zero FIR is registered by a police station when an offence reported to it has been committed in the area under the jurisdiction of a different police station.Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has made the same point. “The law is clear. If the incident has not happened in our jurisdiction, we register a ‘zero’ first information report [FIR], and transfer it,” the Mumbai police chief said on Monday.But the sharpest attack came from Randeep Surjewala, the Congress’ chief spokesperson.Surjewala said it was time for the chief minister to read the Constitution again.“It is the responsibility of the state government to maintain law and order within the state. In Maharashtra, it is the responsibility of Maharashtra’s coalition government led by Uddhav Thackeray to enforce the law. Nitish Kumar should read the Constitution again. Nitish Kumar or the Bihar government cannot interfere with the investigations by trying to force its way in,” Surjewala said.The standoff between Mumbai and Bihar police over the Sushant Singh case is seen to mirror the rivalry between the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in Bihar and Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition that comprises the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-recommends-cbi-probe-in-sushant-case-sets-up-a-new-row/story-qbjgT4fEXLCxk3YZhdy77H.html

However, no NSA was invoked against me or the millions of other protesters across the country.“I am quite bewildered as to why a young medical practitioner has been implicated despite the fact that freedom of expression has been engraved in the hallowed Constitution of India,” Chowdhury wrote in the letter.The senior Congress leader urged Modi to secure justice for Khan, who had been in jail since January.“Even international forums such as the United Nations have been persuading you for the release of Kafeel Khan. Sir, I firmly believe that ‘Ramraj’ is simply antithetical to injustice, discrimination and retribution,” the Lok Sabha MP from Berhampore said.Khan was arrested at Mumbai airport on January 29 in connection with a case registered at Aligarh’s Civil Lines police station under section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code.The section relates to enmity promotion between groups over religion and other differences.On February 10, Khan was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court but not immediately released by Mathura Jail authorities. His family then moved the court in Aligarh, claiming contempt of the HC order.The court issued a fresh release order on February 13.But before it could be executed, the authorities invoked the National Security Act against him.The paediatrician had earlier faced arrest following the deaths of over 60 children in a week at a government hospital in UP’s Gorakhpur in 2017.About two years later, a state government probe cleared Khan of all major charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adhir-writes-to-pm-for-kafeel-khan-s-release-says-ramraj-antithetical-to-injustice/story-c0ZTrenM49FRpgEetzJyRM.html

The man ran away from the hospital soon after the test results on Sunday night confirmed that he was positive for coronavirus, an official said.“We have lodged an FIR against the person and advised our staff to take extra precautions while arresting him,” said Ashok Kumar, in-charge Pantnagar police station.The district hospital falls under the jurisdiction of Pantnagar police station.“The 33-year-old man was suffering from fever. His test was conducted and when the report was received and he was informed that he had tested Covid-19 positive, he ran away from the hospital,” said Kumar.Ever since the epidemic began, many people have run away from quarantine centres and hospitals, especially in the Kumaon region. In May, nine people ran away from a village quarantine centre in the Bazpur area of US Nagar. In the same month, 10 persons ran away from a quarantine centre set up at Haripura village in US Nagar. Later, they were nabbed by police and again put under quarantine at Sooraj Mal College at Kichha.Similar incidents were reported from quarantine centres in Kashipur, Nanakmatta, Pantnagar and Khatima areas of US Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tests-show-man-is-covid-19-ve-he-runs-away-from-hospital-fir-filed/story-OrknIdoLo8Le5Wtjliv4xL.html
04-08-2020||India||US doing ‘very well’ against Covid-19, India has a ‘tremendous problem’: Donald Trump||President Donald Trump has said that as compared to big countries, America is doing “very well” in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, while India is having a “tremendous problem” battling the disease and China is witnessing a “massive flare up” in infections.India’s Covid-19 tally increased to 18,55,745 on Tuesday with 52,050 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day.China on Tuesday reported 36 new cases across the country, down from 43 the previous day. The country’s Covid19 cases crossed the 100-mark on July 29, for the first time in over three months, sparking the fear of a rebound.“I think we’re doing very well. I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flare ups and nations that they were talking about,” Trump told reporters at a news conference here on Monday.As such, compared to larger countries, the US is doing much better in the fight against the coronavirus, he said.“Don’t forget, we’re much bigger than--other than India and China. China is having a massive flare up right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems,” he said in response to a question.“And I noticed that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any news, I don’t read about the other countries. You’re starting to see that other countries are having very big flare ups, countries that thought they were over it, like we thought we might be over in Florida, and then all of a sudden it comes back. They do come back,” he said.The US is the worst-hit country from the pandemic with over 4.7 million cases and more than 155,000 deaths.The US, Trump said, has tested over 60 million people for coronavirus.“No other country is even close to that. We’ve tested 60 million people -in many cases about 50 percent, now rapid fire, meaning five to 15 to 20-minute tests where you get the results almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. And I think we’re just doing very well,” he said.Trump said that the US is beginning to see evidence of significant progress. Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly six percent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 per cent to 8 per cent over that same period of time.“Hotspots across the South and West; we have seen slow improvements from their recent weekly peaks,” he said, adding that Arizona’s weekly case counts have dropped 37 per cent that is a tremendous drop and the governor and the state have done a fantastic job down 37 per cent, Texas down 18.7 per cent, and Florida 21.2 per cent drop.“As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri, and I think you will find that they are soon going to be very much under control,” he said.Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates under five per cent, including New Jersey, New York, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts.Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up, he said.“To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places and to protect the elderly very, very important, protect the elderly. It is much different....,” Trump said.It is important for all Americans to recognise that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path towards producing the results that one wants or certainly not a viable path forward and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent, he said.“As we are seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging, you have many places where we thought they were under control doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough invisible enemy. Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future. They just don’t. It comes back many times...,” he said.The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity in hospitals, learn more about the disease and develop effective treatments, he asserted.“We are doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutic. Countries, where there have been very significant flare ups over the last short period of time, are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and also, as you probably heard in Hong Kong, they have had some very serious flare ups. Japan has gone a lot of--six-fold, six-fold flareup, that’s a lot, but they will get it under control,” he said.“In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools.

Lord Ram wants everybody’s welfare. That is why he is called ‘Maryada Purshottam’,” the Congress general secretary said in a statement. “The groundbreaking ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has been scheduled for August 5. Hope this event becomes an occasion of national unity, brotherhood and cultural harmony in accordance with the message of Lord Ram and with his blessings and that of Mother Sita,” she said. Gandhi’s remarks are in line with the party’s renewed stand on the issue after the Supreme Court gave its verdict on the Ram temple last November. At its meeting on November 9 last year, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, unanimously passed a resolution on the issue, saying it respects the verdict. It had also appealed to everyone to maintain peace and harmony in the country. That day, the Congress favoured the construction of the Ram temple and sought to take credit for the development, insisting it was the party-led central government that acquired 67 acres outside the disputed 2.77 acres in 1993 to maintain law and order. The Congress also recalled it was the Rajiv Gandhi government that allowed ‘shilanyas’ or a groundbreaking ceremony at an undisputed site close to the structure and opened the doors of the Ram temple in 1986. After the demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992, the Centre acquired the disputed site and 67 acres surrounding it through a law passed in 1993. The land included pockets of government land, a disputed shrine and land belonging to Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas. But the Nyas opposed the take-over and said the land should be handed over to its rightful owner. Quoting poets such as Maithilisharan Gupt and Nirala, Priyanka Gandhi said that for ages, Lord Ram’s character had served as a source of unity for the Indian subcontinent. “Ramayana has left an indelible mark on the civilisation of the world and the Indian subcontinent. For ages, Lord Ram’s character has helped the Indian subcontinent,” she added. In a tweet, she said, “Simplicity, courage, restraint, sacrifice, commitment, are the essence of the name Deenbandhu Rama. Ram is with everyone, Ram is with everyone.” Addressing a news conference at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said politics should have ‘dharma’, instead of having politics of ‘dharma’. “It is the responsibility of each one of us to reaffirm our tradition of mutual respect and unity among all that has defined our society through the ages,” he said. Last week, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath too welcomed the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying it is being built with the consent of every Indian. “I welcome the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. People of the country have been expecting and waiting for this for a long time now,” the senior Congress leader said in a video. “Such thing is possible only in India,” he added. The issue also resonated at a meeting between Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the party’s Rajya Sabha members on July 30. Deepender Singh Hooda said Congress leaders should speak in one voice and stick to the CWC resolution on the issue as it is attached to the sentiments of millions of Indians. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony at Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lord-ram-belongs-to-everyone-says-priyanka-gandhi-ahead-of-bhoomi-pujan/story-e781uBxBZSzzOanZwPeaeL.html

04-08-2020||India||Two BSF personnel shot dead by colleague in north Bengal||A constable of the Border Security Force (BSF) shot dead two of his colleagues in north Bengal late at night on Monday in another case of fratricide in paramilitary forces. The accused surrendered a few hours later and was handed over to the police. “Inspector Mahendra Singh Bhatti and constable Anuj Kumar were shot dead by constable Uttam Sutradhar. They died on the spot. Sutradhar surrendered before the company commander a few hours later,” said Sumit Kumar, superintendent of police (SP), Uttar Dinajpur district. The three BSF personnel were on duty along the Indo-Bangladesh border under Raiganj police station in North Dinajpur district at night on Monday. They were attached to the Maldakhand border outpost of BSF’s 146 battalion. While Sutradhar belongs to Tripura, slain Bhatti and Kumar hailed from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. Even though a senior police officer said that Sutradhar had some grievances against some BSF officers, which could have led to the fratricide, the paramilitary authorities are yet to ascertain the cause of the incident. On Monday night, at around 11:50 pm, Sutradhar fired two rounds in the air from his service rifle. When Bhatti and Kumar rushed to the spot, Sutradhar opened fire on them and killed them on the spot. “The company commander reached the spot and the constable surrendered to him at around 3 am. The victims neither had any quarrel nor scuffle with the accused. The cause of firing will be ascertained after the conduct of a probe,” said Rajeev Ranjan Sharma, deputy inspector- general (DIG) BSF, North Bengal Frontier. The bodies were sent for post-mortem examination and Sutradhar was handed over to the police, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-bsf-personnel-shot-dead-by-colleague-in-north-bengal/story-EIhZgsyZS7WwOpIIl3XOQO.html
04-08-2020||India||At least 70 Maoists have surrendered under Lon Varratu campaign in Dantewada till now||At least 70 purported outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist rebels have laid down their arms and surrendered under the ongoing Lon Varratu campaign in the past two months in around 50 villages of the Left-wing Extremism (LWE)-hit Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh. The human rights activists claimed that an innocent tribal is being trapped between Chhattisgarh Police and other paramilitary security forces and the Maoists. Under the programme, the activists alleged, the police are forcing innocent tribals to turn themselves in. Lon Varratu in the tribal Gond dialect means homecoming. The police have earmarked about 50 hypersensitive Maoist-dominated villages, where pamphlets have been put up with an appeal for villagers to surrender. Police said of the 70 surrendered Maoist rebels, 15 had a reward between Rs one and eight lakh on their heads. On Sunday, Malla, who had an Rs 8-lakh reward on his head and was a military platoon deputy commander, surrendered on his own due to growing pressure from his sisters before the Raksha Bandhan that was celebrated the following day, police said. Police and the state administration believe that Maoists might come around and shun violence if community awareness and pressure could be mounted. “The narrative and the landscape have reversed. Earlier, during monsoon, the Maoists would go on a hiring spree, but now it’s the high season for surrender,” said Abhishek Pallava, superintendent of police (SP), Dantewada. The SP said the Maoists’ anonymous cover has been blown off because of the campaign. “The Lon Varratu campaign has led to transparency. There are no complaints of fake arrests and encounters. The drive targets top rung to grassroots Maoist rebels, who are being given an opportunity to join the social mainstream,” Pallava added. Police claimed that the success of the programme could be gauged from the fact that not even a single poster put up in remote Naxal sensitive villages has been torn. Soni Sori, a tribal leader, questioned the campaign and claimed that an unsuspecting tribal is caught between the Maoist rebels and the police. “Who has given the rights to the police to declare a person a Maoist? Tribal farmers have been declared Maoists under this draconian campaign,” alleged Sori. The poor tribals have nowhere to go, as the police are pressuring them to surrender and the Maoists are torturing them for co-operating with the police, she alleged. ‘Surrender is the key, but it shouldn’t be imposed upon innocent tribal farmers,” she added. Pallava refuted Sori’s allegations. “Tribals are getting an opportunity for the first time to join the social mainstream. We hope they will use this option and surrender in the coming days, as Maoists cadres in respective villages have been reduced to a minority,” he said. The SP said any tribal villager, who might feel that his name has been erroneously included as a Maoist rebel, has the right to seek redressal. He reached out to the activists to “share feedback about the campaign and ways to improve it”. The Dantewada district administration is also providing livelihood opportunities to the surrendered Maoists under the campaign. “The district administration is providing them with agricultural equipment such as tractor, construction activities, and also work in veterinary and allied departments. Many of these tribals, who have surrendered, are encouraging others to join the social mainstream. The state government’s poverty alleviation scheme for Dantewada will be extended to all the surrendered beneficiaries,” said Deepak Soni, district collector, Dantewada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-70-maoists-have-surrendered-under-lon-varratu-campaign-in-dantewada-till-now/story-cA7LuH2Y0hXFP6jCSEwCQK.html

This crisis, too, will fade away with the blessings of Lord Ram,” it said.The responsibility of security arrangements in Ayodhya was with the Home ministry, but it is unfortunate that Home Minister Amit Shah tested coronavirus positive, it said.Despite the presence of the Prime Minister, the RSS chief, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and others, the ceremony will be lacklustre without Shah, the Sena said.It said Shah participated in a public event in Delhi last Saturday and attended the cabinet meeting last Wednesday observing social distancing norms, and has asked those who came in his contact in the past few days to isolate themselves and get tested for coronavirus.The entire Council of ministers needs to be isolated, if the home minister is saying this, it said.Shah is close to Modi but nothing will happen to the prime minister and the home minister due the blessings of Lord Ram, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-will-disappear-with-blessings-of-lord-ram-shiv-sena/story-om10czVEwZlGMeAw9vuF7M.html
04-08-2020||India||Rajasthan SOG requests local court to transfer alleged horse-trading case to ACB||The special operations group (SOG) of Rajasthan Police has done a U-turn about the three first information reports (FIRs) registered in July related to the toppling of the Ashok Gehlot-led government by requesting a local court to transfer the investigation to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). “We have requested the court to transfer the investigation to the ACB because the preliminary probe has revealed that the charges of inducement of Rajasthan Assembly lawmakers cannot be categorised as sedition. More details will be shared soon,” said Ashok Rathore, additional director general of police (ADGP), SOG, Rajasthan Police. The SOG has registered three FIRS on the basis of complaints filed by the chief whip of Rajasthan Assembly, Mahesh Joshi, which pertained to horse-trading allegedly aimed at dislodging the Gehlot government in Rajasthan. The first FIR was registered on July 10, in which the two accused, Ashok Jain from Banswara and Bharat Malani, were arrested and are in judicial custody. The second and third FIRs were registered on July 17. In the second FIR, Bhanwarlal Sharma, one of the 18 dissident Congress lawmakers, who is backing the sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, a businessman-turned-political fixer Sanjay Jain and one Gajendra Singh were booked. On July 17, the ACB also registered a case against the three accused, who were booked under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988. Vivek Bajwa, the counsel for Jain, said that the SOG has filed an application in the chief judicial magistrate’s court that the shreds of evidence found to date are not applicable under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code, and the ACB could be entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the probe. He also demanded Jain’s bail on the ground that the charges levelled against his client are a bailable offence. “We have requested the court that the SOG FIRs only related to criminal conspiracy, a bailable offence. We have requested the court to grant bail to my client, Sanjay Jain,” Bajwa added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-sog-requests-local-court-to-transfer-investigation-of-toppling-of-govt-to-acb/story-syAfmO94mRZg3k8LmIGDaN.html
04-08-2020||India||‘Thin line between free speech and contempt’: Supreme Court tells Prashant Bhushan||The Supreme Court on Tuesday concluded arguments in the 2009 contempt case against advocate Prashant Bhushan. The hearing was conducted in-camera with the bench of three judges led by Justice Arun Mishra speaking to senior lawyers Rajeev Dhavan, Kapil Sibal and Harish Salve individually on WhatsApp video call. Dhavan appeared for Bhushan while Sibal represented former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal, who is also named in the contempt case initiated by Salve.The case pertains to an interview given by Bhushan to Tehelka where he alleged that half of past 16 chief justices of India (CJIs) were corrupt. The bench said that there is a thin line between free speech and contempt.The judges told Dhavan that they seek to balance the right to free speech on one hand and the need to protect the dignity of the judiciary as an institution.The top court had said in the last hearing that it is giving some time to the counsels appearing in the matter to prepare and had posted the matter for hearing on August 4.The apex court in November 2009, had issued contempt notice to Bhushan and Tejpal for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to Tehelka. Tejpal was the editor of the magazine.On July 22, the same bench had issued suo motu (on its own) notice to Bhushan for his remarks and two alleged derogatory tweets against the judiciary, observing his statements prima facie “brought the administration of justice in disrepute”.In his reply to the court’s notice, Bhushan said the expression of opinion, “however outspoken, disagreeable or unpalatable to some”, cannot constitute contempt of court.In a 142-page reply affidavit filed through lawyer Kamini Jaiswal, the activist lawyer has referred to several apex court judgements, speeches of former and serving judges on contempt of court and the “stifling of dissent” in a democracy and his views on judicial actions in some cases.Bhushan also stood by his two tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thin-line-between-free-speech-and-contempt-supreme-court-tells-prashant-bhushan/story-UEtgGBuFadsGwvpzctTj0L.html
04-08-2020||India||Mumbai receives half of August’s average rain in less than 4 days, downpour likely to continue||With 26 days to go till the end of the month, Mumbai has already received 50 percent of its August average rainfall owing to incessant downpour over the past 16 hours. Heavy rain led to the overflow of Dahisar river in the northwestern suburbs and inundated parts of the city’s national park.Against the monthly average rainfall of 585.2 mm, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of Mumbai, recorded 293 mm rain from August 1 to August 4 noon. Of this, 271 mm was recorded between 8.30 pm Monday and 12.30 pm Tuesday. Intense thundershowers and high-speed winds witnessed overnight died down on early Tuesday morning with light to moderate rain. The suburbs recorded 20.2 mm rain between 8.30 am and 12.30 pm while south Mumbai recorded 9.8 mm.The weather bureau has predicted extremely heavy rain for the rest of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday morning announced the formation of a low-pressure system over north Bay of Bengal (BoB). Also read: Mumbai civic body asks people to stay home unless urgent following incessant overnight rain“As per the accurate forecast, the Konkan coast, including Mumbai, has witnessed intense showers due to prevailing weather synoptic factors stemming from the low-pressure system in the BoB. This trend is likely to continue, and necessary warnings were issued to respective government departments well in advance,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Independent meteorologists said an offshore trough and a vortex system (localised circulation) were activated on Monday night paving the way for extremely heavy rain activity. “These rains were expected and predicted much earlier by the IMD as well as weather bloggers. With the confirmation of the low-pressure formation, north Konkan including Mumbai will continue to see very heavy rains for the next 48 hours. This low pressure will keep the offshore trough very active along with a cyclonic system in the north Arabian Sea,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.He added that Palghar, Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Ratnagiri should continue to remain on high alert for the next 48 hours.Water stock across seven lakes was 35 percent of the required total even after intense rainfall. It was 92 percent last year by this time. “Catchment areas (lakes supply water to the city will also start getting rains by Tuesday afternoon or evening. An increase in lake levels is expected by Aug 7,” said Balasubramanian.Areas within and along the periphery of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SNGP), Borivli witnessed waterlogging after Dahisar river overflowed on Tuesday morning. The SGNP office and six structures of staff quarters were flooded. “All structures had 1.5-foot high water. Our staff is working on its removal. However, more flooding was witnessed along Shanti Van bridge at SGNP’s periphery, which has put traffic movement to a standstill,” said Vijay Barabde, range forest officer, SGNP. Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife-west) said, “Luckily no animals have been injured in the wild or the captive animal rescue centres and there have been minimal tree fall cases. Fortunately, an accurate forecast by the weather bureau helped us identify the risk we were facing. On Monday itself, all major files, electronics and other valuables were kept at a height of 5 foot and above to ensure there is no damage to them.” Last year water had entered the offices, damaging important documents and computer databases.Meanwhile, Tulsi lake had overflowed on July 28 through its southern course towards Vihar and then Powai Lakes. However, on Tuesday morning, lake levels reached the brim even towards the northern end of the constructed dam. “We are concerned about flooding due to excess rainwater overflows from this end of the lake, which will directly affect the residential quarters and the SGNP office area. Despite repeated reminders last year for a structural audit of the lake, it has not been carried out so far,” said Limaye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-receives-half-of-august-s-average-rain-in-less-than-4-days-downpour-likely-to-continue/story-wImRGhL2iMMhVSEEjVdgyM.html
04-08-2020||India||Congress again reaches out to rebel Rajasthan MLAs, lists its only condition||The Congress party could hold talks with the rebel MLAs of Sachin Pilot camp if they leave the hospitality of Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana, underlined party’s national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Tuesday. Surjewala maintained that the only condition for talks with the dissident Rajasthan MLAs is that they leave the BJP’s “suraksha chakra (protection)”. “Innocent kids are being killed, gang rapes are taking place, people are being beaten up in Gurugram. There is no police available for them, but 1,000 policemen are deployed for the security of 19 upset MLAs. The legislators should first give up the Haryana police’s security, and friendship and hospitality of the BJP, return home and only then will the dialogue take place,” said Surjewala, once again underscoring the party’s accommodating stance. Congress leaders have alleged that Pilot camp is staying at a Haryana hotel on BJP’s hospitality. They have also accused the BJP of attempting to topple the Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan.Surjewala, Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pande, and senior leader Ajay Maken have been sent by the party to the state as Central observers. On Saturday, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who earlier used harsh words against his Number 2 in the government, said that he would welcome back former deputy chief minister Sachin pilot and other dissident Congress legislators if the party’s high command forgave them.“If the high command forgives them (dissident MLAs), I will hug them. I have no prestige point,” Gehlot said while talking to the media outside a Jaisalmer hotel, where the MLAs loyal to him were shifted ahead of the assembly session from August 14.Gehlot has also rejected the claim of dissident Congress MLAs that their work was not being done.He told reporters that the MLAs earlier used to appreciate the government’s work and now they are complaining about it.He said people elected them but now they have “revolted”.The fissures in the state Congress leadership came to the fore when Pilot and 18 other MLAs rebelled against the Gehlot government in July. The chief minister has accused Pilot of trying to topple the government and alleged that he did nothing substantial as the Rajasthan Congress president in a seven-year tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-again-reaches-out-to-rebel-rajasthan-mlas-lists-its-only-condition/story-etV90KJHitS1ws4kCbPoWK.html
04-08-2020||India||Dissidents want dialogue, first leave BJPs hospitality and security: Surjewala||Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Tuesday said the 19 dissident party members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly (MLAs) should leave the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) hospitality and security of the Haryana Police, if they want to hold a dialogue with the party. “They (dissident MLAs) should first leave the hospitality of the BJP and security of the Haryana government, if they want to hold a dialogue. They should break their friendship with the BJP and ghar wapasi karein (return home),” he said while responding to the media persons’ query whether the doors are open for 19 Congress rebel lawmakers, including sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.Surjewala spoke to the media persons outside Hotel Suryagarh in Jaisalmer, where the Congress MLAs have been camping since last Friday. He alleged that the innocent children are being murdered, women are gang-raped and people are beaten up in Haryana but there is no police protection available for them. “But for 19 MLAs, around 1,000 police personnel has been deployed. The BJP is providing security to dissident Congress MLAs. What does this mean?” he asked. He also took an exception to the Bihar Police’s alleged interference in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide in Mumbai on June 14. He said the probe must be conducted under the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra Police. “The constitution and law uphold that maintaining law and order is the responsibility of the state government. Bihar government and its police cannot forcefully take action in other states. Such an action will lead to anarchy,” he said.Surjewala also read out the statement of Congress leaders such as Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra on the occasion of Bhoomi Pujan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on Wednesday. BJP leader Mukesh Pareek said it is surprising that the Congress speaks with a forked tongue while rubbishing baseless allegations against his party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissidents-want-dialogue-first-leave-bjps-hospitality-and-security-surjewala/story-wYGVkWxYugeinxgxOw4jIK.html

He will be in the city for three hours tomorrow.According to the official itinerary released on Tuesday, the prime minister will start from Delhi at 9:35 am, and the groundbreaking is ceremony is scheduled to take place after noon. The PM will first go to Lucknow on a special plane from Delhi, and from there to Ayodhya on a helicopter.He will straightaway go to Hanuman Garhi for Lord Hanuman’s darshan. The temple is being decorated ahead of the prime minister’s visit.Special puja and Vedic rituals have been going on at the ceremony venue since Monday. Prayers are also being held at Hanuman Garhi.PM Modi will reach the Ram Janmabhoomi site at noon, where he will visit Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) for 10 minutes, according to the itinerary. He will then participate in a tree plantation programme in the premises.The main programme of bhoomi poojan will begin at 12:30 pm and PM Modi will lay five silver bricks as the temple foundation amid the chanting of religious hymns at 12:40 pm, according to the Associated Press. The priests and religious leaders supervising the entire event said that the muhurat (auspicious moment) will last only for 32 seconds.The prime minister will also meet Swami Nrityagopal Das and other members of the Ram Janmabhoomi trust after the programme. He will leave for the helipad at 2:05 pm and for Lucknow at 2:20 pm.At Ram Janmabhoomi, 21 priests started Vedic rituals at around 9 am on Tuesday for Ramacharya puja.

Scenes from the popular stories of Ramayana have been etched on to the walls and other structures of the city on the road which PM Modi will use to reach the groundbreaking ceremony venue. More than 100,000 oil lamps will light up the city in celebration, said chief priest Satyendra Das.A security clampdown, however, will allow only limited entry to devotees into Ayodhya because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement, the Chinese embassy asked India to avoid what it described as “politicisation of normal cooperation” between the two countries and maintain stable people-to-people and cultural exchanges.Hindustan Times had first reported the government’s move to review the institutes after intelligence agencies raised security concerns around these institutes. The agencies had also pointed out that many central universities and institutes had gone ahead to sign pacts with Chinese institutes without basic approvals from the Centre.Also Read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomThe security alert came against the backdrop of a standoff between soldiers of the two countries along the Line of Actual Control in East Ladakh that has stretched for over 90 days and mounting concerns in parts of the world over the misuse of institutions funded by the Chinese government for activities other than academics.The review, to be carried out jointly by the higher education regulator University Grants Commission and the education ministry, is scheduled to be held on Wednesday.A senior education ministry official rejected the insinuation that the review is a political exercise as claimed by the Chinese embassy.“The review is being conducted to understand the functioning of these institutes and syllabus… The review is being conducted from an academic perspective,” the official told Hindustan Times.The official added that he could not prejudge the outcome of the review.Also Read: China moves PLA battalion across India’s Lipulekh Pass. It’s a signalThe Confucius Institutes are directly funded by the Ministry of Education of People’s Republic of China with the ostensible aim to promote Chinese language and Culture.But they have come in for criticism all around the world, including the US and the UK for helping spread Chinese propaganda. Already, ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee have been quoted saying that Confucius Institutes are part of the overseas propaganda to project Beijing’s soft power.Wednesday’s review is also scheduled to take up the 54 memoranda of understanding signed by central universities and institutions with Chinese universities. This exercise, besides evaluating the academic outcome of the agreements, will also take a hard look at compliance issues.

It is not done with a pre-determined mind to close them. We want to know what is in it for Indian students and India,” he said.Officials in India’s security establishment, however, have been pushing for action against Chinese interests on the lines of the ban on over 100 Chinese mobile apps and barring firms based in China from getting government contracts without specific approval.The Confucius Institutes in India to be reviewed are at: University of Mumbai; Vellore Institute of Technology; Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar; OP Jindal Global University, Sonepat; School of Chinese Language, Kolkata; Bharathiar University, Coimbatore; and KR Mangalam University, Gurugram.According to central government documents accessed by HT, the list of 54 MoUs that will be reviewed this week at a high-level committee are:IIT Kharagpur - (1) Tianjin University, (2) Henan Polytechnic University [HPU], (3) Chang Gung UniversityIIT Bombay - (1) Central University of Finance and Economics, (2) Tongji UniversityIIT Madras - (1) Beijing Jiaotong University, (2) Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology, (3) Shanghai International Studies University, (4) Dalian UniversityIIT Delhi - (1) Chang’an University, (2) City University Of Hong Kong Hiksar Peoples & Republic of China, (3) China Jiliang University, (4) Nanyang Normal UniversityIIT Guwahati - (1) Hunan University, (2) Shantou University, (3) Soochow University, (4) University of Macau, (5) Yunnan UniversityIIT Gandhinagar - (1) Confucius Institute Headquarters [HANBAN]IIT Roorkee - (1) The Center for Monsoon System Research of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at Chinese Academy of Sciences, (2) East China Normal University [ECNU]IIT Bhubaneswar - (1) Engineering Centre of Materials, Manufacturing, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong - University, China [during state visit of President of India to China]NIT Durgapur - (1) Tianjin Polytechnic University, (2) Hohai University, (3) Integrated Risk Governance Project, Future Earth Program [hereafter IRGP/FE], Beijing Normal University, (4) Southwest University for Nationalities [SWUN], Chengdu, (5) Beijing Normal University, (6) School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jiangsu University, (7) Hunan University, Changsha, HunanNIT Surathkal - (1) Institute of Radio Frequency and optoelectronics Integrated Circuits plus State Key Lab of Bioelectronics, Southeast UniversityNIT Warangal - (1) Chang’an UniversityIISER Kolkata - (1) Hubei University, (2) Changshu Institute of TechnologyIISC Bangalore - (1) China University of GeosciencesJawaharlal Nehru University - (1) Tsinghua University, (2) Beijing Normal University, (3) Shandong University, Jinan, (4) Guiyang University, Guiyang, Guizhou, (5) Tongren University, Tongren, Guizhou, (6) Guizhou Minzu University, (7) Sichuan University of People’s Republic of China, (8) Jinan University, (9) Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences/ the Chinese [Kunming] Academy of South and Southeast Asian Studies, (10) Yunnan Minzu University, (11) Shenzhen University, Guangdong, (12) Renmin University of China, BeijingManipur University - (1) Yunnan Open UniversityCentral University of Punjab - (1) Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, (2) Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xishuangbanna, YunnanBanaras Hindu University - (1) Soochow University, School of Law, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China (2)Beijing Language and Culture University, (3) Beijing Foreign Studies University, (4) North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power, (5) Dali University||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-review-of-confucius-institutes-riles-china-says-treat-them-in-fair-manner/story-IU6vo10CjJctLR8PcKLKOK.html

Trouble erupted, when two local youth had an altercation over the payment of toll with the plaza staff. “The two youth were allegedly beaten up by the toll plaza staff with baseball bats. The news spread like wildfire in the area and a few people assembled at the plaza around 11 pm. Initially, they resorted to sloganeering, and later they ransacked the toll collection cabins,” said a local resident. A majority of the staff fled the toll plaza, and the two, who had beaten up the youth, were thrashed by the mob. Later, Jammu & Kashmir Police reached the troubled spot and resorted to mild lathi-charge to restore law and order in the area. Kathua district commissioner (DC) OP Bhagat said that following the incident prohibitory order of assembly of four or more people, under Section 144 Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr PC), have been enforced in the area. “The incident occurred at night on Monday. The SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) informed me about it. A mob attacked the toll plaza staff. The prohibitory order has also been issued in view of August 5 (the first anniversary of the scrapping of Article of 370 of the Constitution that gave special powers to the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir),” DC Bhagat said. Earlier on July 22, the opposition, including the Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Panthers Party, National Conference, Youth Federation, Kathua, and truckers’ association, had staged protests for two days and had courted arrests for the installation of another toll plaza in the Jammu division. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) authorities had signed an agreement for operationalisation of the toll plaza with Haryana-based Ranchordas Company. At present, tourists and pilgrims have to pay toll at four separate plazas in the Jammu division, including Lakhanpur in Kathua, Sarore in Samba, and Nagrota in Jammu. The public is sore with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the installation of toll plazas in the Jammu division. Jammu has another toll plaza at Chenani in Udhampur. While two more have been proposed on Ring Road and Akhnoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhanpur-toll-plaza-ransacked-as-two-local-youth-allegedly-beaten-up-by-plaza-staff/story-KLh5yxt3epr510aF1eZbdK.html

This is the sixth consecutive day that Covid-19 cases have increased by more than 50,000 in the country.According to Union health ministry’s update on Tuesday, there are 5,86,298 active cases and 38,938 fatalities (803 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours). So far, 12,30,510 patients have been cured or discharged.Along with the nuber of Covid-19 cases, the numebr of tests too have gone up in the country. On Monday, India recorded highest single-day testing by conducting over 6.6 lakh tests to diagnose Covid-19.“In its fight against Covid-19, India scales a new high of 6,61,715 tests in the last 24 hours,” said the Health Ministry in a tweet on Monday.The number of Covid-19 tests carried out in India has also crossed the two crore-mark, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The Covid-19 recovery rate stands at 65.77 per cent in the country, while the fatality rate is at 2.11 per cent, according to health ministry data.India continues to improve the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), and maintains its global position of having one of the lowest Covid-19 fatalities rates, the ministry said.The government, meanwhile, issued guidelines for reopening of gyms and yoga institutes on Monday. Only asymptomatic people will be allowed at these places, according to the guidelines. Maintaining social distancing, disinfecting equipment and wearing of visor while exercising have been made mandatory.Persons above 65 years of age, persons with comorbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years are advised not to use gyms in closed spaces, the guidelines said.In another significant development, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has given nod to the Serum Institute of India for conducting phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-50-000-new-covid-19-cases-for-sixth-consecutive-day-india-s-tally-crosses-1-85-million/story-kMlm1W0eTMY3RYgcfJew0J.html
04-08-2020||India||Indian envoy to UN outlines Pakistan’s direct involvement in manufacturing terror||India’s permanent representative to the United Nations, TS Tirumurti, has lashed out at Pakistan, saying it is the nerve centre of terrorism.“It is a well-known fact that Pakistan is the nerve centre of terrorism. Pakistan is home to largest number of listed terrorists, internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals, including Jamaat-ud-Dawah, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul Mujahideen,” Tirumurti said.Pakistan prime minister (Imran Khan) has on record said that there are around 40,000 terrorists present in the country, Tirumurti further said.Referring to United Nations’ 26th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIS, the ambassador said there is a clear acknowledgement that the leadership and funding for the terrorist entities like Al-Qaeda, ISIS emanate from Pakistan.“Under the 1267 Committee, which submits its report periodically terrorist activities of ISIL al Qaeda and its affiliates. There are several direct references to Pakistan’s involvement,” Tirumurti said.He stepped up the attack further, saying Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the bilateral issues it has with India. Tirumurti said that Pakistan’s latest attempt fell flat.“Attempts by Pakistan to try and internationalise what is a bilateral issue is nothing new. Contrary to what the foreign minister of Pakistan has asserted, there has been no formal meeting of the UN Security Council on India-Pak issue since 1965,” said Tirumurti.“What came up recently was a closed-door and completely informal meeting under ‘Any other business’, which is not even a recorded discussion,” India’s permanent representative to the UN added about the recent UN meeting.“Pakistan’s attempt fell flat. Even UN secretary general, in his statement last August, clearly referred to 1972 bilateral Shimla Agreement. Consequently, Pakistan’s efforts haven’t met any traction in UNSC. Even if Pakistan persists, there are no takers here in the United Nations,” he said.Tirumurti then went on to talk about the “infodemic” launched by Pakistan about the Covid-19 situation in India and how New Delhi countered it.“India and a group of select countries, cutting across regions, made a joint statement in the context of infodemic in the context of Covid-19, at the UN. The statement was designed to counter exactly this type of disinformation spread by countries like Pakistan in the context of Covid-19 to foment division and create disharmony among communities,” he said.Tirumurti was appointed India’s permanent representative to the United Nations in April. He will replace Syed Akbaruddin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-nerve-centre-of-terrorism-indian-envoy-to-united-nations/story-6Rq8as1bWVtbrJjh26qHRJ.html

04-08-2020||India||Negligence led to spike in Covid-19 cases: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||As Kerala struggles with a fresh wave of the coronavirus disease cases, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said there was negligence on part of everyone. There has been a steep hike in new Covid-19 cases in the last two weeks; on Monday, the state reported 962 new cases and two deaths.Vijayan said there was strict vigil in initial stages and results were really encouraging but gradually people lowered their guard which resulted in big spike in cases. The CM said this while launching 100-odd family health centres across the state through video conference.He later clarified that his criticism was not aimed at healthcare workers who are toiling day in and out but about the general perception of the people. Vijayan said it took more than five months for the state to reach 10,000 cases but less than three weeks to cross 25,000. He also took a dig at the Opposition saying it was more interested in toppling the ongoing drive against the pandemic.“In first stage, we effectively dealt with the situation. After this, some sort of laxity crept in. Some people thought it is only the duty of the government machinery. This attitude cost us dearly,” he said. The chief minister said that those who violated quarantine will be dealt with heavily and police will be given more powers to deal with them.But the Opposition said it was happy that the chief minister at least admitted to his lapses, even if it came at the eleventh hour. “When we cited pitfalls he said we were sabotaging the ongoing drive. The state’s testing rate is still poor,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. Meanwhile, Kerala reported 962 new cases taking the total to 26,872. Out of these, 15,282 have recovered and 11,484 are active cases. With two more casualties, the state’s death toll rose to 86 on Monday. There are 506 containment zones in the state and capital Thiruvananthapuram topped the list with one-third of the active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negligence-led-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan/story-ypiZwvi5jjHMBsGmKmrPSL.html
04-08-2020||India||Rescue, treatment and release of animals an annual ritual in Assam’s Kaziranga during floods||Every year as the annual floods hit Assam, the plight of wild animals of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) also hit the headlines with the focus on the number of fatalities. Apart from the deaths caused by flooding and vehicle hit while the animals cross the national highway adjoining the park to reach higher locations, dozens of residents of the park spread across 430 sq km are rescued by teams of forest personnel and wildlife veterinarians. “This year, six teams that include forest personnel and veterinarians were involved in rescuing animals during the floods. The size of the team depends on the size of the animal needed to be rescued. For a tiger rescue, as many as 100 people or more are involved,” said P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR. This year, 172 animals including 3 rhinos, 4 tigers, 120 hog deer, 31 pythons and 4 king cobras have been rescued from in and around the park during floods. The season had witnessed 150 animal deaths including 18 rhinos (12 due to drowning) and 105 hog deer. Also read: Baby rhino rescued in Kaziranga National Park, efforts underway to find its motherFloodwaters have started receding in the park, the biggest habitat of endangered one-horned rhinos, and at present nearly 50 percent of its area is submerged. But work hasn’t stopped for the rescue teams. On Sunday, a 3-4 days old female rhino calf, which got separated from its mother, was rescued from the park’s central range. It is being treated at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), the only facility of its kind in India where orphaned or injured wild animals are hand-raised or treated before returning them to the wild. “The calf is distressed and dehydrated and we are trying to feed it milk formula. Since it’s very small, its health is critical. Efforts are underway to locate the mother and reunite the calf with her,” said Rathin Barman, in-charge of CWRC. This is the second rhino calf rescued during this year during floods. Both the animals, including the five calves rescued during last year’s floods, are staying at CWRC’s facility located at Borjuri close to KNPTR. Till date, of the 172 animals rescued during this year’s floods, 149 have been treated and released back into the wild while 17 had died on arrival or during treatment. Six animals including 2 rhinos, 3 hog deer and a king cobra are still under treatment. “Rescuing a wild animal always involves some risks as it not used to human presence. Some of us have got injured as well during rescues. Once the animal comes out of the park, chances of it getting injured increases and there’s the issue of crowd management as well,” said Panjit Basumataray, wildlife veterinarian at CWRC. Officials of KNPTR and CWRC informed that this year, the number of rescues have been less than previous floods due to awareness campaign among villagers living on the park’s periphery on allowing animals that stray out of the park to reach higher locations or return to the park on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescue-treatment-and-release-of-animals-an-annual-ritual-in-assam-s-kaziranga-during-floods/story-QoGbx5Begwf4hQlFpLfw8I.html
04-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The charts say it all. Accompanying this column are eight charts, all data sourced from worldometers.info, of the daily new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the number of active cases for four European countries – Spain, France, Germany, and Italy. And they tell a story. Spain is definitely seeing what looks like the beginning of a second wave. Spain’s seven-day average of daily new cases (according to the New York Times database; all the seven-day averages are from it) as on August 2, was around 2,300. It was around 700 on July 15, and nearly 370 on July 1. The number is still just a fourth of the peaks the country saw in April, but it is rising. The country has in excess of 110,000 active cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageFrance, which has a little over 75,000 active cases, is also seeing what looks like a second wave (although it isn’t as marked as Spain’s). Its seven-day average of daily new cases has increased from around 550 in mid-July to almost 1,500 in early August (it was in the mid-400s for much of June, but then started climbing).Germany and Italy present a contrasting picture.The first has just around 8,200 active cases currently, and there is no perceptible second wave in the country, despite the rise in number of daily cases in recent days. Its current seven-day average of daily new cases is a little under 700, almost double the 350 it was in mid-July (it was almost 500 in late June).The second, Italy, has just about 12,000 active cases, and it too isn’t showing a clear second wave. Its current seven-day average of daily new cases is around 280, a little higher than the roughly-200 level it was at in mid-July (it was around 250 in late June).Also read: Anxious WHO implores world to ‘do it all’ in long war on Covid-19In both these countries, though, the increase in daily cases is worrying because it could, just as it has in Spain and France, result in a second wave (however small) if the reasons behind the rise in infections are not addressed.None of these countries is like the US, where the clear second wave that has been evident since mid-June has been driven, largely, by infections in regions that were hitherto unaffected, or little affected, by the pandemic (even as some states that believed they had the disease under control are seeing a recurrence of infections).The reason for the resurgence of the disease in Spain and France, and to a much lesser extent, in Germany and Italy, is that they opened up some time back, albeit with rules related to social distancing and the wearing of masks – which many people, especially the young, are flouting (it is summer after all, in Europe, what would have been peak holiday season if not for the pandemic) . According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, there is a higher incidence of the virus among young people in France, an increase in the number of young people being infected and hospitalised in Spain, and a lowering of the median age of new infections in July in Italy.The article quotes a 23-year old student in Paris: “We were being careful at first, and then not so much.” It adds: “…younger Europeans say they are tired of maintaining rigorous social distancing...”Or, as I wrote in Dispatch 87 (and it is definitely worth repeating in the larger interest): “So, bored, tired, lonely perhaps, and physically, mentally, and emotionally weary, we let things slip. And the virus wins.”Sometimes, that’s all it takes to start a second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-g4uf0uHl6DbZhcppnOrV6N.html
04-08-2020||India||No compromise on territorial integrity, says India in 5th round of military talks with China||The Indian army has categorically conveyed to China’s PLA at the fifth round of military talks it will not compromise on India’s territorial integrity, and clearly said disengagement of troops from Pangong Tso and a few other friction points in eastern Ladakh should be completed at the earliest, people familiar with the developments said on Monday. Senior commanders of the two armies held intense negotiations for nearly 11 hours on Sunday at a designated meeting point in Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also read: India-China expand border talks, to revisit patrolling protocol to avoid skirmishes The Indian delegation very clearly and firmly communicated to the Chinese side that restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh was key for overall ties between the two countries, and that Beijing must ensure complete disengagement of its troops from the remaining friction points, according to the people familiar with the developments. It was also categorically conveyed that the Indian army will not compromise on the country’s territorial integrity, they said. The Chinese army has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other areas but the withdrawal of troops has not moved forward from the Finger Four and Eight areas in Pangong Tso as demanded by India. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers. China also has not completed withdrawal of troops from Gogra areas. The focus of the Sunday talks was on finalising the modalities for further de-escalation, and disengagement of troops from various friction points, sources said, adding both sides were to discuss details of the negotiations with their respective military and political leadership.Also read: Finger Area in focus as India, China hold talks The sources said Army Chief Gen MM Naravane was given a detailed briefing about the talks on Monday morning which was subsequently followed by a discussion he held with senior military officials on the overall situation in eastern Ladakh. It is learnt that National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar were also apprised about the talks, and the entire military and strategic brass tasked to deal with the border row is deliberating on various aspects of the overall situation. The Indian delegation was led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, while the Chinese side was headed by Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region. The previous round of the Corps Commander-level talks took place on the Indian side of the LAC on July 14 and it lasted for nearly 15 hours. There was no official word on details of the meeting. The military talks took place 10 days after both sides held another round of diplomatic parleys on the border issue. After the diplomatic talks, the Ministry of External Affairs(MEA) said both sides agreed that an early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols was essential for the overall development of bilateral relations. Last week, India rebutted China’s claim that the disengagement process was completed at most locations. “There has been some progress made towards this objective but the disengagement process has as yet not been completed,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said when asked about China’s claim. In the last three weeks, India has significantly ramped up troops and weaponry in the areas around Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) and Depsang Valley in commensurate with deployment of troops by China’s People’s Liberation Army(PLA). During the military and diplomatic talks, India has also been demanding withdrawal of Chinese troops from Depsang, the area where they had intruded in 2013. The transgressions had created military and diplomatic tensions but was resolved after hectic rounds of negotiations following which the Chinese troops withdrew. India began sending reinforcements to Depsang and the areas around DBO in mid-May when tension between the two sides gradually escalated, and the deployment has been significantly ramped up with several thousand troops, tanks and artillery guns in the last two months, sources said. The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between NSA Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tension in the face-off points. The first round of the Lt General talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley. However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC. The Chinese side also suffered casualties in the clashes but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35. The second round of military talks took place on June 22. At the third round of military talks on June 30, both sides agreed on an “expeditious, phased and step wise” de-escalation as a “priority” to end the standoff. Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC. The Indian Air Force(IAF) has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-compromise-on-territorial-integrity-says-india-in-5th-round-of-military-talks-with-china/story-U05cqPj0YBmhJmpeLiSP6M.html
04-08-2020||India||Serum Institute gets nod for Oxford vaccine trials||India’s drug controller on Monday gave approval to Pune-based vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) for conducting phase II and III clinical trials on the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, according to the Union health ministry. The trials are likely to begin within the week, according to people aware of the matter. This would make the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – called Covishield – the first one to enter phase II and III trials in India. Phase I human trials have started on two indigenously developed vaccines — Bharat Biotech International Ltd’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D — to assess their safety. The company has already bet big on the vaccine working — investing up to $450 million in mass-producing the vaccine. SII declined to comment on the regulatory approval for it to conduct the trials.Four other vaccine candidates being supported by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under the science ministry are in advanced stages of pre-clinical trials and are likely to enter human trials in another four to six weeks. Confirming the development, a senior official in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said: “The subject expert committee that went through the data and protocol submitted for the trial was satisfied with the results, and based on their opinion the drugs controller permitted its trial in India.” Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt was always understood that India’s drug regulator would approve the clinical trials once Oxford University, once, on July 20, Oxford University published research that showed that the initial trial results of the vaccine candidate were promising.The vaccine candidate is safe and induced an immune reaction against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease, and protects healthy people from infection, it said in the journal The Lancet.Dr G C Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said: “The Oxford vaccine is one of the most promising candidates so far and India being one of the largest vaccine manufacturers, this is a welcome move. A vaccine is needed and fast. We are nowhere close to controlling the infection. Now, the numbers have started going up in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities and every day we are seeing an increasing number of cases....There is a resurgence of cases in many places that had controlled the spread. So, we need a vaccine that is safe, effective and provides long-lasting immunity to go back to normal.”The study whose results were published in The Lancet were conducted on 1,077 healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of Covid-19 in five UK hospitals between April 23 and May 21. The data that was published covered the first 56 days of the trials that are ongoing. “By now, we have vaccinated about 10,000 people in the UK phase 3 trial at 19 sites, soon 4,000 people in Brazil and in a couple of weeks in South Africa will also be given the candidate vaccine. And most importantly, a trial in the United States will start in the next few weeks with 30,000 people. This is going to be over 50,000 people by the time we finish,” said Prof. Adrian Hill at a symposium organised by the Indian Council of Medical Research on Thursday. He is the director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute that is collaborating with the British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold adenovirus taken from chimpanzees and genetically modified so that it cannot infect humans. To develop the vaccine, researchers added genetic material to the adenovirus from the Sars-CoV-2 virus’ surface protein, spike glycoprotein (S), which helps the virus to bind to ACE2 receptor to enter human cells and cause an infection. “This was one of the first vaccine candidates to enter phase III trials in late May. And one of the reasons it was possible was because it is a type of vaccine that we already know a lot about. Over 60,000 people have already been vaccinated with investigational adenoviral vaccines. We were able to go ahead quickly because of that safety database on the vaccine platform,” said Prof. Hill. Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is one of the nine global manufacturers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. “We do not know when we will get the results – depending on the instance of the disease at various places , it can be next month or it can be six months. This is a lot of uncertainty for our manufacturers. And, we have taken a risk collectively to engage manufacturers in nine countries,” Prof. Hill said. The company plans to start human clinical trials in India with about 5,000 participants. “One billion doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine will be produced over the next one year. The vaccines will be for India and middle-and-low-income countries across the world,” Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, SII, had earlier said. Dr Vinod Paul, who chairs one of the National Task Forces on Covid-19 management in India, said: “India is one of the vaccine hubs globally, and wherever the Covid vaccine is developed we will take lead in its manufacturing. Vaccine is the ultimate solution to prevent Covid transmission even though India has managed to control the outbreak very well so far.” To ensure that Phase III trials can start on vaccines that are in advanced preclinical or in early clinical stages, the department of biotechnology has already created five trial sites across the country and is working on preparing six more. Each of the trial sites will provide access to cohorts of 50,000 to 100,000 people . The sites are INCLEN Trust International, Haryana; KEM Vadu, Pune; Christian Medical College, Vellore; Society for Health Allied Research Education (SHARE), Hyderabad; and National Institute of Epidemiology, Tirunelveli.. “At this moment, I am unsure whether these trial sites are part of the approval for SII. However, the sites are ready for SII or any other company to start Phase III trials immediately. This will, of course, be the first Phase III trial to happen in India. The other two indigenously developed vaccines – one by Zydus Cadila that is supported by DBT – are in Phase I and II. This would ideally take between 45 days to two months and a while for data analysis. Depending on the data, they will begin their Phase III trials soon after,” said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary, DBT.The other two are undergoing merged phase 1 and II trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-gets-nod-for-oxford-vaccine-trials/story-AEmGtKlevoPF6JDddfihyJ.html
04-08-2020||India||Economic recovery hits July plateau, shows data||The rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will begin a two-day meeting on Tuesday amid mounting evidence that India’s nascent economic recovery is at risk of plateauing out as new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections pile up.Most high-frequency indicators for July suggest that not only was economic activity in July slower than the year-ago level, but that even a sequential recovery seen in May and June may have been interrupted. Experts believe that this may be a result of the exhaustion of pent-up demand created by lockdown restrictions in April and May. This has also raised concern that the economy could take longer than expected to come back to pre-pandemic levels. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the Indian economy may be in a contraction mode till the December quarter.  The IHS Markit India Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing went down from 47.2 in June to 46 in July. A PMI value below 50 signals a contraction in economic activity. Services PMI numbers, which had taken a bigger hit due to the lockdown, for the month of July will be released on Tuesday. Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in July fell to ₹87,422 crore after rising to ₹90,917 crore in June. On a year-on-year basis, the July collections were 14.3% lower. State-owned refiners’ diesel sales, which, according to a Reuters report, account for two-fifths of overall sales in India, fell by 13% to 4.85 million tonnes in July from the previous month, and by about 21% from a year earlier. Some high-frequency indicators suggest a plateauing rather than a worsening of economic activity. The weekly Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) was flat between the week ended July 26 (70.3) and August 2 (70.4). “Overall, the NIBRI has remained stuck at 30 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels for the month of July, although it has improved by 2.7 percentage points from June levels”, Nomura’s chief India economist Sonal Varma said in a research note. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTo be sure, domestic car sales, often used as a key indicator of demand and consumer confidence, showed a spike in July. Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker, reported an 88% increase in sales over June and a 1.3% rise over July 2019. These numbers are of Maruti’s sales to dealers and do not reflect sales to customers. Overall, because of the decline in exports, the company’s sales declined 1.1% over last July. These numbers failed to generate enthusiasm. Maruti Suzuki’s share price fell by 1.5% on Monday. “The Street’s reaction to the auto numbers shows that investors are not quite convinced that demand will persist,” said a Mint report. As new infections continue to surge and many states impose ad-hoc lockdowns, there is growing concern that the Indian economy may be headed for a longer period of contraction than was initially expected. “GDP growth in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in negative territory, with some pick-up in growth impulses from H2: 2020-21 (October) onwards,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said after the previous MPC meeting on May 22, 2020. The consensus estimates among economists is that the Indian economy will shrink by at least 5% in 2020-21.  Most economists who participated in the Reuters poll said the economy could contract by 20% in the June quarter and remain in negative territory until the December quarter. The continuing weakness in aggregate demand is likely to lead to another rate cut by 25 basis points, the poll says. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The MPC has already cut policy rates by 115 basis points since March.Further rate cuts may not be of much help, according to some experts. “To avoid further supply disruption, viable firms may need to be kept afloat with adequate credit; but the banking system, unfortunately, is rather risk-averse, and may not fully oblige,” Pranjul Bhandari,chief India economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets Private Limited, wrote in a research note on July 31. Credit disbursal data supports this view. Annual growth in non-food credit has fallen continuously for seven fortnights to 5.6%, the lowest since May 2017, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database. Even agriculture, which was being seen as a key factor in generating tailwinds for economic recovery, may not be able to provide the much-needed boost, according to experts.“Green shoots of the Indian economy are unlikely to grow until they are watered with fiscal stimulus measures that create broad demand for agricultural commodities. This will require a massive increase in fiscal spending, not just to maintain agricultural incomes through increases in procurement and subsidies, but also to boost non-farm sectors that could act as strong demand generators for the agricultural sector,” Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, wrote in his latest Mint column. To be sure, the government has been signalling that the process of economic recovery may take longer than initially expected.  “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is getting regular feedback on the economic situation and the government is keeping all options open to facilitate a faster economic recovery...Even so, the government is cautious about overstating the green shoots of a recovery visible in the economy,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told journalists on Saturday while announcing an extension of the emergency credit facility to private professionals such as doctors and chartered accountants. Last week, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey told the parliamentary standing committee on finance that the government may not be in a position to pay compensation to states this year for a shortfall in GST collection. The centre’s fiscal deficit in the quarter ending June has reached 83% of the full-year budget, much higher than the five-year average of 60%, according to a research note by Samiran Chakraborty, chief economist, India, at Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited. This happened even as spending by 13 out of top 20 ministries (by budgeted expenditure) fell in the June quarter by at least 30% on an annual basis, the note said. The 13% jump in total expenditure in the June quarter was primarily the result of a sharp jump in the ministry of finance’s spending, which included a transfer of ₹36,400 crore of GST compensation and some Covid disaster relief to states, the note added. With the economic situation and revenue outlook continuing to be grim, a clamour for fiscal support over and above monetary policy measures is likely to increase. In an opinion piece published in The Hindu, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress leader Praveen Chakravarthy argued that India should make “full use of loan programmes of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank” and only “adopt deficit monetisation as the last resort when all other options are exhausted”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-recovery-hits-july-plateau-shows-data/story-6NCbY5bhiMjSj8Dseyx2hL.html
04-08-2020||India||Rituals begin as Ayodhya counts down to August 5||Ayodhya At 9.30am on Monday with the chanting of Vedic hymns, a group of 21 Hindu priests began a holy ceremony that will culminate with Prime Minister Narendra Modi laying the foundation stone of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya town two days later, marking a key milestone as a 135-year conflict that sparked riots and left thousands dead heads towards closure. The two-hour Gauri Ganesh Puja, in honour of Hindu god Ganesh, was helmed by Vanarasi-based priest, Jai Prakash Upadhyay, as the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, which is overseeing the temple’s construction, confirmed that 175 guests were invited for Wednesday’s ceremony. Also read: ‘His blessings first’: Why Ayodhya’s Hanumangarhi temple is PM Modi’s first stop“Before any auspicious work, lord Ganesh is worshipped. So, before the construction of Ram Mandir, this ritual was performed,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, designated successor to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the temple trust chief. The 175 guests include top politicians, religious leaders, Hindu seers and eminent people from Ayodhya town. Ahead of the ceremony, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited the Ram Janmabhoomi site with senior officials to review preparations. He also went to the Hanuman Garhi temple, where Modi is expected to offer prayers before the ceremony on Wednesday.“It is not only a historic but also an emotional moment as after 500 years the Ram temple work will start. It will be the foundation of a new India,” Adityanath told reporters. The temple trust released the main invitation for the ceremony that listed PM Modi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, Adityanath and UP governor Anandiben Patel as guests. The invitation, which had an image of Ram Lalla, or infant Ram, on the obverse, was issued in the name of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das. “Sacred soil from more than 2000 teerth sthan [pilgrim spots] and water from more than 100 rivers has been brought to Ayodhya for Bhumi Pujan,” the trust tweeted. The coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed 16 lives in Ayodhya, has cast a shadow on the ceremony. On Monday, Prem Kumar Tiwari — part of the team that conducts the daily rituals at the existing makeshift temple — was found infected by the virus, confirmed head priest Satyendra Das. Just last week, another junior priest and four more staff were infected. “Of course it is worrying,’’ Das said over the phone. “We all stay in the same area in the temple. I also have some other conditions and I’m not a young man,’’ added the 82-year-old. The pandemic has forced authorities to keep invitees to a minimum but senior officials were confident of Covid protocols and social distancing guidelines being followed. We have tested a large number of people and we are taking all precautions. I don’t think this event has any risks at all,’’ said a senior district official who didn’t want to be named.The state government appealed to people to remain indoors and not travel to the temple site. “Covid-19 protocol will be strictly followed at the event. As the Prime Minister will be here representing 135 crore people, I appeal that only those who have been invited should visit Ayodhya. The rest should remain at their respective places,” Adityanath said, adding no laxity will be allowed.Two leaders who were an integral part of the Ram temple movement – former deputy prime minister LK Advani and former education minister MM Joshi --- will not be there. The decision was taken keeping in mind their advanced age and the threat of the coronavirus disease, trust general secretary Champat Rai said in a press conference.Also read: In Ayodhya, another priest tests Covid-19 positive, head priest says he’s worried ”We didn’t invite those over 90. How could Parasaran ji [K Parasaran, the lead counsel for the Hindu side in the Supreme Court] come from Chennai? How could Advaniji come from Delhi in these corona times?’’ he said. The city, roughly 130km from Lucknow, is cloaked in security with 4,000 security personnel manning the site and 75 check posts blocking approach roads. The district borders will be sealed from Monday night. “Over 300 police personnel, who are younger, fit and healthy as well as tested negative for Covid-19 infection, have already been handpicked for deployment in VVIP security,” said a senior police official on condition of anonymity. Still, it is not a dampener on enthusiasm among local residents with people saying they will light earthen lamps at home and participate in small-scale rituals in every neighbourhood to mark the building of the temple. The city has been decked with 150,000 lamps, many buildings sport a fresh coat of paint and murals from the epic Ramayana on walls, and evenings are dedicated to chants of hymns in praise of Ram. As many as 5,100 urns will be decorated by local artists and placed on the road that Modi will travel on.“Lot of activity is going on in Ayodhya. Many projects are underway. We are hopeful that Ram Mandir will also bring development to Ayodhya,” said Satyendra Gupta, 32.Political opposition to the temple has been muted in recent years with leaders of the Congress party laying claim to the legacy of the temple movement. “The foundation stone has already been laid, Rajiv Gandhi ji did it,” senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said on Monday. In 1986, the then Congress government had allowed the locks of the disputed structure to be opened and in 1989, allowed a ceremony to take place adjacent to the site. Elsewhere, Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath said he will lead party workers in reciting the Hanuman Chalisa on Tuesday and the party-led Chhattisgarh government announced development of three separate tourist circuits linked with Ram’s exile.The temple’s groundbreaking ceremony marks the beginning of the end of a religious dispute that dates back to 1885, when a Hindu priest petitioned the local court to build a temple where the 16th-century Babri Masjid stood. Religious tensions, simmering since Ram idols appeared under the central dome of the mosque in 1949, exploded on December 6, 1992 when thousands of Kar sevaks, or Hindu religious volunteers, scaled the mosque and demolished it. A political upheaval ensued that resulted in the dismissal of the state government even as a wave of communal riots swept India, killing thousands. The government took control of the site and surrounding areas and the battle for the site moved from the streets to the courts.The construction of the temple was cleared in a landmark verdict by the Supreme Court last year in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. A five-judge bench of the apex court awarded the 2.77 acre disputed site to the representative of Ram Lalla and instructed the Centre to set up a trust to oversee the construction of a temple. It also gave the main Muslim litigant, the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, five acres of land at an alternative site in the district for a mosque. A separate criminal suit for the mosque demolition – where Advani and Joshi are accused – is being heard by a special Central Bureau of Investigation court, which completed recording statements of all 32 accused people on July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rituals-begin-as-ayodhya-counts-down-to-august-5/story-eZNyLYSktBsMzBffEpIruO.html
04-08-2020||India||Calls grow for Rahul Gandhi’s return at helm||With Sonia Gandhi set to complete her one-year tenure as interim Congress president on August 10, and the party showing no signs of putting in place a mechanism to elect its next leader, some sections of the party have started demanding that Rahul Gandhi return to the post he gave up in May 2019, owning responsibility for the party’s rout in the general elections. The demands came in three meetings: the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on June 23; at Sonia Gandhi’s deliberations with the party’s Lok Sabha members on July 11; and during her interaction with the party’s Rajya Sabha MPs on July 30.Also read: ‘Proud to have such a brother’: Priyanka’s emotional message for Rahul on Raksha BandhanTo be sure, not everyone in the party has made the demand or supported it. One Congress leader said on condition of anonymity that he sees it as the responsibility of Rahul Gandhi to assuage the concerns of both veterans and members of the young brigade because there is visible unease between the two groups over the leadership issue and their future in the party. His reference is to the long-simmering conflict between the party’s old guard and its younger members -- which came to fore most recently during Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with Rajya Sabha MPs.While Sonia Gandhi is not keen to continue in the post, Rahul Gandhi has not shown any inclination to take up the responsibility. “But circumstances can change any time,” the leader added. The demand has also come from outside the Congress. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar last week suggested that Rahul Gandhi should take up the Congress president’s post, start a conversation with party leaders and workers, and undertake a nationwide “yatra” to galvanise the Congress cadre and reconnect with the people who have moved away from the grand old party over the years. Pawar’s views were echoed by senior Congress leaders and Rajya Sabha members Digvijaya Singh and Partap Singh Bajwa. “I agree. He (Rahul Gandhi) is different and wants to do politics differently. We should allow him to do so but then we also would like him to be more active in Parliament and more accessible to people. As advised by Sharad Pawar he should travel around India. Yatras are important to connect,” Singh tweeted on Saturday. Bajwa said Rahul Gandhi should first become the Congress president and then tour the country. “I request the Congress president to settle the leadership issue once and for all. The issue has to be tackled anyway otherwise we are ceding ground to the BJP every day.” Bajwa said it was the “relentless campaign” carried out by Rahul Gandhi in Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh that ensured the party’s victories in these states and even Gujarat, where he brought the Congress within the striking distance of ousting the BJP from power. One of the architect’s of the party’s Madhya Pradesh win, Jyotiraditya Scindia has left the party for the BJP, after he was marginalised in the state and the party’s central leadership chose not to intervene. Legislators allied with him resigned from the party too -- causing the collapse of the Kamal Nath government. More recently, Sachin Pilot, credited with having played a significant role in the party’s win in Rajasthan, and lawmakers loyal to him have broken ranks with the party over differences with chief minister Ashok Gehlot, although they haven’t left the party. The development has left the Gehlot government with a wafer-thin majority. Experts said the clamour for Gandhi’s ascendancy to President once again highlights the fact that the party does not want to take the tougher route of holding elections and finding a new leader from outside the Nehru-Gandhi family. Hyderabad-based political analyst C Narasimha Rao said, “Many Congress leaders do not want internal elections as they are comfortable with the nomination process and hence push for the easy route. Also, the Gandhi family does not want to give up the control of the party though some argue that it is the only binding force.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calls-grow-for-rahul-s-return-at-helm/story-Ye1yzBoTvfh2wuvjnlhOKO.html
04-08-2020||India||In Ayodhya, hymns and pujas at every corner||Eight priests from Ayodhya, five each from Varanasi and Delhi and three from Tamil Nadu performed the Gauri Ganesh Puja at the Ram Janmabhoomi site on Monday morning, marking the beginning of three-day Vedic rituals ahead of the foundation-laying ceremony. Jai Prakash Upadhyay, a priest from Varanasi, presided over the ceremony. “The ceremony began with Gauri Ganesh puja as per Hindu tradition. Before any auspicious work, lord Ganesh is worshipped. So, before construction of Ram Mandir, this ritual was performed,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the temple trust chief. “Ganesh puja continued for two hours. On Tuesday Ramacharya puja will be performed,” added Das. The site was decorated with saffron flags marigold flowers and the rituals were performed at the place where the sanctum sanctorum of the proposed Ram temple will come up. Special puja was also performed at the existing makeshift temple. “Apart from routine puja, special ‘arti’ of Ram was performed,” added Das. The rituals happened under a giant water-proof pandal. “In all temples, big and small, across Ayodhya, special puja was performed, said Das. In the evening, festivities began as temples and houses across the city were decorated with earthen lamps and rangolis. Local residents thronged to the Naya Ghat on the banks of the Saryu river that shimmered under the light. All roads are being regularly cleaned by a 500-people strong team of sanitation workers. Murals and images depicting scenes from the Ramayana have been drawn on the main roads and buildings have been painted yellow. “Yellow is an auspicious colour. In Hindu tradition, yellow is used in all ceremonies. It symbolises purity and light,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor-designate to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the trust. Local residents said they were enjoying the facelift Ayodhya had received. “Ayodhya has donned an altogether new look. It is also because of Prime Minister’s arrival for bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir,” said Rajan Patel, 30. His friends, Satyendra Gupta, 32, hoped for development projects. “A lot of activity is going on in Ayodhya. Many projects are underway. We are hopeful that Ram Mandir will also bring development to Ayodhya,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-ayodhya-hymns-and-pujas-at-every-corner/story-O97uNb9cL3LVfloMQgQeUJ.html
04-08-2020||India||Lord Ram’s will that I attend ceremony: Title suit litigant||The son of the oldest litigant in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, a Padma Shri awardee and the chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) are three Muslim invitees among the 175 guests attending the foundation-laying ceremony of the Ram temple on Wednesday. The first invitee is Iqbal Ansari, 69, son of Hashim Ansari who died at of 95 in 2016 after which the son started pursuing the case in the top court. The second is 80-year-old Mohammad Sharif, who is known across the state for his work in holding final rites for at least 5,000 unclaimed Hindu and Muslim people. The third is Zufar Ahmed Faruqi, the chairman of the UPSCWB that was the main Muslim party in the title suit and the head of the 15-member trust that is helming the construction of a mosque at a five-acre site in Ayodhya district. “We have invited Iqbal Ansari and Mohammad Sharif from Ayodhya for bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir,” said Champat Rai, general secretary of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust. “Mohammad Sharif’s contribution to the society cannot is priceless. He has given respectful cremation or burial to unclaimed bodies in Ayodhya,” added Rai. A top state government official confirmed Faruqi’s invitation on condition of anonymity. Ansari welcomed the invitation. “I am delighted to be invited for bhumi pujan. Lord Ram and Ram Mandir will usher in development in Ayodhya,” said Ansari, who had opposed filing of a review petition to the Supreme Court’s 2019 verdict that cleared the way for the construction of the temple. “Our Prime Minister is coming. I will meet him and give him a ‘Ramnami’ stole (a piece of cloth with Ram’s name written on it) and Ramcharitmanas as a present,” Ansari added.“The dispute is over now after the court’s verdict. I respect sadhus and saints.. I think it is Lord Ram’s will that I attend it”.Sharif, a cycle mechanic popularly known as chacha (uncle), was awarded the Padma Shri, the country’s fourth-highest civilian award, this year and hit the headlines for his work in giving a respectable send-off to unclaimed bodies during the coronavirus pandemic. “I am very happy after receiving the invite. I am thankful to the PM and hope that Ram temple will also bring development in Ayodhya,” said Sharif. Faruqi’s spokesperson confirmed the invitation. ”Yes , the chairman has got an invite, ‘’ said Athar Hussain.In his press conference, Rai announced that the trust also invited Purnima Kothari, sister of two brothers from Kolkata who were kar sevaks, or Hindu religious volunteers, who died in police firing in Ayodhya on October 30, 1990 while on a procession to the 2.77 acre site. The trust also invited family members of local kar sevaks in Ayodhya who died in the firing. “We wanted to invite more Karsevaks. But due to pandemic we have only invited local Karsevaks and Purnima Kothari, sister of Kothari brother of Kolkata,” said Rai. The trust will felicitate the kar sevaks at another function — Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Nirman Yajna —after the coronavirus pandemic, Rai added. He appealed to the kar sevaks to be patient. “In the Ram Mandir movement, a large number of kar sevaks contributed. They all want to come to Ayodhya for the bhumi pujan. We also wanted the same but due to the pandemic this is not possible at present,” said Rai. “But bhumi pujan by the PM is necessary to start the construction work of Ram Mandir.”(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lord-ram-s-will-that-i-attend-ceremony-title-suit-litigant/story-EkzzfhjNVN19yoW3F98atL.html
04-08-2020||India||In MP and Chhattisgarh, Congress tries to claim Ram legacy||The Congress is unwilling to allow the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to solely take credit for the Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya and has entrusted the job of countering its arch-rival on the issue to its leaders in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where Lord Ram is believed be have lived during his 14-year exile, functionaries aware of the matter said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony for the temple construction on August 5. A Supreme Court ruling in November ended a decades-old dispute and ordered that a Ram temple be built on the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya.Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and Congress workers across the state plan to recite Hanuman Chalisa, or devotional hymn to Lord Ram’s companion Hanuman, on Tuesday. The Congress government in neighbouring Chhattisgarh has announced the development of three tourist circuits linked to Ram’s exile as part of the party’s attempt to claim his legacy.Nath on Monday said the country knows that late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was instrumental behind opening the locks of the disputed site in Ayodhya in 1985. He said Rajiv Gandhi gave his consent for laying a foundation stone for the temple in 1989. “In his first electoral speech in 1989, he [Rajiv Gandhi] talked about Ramrajya. This is all in the records. I wish to tell the young generation about this...,” Nath said. Nath earlier announced his participation in the Hanuman Chalisa recitation for the state’s“prosperity and happiness”.Bypolls to 27 assembly seats are due in Madhya Pradesh. They are crucial for BJP’s government’s survival in the state. The BJP has 107 legislators and needs to win at least nine of the 27 seats to reach the majority mark of 116 in the 230 member state assembly. The Congress, which won 114 assembly seats in the 2018 assembly elections, now has 89 seats. The resignations of 22 legislators in March brought down the Congress government in the state and paved the way for the BJP’s return to power.A Congress Parliament member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the recital is being organised to also send out a message that it was Rajiv Gandhi, who was instrumental behind “what we are going to see on August 5, and that the BJP only drew political mileage from the issue”.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel announced on Sunday construction of a “magnificent” temple dedicated to Lord Ram’s mother, Mata Kaushalya, in Raipur as well as the development of religious tourist circuits also covering Turturiya’s Valmiki Ashram. Lord Ram’s sons, Luv and Kush, are believed to have been born at the ashram.A 1,000-year-old Shiv Temple in Jagdalpur district, which Lord Ram is believed to have been established during the exile, will also be renovated, the Chhattisgarh government said in a statement on Monday.“The way Shri Ram had established ‘Shivling’ in Rameshwaram [Tamil Nadu] before leaving for Lanka, the same way he had established ‘Shivling’ at Rampal area of Chhattisgarh as well, before moving from Northern to Southern part of India, and had performed customary rituals there,” the statement said. The statement said Lord Ram spent some time of his exile in the forest of Turturiya.The projects related to Lord Ram will be part of Chhattisgarh government’s Ram Van Gaman Path Project (Ram Forest Travel Route) worth Rs 137.45 crore, the statement said. As part of the project’s first phase, nine of the 75 identified locations believed to have links with Lord Ram in the state will be developed and beautified.Baghel on Sunday said Mata Kaushalya was from Chhattisgarh and Lord Ram spent a significant amount of time during his 14-year-exile there. He said their initiatives would generate employment opportunities.Vijesh Lunawat, the state BJP vice-president in Madhya Pradesh, scoffed at the Congress’s attempts. “The country knows about the stand of the Congress and its leaders. Today, they are talking of Ram temple on seeing the massive sentiments of people across the country. It is better that they continue to practise the policy of [minority] appeasement that they have been practising for decades.”Political analyst Girija Shankar said Nath and Baghel’s announcements suggest a vacuum at the party’s central level. “In fact, any stand like this should be decided by the party’s central leadership which is not existing as it appears. Further, the Congress leaders in these states firmly believe that Congress won 2018 assembly elections because of their soft-Hindutva approach. They have failed to understand that it is because of the then BJP governments’ failure that Congress was voted to power in both the states. That is why the party leaders do not want to deviate from soft-Hindutva line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mp-and-c-garh-cong-tries-to-claim-ram-legacy/story-ilIVnc8hW9Qoo9h1yidqqN.html
04-08-2020||India||Wildlife nod not required for railway projects: Ministry||Railway projects, small-scale development works involving construction over less than 20,000 square metres, and under-25 MW capacity hydropower plants will not require approval from the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) even if they are located within eco-sensitive zones (ESZs) of national parks or wildlife sanctuaries, the environment ministry has said.ESZs of 10 km radius were meant to be “shock absorbers” and transition zones from areas of high to low protection for wildlife and biodiversity, as per the ministry’s 2011 guidelines on declaring such zones. The 2002 Wildlife Conservation Strategy also recommends a 10 km buffer around sanctuaries. The Supreme Court in December 2006 directed all states and Union territories to follow the strategy while hearing a plea over a delay in declaring ESZs.In letters dated July 24 and July 16 to chief secretaries of states and Union territories, the ministry said NBWL’s nod will be needed only for projects that require prior environment clearance or are located in areas linking one protected area to another.The ministry has accordingly changed the wording of the Handbook of Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which said: “Prior recommendation of standing committee of NBWL under the provisions of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, is also required for taking developmental activities in/over an area falling within eco sensitive zones. ” It now reads: “Prior recommendation of Standing Committee of NBWL under the provisions of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 shall be obtained, if required, for taking developmental activities in/over an area falling within eco sensitive zones.”The July 16 letter clarifies that proposals related to projects within a notified ESZ and those that require prior environment clearance will also require NBWL’s nod. It adds those that do not have a notified ESZ will require an NBWL nod only if the proposal requires prior environment clearance and is located within a 10 km radius of a protected area. Proposals for projects to be located in a corridor connecting one protected area to another will also require NBWL’s approval.Rest of the projects are exempt from NBWL’s consent. “State governments are requested not to insist upon wildlife clearance for such development projects outside protected areas that are not covered under para 3 [conditions listed above],” the July 16 letter said. HT has seen a copy of the letter.HT on August 17 last year reported that the ministry had published an office memorandum saying projects outside the boundary of a notified ESZ of a sanctuary or national park but within its 10 km radius will not need prior clearance from NBWL. Such proposals will get environmental clearance from the ministry’s expert appraisal committee, which will also ensure “appropriate conservation measures in the form of recommendations.” The memorandum nullified previous office memoranda of February 2007 and December 2009, which made NBWL’s approval mandatory for projects within a park’s 10 km radius.The ministry’s clarifications go a step further and say smaller projects, which do not fall under the purview of Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, do not need to seek wildlife clearance no matter where they are located in buffer zones. Inland waterways and railways are also exempt from prior environmental clearance and hence will also be exempt from NBWL’s approval even if they fall in ESZs of protected areas.“Only projects that are eligible for prior EC [environmental clearance] will also need a wildlife clearance if they are located in the notified ESZ of a protected area or within a 10 km radius where ESZ is not notified,” said environment ministry secretary R P Gupta.Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said the clarifications read down the importance of ecologically sensitive areas by introducing phrases like “if necessary” when it comes to scrutiny. She cited social conflicts related to ESZ creation. “However one cannot rule out their importance as buffers or corridors that help protect biodiverse habitats. This is important more than ever before to mitigate climate change and prevent ecologically destructive regulatory decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-nod-not-required-for-rly-projects-ministry/story-Ik4I56MXDMxeQD0q5JQhlK.html
04-08-2020||India||Land for Bullet train project: Tendering to start within three months, says Railway board chief||One section of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor is likely to be tendered out within three months after nearly 90% of the land acquisition for the project is completed, according to railway board chairman VK Yadav.Indian Railways has so far completed 76% of land acquisition in Gujarat and 24% in Maharashtra; overall 60% of land acquisition for the ambitious Bullet Train project has been completed, Yadav said in an interview. “In any mega project, the first thing we do is land acquisition and then we finalise the alignment. We have completed the alignment and designs. As on date, we have acquired 60% of the land...Due to Covid situation there was some slowdown in land acquisition, but it has started picking up now and we are sure over the coming six months, most of the land will be acquired.”Railways said last month that the high-speed rail corridor is expected to be completed on time despite the Covid-19 outbreak. The project connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad has a deadline of December 2023.The project has had to contend with issues ranging from protests by landowners to rising costs because of a widening gap between the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen; 80% of the Rs 1 trillion needed to fund the project will come from a 20-year Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) loan.“In mega projects we go for tendering only when 90% of the land is acquired. We will be going ahead when we acquire some more land and a complete uninterrupted stretch of land is available. Project is progressing well. We will be going ahead with tendering within three months,” Yadav said.The project implementing agency National High-Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL), has also begun floating tenders for related civil works.The national transporter has begun feasibility studies on seven other potential high-speed corridors to gauge their financial viability and estimated traffic they will attract. Yadav said Indian Railways was exploring whether the corridors would be viable to run high-speed Bullet Trains with speeds above 300 kmph. The seven proposed corridors are Delhi -Varanasi, Varanasi- Howrah, Delhi – Ahmedabad, Mumbai– Nagpur, Mumbai – Hyderabad, Chennai – Mysore and Delhi –Amritsar.“We are working on seven high-speed corridors and four freight corridors. The normal time taken for a Detailed Project Report is one year. At this point of time I can say feasibility study has begun and we will be completing the feasibility studies of all these sections in one year, that is by July 2021,” Yadav said.“The feasibility report will give the answer to see which corridor will be suitable for Bullet Train speeds of 300-350 kmph or semi-high speed, ie 200-250 kmph,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/land-for-bullet-train-project-tendering-to-start-within-three-months-says-rly-board-chief/story-MOg2Te8vNHt458tQPKd9KJ.html

The EPCA, which assists Supreme Court on air pollution and environment issues, pointed out in its July 27 report that the CPCB has developed an App called ‘COVID19BWM’ on which tracking of such waste from the point of collection to its treatment is possible, provided all state municipalities and state pollution boards feed the required information.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIncorporating the EPCA recommendations in its order, a bench of justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said, “All municipal corporations and state pollution control boards are directed to use the COVID19BWM App. This is made mandatory and CPCB to track all the biomedical waste and ensure that it is being sent for treatment.”In addition, the court also directed the Centre and CPCB to work out a national barcode system or portal to track biomedical waste. The court has sought a compliance report on its directions by August 7, following which the matter will be heard on August 10.EPCA senior advocate Aparajita Singh said, “The volume of biomedical waste generated due to Covid-19 has shown an increase over the last three months. Much of this waste is not segregated at the homes and quarantine centres, from where it is generated. This requires public sensitisation by municipal bodies, as only then can biomedical waste be incinerated at the Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facilities (CBWTF).”EPCA, studying the pattern of waste generation in Delhi-NCR, noted that biomedical waste generation increased from 94 tonnes in May 2020 to 761 tonnes till July 24. There was no segregation between biomedical waste and other waste. It was noted by the EPCA that two municipal bodies in Delhi — South and North Municipal Corporations — were sending the biomedical waste to waste-to-energy plants instead of CBWTF.When Singh highlighted this problem to the Court, the bench directed all municipal corporations to educate households about segregation of biomedical waste into a yellow bag and send it for treatment only to CBWTF. “The waste energy plants are not designed to incinerate biomedical waste, which needs a double-incineration chamber and protocols for storage and emission control,” the court recorded in its order.The growing volume of biomedical waste is posing a worry to EPCA. Delhi has a capacity to treat 2,220 tonnes of biomedical waste in a month, followed by UP (1,656 tonnes/month), Haryana (288 tonnes/month) and Rajasthan (72 tonnes/month), EPCA stated in its report. “This will need to be carefully monitored and tracked as, in case the generation load increases, then other facilities like hazardous waste incinerators will have to be used for biomedical waste,” the report added.Besides, the court further directed all state pollution boards to ensure that the common facilities treating biomedical waste have an online emission monitoring system that can be monitored daily. In this regard, the contractors running these common facilities were directed to file compliance reports by the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upload-covid-waste-disposal-data-on-app-says-top-court/story-i1qSzOIFt11ed97pkXCLBI.html
04-08-2020||India||Amid rising Covid-19 cases, Parliament’s Monsoon session may get pushed to Sept||New Delhi: A September schedule is starting to look more likely for the much-awaited monsoon session of Parliament as the chances of safely starting proceedings in August appear to be thinning due to the continued rise in Covid-19 cases in India, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.India’s top legislative authorities, including Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, are keeping a close watch on the status of the pandemic in the Capital and elsewhere to finalise the dates for the session. An improvement in Delhi in recent weeks offers a glimmer of hope, but greater progress in the Capital’s fight against Covid-19, and some measure of control in other parts of the country may be needed to ensure suitable attendance by members, the people cited above indicated.Under the Indian Constitution, the duration between the end of one session and the start of the next cannot exceed six months. So, Parliament has a window till September 23 to start the monsoon session, after the budget session ended on March 23, two days before a 68-day national lockdown kicked in.Once the dates are finalised, officials involved in the planning of the session say they would require at least four weeks to put the arrangements in place.“Monsoon session in August looks very tight. Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats have discussed a couple of seating options with the government. A final view on them is yet to be taken. Once the Union Cabinet decides, it will take about four weeks to put in place necessary arrangements,” said an official who asked not to be named. Logistical issues are challenge because scheduling the session will require special Covid-19 arrangements -- from the seating of MPs to ensure social distancing , to the timing of the proceedings in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, which are likely to work in shifts to avoid crowding. The session may be a short one, with lawmakers spread across different buildings and attending hybrid — mix of physical and digital — proceedings. “There’s not a heavy business to transact. The priority of the government is to clear the ordinances promulgated in the past few months and the Opposition might press for debates on the Covid pandemic and the Indo-China border conflict,” said a second official involved in the preparations.Officials close to Naidu said the Rajya Sabha chairman had secured isolation-related relaxations for MPs travelling to Delhi to attend Parliament or parliamentary committee meetings. “Naidu told the home ministry that government officials don’t have to undergo isolation after travelling to other places. If they can be exempted from isolation for doing official duty, MPs too travelling on official duty should be given the same exemptions. The home ministry has agreed,” a third official said. Giant screens to beam parliamentary proceedings, with engineers from the National Informatics Centre on call, and provisions for possible latency -- these are among the issues Naidu and Birla and their teams are discussing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-may-get-pushed-to-sept/story-ME9xo2w0UC2ZWV4QklwffJ.html

Call central / state helpline / ambulance and refer such persons to the nearest health facility. Ensure availability of pulse oximeters to record oxygen saturation of members prior to the exercise,” read the guidelines.The health ministry has been releasing such SOPs from time to time, underlining preventive measures needed at public places such as religious shrines, hotels and restaurants where the risk of exposure to the virus is high, to contain the spread of Covid-19. Many yoga institutes have been making preparations to implement preventive measures needed in Covid-19 times before reopening their premises post the lockdown.“We used to have a clinic running within our institute wherein all our members would undergo a health check-up once before starting classes; now we will use the facility to medically examine all members before each class. Our instructors and teachers have also been trained to pick up signs of respiratory distress in members while performing exercises. Pulse oximeters and other relevant equipment will also be available within the premises to identify high-risk cases. All guidelines will be followed before we begin classes,” said Dr Ishwar Basavaraddi, director, Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, ministry of Ayush. The health ministry has also asked gym and yoga school managers to calculate the maximum capacity per session based on redesigned spaces, and to accordingly schedule a session and inform members.“We have reduced admissions; instead of 30 members in a hall now we will only run a group session with 8-10 members; and outdoors we used to conduct classes with about 200 people, which will now be reduced to not more than 50 members,”Basavaraddi added.All spas, sauna, steam bath and swimming pools shall remain closed, as per the ministry.In order to maintain social distancing effectively, all equipment, including cardio and strength machines, must be placed 6 feet apart.“For air-conditioning/ventilation, the guidelines of CPWD {central public works department} shall be followed which emphasizes that the temperature setting of all air conditioning devices should be in the range of 24-30o C, relative humidity should be in the range of 40- 70%, intake of fresh air should be as much as possible and cross ventilation should be adequate,” the guidelines say.Lockers cab remain in use as long as social distancing is maintained.Gym administrators are in the process of making changes to their set-up to meet the requirements for reopening their facilities.“We are going through the guidelines to see how best these can be implemented. There is no question of not following the guidelines as safety of our members is our primary concern. We will be making changes accordingly before reopening the gym,” said Chetan Gaur, the main instructor at the Noida Golf Club gym.All gyms and yoga institutes in containment zones will remain shut, as per the health ministry directive.“Since containment zones are hotbeds, most activities that may lead to spread of the disease in these areas are still restricted. There is a standard directive for all facilities where people might gather in large numbers, to remain closed in these places,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-with-oxygen-saturation-below-95-not-allowed-in-gyms/story-0W2wDlrgvcf1JerdwHtRvL.html
04-08-2020||India||Poonia met Pilot camp MLAs in July: Rajasthan cops||A Rajasthan police investigation of an alleged plot to topple the Ashok Gehlot government has found that the state’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president, Satish Poonia, met the Sachin Pilot camp of MLAs twice in July even as the BJP said it had nothing to do with the rebellion in the local unit of the Congress, an officer said on Monday . “Poonia met the Pilot camp MLAs twice between July 18 and July 29,” an officer who is part of the investigation, being carried out by the Special Operations Group (SOG), said on condition of anonymity. “The first meeting took place between July 18 and July 20 and the second meeting was on July 28. Both the meetings took place in Manesar,” in Haryana.When asked whether Poonia’s name had surfaced in the investigation, SOG’s additional director general of police Ashok Rathore said: “The case is under investigation and details related to findings of the investigation done so far cannot be revealed.” Pilot has been ousted as president of the Congress’s state unit and as deputy chief minister for a rebellion he mounted last month against the Gehlot government. Pilot and 18 legislators supporting him on July 12 questioned Gehlot’s leadership and called for his removal -- a demand the party leadership has resisted. Poonia denied meting any of the rebels. “I have never met Pilot or any other rebel MLA. Police are speaking the government’s language,” he said. Chief minister Gehlot hit out at the state BJP chief on July 30, alleging that he had been meeting Pilot camp legislators secretly. “If BJP leaders are not part of the conspiracy to topple the government then why do they go to Delhi at night and return early morning? Why do they go secretly,” Gehlot had asked. The next day, Poonia denied this through a tweet. “I heard the lecture of Ashok Gehlot. What is wrong in going to Delhi? You also go to Delhi and Mumbai? I will keep going to Delhi for party’s work,” he wrote.Poonia also denied that he was in touch with three independent MLAs – Suresh Tank (Kishangarh), Khushveer Singh (Marwar Junction) and Omprakash Hudla (Mahuwa) – who had gone to Banswara in first week of July and were in touch with at least five MLAs of Banswara, Dungarpur and Udaipur districts. The SOG had claimed that the independent MLAs had offered money to the Congress legislators to topple the Congress government. Mobile phones of the MLAs, Khushveer Singh, Suresh Tank and Omprakash Hudla, were switched off.  The SOG is investigating three cases registered under section 124A (sedition) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code for the alleged attempt to topple the state government. Officers from the SOG, state crime branch and anti-terror squad (ATS) are conducting the investigation. The first case was registered on July 10 on the basis of phone intercepts. Two persons –Ashok Jain of Banswara and Bharat Malani of Ajmer – were arrested on July 11 and are currently in jail. The second and third cases were registered on the basis of audio tapes in which some people were purportedly striking deals to pull down the Gehlot government.The SOG officers said that it was also investigating various modules that worked at the same time to lure the MLAs to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poonia-met-pilot-camp-mlas-in-july-raj-cops/story-up7XOyzfGbkjPy8Lbh15yK.html
04-08-2020||India||Five police personnel suspended after custodial death in Madhya Pradesh||Bhopal/Jabalpur: Five police personnel, including an in-charge of a police station, was suspended on Monday after a murder accused allegedly died by suicide in the police custody in Madhya Pradesh’s Narsinghpur district. According to police, the accused Narayan Singh (21), a resident of Chawarpatha village of the district, had attempted suicide at Bamori police outpost on Saturday.

04-08-2020||Editorials||Ayodhya is a sign of Hindu faith; make it a site of secularism too||On August 5, nine months after the Supreme Court (SC) decided in favour of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over the bhoomi pujan to mark the beginning of the construction in the holy town. Ayodhya, in Indian history and mythology, is associated with the Hindu faith as the birthplace of Ram, and the Ram Rajya that he presided over after a long battle against evil. Ayodhya, in Indian politics, has been associated with unprecedented Hindu political mobilisation, the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a protracted legal dispute, and yes, Hindu-Muslim tensions and communal violence.As the construction of the temple commences, Mr Modi has a rare opportunity to fuse together both these strands of Ayodhya. The temple is a political, intellectual and legal victory for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, for the BJP, for its countless workers who participated in the rath yatra that brought the issue to national centre stage, for Mr Modi himself whose political life has coincided with the rise of Hindu political consciousness, and for millions of devotees who wanted to see a temple at the disputed site. This is a victory which the devout will, undoubtedly, mark with renewed faith. Mr Modi will not be off the mark in acknowledging this.At the same time, the contentious history leading up to the temple cannot be erased. The fact that Muslims have abided by the rule of law and accepted the SC verdict in the spirit of closure is laudable — but cannot take away from the insecurity they have felt at the political mobilisation around the issue. The fact that the Babri masjid was demolished, and this was illegal according to the same SC verdict that allowed the temple, cannot be denied either. It is, therefore, incumbent on Mr Modi to not only mark the day as one of celebration for the devout, but also a day of sobriety, reaching out to those on the other side of the divide. There can be no better occasion to enunciate the “sabka vishwas” slogan of the government than in Ayodhya, to mark the end to an era of contentious political polarisation, and inaugurate a new phase of pluralism, secularism and harmony. Ram took care of all his subjects, with compassion and empathy. PM Modi must reach out to all citizens, with the same compassion. That would be a true tribute and redefine the meaning of Ayodhya in Indian political lexicon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/ayodhya-is-a-sign-of-hindu-faith-make-it-a-site-of-secularism-too/story-y5EEqhh1IL7ZLiQFKatgEK.html
04-08-2020||Editorials||In Kashmir, integrate Kashmiris||It has been a year since Parliament changed the constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), effectively nullifying Article 370, and reorganising the state into two Union territories of J&K and Ladakh. This newspaper supported the quest for integrating Kashmir with the rest of India, constitutionally and legally, with the dilution of Article 370 — while raising questions about the process followed to achieve it, and emphasised the need for outreach to the Kashmiri people. A year later, there is little doubt that the entire constitutional, legal and administrative rejig of J&K has cemented the control of the State over the territory. It has armed Indian security forces with greater room to tackle Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and crack down on violence. And it has shown the futility of the “azaadi” slogan of those who harbour ambitions of secession. At the same time, the challenge of integrating Kashmiris with the Union persists. The detention of mainstream leaders, the curtailment of civil liberties, including mobility and connectivity, and the restrictions on political activity (all of which this newspaper has consistently opposed) has left the Kashmiri street alienated. The dilution of statehood has been met with hostility. There has been tremendous disruption to the everyday lives of people.The government must note these sentiments and not brush aside the democratic dissent of citizens, even as it battles the violence. Restoring democracy fully — by removing restrictions on connectivity, releasing detained leaders, initiating a political dialogue, making security forces more accountable for excesses — and restoring statehood to J&K (while keeping Ladakh as a separate unit) is the best way to restart the political process. Kashmir has been won over, now win over the Kashmiris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-kashmir-integrate-kashmiris/story-IcsK4qhdHOW4d4YSi8tQ8H.html
