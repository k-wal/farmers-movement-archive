07-08-2020||News||NEP 2020: Recognising the primacy of early education||Perhaps the most significant change envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is at the very beginning of a child’s educational journey — the first step of the learning ladder. The critical importance of good quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) has been understood by experts for a long time. But by bringing ECCE to the centre of the education stage and by clearly stating that “ECCE is the greatest and most powerful equaliser”, NEP 2020 has given the highest priority to building strong foundations early in a child’s life. The policy document released in its final form last week sees the age group — three to eight — as a continuum. This continuum is not only a conceptual construct; it will need to be operationalised in terms of provision, approach, curriculum and pedagogy. The transitions from pre-primary to primary will have to be made in a way such that each year’s progress builds on the previous year’s learning. The policy document stresses that an urgent national mission is needed to ensure that by the end of class 3, every child has acquired foundational literacy and numeracy skills. Let us stay for the moment with the first building block outlined by the policy — the first five years of a child’s educational life. Already there are debates about difficulties in implementation. Further, in the current context, where fiscal pressures are high, where will the resources come from? Today in India, even at the age of three, at least seven out of 10 children are already enrolled in early childhood centres, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2018. Apart from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Bihar, in most other states, only one out of every five children at age three is not enrolled anywhere. Therefore, although coverage is not universal, India has come a long way in spreading the net for early childhood centres. Families take decisions on where to send their children, considering available options in their neighbourhoods. On the one hand, private schools, even low-cost ones in rural areas, enrol children in lower kindergarten (KG), who then move to upper KG before entering class I. On the other hand, in the government sector, there are anganwadis in the community as well as those which are physically located within school compounds. In the past, some states such as Assam (with the ka-shreni class) and Bihar (with the bal-varg) have tried to create opportunities for the pre-primary age group. More recently, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh have brought in a pre-primary class into their school structures supporting these initiatives with age and developmentally-appropriate classroom materials, training, and mechanisms for academic support. Thus, while the key blocks for the first step of NEP will have to be strengthened, it is not like they have to be built from scratch.Undoubtedly, there is much to be done. We need to expand access to pre-primary opportunities for those who are still outside the net. Next, it will be essential to introduce and integrate developmentally-appropriate practices both in pre-primary groups and primary grades. This needs to be planned systematically, one step at a time, keeping in mind the goals and ground realities. Further, different departments, parents and teachers must work closely together to ensure a smooth transition from early childhood centres into schools. While at the ground level, many co-located anganwadis and primary schools use common sense to share and maximise resources, convergence at higher levels of their departments and ministries will urgently need to be planned and operationalised. For example, there are roughly 13,000 government primary schools and close to 27,000 anganwadis in Punjab. Of these, well above 10,000 anganwadis are in school compounds. In both Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, where governments are giving serious priority to preparing the pathway from pre-primary to primary, discussions on how to productively bring in anganwadis as an integral part of this process are well underway. Learning from these experiences is essential. It is possible that a careful analysis of budgets from the ground up may show that more effective deployment of existing resources is possible for enabling young children to get more out of their pre-primary experience. NEP 2020 boldly states that if the stage-wise goal of foundational skills is not achieved by class 3, the rest of the policy is irrelevant. It also lays out timelines and asks states to create implementation plans and goals to be achieved by 2025. Every child needs to have a strong start to their educational life. The high priority to early years given in the policy document can give a strong backing to effectively translating policy into practice. Ten years after the Right to Education came into force, let us take bold and much-needed steps to give every child the right to learning.

07-08-2020||News||August 5: A tribute to the values of the Republic||As the triumphant narratives of August 5, celebrating the bhoomi pujan that marks the beginning of the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya get recorded in history, they will inaugurate a new majoritarian identity for a Republic that was hitherto proudly upheld as a secular, democratic polity where all religions of the nation and their followers had equal rights. Some of us, however, would like to remember this date for a different reason that is cause for celebration as well. August 5, also marked the 60th anniversary of K Asif’s dream project, the magnificent Mughal-e-Azam, that released on this date at Maratha Mandir in Bombay to massive crowds, eagerly awaiting a film that had been 15 years in the making. The difference between the two events — equally popular — could not be starker. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who were present at the bhoomi pujan, and others who were not in attendance, were instrumental in initiating and encouraging imaginaries of a majoritarian Hindu India. For them, the destruction of a monument such as the Babri masjid, which they claim was built on a site that was the exact birthplace of lord Ram, was crucial to overcome centuries of humiliation at the hands of “foreign rule”. This dream project is now set to be realised, and with it, we will see the birth of a new Republic that goes against the founding principles of this nation. So how does Mughal-e-Azam represent a different imaginary of the Republic? Can a film that has its roots in a play that was written in 1922 in Lahore — Anarkali by Imtiaz Ali Taj; that was read and appreciated by several luminaries all over north India, including Rabindranath Tagore; that was realised on screen several times; and that colonised the imagination of K Asif when he first encountered it in 1944 as a 20-year-old, embody different imaginaries of nationhood, law, governance, the role of the intellectual, the place of dissent, and the power of a self-sacrificing poignant, beautiful legendary romance? Mughal-e-Azam realises on screen not only all these resonances, but also represents an India that respected talent for itself and not for the identity of those involved in creative acts. It recognised that the nation that was born in 1947, with its roots in centuries of pluralism and mutual coexistence of multiple faiths, was equally constituted by the bhakti imaginaries in the bhajans and thumris in praise of Krishna and Ram as it was by Sufi ideas articulated in the qawwalis imbued with conceptions of ishq that brought human and divine love together, without a thought to the sacrifices that this love would demand. Akbar’s court in the film powerfully brings together these traditions. It is a court in which the Janmashtami festival is celebrated with fervour, with Akbar receiving prasad from Jodhaa Bai and performing the ritual of pulling the cord of Krishna’s cradle gently. As a finale of the celebrations, Anarkali dances to the Benaras thumri, mohe panghat pe nand lal ched gayo re. The mise-en-scene and performance forms, including her kathak, are in the tradition of the Rajput courts. Her other kathak performance, articulating the challenge that her love for Salim is to Akbar’s patriarchal and imperial authority, pyar kiya toh darna kya, is, on the other hand, in Islamicate registers in mise-en-scene, lyrics, and performance codes. Jodhaa Bai maintains her Hindu identity, one that Akbar respects. This is indicated not only in the Janmashtami sequence, but also in his desire that his queen sends him off to battle with the customary tilak and handing over of the sword representing her wishes for his success as per Rajput custom. That Man Singh has a prominent role in the upbringing of Prince Salim is another indication that in Akbar’s court, Rajput Hindus had significant functions to perform. However, these are not the only reasons why Mughal-e-Azam embodies a vision of India that is different from the one that is being realised in Ayodhya. Along with its articulation of the poignant tale of Anarkali and Salim’s doomed love in deeply poetic, spiritual and emotional terms, the film is also a statement about how the right to challenge authority should be an individual right. As Anarkali sings of her fearless love in contravention of the diktats of the emperor; as Salim states his freedom to love when he says that his heart is not Hindustan over which the emperor can claim autocratic rights of rule; or as the poet, artist and sculptor, Sangtarash, asserts the right and freedom of intellectuals to critique authority and power and attempt to awaken authoritarian figures to the destructive implications of their actions, the film can be seen as articulating a vision for a new post-colonial democratic India. This is a vision in which the right to dissent and critique ought to be recognised as a fundamental right. That the Indian Constitution guarantees this right, along with the right to practise and believe in non-Hindu faiths, and that Mughal-e-Azam embodies these and celebrates an India that made such a vision possible, is a value that we need to cherish and preserve as a new India is born.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/august-5-a-tribute-to-the-values-of-the-republic/story-D5Z8gQoPcq0BpVx4blN9kL.html

He was rushed to the hospital in the morning but due to non-availability of a ventilator, he was referred to the civil hospital. The family, however, refused to shift him, prompting civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga to intervene. But by then, it was too late.This is the third such case in the fortnight wherein kin of patients were seen scrambling for ventilators. Earlier, a 49-year-old man died on the way to the civil hospital after being referred by DMC&H. Another 54-year-old of Dholewal area died at the civil hospital on August 4 due to unavailability of ventilator. Both were Covid-19 patients.When contacted, medical superintendent, CMC&H, Anil Luther said, “It is unfortunate that a precious life was lost but we are hard-pressed due to the increasing number Covid-19 patients. We have 21 (invasive and non- invasive) ventilators but all are occupied.” He added that the district has 84 patients, who are either on oxygen or on ventilator support. Besides, there are other critically ill patients with other ailments. “We have arranged nearly 10 more ventilators today and the number will be increased to 31 in the coming days,” said Luther.Rakesh Kumar, son of the deceased, Vishav Nath, lamented, “If so many Covid patients will keep thronging the hospitals, where will patients with other ailments go. I was told that my father died of heart attack. He could have been saved if facilities were available.” Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga reiterated that there is immense pressure on both government and private hospitals due to the increasing number of patients. He added, “We urge everyone to act responsibly and wear masks while going out in public, maintain distance and wash hands frequently. If the infections come, doctors will be able to offer treatment to patients with other ailments as well,” said Dr Bagga. Dr GS Grewal, former president of Punjab Medical Council, said, “While focusing on Covid patients, we have forgotten about other patients. Even before the pandemic outbreak, the critical care units used to remain occupied. The government has to rework its strategy to ensure enough ventilators for other patients too,” added Dr Grewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cardiac-arrest-patient-dies-due-to-unavailability-of-ventilator-at-cmch-ludhiana/story-6xOCDE6i1fxwR8HzX6zhRM.html
07-08-2020||City||Noida: Traffic police prepare plan to ease congestion at Pari Chowk||Noida: The traffic police and transport department in a meeting decided to deploy measures to ease traffic at Pari Chowk in Greater Noida. As per plan, no commercial vehicles such as buses, autos or taxis would be allowed to halt at Pari Chowk for pick or drop passengers. However, three bus stops have been designated – Sector P-3, Sector Alpha – 1, and Sector Omega II – from where the buses would halt instead.Pari Chowk is a junction where traffic coming from Surajpur, Kasna and Noida converges. A large number of inter-state buses and city autos also occupy a significant amount of space which adds to traffic woes.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Traffic, said the meeting was held with all stakeholders to ease the traffic situation. “Pari Chowk witnesses traffic jams in even normal days due to a large number of vehicles coming from different cities. This sometimes chokes the area and motorists such as office goers, students, etc, get stuck. We have designated three bus stands at some distance where the buses, autos and other commercial vehicles can halt to pick up and drop commuters. This will unclog the Pari Chowk area,” he said, adding that the plan would be deployed soon. The first bus stop has been designated in Sector P-3 where buses going from Greater Noida to western Uttar Pradesh will halt. “Commuters going to Aligarh, Meerut, Agra, Bulandshahr, etc. can board buses from there. These buses will run on the internal road and reach Zero Point without visiting Pari Chowk. From there, they can go to the Yamuna Expressway and continue their journey,” he said. A bus stand for vehicles going from Greater Noida to Noida has been designated near Sector Omega II. This bus stand is located between Pari Chowk and P-3. These buses would navigate through Pari Chowk but they would not halt there to drop or pick up passengers. The third bus stop has been designated near Sector Alpha 1 roundabout where vehicles coming from Noida to Greater Noida would halt. These buses and commercial vehicles would cross Pari Chowk but won’t halt there. Around one lakh vehicles navigate through Pari Chowk on normal days. Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha – 1 in Greater Noida said that the traffic is relatively smooth at Pari Chowk due to the Covid pandemic and the lockdown. “The traffic may increase once normalcy prevails. We feel that the new bus stand is a good experiment and it may ease traffic at Pari Chowk if it is properly enforced on roadways buses and autos,” he said. The traffic police are also conducting enforcement drives to ensure autos having only valid permits ply in the city. “Autos registered in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bulandshahr, etc. would not be allowed to ply on Noida roads. On Thursday, we seized 37 autos and one bus for permit violation in Greater Noida,” the DCP Traffic said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-traffic-police-prepare-plan-to-ease-congestion-at-pari-chowk/story-7hB7FHGdZsNxxq6VHTlXnJ.html

It will come into effect from Saturday.In addition to ‘rehri’ markets, the internal market of Sector 8 that houses various eateries will also open on odd-even basis. In the Covid-19 review meeting chaired by UT administrator VPS Badnore, it was also decided that the scooter repair market in Sector 43 will remain closed on all Sundays and some shops in the mobile market at Sector 22 will remain shut for the next six days.The order on congested markets were issued on the basis of recommendations received from the committee headed by the UT finance secretary to contain the spread of infection. It was constituted in the wake of a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in the last one month and reports of violation of social distancing norms in congested markets. Under the system, odd- and even-numbered shops in the market are opened an alternate days. On August 8, shops with even number will open, and August 9, odd-numbered shops will open.All booths, shops and SCOs that are joined together will be considered as a single unit. In such cases, the lowest number will be considered for deciding odd and even. For example, if SCO numbers 1 and 2 are joined together, it will be treated as a single SCO with number 1.Subdivisional magistrates will coordinate with markets associations for smooth functioning and strict enforcement of the orders. The administration will review the decision after a week.During the meeting, Badnore directed all three chiefs of medical institutions to take greater care of co-morbid patients and to ensure that fatalities are kept at the minimum. He also directed the PGIMER to start rapid antigen testing, so that a large number of people could be covered in a short time. The administrator said that dedicated teams in ambulances could carry kits to take samples and conduct tests on the spot in different areas.Markets to be coveredInternal market, Sector 8Patel Market, Sector 15Palika Bazar, Sector 19Sadar Market, Sector 19Azad Market, Sector 20Palace Market, Sector 20Booth Market, Sector 21Shastri Market, Sector 22Janta Market, Sector 27Krishna Market, Sector 41Market near Burail Chowk||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/odd-even-rule-back-in-chandigarh-s-congested-markets/story-oUksS9DIADlBwHMkE98hMP.html
07-08-2020||City||Sukhbir leads protest against police over missing ‘saroop’||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday led a protest against the police for failing to recover the ‘saroop’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib that went missing from Ardaspur Sahib Gurdwara at Kalyan village in the district more than two weeks ago. Staging a ‘dharna’ along with party activists in front of the office of the senior superintendent of police (SSP), he slammed chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur for allegedly maintaining silence on the issue. “Why did the organisations, which were propped up by the Congress, keep away during the lockdown, leaving it to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to help people in distress? Even now, these organisations are silent despite more than fifteen days have passed since the ‘saroop’ dating back to the World War era went missing.” The SAD, he said, will never play politics on the issue. “We have come here only because the district police have failed in their duty. We will stage a ‘dharna’ in front of the SSP’s office till August 18 demanding recovery of the ‘saroop’ and arrest of the culprits. If the police fail to make any headway by then, we will announce our next course of action,” he added. “We have never taken any false oath like Capt Amarinder Singh who played with the sentiments of the Sikh community. He vowed in the name of the Gutka Sahib to deceive the people into voting for the Congress in the 2017 assembly elections.” SAD leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Charanjit Singh Atwal, Surjit Singh Rakhra and MLA Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra also spoke on the occasion.Chandumajra said the Patiala police had swung into action and recovered the lost mobile phone of Preneet Kaur within 20 four hours but could not do the needful when it came to the missing ‘swaroop’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sukhbir-leads-protest-against-police-over-missing-saroop/story-syhvhIN8VOZPj85ze9Lv5N.html
07-08-2020||City||Noida: Residents suffer power cuts in city’s 10 sectors||NOIDA: Amid the rising humidity, residents from several sectors of the city have complained of long power outages and voltage fluctuations. In some sectors, local faults led to outage of about eight hours, residents said. According the residents of Sector 137, they had to face a power outage that lasted for more than eight hours from 8.30pm on Thursday to 5am on Friday after the supply line was broken by the sewer cleaning crane. Other sectors also suffered outages of up to three hours due a faulty power supply line and tripping of the substation. Parveen Singh Taragi, estate manager of Logix Blossom County in Sector 137, said that his area had a power outage that lasted for nearly eight hours from Thursday night to Friday morning. “The supply lines were broken by the cranes cleaning the drainage. We immediately complained about it to the power discom, but its staff took their own time in rectifying the fault. As a result, all the societies in our sector had no option other than to bank on diesel generator sets for over eight hours,” he said. Similarly, the residents of Sector 77 complained that they have been facing power outages of two or three hours daily for the past 10 days. “On Thursday evening, when we tried to lodge our complaints with the power discom, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), it did not take down our complaints as all the phone lines were hung up. All the residents are fed up of this sorry state of affairs,” said Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Grihapravesh, a high-rise in Sector 77. Kumar further said that the demand-supply gap is not an issue during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The distribution and transmission bottlenecks and dilly-dallying approach of the staff are largely responsible for the avoidable power cuts, as well as tripping,” Kumar added. Similar complaints were raised by the residents of sectors 25, 27, 28, 29, 36, 37, 92, and 93A, among others. When contacted, Virendra Nath Singh, chief zonal engineer of PVVNL Noida, denied long outages across the sectors. “I regularly conduct reviews of the power situation, and it was not as if there were four to five hours of outages across all the sectors.

07-08-2020||City||Residents say Greater Noida not implementing medical waste disposal plan strictly||Two days after the Greater Noida authority asked all households to dispose of biomedical waste separately in yellow coloured garbage bags, many residents alleged that the authority is neither implementing the directives strictly and nor is it raising any awareness about it.“The Greater Noida authority does not seem to be serious at all in implementing this plan to make sure that disposal of biomedical waste such as used masks, gloves among other items is done separately in yellow bags. The body has not created any awareness among the general public about the initiative, and so far has not discussed it with residents’ bodies,” said Davendra Tiger, president, federation of Greater Noida residents’ welfare associations (RWA)—an umbrella body of RWAs.On Wednesday, the authority had asked residents to buy yellow garbage bags to store used masks, gloves, and other biomedical waste to minimise the risk of infection spread through waste. A private agency (AG Enviro Private Limited) has been roped in to collect these bags and the hazardous waste would be handed over to another private agency (Synergy Private Limited) that will treat it in its plant in Meerut. The authority had also released the mobile phone number of a private vendor from whom the residents could buy the yellow garbage bags.However, the residents said the vendor had refused to provide the with the bags. “When we called the vendor, he said he will only take an order of a minimum of 25 kg. He refused to deliver 1kg that contains 40-50 bags. Why did the authority release a number that doesn’t any purpose?” said Harendra Bhati, a resident of Sector Beta 1 and member of Active Citizen Team—a citizen’s group.The vendor, on the other hand, said he was never contacted by the authority.“The Greater Noida authority did not contact me before releasing my mobile number. I only sell bags in bulk for wholesale customers, and I cannot deliver small orders,” the vendor, Neeraj Kumar Gupta, said.“We arranged the contact details of the vendor from the internet to help the residents. However, the residents are free to buy the yellow bags from any vendor in the market,” said Ramesh Chand, senior manager, Greater Noida authority.Residents, however, maintained that there was a lack of communication from the authority’s side.“Many people in our society are in home isolation or under quarantine, and many such people are yet to store the biomedical waste as per the rules. Many others are unaware of the authority’s plans to handle such waste which appears to be only in papers and not on the ground. Releasing a number of a vendor who does not supply bags for retail purposes shows the authority is not serious in its intention to treat this waste. The authority should have made detailed plans to store, collect and handle biomedical waste, ” Bhati said.Meanwhile, the authority said it provides at least 40 yellow bags everyday to the kin of Covid-19 positive patients and is working on creating awareness among residents.“We get a list of patients who test positive from the district health department on a daily basis. Subsequently, our team contacts such families to provide them with a yellow coloured bag to dispose of biomedical waste. We are trying to create awareness about the new directive to make sure the hazardous waste is collected separately and treated as per norms,” said Deep Chander, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-say-greater-noida-not-implementing-medical-waste-disposal-plan-strictly/story-6picQzKdE95eRAXUjf5DaN.html
07-08-2020||City||Noida: Private hospitals launch post-Covid clinics||NOIDA: To assess their patients suffering from cardiac and psychological issues, some private hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar have started post-Covid care clinics. These clinics will provide consultations of senior doctors to the Covid-19 patients who have been discharged from the hospitals. At the post-Covid clinics, the Covid-19 survivors will also receive supportive advice from the physiotherapists and nutritionists, which will enable them to resume normal life at the earliest. These services will also be available to all those who were in home quarantine, hospital authorities said. Manisha Jindal, dean of School of Medical Sciences and Research (SMSR) at Sharda University, said that since scientific reports suggest that even after Covid-19 patients recover from the dreaded disease, there are lasting ill effects on their health, mostly related to heart, mental and chest issues. “To ensure the well-being of the Covid-19 recovered patients, Sharda hospital has opened a new facility to ensure regular check-up and treatment of the post-Covid patients. The facility provides services of cardiologists, chest specialists, psychologists, nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychiatrists and other specialists, as required,” she said. Jindal further said that the hospital, which is the only L-3 facility in the GB Nagar district, and SMSR had compiled all the disease and treatment related details of all patients treated there for Covid-19 infection. “We have treated over 1,000 Covid-19 patients so far, and also prepared a database of these patients so that whenever they come again to our hospital, we can start treatment with the help of their past records. Our call centre is also functioning to help the patients for further information,” the dean added. While launching the post-Covid facility in Fortis hospital, an L1 facility, on Friday, Dr Mrinal Sircar, director and head, department of pulmonology and critical care, said that while the recovery rate of the patients have improved over the past couple of months, it has also been noticed significant changes in patients recovered from Covid-19. “The changes include persistent breathlessness or cough, poor exercise tolerance, disturbed sleep pattern, mental health issues, cardiac complaints, lack of appetite, etc. We have realized that it is important to provide post-Covid care to these patients, to enable their complete recovery. This post-Covid clinic is to address such issues being faced by many patients who have recovered from Covid-19,” Sircar said. Speaking on the occasion, Hardeep Singh, zonal director of Fortis hospital, said, “We have been extending our efforts not only to combat the infection and save lives, but also offering them a post recovery treatment plan. The objective is to deliver overall care and offer support to enable patients to resume their normal lives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-private-hospitals-launch-post-covid-clinics/story-DNT8iDaC6pBNkkpeBrnxxN.html
07-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Home isolation policy working fine, only a few such patients referred to hospitals||The home isolation option is turning out to be the preferred choice for asymptomatic patients and doctors alike. Data showed that fewer people in home isolation were being referred to higher care hospitals when compared to those admitted in L-1 category (mild cases) hospitals. The UP government allowed home isolation through an order on July 20 provided they strictly follow the protocols in place for it. According to records from the health department, only four out of the 299 patients in home isolation were referred for higher treatment to L-2 (moderate care) or L-3 (critical care) hospitals during the period between July 21 to August 6. The rate of referral stood at 1.33%. On the other hand, the referral rate at the of L-1 category ESIC hospital in Sahibabad was 2.99% with four out of 134 patients referred to higher hospitals. The referral rate for at another L-1 category hospital, SRM College in Modinagar, was 20.24% with 34 out of 168 patients referred. The home isolation and L-1 category hospitals cater to asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients. The three category hospitals are part of the UP government’s three-tier Covid healthcare structure. “We are strictly monitoring patients in home isolation regularly monitored with a team of doctors at the dedicated control room. Once a patient opts for home isolation, our rapid response teams physically inspects their house and allows it only if they meet criteria ,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The conditions for home isolation include the undertaking from the patient, a consulting doctor to declare the patient asymptomatic, round-the-clock availability of a caregiver for the patient, a minimum of two toilets at home and separate isolation room. Patients are also required to purchase pulse oximeter, thermometer, mask and gloves, among others. “In case a patient’s health worsens, they are referred to the appropriate L-2 or L-3 hospitals. We have strengthened our dedicated control room from where other activities like surveillance activities and monitoring of teams, facility allocation, etc and calls from public are being taken up and monitored regularly,” he added. Under the home isolation, the patients are marked as recovered after a period of 10 days and they are further directed to stay in home quarantine for a period of seven days as per guidelines. “During the period July 21 to August 6, 18 persons in home isolation were tracked when they did not respond to calls or provide their daily health status. About 540 ‘friendly watchers’ from neighbourhood of home isolated patients also got in touch with the control room if they suspected that the patients were trying to flout norms. In this manner, there is strict watch on patients in home isolation and also on their health status,” said an officer from the dedicated control room who wished not to be named. Experts said that under home isolation, a patient is more comfortable and had a better mental well being. “Since the patient is at home, they are more inclined to fight the illness than if they is admitted at a hospital. Before the home isolation was allowed, people were afraid to be tested as they feared that they would be confined to a hospital. Now, the numbers for those opting for tests is also on the rise,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Overall, up to August 6, the referral rate from different L1 hospitals has ranged from 8.63% to 10.65%. According to official records, total of 554 patients were admitted to SRM College L1 facility till August 6 and 59 patients were referred. The other L1 ESIC Hospital on the other hand has referral rate of 10.08% with 73 patients referred out of total admission of 724 patients till August 6. The Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari (which is temporarily shutdown at present) had admission of 626 patients and referred 54 patients to L2 or L3 hospitals. The L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar on the other hand has a referral rate of 17.52% with admission of 765 patients out of which 134 were referred to higher L3 category hospital. At district’s only L3 hospital of Santosh Medical, a government acquired facility, 562 patients were admitted overall and it has 43 active patients admitted till August 6. However, the hospital also account for 25 deaths out of total of 64 deaths which have taken so far in Ghaziabad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-home-isolation-policy-working-fine-only-a-few-such-patients-referred-to-hospitals/story-zngOYH85lFVrra77ta7zhK.html

The body of a patient remained unattended at a Patiala hospital for 11 long hours. Another patient from Ludhiana died while waiting for a bed at a hospital,” he added.He said over 450 police personnel have tested positive for the coronavirus but the DGP was dragging feet on their testing in an irresponsible and uncalled for manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-demands-white-paper-on-covid-19-arrangements-in-punjab/story-yz07cvlY5Aj1foQHhYtriJ.html

The then inspector Jagir Singh, sub-inspector Harsahai Sharma and assistant sub inspector (ASI) Kuldeep Singh had filed an application in the court seeking permission to turn approvers. They along with former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini were booked on May 6 this year for the disappearance of Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee, in 1991. Saini is the prime accused in the case. Chief judicial magistrate Deepika Singh said the special investigation team (SIT) looking into the case can make a request in the court for pardoning the accused. “In the present scenario, it would be proper if the investigating agency independently applies its mind and moves an application for grant of pardon that no direct evidence is available with them. The agency should consider if it can collect the evidences so as to put all the accused on trial or make some of them as approver,” the court observed. Now, the SIT will file a petition on behalf of the three accused to turn approvers in the case, it is learnt. All the three former UT cops had recorded their statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) before the judicial magistrates in Mohali on different dates. While Jagir Singh had recorded his statement before judicial magistrate Amit Bakshi, Harsahai Sharma and Kuldeep Singh did the same before judicial magistrate Harjinder Kaur. Jagir Singh is also a co-accused along with then inspector Anokh Singh in another FIR in the same episode registered at Kharar Sadar police station on July 27 on charges of fabricating the evidences booked under Section 195-A (fabricating evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the complaint of Kharar (Sadar) station house officer, inspector Sukhvir Singh. Anokh was arrested and was sent to judicial custody after being on three-day police remand. Jagir and Anokh are also co-accused in the previous FIR registered at the Mataur police station against Saini in alleged disappearance of Multani. The two had got bail in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/multani-disappearance-case-mohali-court-rejects-3-former-ut-cops-plea-to-turn-approver/story-WLhYKKtH2q2xCfjJ5ZVOqL.html

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Dushyant disagrees with SET findings, tussle with Vij escalates||A crisis is brewing in the BJP-JJP coalition government in Haryana. A day after home minister Anil Vij recommended departmental action against excise and taxation commissioner Shekhar Vidyarthi, deputy chief minister and JJP leader, Dushyant Chautala on Friday rejected the “allegations made by a special enquiry team (SET) against the IAS officer.” The SET report had blamed Vidyarthi for only giving verbal instructions to order the closure of liquor vends during the lockdown, dilly dallying the supply of information to SET and hampering the visit of the SET to a distillery. Chautala who hold the excise and taxation portfolio also said he was not in agreement with the SET’s observations pertaining to his department. The JJP leader said coming days would reveal the shape of his disagreement with the home minister on the SET findings, indicating the ongoing tussle between the two. The relations between the two have been bitter ever since Chautala as Hisar MP levelled allegations of corruption in purchase of medicines in health department, a portfolio held by Vij in the previous government also. Chautala had also filed a defamation case against Vij when the latter snapped at him with a “drug addict” remark. Defending the IAS officer, Chautala in a statement on Friday said that Vidyarthi is a senior officer and has done a commendable job regarding closure of liquor vends. Rejecting the adverse remarks of the SET pertaining to the functioning of excise and taxation department, Chautala said at a press briefing that the inquiry team did not take into account many aspects before making such observations. “Whether it is about the compliance reports of closing liquor vends in all the districts… the inquiry could have been done in a far better manner. I had ordered the closure of all liquor vends on the evening of March 26 and compliance reports came from all the districts by 11am on March 27,’’ Chautala said. He said that as per the Punjab Excise Act applicable in the state, no officer was allowed to visit a distillery. “Hence such a demand made by SET could not be considered,’’ he said. Chautala said since one of the distilleries is located in Punjab, the Haryana excise department do not have the authority to grant permission to visit. Taking a swipe at the police department which is under the home minister, Chautala said 14 FIRs were lodged regarding illicit liquor by the excise department. However, as per the SET report, the police could not conduct any investigation or take any action against any officer. The JJP leader said while the excise department has taken action against its erring superiors and given a strong message but the police investigation into the matter could not go above the driver-level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dushyant-disagrees-with-set-findings-tussle-with-vij-escalates/story-UUvlP0gpGeKHM5uOT2WgtK.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||International passengers can now apply for exemption from quarantine online||Passengers arriving at the Delhi airport in international flights can now fill their mandatory self-declaration forms online instead of queuing at the airport. Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), the airport operator, on Friday said it has developed “AIR SUVIDHA”—a portal where passengers can fill the form and even apply for an exemption from mandatory institutional quarantine. The exemption from quarantine will, however, be awarded in case of special provisions only, officials said.DIAL said the forms available at AIR SUVIDHA, a first-of-its-kind portal, have been developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of External Affairs and Governments of various states and union territories.“As per MoCA guidelines, this facility will be available for all international passengers arriving August 8 onwards. AIR SUVIDHA will help make passengers’ journey more convenient and comfortable in a contactless way, as they won’t have to fill up physical copies of the forms on arrival,” DIAL said.It said, “With India establishing air bubbles with several countries, the number of international arrivals is likely to go up. This new online self-declaration and quarantine exemption portal will prove to be beneficial for government officials. They can take swift, informed decision on granting exemptions as well as find out how healthy the passengers are,” the airport operator said.However, the exemption from institutional quarantine will be considered only if a passenger falls under one of five categories—pregnancy, death in the family, serious illness, accompanied by children below 10 years and tested negative for Covid-19 via a recent RT-PCR test.Those seeking exemption under the five categories will need to fill up an e-form on the Delhi airport website—www.newdelhiairport.in—and submit supporting documents, including a copy of their passports, at least 72 hours before boarding their flight, DIAL said. However, there is no such time-bound mandate for passengers filling the self-declaration form, it said.“All applications will be routed to the respective state government depending upon the first port of arrival. Similarly, all self-declaration applications will be routed to Airport Health Organization (APHO), under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. A copy of approval or rejection of exemption requests on specific grounds will be emailed to the passengers. Those who are to be exempted from mandatory institutional quarantine can show the same at the transfer area after landing, and walk out hassle-free. This process would not only help flyers, but also the authorities to complete the requisite formalities faster, and reduce congestion,” DIAL said.Usha Padhee, joint secretary, MoCA, said the e-platform prepared by DIAL will be used by all airports in the country and will help the states/health authorities to fast-track the process of clearances for international arrivals.Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO, DIAL, said having an approved exemption form will not only ease the quarantine process but also mitigate the problem of inordinate delays while passengers queue up for the quarantine process.Further, passengers can also avoid the hassle of the filling physical copies of the self-declaration twice, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/international-passengers-can-now-apply-for-exemption-from-quarantine-online/story-StO0IL9XKYXxen3kSji2yL.html

One person has been arrested in the case, while another is on the run, said health department officials. On Friday, acting on a tip off, the health department took the help of a four-month pregnant woman to trace the network operating from Delhi and Bahadurgarh that took part in determining the sex of unborn foetus. The woman got in contact with a man, who was part of the nexus, and met him at the Delhi border. She was told to pay ₹25,000 on the spot to the middleman, according to the FIR filed in Bahadurgarh. The woman was introduced to another man, who took her to a diagnostic centre in Bahadurgarh, where she was asked to deposit ₹2,200 more for an ultrasound procedure.According to the FIR, the woman was told by the doctor present that the sex determination report would be given to her by the two men, who brought her to the clinic. However, health department officials along with the Jhajjar Police raided the clinic and arrested one person from the spot. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said, “We were suspicious of the activities happening in the border areas. We started investigating and managed to trace the network till Jhajjar. One man has been arrested from the spot, while the other one is absconding. Investigation is still underway against the doctor who conducted the test. He has been charged under the sections of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994. An ultrasound machine has also been seized from the spot,” Health department officials said that they are scrutinising documents of local ultrasound centres in Gurugram and would serve notices to them if anomalies are found in their registration documents. “There are 279 ultrasound and diagnostic centres operating in Gurugram. To track their registration and other documents, 12 deputy medical officers and two doctors have been designated. Notices will be served to those centres, which show irregularities in documents and against those whose registration has been cancelled but are operating illegally,” said Yadav. Earlier this month, the health department officials tracked a similar racket operating in Ghaziabad. Three men were arrested and a case was filed against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-health-dept-busts-sex-determination-racket-in-bahadurgarh/story-AUVfljSa1uXGMQvJjN9jXL.html

Earlier, the authorities were working on the project without consulting an expert, to which cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu raised objections.“MC officials are not technically aware about traffic rules, and requirements to make roads safe. We have been receiving complaints that speed breakers are not established properly and road markings are not in place. So, it has been decided that a traffic consultant will be appointed for the project. The matter was discussed when cabinet minister Ashu reviewed Smart City projects last week,” Sandhu said.All major roads will be covered under the project, and steps will be taken to increase visibility at night, including thermoplastic marking on roads and installation of cat eyes.MC officials said all main roads, chowks and entry points of the city will be covered under the project and measures will be taken to reduce road accidents which take place due to lack of precautions and road safety infrastructure.With no cat eyes and road markings, a large number of road mishaps occur every year in the district, especially during foggy weather conditions. 600 LIVES LOST IN ROAD MISHAPS ANNUALLYAs per data compiled by Punjab Police till 2018, on an average, 599 people die in road mishaps in Ludhiana district every year. As per data, as many as 673 persons died in 2016, while 518 lost their lives in road mishaps in 2017. At least 604 lives were snuffed out in road accidents in 2018.As per a report released by Tandrust Punjab Mission director KS Pannu in September last year, Ludhiana district has the second-most blackspots in the state with 91. In the report, Sahnewal bridge was said to be the most risky spot, recording 22 deaths in three years (2016, 2017 and 2018).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/smart-city-mission-ludhiana-mc-to-appoint-traffic-consultant-for-26-crore-road-safety-project/story-OfKpq1kEGityjS7OJVnu5I.html
07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Readers’ take: Beggars should be encouraged to take charge of their lives, not bank on charity||You can’t miss the beggars. They are present at various spots around the tricity such as railway stations, bus stops, roundabouts, markets and religious places. The homeless and destitute, landless labourers and others stricken by poverty indulge in begging in the absence of any employment. Some children are forced to beg by the begging mafia and also made to indulge in crimes. On occasions the poor also encourage their children to beg. What the authorities need to do immediately is. 1. Hospitalise the ill and the infirm 2. Identify children who beg and send them to school 3. Arrest physically fit and mentally alert beggars under the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act 1959 or the Haryana Prevention of Beggary Act 1971. The problem will not disappear unless governments show the will to mainstream such people. SK Khosla, Chandigarh The dispensation needs to walk the extra mile to efficaciously deal with the menace of begging, especially in the new normal situation triggered by the ongoing battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. Should the dispensation want to take on the menace, it needs to crack the whip on those giving alms to the beggars, especially at light points. Police patrolling during peak hours needs to be beefed up. NGOs, sector bodies and the citizenry can play a pivotal role in at least minimising the menace, if not totally containing it. Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Begging has become a common problem in the tricity. The following steps can help eradicate it: - Compulsory and aided (ie free) education for children forced to beg, till Class 10. This will make children self reliant and provide them basic knowledge for socio-economic growth. - Secondly, if the government takes steps to form bodies/association similar to ASHA (accredited social health activist) so that women/young girls can be taken care of, it can end begging among them. Women in slum areas have no facilities with respect to hygiene and social and food security. If ways and means to this are provided by the government, people will stop begging. Thirdly, harsh steps ought to be taken against those begging and skills taught to them to start earning. Rajinder Preet Kaur, Rajpura Practice of begging is rampant, especially in metros and urban areas despite laws and measures adopted by state and Central agencies to curb it. There are organised gangs which exploit the innocents and force them to beg just for money. Rescue teams should be formed at district levels to identify such gangs, the members of which should be punished according to existing laws. The old and infirm who are forced to beg should be sent to destitute homes and children sent to rehabilitation and training centres. Offering alms to beggars at religious congregations, sites should also be made a punishable offence. Anil Vinayak, Amritsar One is overwhelmed with sadness in these times of Covid-19 to see people with small children and carrying babies in their arms, begging at street junctions and streets. Most of them are homeless which is dangerous in the Covid pandemic situation. Such people should be put up in rehabilitation centres set up by state authorities with the help of social and charitable institutes. They should be taught skill development techniques so that they can stand on their feet.Col TBS Bedi (retd), Mohali The beggars of the city can easily be resettled if the administration shows some intent and decides to use its existing available resources. They can be accommodated in night shelters made by the administration. And as the free ration scheme is already in place, food can be provided to these beggars irrespective of whether they possess ration cards or not. These people should also be provided skill training and education and made aware of the employment opportunities available under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which would benefit them and fulfil the labour needs of the administration. Gurnoor Grewal, ChandigarhFirst of all it is really important to know what begging really means. It means asking for money, food and shelter from people without doing any hard work. We all have heard that hard work is the key to success and this should be the mantra everyone should follow. To stop begging, citizens have to take the initiative and instead of money give food and clothes to them. Once they run out of money the beggars will have no choice but to work. Secondly, the government should provide them free shelter so they will not be under pressure to pay extra for lodgings while they work. We should also encourage people who are working hard and trying to sell products, in whichever way possible, by buying from them. Ishita Nara The main concern of a person who begs is to make enough money for four square meals a day. So, they should be counselled first and given the assurance that they will earn while learning and put up free of cost in shelters. They should be imparted skills training and in that course of time should be paid for the work they do, like paid internships. Their children should be sent to government schools and teachers engaged to teach them in the shelters. The youngsters should also at the same time be given some vocational training to help them earn a living going forward. The government should come up with a law to ban begging and to start opportunities for beggars to live with dignity. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliBegging is a full time profession for many Indians but in a pandemic situation it can be a source of transmission. Those who are able bodied should be jailed for a short while and made to understand why begging should not be encouraged. Those who are on the streets should also be medically tested for Covid. A special fine should be imposed on people who feed them or give money to them to discourage this practice. Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhBeggary is deeply rooted in Indian society. Most religions promote giving of alms, which encourages beggars. From time immemorial, beggary has been encouraged as noble, but with close observation and wide experience, mankind has realised that it is a vice, not a virtue for any society. It is against human dignity to earn one’s livelihood without contributing anything to society. Beggars are a burden on the economy of the country and do not produce anything. Often, such people take to petty crimes too. What we needed is strict enforcement of Haryana Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971, duly adopted by the Chandigarh administration. UT adviser Manoj Parida has said he is helpless but the government cannot skip its duty. It must enforce the law, and must give relief to the citizens. However, the locals too need to show their determination to eradicate this evil and stop giving alms to the beggars as it promotes indolence and laziness because of which even children are forced to beg. Manoj Malik, Chandigarh Begging is a social blot and both a humanitarian and law and order issue and warrants a two-pronged resolution with a timebound road map. Those physically challenged, abandoned or others renouncing the material world for spiritual solace must be taken care of by the administration and society. It is appalling to see famished children sleeping on an empty stomach. In a welfare state, those who are starving should have the first right to public purse and resources. Free community kitchens should be set up for the really poor and needy. Traffic policemen/marshals must not be mute spectators to small children or young women with babies in arms walking from vehicle to vehicle at traffic light points. Organised gangs running the begging business should be busted immediately. As most beggars belong to a floating population who have made the tricity their base for making money they must be sent back to their native places. Parents of small children found begging should be counselled about family planning. However, they should not be treated unkindly for most of them are not here by choice. They deserve empathy because begging strikes at the dignity and psyche of an individual.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaOf course we have the Haryana Prevention of Beggary Act 1971 to nab the beggars and put them behind bars, but that is not the answer. If anyone has to be imprisoned it’s the begging mafia, the kingpins profiteering from this business and not the old woman knocking at your car window. We have to view and tackle beggary as a social problem. People take to begging out of poverty and helplessness. They need rehabilitation. It is true many of them get used to the free life and try to resist being mainstreamed, but then the UT authorities and the municipal corporation has to prevail. A road map has to be drawn to remove beggars from the streets in the next five years. First, an account should be taken of total number of beggars, by categories (men, women, children, sick, elderly etc), and the yearly increase in their numbers. Then, an assessment needs to be made for providing them shelters and jobs. They are our human resource. Some work, based on their skills, should be given to them, and children should be sent to schools. These people have to regain their self esteem, and realise their worth. Col RD Singh (retd), Ambala The sad part is that many beggars you see at light points suffer from highly infectious diseases such as leprosy, tuberculosis and now maybe even Covid-19. They also come in contact daily with the general public. Apart from medically testing such people they should also be hospitalised and given treatment. Other able bodied beggars be taken to task and punished and later counselled to start work. . Job opportunities should also be created for such people. The traffic police should not allow them to sit /stand or wander near traffic signals. The administration should arrange for shelters for the handicapped and aged beggars. Local residents should make it a point not to give them money.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, Mohali Having failed to eradicate beggary while spending crores on making Chandigarh a smart city, the administration looks to be trying to find the legal way out to evade responsibility when it comes to removing beggars from the streets. The number of people left to fend themselves on the streets have increased recently due to joblessness after the Covid-19 outbreak. Most of them cannot even afford one square meal a day. In an effort reach out to all such people volunteers of our Humble To Be Chandigarhian, a socially conscious group, has started distributing face masks to people who have no money to buy them in slum colonies and at conspicuous places such as the Housing Board Chowk. Yes, we are not at the Sukhna Lake as advocated by the adviser to the UT administrator, where the visitors hardly need a free mask and generally throw these within the precincts of the lake area. SC Luthra, Chandigarh ‘Bhiksha’ is an old tradition for saints of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism to get food. Even among Muslims, you have Zakat. ‘Langar seva’ in Sikhism takes care of food and shelter, and hence that fulfils the basic needs of a follower. The beggars perform no useful social function, and hence they are a burden on society. It is one of India’s biggest scourges and an embarrassment for all when foreign visitors see them. The superstitions and the orthodox mindset of our citizens, that giving to a beggar is charity, have to change. The main factors that lead to begging, such as unemployment, underemployment, landlessness, poverty, calamity, famines and destitution should be addressed. One solution is to set up penal labour colonies, where psychiatrist treatment, skill enhancement and basic education, medical facilities, recreation and nutritious food should be provided to beggars. A total ban at railway stations and bus stands should be enforced.Rajiv Boolchand Jain||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/readers-take-beggars-should-be-encouraged-to-take-charge-of-their-lives-not-bank-on-charity/story-yzjtwGY7Utuw8AhVvBzL5O.html

According to the police, at least five more suspects have been identified and raids are being conducted to arrest them. The two suspects, identified as Sunil and Naveen alias Chela, both residents of village Rithoj near Sohna, were arrested by a team of Sector 10 crime branch from Vatika Chowk, Badshahpur, on Thursday night, the police said. They were produced in a district court and sent to police custody for a day. A crime branch official, requesting anonymity, said, “Prima facie, the two suspects do not have a criminal history. We are questioning them to ascertain more facts. They said that they had received input from one Ashok about the victim transporting meat in his pick-up truck, following which they tried to stop him. When he did not halt his vehicle, they cornered him near Sadar Bazar and used a hammer to open his truck, following which they assaulted him.” The police said Naveen was among the suspects near Sadar Bazar, who was seen hitting the victim, Lukman, with a hammer in a purported video that had surfaced online. Sunil was among the people present at the two locations, where the victim was assaulted, said the police. The incident had taken place on July 31, when Lukman, a native of Ghasera village in Nuh, was transporting meat in his pick-up truck to a shop near Jama Masjid.On Monday (August 3), the police had arrested the prime suspect, Monu, and Anesh. In a three-minute purported video of the incident, Monu, in a blue T-shirt, could be seen dragging the victim on the road before kicking him and then beating him with a hammer. In the video, at least two more suspects take turns and assault Lukman with a hammer and sticks before he is bundled into the truck. Two more suspects, Mahesh, 30, from Rithoj, and Pardeep Yadav, 28, a Rajiv Nagar resident, were arrested earlier in this week. The case was transferred to crime branch after a preliminary inquiry in which departmental action was taken against four police officials. Three officials were suspended on August 2 for ‘failing to take action on the spot’ while the station house officer (SHO) of Badshahpur police station was transferred to police lines for negligence and failing to control the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/beef-row-two-more-suspects-held-six-arrests-in-the-case-so-far/story-yB0MhAgFedGLeQGWHD3KfI.html
07-08-2020||Gurugram||Man kills mother after she refuses him money for alcohol||A 45-year-old man was booked for allegedly murdering his 65-year-old mother after she refused to give him money to purchase liquor in Bhondsi area on Thursday night, said police on Friday. Police said preliminary probe had revealed that Prem Pal had hit Ram Batheri several times with a sharp object on the head, neck, face, arms and legs. Till the filing of this report, Pal had been absconding.According to a complaint filed by the deceased woman’s nephew, Pal is an alcoholic, who often used to demand money from his mother and beat her up when she refused. Police said Pal was a driver but had been staying at home for the past four months since the Covid-19-induced lockdown was imposed. According to the police, the incident took place around 7pm at their house in Sarhaul ki Dhani in village Raysina. Police said Prem Pal demanded money from the victim’s monthly pension to purchase alcohol. When she refused, he went out of the house, returned with an object and attacked her before running away, said police. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “According to some neighbours, the accused was inebriated at the time of the incident.” In the police complaint, the victim’s nephew, Naveen, 33, a bus driver from Badshahpur, said, “A friend from Sohna informed me over the phone that Prem Pal had killed his mother. At 7.20 pm, I reached their house and saw her lying in a pool of blood. She had injuries on her head, face, arms and body. It seemed that she had been beaten up with a sharp object.” Naveen added in the FIR that Prem Pal was an alcohol addict. “He often used to ask for his share in property from his mother and there were several fights over his frequent demand for money to purchase liquor. He used to beat her up when she refused to give him money. He worked as a driver but since the lockdown, he had been at home for over four months,” added Naveen. A case was registered against the suspect under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Bhondsi police station on Thursday night, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-kills-mother-after-she-refuses-him-money-for-alcohol/story-OfQOnXQjlCbCJrR0kaGcUJ.html
07-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram doubling rate of Covid-19 cases improves to 108 days||The district’s doubling rate of Covid-19 infections improved to 108 days on Friday, up from 58 days on July 27, as per the data available with the district health department. The doubling rate indicates the time taken for the total number of Covid-19 infections to double. A higher doubling rate suggests a relatively slower pace of the spread of the disease. Confirming this improvement, health department officials also added that Gurugram’s daily growth rate of Covid-19 cases has also dipped from about 1.4% on July 27 to 0.87% on Saturday, indicating an even further slowing down of the outbreak than what was observed in July.For the eighth day in a row, Gurugram reported less than 100 new cases per day, leading officials to believe that the situation in the district is under control. State-level data too shows that Gurugram’s doubling-rate is the slowest among all of Haryana’s 22 districts, followed by Nuh (65 days). Neighbouring Faridabad, meanwhile, has a doubling rate of about 40 days, as of August 7. On the other hand, districts that were relatively free of Covid-19 earlier are now reporting new positives with increasing frequency.A state-level official with the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program, seeking anonymity, said, “The rural districts are now coming into focus. Gurugram’s confirmed cases rose by only 5% in the last seven days, but Panchkula reported 53% of the new cases. Yamunanagar and Panipat are the other two districts where infections are growing at a faster rate.”Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that the health department’s efforts have been able to break the chain of transmission of the virus. “We have been observing a declining growth rate and an increase in doubling rate for multiple weeks now. Without proper public health vigilance, the numbers would not have shown a downward trend, week after week. This means we have been able to test enough, isolate quickly and prevent fatalities,” said Yadav.The district’s recovery rate on Friday touched 91%, which is the second-highest in Haryana, preceded by a 93% recovery rate in Bhiwani. The number of recoveries outweighed daily new positives by 5% in the past seven days. In fact, Gurugram is now at number 34 in the list of India’s worst-affected districts (by caseload) shows data by the ministry of health and family welfare. Just a week ago, Gurugram was at number 25. Earlier on in the outbreak, Gurugram for several weeks remained in the top 20 of the worst-affected districts.Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and a former professor of community medicine, said, “While the numbers do provide some relief, it doesn’t mean we let our guard down. Gurugram may be past a peak, but there’s a lot we don’t know about the virus yet, and nationwide cases are still climbing. Social distancing is just as important as it was four months ago.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-doubling-rate-of-covid-19-cases-improves-to-108-days/story-WNv5WbvVltMSs7z61QWkrL.html
07-08-2020||Gurugram||Six revenue officials booked for illegal registries of EWS flats||Gurugram police on Wednesday booked 12 people, including six officials from the revenue department, for allegedly violating norms and corruption in selling flats meant for the economically weaker sections (EWS) category.The latest case comes in the wake of intense scrutiny on the district revenue department where earlier six other officials were booked for allegedly violating norms with regard to sale of small agricultural land.According to officials, between 2013 and 2017, allottees of certain EWS flats sold it in connivance with the revenue department officials. Haryana government rules require all private real estate developers to build flats under EWS category that cannot be sold and transferred for a period of five years after allotment. The allottee should be people domiciled in Haryana. The case names three EWS allottees --- Hemant Kumar, Kamlesh and Neeraj Kumar, all residents of Gurugram--- three buyers --- Girish Kumar, resident of sector 46, Bela Singh from Maharashtra, and Manisha from Delhi--- and the six revenue officials --- Om Prakash, Rupender Singh, Om Prakash Yadav, Inderjeet Singh, Ram Chander and Jagdish Bishnoi. Police said Girish Kumar was involved multiple illegal registeries. The police said that a case has been registered on the complaint of CM Flying Squad, a branch of the criminal investigation department (CID) at sector 29 police station against the suspects under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Corruption Act. Investigating officer Sub-Inspector (S-I) Suresh Chander said that they had received the complaint in January 2019. The complaint alleged that the these properties were transferred to ineligible persons in violation of lock-in period of five years. “We initially began investigation of three registries and during course of investigation sought details of property registration by EWS plots developed by four developers. A large number of violations were found in registries of EWS plots from 2013 to 2107 after which a case was registered against three original allottees, three buyers and six officials of revenue department who served in Wazirabad and Gurugram tehsils, where these sales and registries were carried out,” said Chander. The FIR registered by police said that the CM Flying Squad had obtained information from the officer of district town and country planning (DTCP) regarding the construction and allotment of EWS plots. Officials in the CM Flying Squad said that they had sought details from four developers regarding EWS category flats and the probe revealed that around 75 per cent of these flats were sold within a year. It further said that registries were carried out in violation of rules and below circle rates, which led to loss of revenue and were carried out for pecuniary considerations.Ramesh Kumar, a city based RTI activist, said that he had filed two complaints with the district administration with regard to illegal registeries of EWS flats but no action was taken. “We hope that this criminal complaint would result in curbing such malpractices,” said Kumar. Subash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram police said, “A case has been registered in this matter in sector 29 police station on the complaint of CM Flying Squad and the probe is underway.”On Saturday, six revenue department officials, including a tehsildar was booked under section 420 (cheating) of the IPC and under the Haryana development of urban areas and management act ,1975.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-revenue-officials-booked-for-illegal-registries-of-ews-flats/story-KzZvwzCEQTt4UEsIHqg4gL.html
07-08-2020||Gurugram||MCG starts work on a 2.5km pipeline to prevent waterlogging on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway||To prevent accumulation of rainwater on the Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has started work on installing a 2.5km-long drainage pipeline on the stretch, said officials on Friday.The 3km route is one of the worst-affected stretches in the city when it comes to waterlogging. With the pipeline, the civic body aims to link the drainage lines located on the service lanes of the expressway at Narsinghpur to the nearby Badshahpur drain.Such is the extent of waterlogging on this stretch that even a short spell of rain leaves the service lanes of the expressway and a few lanes of the main carriageway on the Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch heavily inundated. As recently as Wednesday, a brief spell of afternoon rain had left the entire stretch flooded, leading to Gurugram traffic police officials cautioning commuters to avoid the stretch via social media. Due to the limited availability of space to manoeuvre vehicles on the stretch, heavy traffic snarls are often witnessed on the expressway, especially on the Delhi-Manesar side.MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma said that the civic body has started work on a pipeline on the service lane of Narsinghpur and is aiming to complete the work by the end of this month.“Since Narsinghpur is located on the low-lying side, every monsoon season, a heavy gush of rainwater from the nearby high-lying areas starts flowing towards the expressway, leading to waterloggng. This also affects the traffic movement on the stretch. As such, MCG has purchased pipelines from the Haryana Sahari Vikas Parishad (HSVP) and has started work on the project. We are aiming to finish the project within three weeks,: said Sharma. As per MCG officials, the cost of the pipelines is ₹34 lakh, while, the estimated cost of the entire project is around ₹55 lakh. Earlier this year, prior to the start of the monsoon season, the civic body had installed six motor pumps on the stretch to prevent waterlogging. However, officials said that pumps failed to have a significant impact as they were frequently affected by power outages. “Because the nearby areas are located on an incline most of the rainwater that is channelled out with the help of motor pumps recede towards the expressway. As such, the pumps have largely proved to be worthless. In addition, there have been instances, where, because of power outages, we weren’t able to turn on the pumps on time. We had to arrange for diesel generators in such situations, which took time. As a result, by the time the pumps started working on an optimum capacity, 2-3 hours had already been wasted, leading to the entire area being flooded,” said NHAI officials privy to the matter. On July 21, the motor pumps started working only 2-3 hours after it had started raining. Due to power outage, the NHAI had to arrange a 65 kVA diesel generator on a short notice, leading to entire stretch being heavily flooded until evening.The problem of waterlogging is so acute on the stretch that commuters often avoid using it during the monsoon season. “For the last two years, I have been primarily using the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) to head towards Manesar during the monsoon season. Even a short amount of rain would leave the Khandsa-Narsinghpur stretch heavily waterlogged. It takes me more than 25 minutes to cross the stretch during peak traffic hours. Therefore as a precautionary measure, I often use the SPR and bypass the expressway completely,” said R Srinivasan, a resident of Sector 51.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-starts-work-on-a-2-5km-pipeline-to-prevent-waterlogging-on-delhi-gurgaon-expressway/story-MMJBIflzbQzrXRbVFON4xN.html

Police said the victim was rushed to a government hospital in Sohna, where he died during treatment. Police said the victim, 48-year-old Bablu, his wife Kamlesh, their daughter and sons Ajay and Sunny had gone to a man named Rishalu’s house at around 7pm.Rishalu’s brother-in-law Ashok had been playing matchmaker between Bablu’s daughter and Rishalu’s younger brother Pappu’s son and convinced the families to meet on Thursday. Police withheld the name of the daughter and son suspecting them to be minors.The negotiations, police said, had been going on for six months and that Pappu was very interested in the alliance.Sunder Pal, in-charge, Fauwara Chowk police post, Sohna, said, “During the discussion, Bablu said that he was not in favour of the alliance since both were families were related through marriage, which would render this alliance as a marriage between near-cousins. Pappu took offence to this and got into a heated exchange with him. The argument escalated into a scuffle and in the melee, Pappu picked up a knife and stabbed Bablu in the stomach twice.”Police said the victim was rushed to a government hospital in Sohna, where he died during treatment. Police have booked five people -- Pappu and his wife Guddi, Rishalu and his wife Suman, and Ashok-- in the case under sections 302 (murder), among others, of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sohna City police station .Police said according to eyewitnesses, Pappu was inebriated at the time of the incident and acted in ‘a fit of rage’. In the FIR, Bablu’s son, Ajay, said, “After stabbing my father, they all fled from the house. We rushed my father to the civil hospital in Sohna, where he died during treatment.”Police said the suspects were absconding. The victim’s body was handed over to the family after the post-mortem on Friday and they have gone to their native village in Bharatpur, Rajasthan for the last rites, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/meeting-between-two-families-to-arrange-marriage-ends-in-a-murder/story-u9dfgAUOeMgmvW7RcR6kjL.html

The house caught fire and large-scale destruction took place and the unfortunate death of Akbari Begum (mother of complainant) also took place,” it said.It said if released on bail, the accused can threaten the witnesses in the case.During the hearing held through video conferencing, the counsel for the accused said Arun, Ravi, Chand and Singh were falsely implicated in the case and there was no legally sustainable evidence available against them.The police said the accused were not only part of the “riotous mob”, which had indulged in pelting stones, chanting slogans and committing vandalism, but was also part of mob that entered into the house of Begum and set it on fire after committing robbery.According to the charge sheet, on February 25, when the mob torched Akbari Begum’s house, other members escaped to the roof but the octogenarian could not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-bail-plea-dismissed-in-murder-of-85-year-old-woman/story-gY2d3rsXGdM4nRZqY1CTaP.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Two held for stealing jewellery worth ₹1.7 crore after diverting car driver’s attention||A thief who struck twice in the past 10 months, and made off with cash and jewellery worth nearly ₹1.7 crore on both occasions combined, was arrested Friday along with his accomplice.After both incidents, he was caught the very next day by the same police team and every stolen penny and jewellery recovered. The suspects were identified as 20-year-old Sandeep (single name) and his accomplice Santosh.Police said they were part of a Thak-Thak or attention diversion gang. Police said such thieves often use the tactic of diverting the attention of a car’s occupants by either puncturing the tyres, throwing a greasy liquid on the bonnet or by simply scattering some currency notes on the road. The more recent of these thefts took place on Wednesday evening while a Gurugram-based builder and his wife were driving back from Central Delhi’s Karol Bagh after collecting jewellery worth ₹1 crore , said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south). The jewellery was for their daughter’s wedding, scheduled for November this year. “As they drove through the DBG Road market, Sandeep and Santosh drove close to the car on their two-wheeler, and spilled on the car bonnet some greasy substance that starts smoking when it reacts with the air. They then drew the attention of the businessman to the smoke, in the hopes of drawing him out of the car,” the DCP said. The businessman did get out to check, but he locked the vehicle from outside even as his wife sat inside with the suitcase containing the jewellery. “The two thieves, however, managed to snatch the case when the businessman opened the door to get back in the car,” said the DCP. Based on the businessman’s complaint, an FIR of snatching was registered at the DBG Road police station. On Thursday, a video clip of the snatching suspects happened to reach the special staff of the south Delhi district police team.“One investigator noticed the long hair of one of the suspects. Suspecting that this could be Sandeep, who was earlier nabbed by the same team in another case, we visited his home in Madangir to check on him. On finding him missing, we made further inquiries and got to know about his friend Santosh. We visited Santosh’s home in Inderpuri and found him gone as well,” the DCP said.Once they were certain that they had the right suspects, the police deployed informers to learn of their whereabouts and got to know that the duo was in Madangir area. “We caught them on Friday and recovered the entire stolen jewellery before they could sell it,” the senior officer said. Police said Sandeep was earlier arrested for stealing ₹70 lakh cash from a Faridabad-based builder in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas on October 17 last year. In that case, they had allegedly successfully diverted the builder’s attention to steal the cash from his car. “In that incident too, it was the CCTV footage that helped us nab him. The same police team had also recovered the stolen cash the very next day after the crime,” the DCP said. Saneep was released on bail in December in that case. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-held-for-stealing-jewellery-worth-1-7-crore-after-diverting-car-driver-s-attention/story-kOisSj0y5RJB3mh6XXeUcL.html

Punjab, however, has failed to meet its target of conducting 12,000 tests per day for the past fortnight that started July 25 by a margin of 25% or around 43,000 tests (1.25 lakh tests done against targeted 1.68 lakh). The target was set after the state hiked the testing capacity in its government institutions from 9,000 to 12,000 tests per day. On Friday, the state added 12,168 samples tested, the highest single-day testing. As per the state’s media bulletin, Punjab reported 9,246 fresh cases, 5,743 recoveries and 248 fatalities due to the virus over the past two weeks. State covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said: “We are continuously directing district officers to increase daily sample collection. We have conducted more than 6 lakh covid-19 tests in the state and have to keep in mind out capacity. The daily samples being tested are increasing everyday.”“The state has limited staff to collect swab samples, as most employees remain busy in contract tracing. Not every health official is trained in sample collection and conducting rapid antigen tests. Most samples are being collected from Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar, and these are the traced contacts of the patients. Some people are still reluctant to get tested. Others think their family members will also be taken to hospital, if they are found positive,” said a health official, on the condition of anonymity.Officials added that four new testing labs had been set up at Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Mohali with a capacity of 250 per day to begin with, and it would be raised to 1,000 per day by August-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-increase-in-cases-covid-19-testing-misses-its-target-in-punjab/story-HnXChSZ4NvAjFr5Ju1HokN.html

A visit to Rohtak bus stand exposed the tall claims made by the state government and transport authorities of ensuring proper social distancing and conducting thermal scanning of passengers.Many passengers could be seen entering the bus stand without wearing a mask.Gaurav Kumar, a passenger, who boarded the Haryana Roadways bus from Rohtak to Gohana, said he was shocked to see that there is no facility of thermal scanning inside the depot.“Two men were conducting thermal scanning of passengers entering from both gates. However, many commuters entering the bus stand in their own vehicles are not being scanned, which poses a great risk to the lives of other passengers. My bus was not sanitised and many passengers boarded the bus without wearing a face mask,” Kumar said.Another passenger Manoj Dhayal complained that the conductors were issuing tickets without wearing hand gloves. “Precautionary measures are not being followed at the depot and the government has taken a wrong step by plying buses with full capacity. Now, the passengers are sitting close to each other and chances of spreading the virus has increased. The government is only thinking about generating revenue,” Dhayal said.A bus driver, requesting anonymity, said buses coming from other depots are not being sanitised.“We have been washing our buses daily in the morning but it is not possible to sanitise the bus after every route,” he said.Gulab Singh, general manager of Haryana Roadways at the Rohtak depot, said 91 buses commuted on different routes on Friday. “We are making efforts to ensure social distancing at the depot and in the buses too. Thermal scanning is being done outside the main gates of the bus stand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/authorities-passengers-at-rohtak-bus-depot-throw-caution-to-wind/story-Vo8EYINLtC4pZlbmGJmMKJ.html

07-08-2020||City||From Non-SCS to IAS: CAT upholds Haryana govt’s decision to shortlist candidates on basis of written test||The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Friday upheld the Haryana government’s June 9 order on Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) conducting a written test to shortlist Non-State Civil Service (Non-SCS) officers to fill five Indian Administrative Service (IAS) posts. The order comes two days before the HPSC will conduct the test on Sunday to prepare a panel of 25 candidates under what the state government states is a “rational and transparent system for evaluating the persons of outstanding merit and ability.” At least 332 Non-SCS officers from different state departments will appear in the written test for the first time in the state to shortlist candidates. The three-hour written examination will have 100 multiple-choice questions with five options. The examination will have negative marking and for every wrong answer, 25% marks assigned to the question will be deducted. “We do not find any merit in this petition and accordingly the same is dismissed,” justice L Narasimha Reddy, chairman of the division bench stated in the 15-page order. Surender Singh Dahiya, 52, who is additional director, agriculture department, had moved the CAT. His key contention was that June 9 notification of the Haryana government “indirectly” gave the HPSC the power to conduct a parallel examination even as the state did not have this power. The petitioner had argued that the impugned order was a clear encroachment into the powers of the central government. “By no stretch of imagination, the HPSC is entering the realm of central government or UPSC,” the Tribunal says. As per the order, the June 9 notification of Haryana government was only to conduct a written examination and that the HPSC will forward the list of 25 meritorious candidates for five vacancies to the chief secretary “purely on the basis of marks obtained” and he would then forward this list to the UPSC. “The HPSC is not assigned any other role whatsoever,” reads the order, pointing out that the plea of the applicant that the (June 9) order exceeds the legislative competence of the state “is difficult to accept”. The order states that the applicant could have a genuine apprehension in case he was required to compete in the written examination with fresh candidates. “However, here it is only officers who have put in eight years of service... that are eligible to apply and appear in the written examination,” justice Reddy stated. Referring to the “restricted nature of participation in the examination,” the CAT said it cannot be said that an individual candidate is being put to disadvantage of any nature. Justice Reddy has stated that just as there is no legislative background for determination of the ‘outstanding merit and ability’ of the candidate with reference to the ACRs, there need not be any such legislative basis for conducting a written examination. “It may be first of its kind. At the same time, it is a continuous process which needs improvement depending on the past exercise,” the ruling says. “From the above, it is clear that the written examination is proposed to be conducted for determining the outstanding merit and ability of the candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-non-scs-to-ias-cat-upholds-haryana-govt-s-decision-to-shortlist-candidates-on-basis-of-written-test/story-lm1bS1I27Qzh0iUXG0eP8O.html

BJYM chief Mahesh Sharma alleged that cabinet minister Ashu was supporting Rajeev Joshi, the Ludhiana-based businessman who supplied methanol to the manufacturers of hooch. “Ashu said that Rajeev was merely a businessman and was not aware of the purpose for which the methanol was being used. Making such statements indicates that the cabinet minister was supporting Rajeev. The minister should clear his stand,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hooch-tragedy-bjp-bjym-workers-protest-outside-cong-legislators-houses/story-mZD6cCkddqGeekY1FRcSgI.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Necessary security arrangements made for Independence Day: Delhi Police Commissioner||Delhi Police have made necessary security arrangements for the Independence Day celebrations in the national capital, the city’s top cop said on Friday. “Necessary security arrangements have been made for Independence Day, including to deal with threats from aerial objects like drones and microlight aircraft,” Delhi Police Commissioner SN Srivastava told news agency ANI.Srivastava said that the police have sought public cooperation so that no place is used to launch any terror attack. He added that several drives against unauthorised parking have been conducted in the run-up to August 15 so that roads remain clear. “In the absence of public transport, the number of private cars has increased on the roads of Delhi. We have conducted several drives against unauthorised parking so that roads remain clear and lane driving can be ensured,” said Srivastava. The Commissioner of Police also said that Delhi Police is trying its best to provide full security to people and many steps are being taken in this direction.Late last month, Delhi Police prohibited the flying of “sub-conventional aerial platforms” like UAVs, paragliders, and hot air balloons in the national capital till August 15 citing security reasons. The order, issued on July 31, shall remain in force till August 15.Unlike the previous years when dozens of guests and hundreds of school children took part in the main I-Day function at Red Fort in New Delhi, it will be a low-key affair this year, not only in the national capital but elsewhere in the country as well, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. HT had earlier reported citing officials familiar with arrangements being made at Red Fort that fewer guests have been invited for the event and school children will not be part of the festivities. Prime Minister Modi will be presented with a Guard of Honour by the Armed Forces and the Delhi Police, followed by the unfurling of the Tricolour, playing of the National Anthem and firing of the 21-gun salute. The Prime Minister’s speech shall be followed by the singing of the National Anthem and the release of tri-coloured balloons at the end.

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Families of 20 Tarn Taran hooch tragedy victims say were not allowed to meet Punjab CM||TARN TARAN: Family members of 20 of the 121 victims of Punjab’s hooch tragedy on Friday alleged that police did not allow them to enter Sri Guru Arjan Dev Sports Stadium in Tarn Taran, where Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had come to share their grief. Of the 121 people who died after consuming illicit liquor since July 29, 92 are from Tarn Taran and its adjoining villages. The family members of victims from Kang, Muglani and Sangha villages and Tarn Taran town said the police had played with their sentiments by keeping them waiting outside the stadium. The chief minister arrived at 9.50am and interacted with relatives of hooch victims in the stadium for about an hour. “My husband, Satpal Singh, died last Saturday after consuming illicit liquor. I was called to this event by the administration. I was told that I would be taken to the event from the municipal council (MC) office. When I reached the MC office at 8.30am, officials asked me to go to the stadium. I reached at 9am but the police didn’t allow me in,” said Manjit Kaur, 55, of Railway Road, Tarn Taran. “Whatever the government gives us as compensation is a different matter, but the police should have let us meet the chief minister,” she said. Rajwant Kaur, 28, accompanied with her two-year-old son, said, “I was here at 9am but was not allowed to enter. The police said there was no use of going inside. I waited for two hours but was not even offered water.” “Why were we called if we were not to be allowed inside?” said Paramjit Kumar of Kang village whose brother Parmodh Kumar died after consuming the illicit liquor. Jashanpreet Kaur, 22, said: “I showed my father’s Aadhar card at the entry point, but the police didn’t allow me in.” When contacted, Tarn Taran deputy commissioner Kulwant Singh said, “We had deployed officers to bring families to the event. The event was organised at a short notice. Sometimes, after the CM’s arrival, the security doesn’t allow entry at an event. There was no intention to stop the families. Rather, the event was for them. However, we are committed to providing the benefits to all victim families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/families-of-20-tarn-taran-hooch-tragedy-victims-say-were-not-allowed-to-meet-punjab-cm/story-tWrdjxs7HmKWcBblXQvmAN.html
07-08-2020||Patna||Bihar seeks dismissal of Rhea’s plea in Rajput death case in SC||Bihar government Friday sought in the Supreme Court dismissal of Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty’s plea for transfer of the Patna FIR against her to Mumbai in actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case, terming it “premature, misconceived and non-maintainable”.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14 and Mumbai Police, probing the case, has recorded statements of 56 persons including Bollywood directors like Aditya Chopra, Mahesh Bhatt and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The 28-page affidavit of Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Upendra Sharma, filed through Bihar’s advocate Keshav Mohan, said the state police has the jurisdiction in the case as the consequences of the offence are in Patna as well where the old father of the deceased actor resides. Bihar Police has recorded the statement of as many as 10 people in Mumbai including Rajput’s friend Mahesh Shetty and the deceased’s former girlfriend and actress Ankita Lokhande during the probe on the FIR lodged by Rajput’s father, the affidavit said. “It is most respectfully submitted that the transfer petition filed by the petitioner u/s 406 of Cr.P.C is premature, misconceived and non-maintainable,” the IPS officer said in the affidavit filed in response of the apex court’s directives issued on Rhea’s plea earlier. Referring to legal provisions, the state said, “Therefore what transpires from the bare perusal of section 179 Cr.P.C is that the offence can be tried either at the place where the offence has been committed or the consequence ensues.” In the present case the victim is the informant, Krishna Kishore Singh who has lost his “young, vibrant son” due to the act committed by the accused including the actress, the affidavit said, adding that Patna Police has jurisdiction to register the FIR. The affidavit referred to non cooperation of Mumbai Police and interstate ramifications of the crime and said that considering these factors, the state government took note of DGP’s recommendation for the CBI probe and recommended accordingly to the Centre. Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput case: Bihar’s Gagandeep Gambhir to supervise CBI probe team“On the basis of preliminary investigation conducted by Patna Police, it surfaced that the various facts and evidences surrounding the present case may be obtained in Mumbai or rest of India and given the sensitivity of the matter and the inter-state ramification and presence of most of the accused in Mumbai, the Director General of Police, Bihar requested the Govt. of Bihar to recommend the investigation of the case to CBI,” it said. Non-cooperation of Mumbai Police with Patna Police is very much clear from the fact that they have not supplied any documents such as Inquest Report, Post Mortem report, FSL report, CCTV footage, it said. “It is most respectfully submitted that the Mumbai Police has been making lame excuses that only Mumbai Police has jurisdiction to investigate the offence which it has already been investigating despite the fact that no cognizable case,” it said. Seeking dismissal of Rhea’s plea, the state government said the actress has not mentioned anything to substantiate “bias except for the general and bald allegation that the complaint has been lodged due to influence of the informant of the case.” The FIR cannot be transferred merely on the apprehension of bias, it said. It dealt with the CrPC provision under which the transfer of FIR has been sought and said, “the object of section 406 CrPC has never been to transfer investigation from one state to another state.” “From bare perusal of the provision of section 406 CrPC, it transpires that the section provides for transfer of ‘cases and appeals’ from one High Court to another High Court or from a Criminal Court subordinate to one High Court to another Criminal Court of equal or superior jurisdiction subordinate to another High Court...the words “case or appeal” used in...has been used to mean trial and appeals pending before one court may be transferred to another court to secure the ends of justice,” it said. The affidavit said that in criminal proceedings the concept of jurisdiction cannot be applied like civil cases. It also referred to the incident in which an IPS officer of Bihar police was quarantined by civic body BMC in Mumbai. The top court had directed Rajput’s father Krishna Kishore Singh, Bihar and Maharashtra governments to respond within three days to the plea of Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty seeking transfer of an FIR, accusing her of abetting suicide of the actor at his Mumbai residence on June 14, from Patna to Mumbai. The top court had on August 5 said that the truth behind the “unfortunate” death of a “gifted and talented artist” should come out and asked Rajput’s father as also Bihar and Maharashtra to respond within three days to the plea of actress Rhea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-seeks-dismissal-of-rhea-s-plea-in-rajput-death-case-in-sc/story-ICJV7QfeehO7HVXH2x1FcK.html

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||‘Unpardonable act, none will be spared’: CM Amarinder to hooch victims’ families||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday met families of the hooch tragedy victims in Tarn Taran district and said it was not an accident but “murder”, for which the culprits will be given strict punishment. The chief minister said properties of those responsible for the “unpardonable act” will also be confiscated. Singh said the death toll in the tragedy has risen to 121 with eight more people succumbing to spurious liquor in Tarn Taran, taking the fatality count in the district to 92, while 15 have died in Amritsar and 14 in Gurdaspur. “No one involved will be spared. Whoever is involved will be given strict punishment as per law,” he said while addressing families of the victims. The chief minister, who was accompanied by state Congress president Sunil Jakhar, announced an increase in the compensation from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh to the kin of the deceased. He announced a relief of Rs 5 lakh to those who survived the tragedy, but lost their eyesight. Singh also assessed the action taken in the case so far. Addressing the families, Singh said the hooch tragedy was “man-made”. “This is not an accident, but murder. Because when someone makes such a thing (illicit liquor), he knows well that it can be fatal and people will die. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, he is a murderer,” Singh said. “Those who have made this and who know people will die should be tried for murder. Those who do such things should be behind bars” he said, adding that many families have lost their sole breadwinner in the tragedy. “It’s hard to believe how people can even think of making such things (illicit liquor) and not even have fear of God,” he said. Handing over a cheque of Rs 2.92 crore for 92 victim families of Tarn Taran to the deputy commissioner, Amarinder Singh said anyone responsible, however affluent he might be, will not be spared at any cost. The chief minister said the investigation into the case is already underway and Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta has been directed to expedite it. The chief minister said to ensure that the culprits get exemplary punishment, special prosecution teams will be deputed to vigorously pursue these cases. He reiterated his government’s commitment to stand by the victim families in this hour of grief by providing jobs, education and other social security benefits to them. Earlier, Singh told reporters that the opposition parties were playing politics over the tragedy. “Politics is being played even when investigations have just started,” he said when asked about the Opposition taking names of some members from the ruling Congress in connection with the tragedy. Earlier in his address, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar hit out at the SAD-BJP alliance for allegedly nurturing the liquor mafia “which ultimately led to the tragedy of such a magnitude”. Jakhar said the tragedy was an outcome of criminal negligence and merits exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of this crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unpardonable-act-none-will-be-spared-cm-amarinder-to-hooch-victims-families/story-YMufzePNo96uje9ww8iOqN.html

On average, the classes are being conducted online for five hours every day from Monday to Friday. The school, however, is collecting entire fee amount including computer lab fee, library fee, the facilities of which the students are not availing.”“We are requesting to reduce the fees as many of us parents have lost our jobs, the business has collapsed and the income has been cut to half and in some case, it has simply dried out,” he said.“We are not against paying fees but schools should charge for the services that they are providing- like teachers are taking online classes, hence the school should charge for tuition fees only,” he said.“We all have been trying to communicate with the school authorities, but there is no response. Our children are missing out on the classes,” he said.A statement issued by the school management read, “The Ryan group has adhered to all government directives and is sensitive to the financial concerns faced by the parents due to the current pandemic situation.

Kottayam additional district court judge G Gopakumar granted Mulakkal bail on fresh sureties. The court also recalled the non-bailable warrants against him and cancelled the proceedings against the old sureties and listed the matter for further hearing on August 13. Mulakkal was directed to remain in the state till the next date of hearing and was also asked to participate in the trial of the case without fail. Earlier, the court had cancelled the bail granted to Mulakkal and issued a non-bailable warrant against him after he repeatedly failed to appear before the trial court. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed Mulakkal’s plea seeking to discharge him from the case without a trial. The Kerala high court and a Kottayam trial court had earlier refused to discharge him in the case. Mulakkal, a former head of the Latin Catholic Diocese of Jalandhar, had sought from the trial court to quash charges against him claiming that the rape survivor had implicated him after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent. In June 2018, the nun, who is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab, had complained to the police in Kottayam that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. After several rounds of questioning, the special investigation team (SIT) of Kerala Police arrested him in September 2018. The SIT had filed the chargesheet against him last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-jalandhar-bishop-franco-mulakkal-gets-bail-in-nun-rape-case/story-3l0Bw3dvtIno6rsQzwnoRK.html

Authorities took the decision to exempt him after Bihar police wrote a letter to them to facilitate Tiwari’s return to Patna.“I would say I wasn’t quarantined, the investigation was quarantined. Investigation of Bihar police was obstructed,” Tiwari said before leaving, according to news agency ANI. Bihar police wrote to BMC after the Nitish Kumar-led government recommended the transfer of Rajput’s death case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier this week. The central agency registered a first information report (FIR) in the case on Thursday.Tiwari was advised to travel to the Mumbai airport using precautionary measures against the raging coronavirus outbreak, including personal protective equipment (PPE) items.The IPS officer came to Mumbai to probe Rajput’s death after the actor father registered a case in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty, accusing her of abetting his son’s alleged suicide in June.As Tiwari’s quarantine lead to a turf war between the police forces of Bihar and Maharashtra and a political war of words, the Supreme Court said BMC’s move had not sent the right message “despite the fact that Mumbai Police has a good professional reputation”. The top court made the observation during a hearing of a plea by actor Rhea Chakraborty seeking transfer of the case registered in Bihar’s capital of Patna to Mumbai.Mumbai Police are also probing the case after the actor was found dead in his Bandra apartment on June 14 following which the Maharashtra government ordered an investigation into his death.Four personnel of Bihar police, who were in Mumbai since July 27 to investigate Rajput’s death, also flew back to Patna on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-probe-was-quarantined-i-wasn-t-bihar-ips-officer/story-44krbe0JYkHx8ANB8pnYUP.html

07-08-2020||Lucknow||Won’t attend mosque inauguration, says Adityanath; SP asks him to apologise||The Samajwadi Party on Friday sought an apology from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over his remark that he would not attend the inauguration of the mosque to be built in Ayodhya, replacing the demolished Babri Masjid. After the bhoomi pujan for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Adityanath had said on television that “as a yogi and as a Hindu” he couldn’t go for the inauguration of a mosque. Reacting to the remark, the opposition SP said he should seek an apology from the people of the state. When contacted, a UP Congress spokesperson, however, refused to comment on the chief minister’s remarks over the mosque. “If you ask me as a chief minister, I have no problem with any belief, religion or community. If you ask me as a yogi, I will definitely not go because as a Hindu I have the right to express my ‘upasana vidhi’ (way of worship) and act accordingly,” Adityanath had said. “I am neither ‘vaadi or “prativadi’ (petitioner nor respondent). That is why neither will I be invited, nor will I go. I know, I won’t be getting any such invitation,” he said. The day they invite me, secularism of many will be in danger. That’s why I want that their secularism should not be in danger and I continue to silently work to ensure that everyone benefits from government scheme without any discrimination,” he said. He claimed that the Congress never wanted a solution to the dispute. “They wanted the dispute to continue for their political benefit.” “Attending roza-iftar with a skull cap is not secularism. People also know that this is drama. People know the reality,” the CM said. SP spokesperson Pawan Pandey criticised Adityanath over his remarks, charging that he has violated the oath he took while assuming charge as the chief minister. “He is the CM of the entire state, and not only of the Hindu community. Whatever the population of Hindus and Muslims in the state, he is the CM of all. This language of the CM lacks dignity,” he said. “He should seek an apology from the people for this,” Pandey said. UP Congress media cell convenor Lalan Kumar said, “We don’t have any comments on his mosque statement.” But he credited the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi for opening the locks on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid. Referring to the ruling BJP, the Congress spokesperson said, “They play politics of fake Hindutva. The Congress has always talked about whatever is in the interest of people. “Lord Ram is everyone’s, but the BJP wants to show that Ram is theirs alone,” he added. Yogi Adityanath had attended the groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the main guest. Last November, the Supreme Court had settled the Ayodhya land dispute, allowing the construction of the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi by a trust. The apex court had also ordered the allocation of a five-acre plot of land elsewhere in Ayodhya for the construction of a mosque, in place of the Babri Masjid which was demolished by ‘kar sevaks’ in 1992. A trust has been formed by the Sunni Waqf Board for building this mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/won-t-attend-mosque-inauguration-says-adityanath-sp-asks-him-to-apologise/story-Yy3sUGFaDaOjVH1QXis51N.html

Many places in Malnad, coastal and north interior regions of the state have been affected by deluge, putting life and properties at risk. While most of the rivers in these regions are swollen due to rising inflow because of showers continuing in the catchment areas, there are reports of landslips in hilly regions of Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru. Flood like situation persists in the border regions of Belagavi district, with rising water levels in Krishna river and its tributaries due to rains in ghat areas of Maharashtra and water being released from the dams there. Adding to this, the district too has been receiving rains, inundating low lying areas and crops. In Uttara Kannada and Shivamogga districts also there is similar situation of swollen rivers and inundation of low lying areas. Water is being released from several dams in the state including Alamatti and Kabini by opening the gates as inflow has increased. Tungabhadra dam in Hosapete has reached the brim. There have been reports of mudslides near Botlappa and other places in Kodagu, also along Charmadi ghat near Chikkamagaluru and Dakshina Kannada. District in-charge Minister V Somanna has rushed to Kodagu that has been ravaged by floods and landslides. Cauvery river is overflowing and water has entered Bhagamandala temple and blocked major connecting roads in the district. Search is on by the NDRF team and authorities for five people including the priest at Talacauvery, the origin of river Cauvery, who had gone missing due to massive landslides at Bramhagiri hills on Wednesday night. Bad weather and heavy rain is affecting the operation. Residents living in low lying areas in Kushalnagar in Kodagau are shifting themselves to safer places anticipating flood. Three relief centers are opened in the district so far and people in danger are being shifted there.

07-08-2020||Kolkata||BHEL begins civil works at 660-MW Sagardighi power plant in West Bengal||State-owned engineering firm BHEL on Friday said it has commenced civil works at 660-MW Sagardighi supercritical thermal power project in West Bengal. Following the strategic completion of pre-engineering activities for the project beforehand, ground breaking has begun on zero date itself, a BHEL statement said. This is a major achievement as conventionally it takes a few months after the zero date to initiate civil works on-site, the company said. Valued at approximately Rs 3,500 crore, the turnkey order for Sagardighi Thermal Power Project Extension Unit-5 was won by BHEL against stiff international competitive bidding. The order for the project located at Manigram village in Murshidabad district of West Bengal was placed on BHEL by West Bengal Power Development Corporation (WBPDCL). The notice to proceed was issued after obtaining the necessary approvals like environmental clearances. BHEL’s scope of work in the project includes design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, testing and commissioning of the main plant turnkey package, the statement said. The package comprises supercritical boiler and turbine generator along with its auxiliaries, electricals, controls and instrumentation, switchyard, flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, coal handling plant and ash handling plant. The key equipment for the project will be manufactured at BHEL’s Trichy, Haridwar, Bhopal, Ranipet, Hyderabad, Jhansi, Thirumayam and Bengaluru plants, while the company’s Power Sector - Eastern Region division will be responsible for construction and installation activities on site. The Sagardighi thermal power station is already equipped with two sets of 500 MW installed by BHEL in 2016. BHEL has so far contributed over 80 per cent of the total coal-based generating capacity of WBPDCL. In addition to Sagardighi, BHEL has executed projects at Bakreswar (5x210 MW), Kolaghat TPS (6x210 MW), Bandel TPS (1x210 MW) and Santaldih TPS (4x120 MW + 2x250 MW) for WBPDCL. The BHEL-installed units are running successfully and form the backbone of electricity generation in the state of West Bengal. BHEL is India’s largest manufacturer of power generation equipment with an installed base of over 1,90,000 MW of power plant equipment globally. The company has contracted 58 sets of supercritical boilers and 53 sets of supercritical turbine generators, ordered on it by various customers, in domestic as well as overseas markets. In the supercritical segment, BHEL has successfully manufactured and executed 660 MW, 700 MW and 800 MW sets, thereby demonstrating its leadership status and technological prowess.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bhel-begins-civil-works-at-660-mw-sagardighi-power-plant-in-west-bengal/story-fNUkaqYCqENq1UopTwwffO.html

07-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal launches electric vehicle policy, calls it ‘most progressive’||The Delhi government aims to boost the economy and reduce pollution level in the national capital, recognised as one of the world’s most polluted cities, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday as he rolled out his government’s electric vehicle policy.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said his government studied the electric vehicle policies across the world and consulted experts in the country to come up with the policy to offer subsidies and waive road tax and registration fee for electric vehicles.“We have issued a notification for the electric vehicle policy today… This electric vehicle policy is the country’s most progressive policy and most probably is one of the good policies in the entire world,” Arvind Kejriwal said in a press conference.“The policy has two objectives. First, to boost Delhi’s economy after the coronavirus pandemic. Second, to significantly reduce the pollution level and contribute to sustainable development,” Kejriwal added.The policy would help generate jobs in large numbers – driving, selling, financing, charging points, etc, he added.The Delhi government, he said, would introduce financial incentives for people buying e-vehicles. For two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and freight vehicles, there will be incentives up to Rs 30,000 and for cars, it will up to Rs 150,000. “These incentives are over and above already existing incentives for e-vehicles under the central government,” he said.The Delhi government will also provide a scrapping incentive, the first in the country, for replacing the fuel-based vehicle with e-vehicle. Interest on loans for the purchase of e-vehicles for commercial activities will be waived and e-vehicles will be exempted from registration fees and road tax, he said.Kejriwal said the electric vehicle policy will be valid for three years and will be reviewed from time to time. A state electric vehicle (EV) fund will be set up to bear all expenses related to the policy and an EV board will be set up which will be chaired by the state transport minister.“An EV cell will be set up to ensure implementation of the policy…We hope, in the next five years, five lakh new e-vehicles will be registered in Delhi.”The Delhi cabinet had approved the Delhi Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, 2019, last year with an aim to reduce air pollution by offering subsidies and waiving road tax and registration fee for electric vehicles bought in the national capital. Delhi has 83,730 electric vehicles out of over 11 million vehicles registered in the city. Of the 83,730 registered EVs, a mammoth 75,567 are e-rickshaws. There are only 908 private electric cars and 3,703 e-two-wheelers in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-launches-electric-vehicle-policy-calls-it-most-progressive/story-TdruermDOf7hGMKKWZnUbP.html

07-08-2020||Delhi||Sadia, the ultimate Delhi wali||“I want to be buried here,” said Sadia Dehlvi, the author of Sufism: The Heart of Islam, The Sufi Courtyard: Dargahs of Delhi and Jasmine & Jinns: Memories and Recipes of My Delhi. On that early morning, she was walking around Nizamuddin Chilla, the serene retreat of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, just behind Humayun’s Tomb, in central Delhi. Here, the city’s iconic 14th century Sufi saint lived, meditated, and died. Ms Dehlvi would often walk over to this calmly place from her garden-facing apartment in nearby Nizamuddin East.This is an account that unfolded a few years ago, before Ms Dehlvi was diagnosed with cancer. She died on Wednesday night after a long, brave struggle with the illness, aged 63.But that morning, Ms Dehlvi was full of life and plans — as always. Standing amid the shrine’s little graveyard, she said, “It is with the mitti (earth) of Delhi that I wish my remains to mingle with.” Her family has been living in the city for centuries. The name Dehlvi literally means “someone from Delhi”. For many years she lived in a sprawling mansion on Sardar Patel Marg. Hers was one of the first Old Delhi families to have a large establishment in New Delhi. Ms Dehlvi’s father and grandfather were publishers of the influential film and literary Urdu journal Shama. “Throughout my childhood I saw actors, writers and poets coming in and out of the house, and my grandfather loved hosting receptions for them.” In the evening, the house at SP Marg regularly hosted cultural soirées. It became an institution and was known as Shama Kothi. In the 1990s, the magazine had to close because of a dwindling Urdu readership.A few years later, a family crisis forced the Dehlvis to sell the house. The buyer happened to be Mayawati, the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party. Shama Kothi became BSP House. Ms Dehlvi moved to Nizamuddin East.The fabled Shama Kothi had 40 rooms, 15 members of an extended family and 25 retainers. At the new apartment in Nizamuddin East, where Ms Dehlvi’s son lived with her, she had four rooms and two household assistants. “For me, this move was a hijr, a symbolic migration where one encounters physical and emotional displacement that brings suffering. The pain purifies the soul, triggering an inner change that connects you with the truth, with God. And truth is…” By then Ms Dehlvi was no longer audible. She had walked ahead, eagerly looking at the tombs and reading the inscriptions. Some graves had potted plants. One had marigold flowers growing out of it. Another was covered with grass.Ms Dehlvi’s son, Arman, is a musician. It was almost a tradition for both mother and son to invite friends almost every evening to their second-floor flat, whose roof faced Humayun’s Tomb. While Arman would render Sufi songs or play the tabla, Ms Dehlvi talked politics, passionately argued about new books, played qawwalis on YouTube, and shared stories about Delhi so vividly as if the city were her some stubborn eccentric maddening, but ultimately loveable, aunt. The entire evening would unfold in her book-lined drawing room, whose walls were decked with beautiful original works of art by eminent South Asian painters. The generous hostess laughed easily. The evenings usually ended with the dinner cooked by Ms Dehlvi herself with help from Sabir Bhai, her longtime cook. Although aloo salan and dal maash remained the favourite with friends, sometimes they were surprised with the unexpected—such as baked fish, Italian style, or very rich French onion soup. Indeed, her house was famous for not letting anyone—no matter who, friend or not—leave without being treated to a nice satisfying meal.After her sprawling family house was sold, Ms Dehlvi confesses she found herself unable to write, even though she had been a columnist for newspapers for decades. “The collapse of our legacy was soul-crushing.” A couple of years later after the move, Ms Dehlvi began to work on her book on Sufism. In 2009, it was released by her mentor, author Khushwant Singh, who himself had written a lot on her. “Researching the lives of the Sufis and reading Islamic philosophy helped me understand that pain is a gift from God. I started seeing myself as being blessed and not cursed,” she said, sifting absentmindedly beside a grave.Later, while between a jumble of tombstones, she stopped suddenly and said: “Another reason why I want to be buried here in the Chilla is because it is close to my home. Hopefully, my son will find it easier to visit me more often.” And she added with a laugh, “Also, it’s more important to have a good neighbour in death than in life.” She was referring to her beloved Hazrat Nizamuddin.But then Ms Dehlvi’s mobile rang. “Oh, I must head back. There’s a cricket match on TV today.”Ms Dehlvi was buried in the Shidipura graveyard on Thursday morning. Thursday was always a special day for her. If there had been no coronavirus pandemic, and Ms Dehlvi had been alive and healthy, she would most certainly have gone to Hazrat Nizamuddin’s Sufi shrine to offer her Thursday night prayers. She is survived by mother, Zeenat, brother, Vaseem, his wife, Himani, son, Arman, and his wife, Maliha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sadia-the-ultimate-delhi-wali/story-KXjh39It8ibPkucUoWc9ZP.html
07-08-2020||Education||Mumbai University first merit list out: Self-financed degree courses top choice, check cutoff for prominent colleges||The University of Mumbai’s first merit list for undergraduate degree courses was released on Thursday, with many colleges seeing a spike in cut-offs for science, arts and commerce. Unaided self-financed courses remain a favourite of applicants. Students allotted seats in the first merit list have from August 6 to August 11 to complete their admission process. To confirm admission, a candidate must submit all necessary documents online along with a copy of the pre-registration form to the college and their college fees. The second merit list will be released on August 11 at 7pm. A mixed response for BAThis year, some of the top arts colleges retained high cut-offs. The cut-off for BA at St Xavier’s College is 92% for HSC students and 98.60% for other boards. Mithibai College closed its first list at 96%. Compared to 93% in 2019, this year the cut-off at KC College is 96% and Ramnarain Ruia College ended the first merit list on 95.6% compared to 95% last year.At Wilson College, the cut-off is 93.6%, seven percentage points higher than 2019. “Cut-offs for almost all courses have gone up or remained similar to 2019. Despite Covid-19, students want to study in Mumbai. We got applications from many outstation students and the competition seems to be as fierce as 2019,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal, St Xavier’s College.Surprisingly, DG Ruparel College saw a lower cut-off than last year. The BA cut-off at Ruparel College is 88.6% this year, compared to 2019’s 98%. “One reason is that we increased the intake for BA. We are also seeing a slight dip in the applications because of the Covid-19 situation as many students are in their hometown and unsure about moving back to Mumbai, at least for this academic year,” said Tushar Desai, principal, DG Ruparel College.“One reason is that we have increased the intake for BA from this year so we are accommodating more students this year. We are also seeing a slight dip in number of applications, which could be because of the ongoing Covid-19 situation as many students are back in their hometown and unsure about moving back to Mumbai, at least for the current academic year,” said Tushar Desai, principal, DG Ruparel College. Unaided courses attract top scorers: Once again, unaided courses like bachelors in management studies (BMS), bachelors in accounting and finance (BAF), bachelors in banking and insurance (BBI), bachelors in mass media (BMM) as well as bachelors in financial markets (BFM) remain favourites among students. Most top colleges recorded a slight rise in cut-offs for courses like BFM and BBI this year. “Unaided courses invariably attract more students because students still feel they have better job opportunities after such courses. Arts students, however, are moving more towards the traditional course over unaided courses,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal, KC College. This year, the cut-off for BMS at Jai Hind College in Churchgate is 96.2% for commerce, slightly higher than last year’s 94.6%. For science stream, the BMS cut-off is 93.4%, compared to 89.8% last year. The cut-off for arts dipped by two percentage points. Commerce and science attract more studentsTraditional courses like bachelor of science (BSc) and bachelor of science in information technology (BSc-IT) or computer science (BSc-CS) have received more applications this year across several colleges. “Overall, the university has received 25% more student registrations this year compared to last and this could be because of the uncertainty over admissions to professional courses. Many students must have blocked seats in traditional courses until they bag a seat in the course and institute of their choice. There’s a chance that more seats will go vacant once admissions to professional courses commence,” said Bagla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-s-first-merit-list-out-self-financed-degree-coursestop-choice/story-CBzftWyWlF9UlCap14TXZJ.html

The BJP claims it asked party workers to mark the celebrations keeping in mind Covid-19 norms. “By taking action against party workers who were peacefully celebrating the bhoomipujan of Shri Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government brought alive the tyrannical Mughal rule in the state,’’ said BJP’s chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay. In a press conference, Upadhyay alleged that in Pimpri Chinchwad, the police stopped the distribution of 10 lakh ladoos planned by party workers, while in Vidarbha, the members were threatened with a police case if the celebrations continued. At Baramati, Indapur and Saswad, the celebrations were not allowed at all, he claimed. “These incidents have exposed the true nature of Shiv Sena, which said it has not given up on Hindutva despite an alliance with Congress,’’ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-in-maharashtra-did-not-permit-ram-mandir-celebration-bjp/story-gmom0NBAEhKT1lSmeMrArK.html

The woman also shared a morphed photo of the CM. The police booked her for promoting enmity between different groups and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, defamation and other charges under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A local court granted her bail on Thursday. “The Navi Mumbai resident was arrested on Thursday,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (Cyber), Mumbai Police crime branch.The woman was arrested based on a complaint filed by advocate Dharmendra Mishra, who is also associated with Shiv Sena, as the party’s legal consultant.In the first information report, a copy of which is with HT, Mishra alleged that the woman, through several of her tweets, on July 25 and July 28 hurled abuses on the CM and Aaditya Thackeray. She also made objectionable comments on them.“The woman in her Twitter bio describes herself as core committee member of @Bharat_niti which is linked to BJP’s [Bharatiya Janata Party] IT [information technology] cell. Her abusive and objectionable posts on Twitter not only undermines the diginity of chief minister’s post, but also promotes enmity in religious groups. This is a perfect example of blatant misuse of freedom of speech,” Mishra tweeted.Last month, the VP Road police booked Nagpur businessman for allegedly abusing CM and defaming Aaditya Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-woman-held-for-posting-maharashtra-cm-s-morphed-pic-on-social-media-abusing-his-minister-son/story-25udJwxe6NlaRQZiOy0XUN.html
07-08-2020||Mumbai||Rain brings Mumbai to halt||Two people, one of them a railways employee, died of electrocution amid the record rain that slammed the city, according to officials.Shambhu Soni, 38, a resident of Anand Nagar in Dahisar (East), was electrocuted by a short circuit at 9.46am on Wednesday and he was rushed to Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital in Kandivli, where he was declared brought dead. A railway employee identified by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as Sanjeev, 22, was electrocuted to death while on duty near Masjid Bunder railway station on Wednesday. Officials said the tracks at the station were submerged under 1.5 feet of water , following which Kumar got into the waterlogged area to inspect a pump placed by BMC. He was declared dead at the hospital.The exceptionally heavy rain of 331.2mm rain in 24 hours, accompanied by chaotic winds ranging from 70-80kmph, between Wednesday and Thursday not only broke the record for this season, but was the highest monsoon rain record for south Mumbai in 46 years and second-highest all-time rain record during monsoon, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. The highest all-time record was on July 5, 1974 with 575.6 mm rain in 24 hours. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 331.2 mm (exceptionally heavy) rain between 8.30am Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday. This was also the all-time high one-day rain in August. Over the past 72 hours (August 3, 8.30am to August 6, 8.30am), Mumbai saw its heaviest rain spell this season with the island city recording 637.2mm rain in south Mumbai and 505.2 mm rain in the suburbs.On Thursday, part of the second floor in a ground-plus-four-storey structure in Dadar collapsed afternoon.

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Politics over hooch tragedy: Punjab ministers want Bajwa, Dullo out; MPs stay defiant||The internal war in the ruling Congress escalated on Thursday with all Punjab cabinet ministers demanding immediate expulsion of Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo for ‘anti-party and anti-government activities’. The move came two days after both MPs submitted a letter to the governor, seeking CBI and ED probes into the state’s worst hooch tragedy that has claimed 113 lives. The ministers said the ‘gross indiscipline’ by two MPs call for immediate action by the party high command as the duo “bypassed all party and government forums’ to attack their own government. Both MPs, however, rejected the allegations and refused to back down. The cabinet ministers, who issued a joint statement here, said: “Indiscipline could not be tolerated at any time, least of all when the assembly elections in the state are less than two years way.” They further said the two MPs had never, in their Rajya Sabha term, bothered to raise any issue of the interest of the state they represent, including related to completion of the ED probe into the drugs issue, anti-farm ordinances and the CBI’s failure to probe the sacrilege cases. Accusing the duo of undermining the state police force, the ministers said a CBI probe was needed only if the police failed to deliver, which was definitely not the case at present. They said both MPs had rendered themselves useless, and were of no value to the party, and needed to be shunted out without delay. BAJWA, DULLO HIT BACK Dismissing the ministers’ demand, Bajwa and Dullo called it an afterthought. “If the performance of the party can’t be criticised even if the government is working against the interest of the public which has reposed faith in the party and elected them to power, then this is against the principles of democracy,” the duo said in a joint statement. On the ministers’ charge regarding not raising the ED case, Bajwa said, “It appears that Capt Amarinder Singh has started suffering from dementia and has forgotten that it was he who had supported the Badals and not us. During Bajwa’s tenure as the PPCC president, it was Amarinder who had been opposing and criticising not only the PPCC but also the party high command,” they claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/politics-over-hooch-tragedy-punjab-ministers-want-bajwa-dullo-out-mps-stay-defiant/story-4wN5qo9VaBWWMvylAtWzkJ.html
07-08-2020||City||Artist duo sculpt eco-friendly cow dung Ganesha idols||Two artists, from Thane and Pune, who lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 lockdown, have now come together to sculpt eco-friendly Ganesh idols using natural elements like cow dung, rose water and sandalwood.Naresh Nagpure, a Thane resident, and his friend Jayendra Gholap from Pune, both 28-year-old art directors, lost their jobs at different agencies recently. Hoping to use their free time productively, the two decided to use their talents for environmental causes and have started creating eco-friendly idols for devotees.“During the lockdown, people were not keen on giving artists work. We were running out of clients, and I lost my job. We decided to take it positively, and during one of our conversations, Gholap and I came up with this idea to use cow dung to create environment-friendly Ganesha idols. It was the thirst to look for a unique element that prompted us to make use of cow dung, which is also considered holy and pure,” said Nagpure, resident of Panchpakhadi, Thane. These idols, they say, will be easy to immerse at home, and people can avoid immersion sites during the ongoing pandemic. Working from a studio they set up in Pune, Nagpure and Gholap have made over 35 idols using a mix of cow dung powder, rose water and sandalwood. They have set up a studio in Pune for sculpting the idols.The idols are priced at around ₹3,000 and are available for sale online. Since July 5, within they have managed to get orders for more than 35 idols within Pune and Thane.The duo initially tried making the idols from cow dung they sourced from a local cow shed. However, it was not strong enough, so they made use of dung powder instead.“We did a lot of research and found out that powdered cow dung is used to make eco-friendly products. We then sourced powdered cow dung from Nagpur, Nashik, and Madhya Pradesh, which was easier to shape into idols,” said Nagpure.Buyers receive a tulsi sapling with each idol. On the day of immersion, the idol can be immersed in a bucket of water at home. By the next morning, it would have dissolved completely and turned into manure, which can be used for the tulsi sapling.“Those who are keen on immersing the idol in any water body can do so, and it will not harm the environment in any way. As we are getting a good response, we will work on improving the design and having eco-friendly colours for the idols from next year,” said Gholap.One of the customers who placed an order for the idol, Shanti Lele, 46, resident of Naupada, said, “I was initially very sceptical about the concept. I was looking for eco-friendly idols, and after looking at the pictures they provided, I found it to be a unique idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/artist-duo-sculpt-eco-friendly-cow-dung-ganesha-idols/story-CzWwrcL7np14AWJyJy4KwK.html

Accusing the complainants of ulterior motives, Neelkanth Constructions contented that after taking the possession of their flats, the buyers cannot stop it from consuming the FSI of the entire land. The developer said they started the process of forming the society, but the complainants kept obstructing the respondent to extract money from the builder. Hence, the society formation process was stopped. The developer also said that if the complainants do not disrupt the process, it will go ahead with the formation of the society.However, while hearing the case, the state real estate regulator cited section 14 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) 2016, which mandated that any modification in the building plans, including the construction of additional floors, required the requisite consent of two-third of the allottees.“With regards to the construction of additional floor to be constructed in the building, MahaRera directs that without the consent of two-third of the allottees, as prescribed under section 14 of the RERA, a respondent would not carry out any construction on site,” MahaRera said in its ruling.According to housing activist Vinod Sampat, a builder loses his/her right of modification after the first apartment is sold.“It is binding on the builder to obtain the consent of the buyer, as the latter has booked [the property] based on the plans given by the developer. Any additional construction would be a burden on the homebuyer, and hence, the consent [of the buyer] is required. Even the extra FSI offered later goes to the kitty of homebuyers,” said Sampat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/developer-can-t-add-extra-floor-without-nod-of-buyers-maharashtra-real-estate-regulator/story-UUiwdRUYGzpeUkIphqooVN.html
07-08-2020||Mumbai||As Covid-19 testing increases, positivity rate drops in Mumbai||With the introduction of large-scale antigen testing in Mumbai since the last week of July, the daily average for the number of Covid-19 tests conducted in the city has risen to 7,500. Despite the increase in testing, new cases have consistently remained below 1,000, which in turn has helped bring the city’s positivity rate down to 20.83%, from 21.68% in July. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started its jumbo antigen testing drive on July 25, under which hundreds of frontline workers from the solid waste and police departments are being tested for Covid-19 every day. As of August 4, the civic body has conducted a total of 5,67,031 tests in Mumbai. In the past 12 days, BMC has tested XXXX individuals, using both antigen and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. RT-PCR is considered the gold standard in testing for Covid-19. “On three consecutive days, we have tested more than 10,000 people in Mumbai. We are still trying to increase daily testing numbers. Along with this, we are also using x-ray and CT scan for diagnosis,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. As per data from BMC, on July 27 a record number of 11,643 people were tested. This was the highest number of tests to be conducted in a day since the outbreak reached the city in March. The increased number of tests has not seen a corresponding rise in the number of new cases recorded and the city’s daily Covid tally has remained below 1,000. Even on July 27, 938 new cases of Covid-19 were reported. Experts said this indicates flattening of the pandemic’s curve in Mumbai. “In June, we were testing around 5,000 people daily. A section of the society claimed that due to the same testing number, the cases of new Covid-19 infection also remained constant, below 1,300. But now, even though we have doubled the testing, the new infection rate is below 1,000,” said Dr Shashank Joshi from the state’s Covid task force. As the city and state gradually relax lockdown restrictions as part of Mission Begin Again, civic officials and doctors are relieved to see the number of new cases has plateaued. “Now, our primary target is [people in] residential buildings. We have been given a target of testing 400 people daily with rapid antigen kits. As many Covid care centre (CCC) facilities are closing down, we have decided to start doing antigen tests at home through private labs,” said a civic officer from R (Central) ward, which covers Borivli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-covid-19-testing-increases-positivity-rate-drops-in-mumbai/story-YOsXptZqIQ3A36QQjkacuK.html

07-08-2020||City||Thane, Kalyan traders demand shops to be open through the week||Shopkeepers associations in Thane and Kalyan have appealed for shops to be permitted to stay open throughout the week. At present shops in most of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, especially in Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Badlapur are allowed to function on odd and even basis. In Mumbai, shops are permitted to open throughout the week from 9am to 7pm since August 3. Rasik Chedda, chairman, Ram Maruti Road Shopkeepers Association, said, “Due to this odd and even concept, we can do business only for 15 days in a month. We remained closed for three months due to strict lockdown enforced here; it has had a deep impact on our business. Like Mumbai, that has been permitted shops to open for all seven days, we also need similar permission, now that the situation is improving.” Shopkeepers have approached Thane municipal commissioner, Dr Vipin Sharma with this request. “We have to ensure that the numbers go down and it is safe to allow shops to remain open all day. We are taking strict measures to ensure crowds do not increase in market areas and the odd and even method is an initiative to ensure fewer crowds in open areas,” said a civic official from Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).Shopkeepers in Kalyan, Ulhasnagarr, Badlapur and Ambernath are also demanding permission to stay open through the week. Anand Kulkarni, owner of Trupti Fashion outside Kalyan station, said, “We have been supporting the lockdown along with the residents; we understand the importance of such measures. But with increasing expenses of electricity bills and shop rentals, we are finding it difficult to make ends meet. If shops are open on all days, the crowd in front of shops will also lessen.” Ulhasnagar and Badlapur traders claim that with cases decreasing, shops should be permitted to open. Sanjay Chanchlani, Ulhasnagar Shopkeeper and Traders Union, said, “We will ensure social distancing. If a city as busy as Mumbai can allow shops to remain open, why is the same rule not applied in other areas also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-kalyan-traders-demand-shops-to-be-open-through-the-week/story-yn0wlz7sPzh8W0E92wHLgM.html

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet ministers accuse SAD, AAP of politicising hooch tragedy||Four Punjab cabinet ministers slammed the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) saying they were using the hooch tragedy to toy with the sentiments of the people with an eye on the assembly elections due in 2022. In a joint statement, cabinet ministers Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Sunder Sham Arora and Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the opposition was so busy playing to the gallery that the sufferings of the victims and their families seemed not to have affected them. Referring to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s statement seeking the state government’s dismissal, they said the game plan of the party had been exposed. “It is clear that following the pattern of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the Akalis, acting on the directives of their political master – the Bharatiya Janata Party – are trying to destabilise Punjab’s duly elected government,” the ministers said. They said the machinations of the Akalis will not succeed, and they would end up humiliating themselves. Drawing attention to the different hooch tragedies that had taken place under the SAD rule, and were taking place in many states even under BJP-ruled governments, the ministers challenged Sukhbir to come forward with details of the action taken. The ministers also ridiculed the Akalis for making baseless accusations about the complicity of some elected Congress leaders. “Wait for the inquiry to be over. The chief minister has already made it clear that no one involved in the tragedy will be spared,” said the ministers, adding that if the government had gone by mere hearsay and wild allegations, without any investigations (which incidentally are underway), both Sukhbir and his brother-in-law Bikram Singh Majithia would have been behind bars by now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-ministers-accuse-sad-aap-of-politicising-hooch-tragedy/story-qnReiDP4fFwb2bO0epNvGJ.html
07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Hooch tragedy: Govt finds itself on back foot, Capt’s critics, opposition smell blood||navneetsharma@hindustantimes.com Punjab’s worst hooch tragedy that claimed 113 lives in three border districts has stirred the placid political waters in the state. The Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government, which seemed to be in control after defeating a lackluster opposition in the Lok Sabha elections and the state assembly bypolls last year, finds itself on the back foot like never before. The hooch deaths have not only blemished the image of the state government, leaving its repeated claims of decisive action against illicit liquor in tatters, but also led to a full-blown showdown within the state party. The opposition - Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) - have smelled blood. Both parties, which have been grappling with unsavoury internal squabbles and desertions, are going all-out after the Congress government, directly targeting the chief minister as he holds the home, and excise and taxation portfolios. The AAP and SAD have ratcheted up their attacks and are also competing with each other, statement for statement and protest for protest, to get onto the political centre stage.Providing the opposition parties additional ammunition are the questions raised by Congress Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo who have publicly accused the government of “clear-cut failure” and “maladministration”. Though there have been rumblings of discontent within the government and the state unit in the past, the fierce joint offensive of the former presidents of Punjab Congress, who met the governor on Monday to demand impartial probes by the CBI and ED into the hooch deaths and illegal liquor trade, has the party leadership in the state worried. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar was the first to demand that Bajwa and Dullo, both known Amarinder-baiters, be shown the door for “brazen indiscipline”, claiming their actions were on the pattern of the revolt in the Congress-ruled Rajasthan. On Thursday, all members of the Amarinder cabinet, in a joint statement, also pressed for immediate expulsion of the two MPs for their “anti-party” and “anti-government” activities. Bajwa and Dullo, who were picked for Rajya Sabha in 2016 despite Amarinder’s strong reservations, have refused to back off so far. Professor Ashutosh, head of the political science department, Panjab University, said the hooch tragedy is bad news for the ruling dispensation as it has not just tainted the image of the state government but the opposition parties are also getting adrenalised. “There were also no voices of dissent after (former minister Navjot Singh) Sidhu’s marginalisation and Amarinder was being praised for his government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but this tragedy is a setback and is going to be a key issue in the state elections,” he said. Already, there are alarm bells ringing and the state government is in damage-control mode, responding to the dissenters and opposition parties with equal vehemence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooch-tragedy-govt-finds-itself-on-back-foot-capt-s-critics-opposition-smell-blood/story-MANm227OEAK5Z7u62IOK4J.html
07-08-2020||City||Don’t permit Ulhasnagar residents, mandals to immerse Ganpati idols in Kalyan creek: Traffic police to KDMC||The traffic police in Kalyan have requested the civic body to not permit the immersion of Ganpati idols from nearby Ulhasnagar in Kalyan creek. The request was made during a meeting between the traffic police and civic officials on Thursday in a bid to ensure less crowding in the city amid the Covid-19 outbreak as well as to manage the traffic better. Sukhdev Patil, senior traffic police inspector, Kalyan, said, “Each year, huge idols from Ulhasnagar are immersed in Kalyan creek, as there is no facility to immerse big idols in Ulhasnagar. However, this year, as the government is only allowing idols upto 4 feet, all the immersions can take place in Ulhasnagar itself. This will help us to man the traffic situation better in Kalyan.” Around 200 Ganpati idols from Ulhasnagar are brought to Kalyan for immersion. Mandal representatives and residents from Ulhasnagar take the Shahad bridge or the Waldhuni bridge to reach Kalyan. Both these bridges are the main connecters to reach to Kalyan and witness huge congestion, traffic officers from Kalyan said. “The state government directed against allowing any kind of procession in the city. So we will make sure that residents don’t cause crowding anywhere,” said Patil. “We are discussing the proposal made by the traffic police over restrictions on allowing idols from the neighbouring cities to Kalyan for immersions and a decision on the issue will be taken soon,” a civic official, who did not wish to be named, said. Meanwhile, the traffic department also appealed to the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) to ensure that the roads are repaired and also demanded civic officials to put up barricades and dividers wherever necessary to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. “Barricades and dividers are must for the free flow of traffic. From the past one year, we have been following up with the civic body to help us in putting them up, but it has been delayed,” said Patil. The civic official said that barricades can be provided only after the proposal gets approved by the general body. “Also, the roads which need dividers fall under the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and the traffic police will have to follow up with them,” the official said. The Maharashtra government made it mandatory for all mandals to take prior permission from the local authorities concerned before holding celebrations. The government also capped the maximum idol height at 4 feet as a part of the precautionary measures for celebrations amid the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-permit-ulhasnagar-residents-mandals-to-immerse-ganpati-idols-in-kalyan-creek-traffic-police-to-kdmc/story-yDqWwYtHMpsmvzk0BJ1BiP.html

To avoid this, giving them school essentials in time is important. Hence, books should be distributed from August 10,” reads the circular.Usually, students get notebooks after the BMC completes the tendering process, which often gets delayed by four to five months after the new academic year begins in June. This year, however, students will also receive other school essentials like bags, uniforms, stationery, etc, by October, said officials at the education department.“It’s a good thing that students will get these items on time. It will help them study in the current situation, wherein physical classes are not available,” said Prashant Redij of the Mumbai Principals’ Association.In June, the civic body also distributed textbooks to students, which were delivered as part of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan initiative, to ensure that those without internet access can have access to study material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fearing-dropouts-bmc-to-provides-civic-school-students-with-free-notebooks/story-a38xBc3lrSQmrwko0wlGNP.html

Later the same evening, NMMC issued an order directing them to shut down.“Malls, multiplexes, theatres, food courts, restaurants and restaurants in malls will not have permission to operate in Navi Mumbai. The decision has been taken after taking into account the Covid pandemic in the city, and the measures being taken to contain it. The situation at present is not conducive for the start of the malls,” said municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar.Explaining the reason for the decision, Sanjay Kakde, additional commissioner, NMMC, said, “The malls and restaurants have not opened in Thane and Kalyan. We felt that since these cities are close to Navi Mumbai, there is a strong possibility of the residents coming over to Navi Mumbai malls. Such a scenario will lead to additional crowding in the malls and there could be social distancing issues as well. Under such circumstances, it has been decided to shut the malls for now, to prevent increased arrivals in the city and also crowding at the malls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/malls-to-remain-shut-in-navi-mumbai/story-IsFoA5ZKarDq8jsyfj3LkL.html
07-08-2020||Mumbai||AAI redesigns air traffic routes at CSMIA||Taking cognisance of demands from the aviation industry, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has redesigned air traffic routes for arrivals and departures at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). These newly redesigned air traffic control (ATC) routes, which will come into effect from September 10, are not only intended to standardise procedures and reduce the workload of pilots and ATC but also allow aircraft to burn less fuel that could lead to cheaper airfare. The routes will be redesigned from 100 nautical miles (Nm) after take-off, and 100Nm before landing. The Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) supplement (number: 84/2020) issued by AAI has been made public on the authority’s website.“This is the ideal time to implement redesigned procedures as air traffic is less due to Covid-19 related restrictions. It will allow senior air traffic controllers (ATCos) and pilots to test and practice operating/flying on these routes without much complexity,” said a senior air traffic controller.Redesigning air traffic routes in India was first adopted for the Mumbai airport in 2006. At the time, a technology to redesign navigation- based routes was being introduced internationally. In view of the growing air traffic at the Mumbai airport - also among the busiest - it was the first to be introduced in India at CSMAI.“Once these redesigned routes come into effect, the lateral profile of aircraft will remain the same as the older ones. But the altitude and speed restrictions of the aircraft will not only facilitate a smooth, orderly and efficient flow of air traffic but also enhance the capacity of airspace and help ATCos to maintain optimum spacing in between two arrivals [arriving aircraft],” said a Delhi-based ATC officer, requesting anonymity.This implies that more aircraft will be able to land and take off in less time, thereby reducing the probability of holding an aircraft in the air before landing – a common scenario at Mumbai airport on regular days.“When sudden disruptions occur at Mumbai airport due to bird hit or bad weather, the ATCos on duty have to manage the delay in take-offs and landing tactically, by asking the pilot to orbit in long patterns. But the new holding patterns designed in new routes will allow flights to hold in race-track patterns, which is a very comfortable and orderly method of absorbing delays,” said a senior AAI official.After the promulgation of new routes, airlines will have to include the redesigned routes in the flight management system’s database of all the aircraft. Similarly, Mumbai ATC will have to replace the old routes with new ones in the ATC automation system.“The pilots, flight planning, and ATC officers will have to undergo a familiarisation and training program before the new routes get implemented. That is why the procedures [62-page AIP document] are published around 45 days prior to the implementation,” explained the AAI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aai-redesigns-air-traffic-routes-at-csmia/story-irsLmPLfRRDWpT34ae5HFJ.html

07-08-2020||Mumbai||Flood forecasting system didn’t help||The city’s flood forecasting system was unable to assist the civic body during the exceptionally heavy rain on Wednesday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said. Inaugurated on June 12, the integrated flood warning system for Mumbai (iFLOWS-Mumbai), the second for any urban city (after Chennai) in the country so far, was developed to provide possible extent of flooding in Mumbai three days prior to heavy rain events and warnings to areas susceptible to flooding across all 24 wards 12 hours in advance. The system was launched on a trial basis this monsoon and based on its success, it was to be made public next year. “The system is not fully functional and not handed over to BMC yet. Although it is being used on an experimental basis, it did not provide any alerts to us about possible areas to be flooded 12 hours in advance. We were only aware about the extremely heavy rain event three days prior. No bulletin was issued either on Tuesday or Wednesday,” said BMC’s disaster management chief officer Mahesh Narvekar, adding Wednesday’s rainfall and unprecedented wind speed was the most severe weather event witnessed in south Mumbai over the past two decades.When the July 2005 deluge struck Mumbai, Santacruz had recorded 944.2mm rain over 24 hours, but the Colaba weather station, 27km away, had recorded only 73mm. “There was no prior intimation of extremely high wind speed that caused the tree fall and infra damage,” said Narvekar. Since its launch, IMD made public the flood warning bulletin on July 3, 14 and 15 that issued warnings for 656 spots across 24 wards in the city, dividing them into categories ranging from low probability (less than 1-ft depth), moderate (1-2ft depth), high (2-3ft depth) and very high (over 3-ft depth). “These warnings for Wednesday could have helped direct our manpower to locations faster. However, there is a difference in issuing the forecast and the ground reality. In all, over 200 tree fall incidents were reported across south Mumbai, and major flooding was reported from 25 spots that took seven hours for the water to recede,” said Narvekar. The system was jointly conceived by various departments of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) and BMC. “I was recently informed about some technical issues at our observatories due to the Covid-19 pandemic. At a couple of observatories, people were unable to go and repair them. However, we will cross-check what happened,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, MoES. IMD director-general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said, “Apart from an accurate forecast for all three days, wind warning for the port and fishermen identified maximum wind speed at 70-80kmph. The iFLOWS system is being studied on an experimental basis, and we will check if there were any technical problems.” Additional municipal commissioner P Velarasu said the accuracy of actionable advanced warnings using the system need to be validated with ward units. “There needs to be a verification mechanism. On the day forecasts were issued, broad trends for three to six hours have been accurate, but exact detailing and fine-tuning are not available yet. IMD is giving an area-specific forecast, but we have spot-specific issues. We need to check how the ward-wise forecast can be narrowed down for specific areas,” he said. A senior BMC official said that on Friday they are holding a meeting with the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), one of the MoES bodies, for further deliberations about the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/flood-forecasting-system-didn-t-help/story-mJanM39kxJPOvFma6TeqUM.html

07-08-2020||Education||Maharashtra government ties up with Google to start virtual classes for over 22 million students||Maharashtra government on Thursday tied up with Google to provide online education to students in the state. Students and teachers will get access to Google Classroom and G Suite for Education that will provide solutions to support remote learning.The tools allow interactive sessions, which will allow teachers to explain lessons, and students can also ask their doubts while sitting at home. Homework can be uploaded, and teachers can check them online, said state officials.The project was launched by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday, and will cover over 1.09 lakh government, private, aided, and unaided schools, and benefit over 22.03 million students.The move is significant, considering the shutdown of schools due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The new academic year of schools in the state should have started on June 15.Last month, the state government allowed students from Class 1 to 8 to attend online classes so that they can start their academic year while at home. However, initiating online classes posed a problem, officials said.“Maharashtra is the first state in the country that is launching such a project. Coronavirus has forced us to adopt the changes that were supposed to come in the future,” Thackeray said while launching the project online.“Google Classroom and G Suite, which will be available free of cost, are the tools that allow the education institutes to conduct interactive sessions. Around 250 participants can attend it at a time. Teachers can make their audio or video presentations; students can clear their doubts, and upload homework and assignments. Even parents can submit their complaints or suggestions through the system,” said Dinkar Patil, director, Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT).“We are beginning with the training of the teachers. As many as 40,000 teachers will be the master trainers for the remaining 2 lakh teachers. Once, training is completed, students will be asked to register their mobile numbers, and will get notifications with details of each session,” Patil added.School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “We have got responses from 1.34 lakh teachers within 48 hours after floating an invitation link for Google Classroom training. The process of teacher training is going to be started on August 7. We are turning the crisis into an opportunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-ties-up-with-google-to-start-virtual-classes-for-over-22-million-students/story-6bmLKsGSbRJr72i0kOTntJ.html

Dashrath Ghadigaonkar, 63, was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kalyan since July 8 after being tested positive for the virus. He was later shifted to another private hospital in Mulund. Party leaders said the death of their senior leader comes as a major loss, as Ghadigaonkar had managed to win the Ashok Nagar ward in Kalyan (East) for the first time for Shiv Sena in the 2015 civic polls. “It was for the first time that someone from the Sena won that ward. He was a dedicated party worker and worked calmly towards issues. His demise is a major loss for us. He was a diabetic and underwent treatment for 28 days. We were all waiting for his recovery,” said Rajendra Devlekar, former mayor of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation and Ghadigaonkar’s colleague.

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||SAD-BJP delegation meets guv, seeks dismissal of Cong govt||A joint delegation of SAD and BJP on Thursday urged Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore to dismiss the Amarinder Singh-led government in the state over the hooch tragedy that has claimed 113 lives so far.It also sought a probe by a sitting judge of the high court or the CBI into the hooch tragedy and demanded an inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate into the alleged “wealth” acquired by some Congressmen from the “illicit liquor trade”.The delegation urged the governor to direct confiscation of properties of all those involved in the illicit liquor trade, besides stopping “smuggling of denatured spirit and extra neutral alcohol (ENA) from distilleries”.It also demanded that murder cases be registered against all those named by the families of the victims.While handing over a memorandum to the governor, the delegation said the hooch tragedy was the direct result of alleged “state patronage”.“The liquor mafia has been given full liberty by the Congress government in the state and because of which more than 100 persons have died,” SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged.“The chief minister has the excise and home portfolios and now you cannot run away,” he said.The delegation said the supply of spurious liquor had happened due to the alleged “nexus established between Congress leaders, police and excise officials”.Sukhbir claimed that no action was taken after two illegal distilleries-cum-bottling plants were unearthed at Rajpura and Khanna sometime back.He alleged that attempts were being made to divert attention from the role of distilleries in the hooch tragedy by conducting raids against bootleggers making country liquor despite knowing that it was denatured spirit procured from distilleries which was behind the deaths.The SAD chief claimed that the “illicit liquor trade” has already caused a loss of Rs 5,600 crore to the state treasury.“We have sought dismissal of the state government. A CBI probe should also be ordered into the hooch tragedy,” BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia said.Kamaljit Kaur, a family member of a victim of hooch tragedy, accompanied the delegation.

07-08-2020||Mumbai||SoBo received more rain on Wednesday than ’05 deluge||South Mumbai on Wednesday received more rain than during the July 26, 2005 deluge, with a maximum wind speed of 101kmph making the situation “hurricane-like” and “unprecedented”, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The city was marooned and more than 1,000 people died in the 2005 monsoon mayhem. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Colaba had recorded 73mm of rain in 24 hours during the 2005 deluge, compared to 944mm in Santacruz. Compared to this, Colaba recorded 331mm rain and Santacruz recorded 162mm in 24 hours between Wednesday and Thursday morning. The civic body said the current capacity of drains is good enough for average or above average rain, but can’t handle an extreme situation like that on Wednesday. BMC said it will explore the possibility of having a holding pond or underground water tunnel to contain the floodwater in south Mumbai. On Wednesday, upscale localities of south Mumbai such as Marine Drive, Chowpatty, Grant Road, Mumbai Central and Marine Lines witnessed heavy waterlogging. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had to even use boats to rescue passengers stuck at Masjid Bunder Railway station, which was completely under water. According to the IMD’s three-hourly bulletin, between 8.30am and 11.30am on Wednesday, Colaba recorded 51mm of rain, which increased to 120mm by 2.30pm, 229mm by 5.30pm, 293mm by 8.30pm, 328mm by 11.30pm and 331mm by 8.30am on Thursday morning, indicating 242mm of rain in a period of nine hours between 11.30am and 8.30pm on Wednesday in Colaba. In a statement issued on Thursday, IMD stated: “Mumbai received widespread rainfall with scattered heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places. Colaba reported the highest rainfall of 331.8mm in 24 hours, breaking its earlier record of August. This is also the second highest all-time record over Colaba after 575.6mm (July 5, 1974).” On the other hand, Santacruz observatory of IMD recorded 32mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 11.30am on Wednesday, followed by 42mm by 2.30pm, 65mm by 5.30pm, 103mm by 8.30pm, 138mm by 11.30pm and 162mm by 8.30am on Thursday. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Every area has different capacity and in south Mumbai, the drains have capacity to hold 50-60mm of rain in a period of 60 minutes, which is suitable for average or above average rainfall. What we witnessed on Wednesday was an extreme situation considering our drains in areas like chowpatty are well-maintained, but did not work owing to the heavy rain.” “Our system can’t cope with an extreme situation like that of Wednesday, and we definitely need to re-look at our strategy. We have to undertake augmentation of our facilities by correlating with the current rain pattern, and this is a process that will take five-10 years. There are no short-term measures for stormwater drainage, apart from increasing dewatering pumps post accumulation of water, which we have already done. We have initiated a process to have the capacity to handle around 90mm of rainfall per hour. Having underground water tunnels under playgrounds in south Mumbai is one of the solutions.” BMC had initiated a plan for holding ponds in the form of underground water tunnels to divert the excess rainwater for a temporary period, from where they can be drained out further into the sea or put in use by transferring rainwater to the treatment plants of BMC. Experts claimed that waterlogging, even after projects such as the ₹4,000-crore Brimstowad launched post 2005 being completed, hinted that the drains were not properly cleaned. Brimstowad project includes rehabilitation and augmentation of underground drains in the city from handling 25mm of rainfall per hour to 50mm of rainfall per hour, widening and deepening of nullahs, construction of access road along the nullah and construction of stormwater pumping stations. BMC’s data stated that 36 of the total 58 projects planned under Brimstowad have been completed, which include 19 of the 21 projects planned for south Mumbai. Nikhil Desai, advanced locality management (ALM) from Matunga, said, “The execution of the Brimstowad project is poor, even though projects for south Mumbai may have been completed. The inefficiency of BMC is clearly out, considering it seems that owing to Covid-19 the cleaning of drains was not done properly which led to waterlogging at newer spots. I have never heard of waterlogging outside chowpatty or Sir JJ Hospital.” BMC claimed there were no instances of drains being choked. Velrasu said, “There were no incidents of water accumulation owing to choked drains. The intensity of rainfall was very high due to which there was a burden on the system. We had used around 175 pumps. This is a global challenge, and we are somewhat on the job to find long-term solutions.” Meanwhile, BJP on Thursday demanded BMC compensate citizens whose houses were damaged, as people were already under financial stress due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sobo-s-rain-of-terror-on-wednesday-worse-than-05/story-A0thwjlFB1a3vJyB0mgGwO.html
07-08-2020||Mumbai||16 fishermen saved; trawler damaged||The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) rescued 16 people after their fishing boat Dev Sandesh got caught in rough seas due to high wind speed, around 70kms off Arnala coast on Thursday. Meanwhile, a fishing trawler got lost in the sea after it was damaged by a stone barrier near the coast during the torrential downpour.According to an ICG official, as the fishing boat got caught in very rough sea conditions, the fishermen sent alert messages to Yellow Gate police station on August 4 evening. The message was immediately conveyed to coast guard’s Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC), Mumbai. MRCC Mumbai ascertained the exact location of the distressed fishing boat, activated the international safety net and also relayed messages to all the ships in the vicinity, specially transiting ships, to render assistance to the boat in distress, said commandant RK Singh, spokesperson of ICG.An Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) Greatship Asmi was located in the vicinity and was diverted for the rescue operation, added Singh.However, due to worsening weather conditions, OSV Greatship Asmi was directed to keep a strict vigil. ICG then coordinated with another offshore support vessel Colonel SP Wahi and sent it to pick up the fishermen from the trapped boat.After around six hours of efforts, all the 16 people were rescued safely. “They are heading towards the coast and will reach Mumbai soon,” said Singh.In the other incident, the trawler Prajakta, owned by Moreshwar Vishnu Chowdhary, was heading back from its fishing trip on August 4 after getting the weather alert when the incident took place. The trawler’s captain Jitesh Chowdhary decided to drop the anchor late on August 4 while heading towards Satpati coast because of choppy water and low visibility. However, the anchor broke loose and the trawler hit a stone barrier. All 15 fishermen on board the boat got down and started moving fishing equipment with the help of some locals. During high tide early on August 5, the trawler along with the equipment and the catch entered the sea and got lost. “I bought the trawler under the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) scheme and took ₹17 lakh loan from a cooperative bank. I am yet to repay the loan but I lost the trawler to the sea…However, I am happy that the 15 crew are safe, said Chowdhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/16-fishermen-saved-trawler-damaged/story-IEwKqzdJmwDj52nACnwrXJ.html
07-08-2020||Mumbai||Heavy rain lashes western Maharashtra; citizens evacuated||Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts in western Maharashtra relived the memories of last year’s ravaging floods, as heavy rains lashed most parts of the state over the past two days. The state government has started evacuation of families from low-lying areas and deployed 16 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams in the affected districts.Sangli has received more than 100mm rainfall each day over the past two days which led to swelling of Panchganga and Krishna rivers. Palghar and Raigad received 148mm and 106mm rainfall with damages to structures and electricity infrastructure. Meanwhile, Kodavali and Kundalika rivers in Ratnagiri have crossed warning levels and nearby districts have been put on high alert.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took stock of the situation on Thursday morning and directed administrations to relocate citizens from submerged areas. He also asked district authorities to ensure that people do not face any hardships. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the state has issued a directive to local administrations of the affected districts to be on alert. The government has deployed 16 teams of NDRF, including five in Mumbai, four in Kolhapur, two in Sangli and one each in Satara, Thane, Palghar, Nagpur, Raigad. District authorities have relocated more than 4,500 people from these districts in the past two days, of them 4,413 are from 23 villages in Kolhapur alone. The authorities have also been directed to begin spot assessment of losses to structures, houses and livestock to facilitate speedy compensation to citizens.Prasad Sankpal, district disaster management officer, Kolhapur, said the water level in Panchganga river has already crossed the danger mark and added they have already started evacuating villagers. “The water level has crossed the danger level of 43 foot. We started evacuation after the warning level of 39 ft was crossed yesterday. We have evacuated 400 citizens from 100 families from Ajara, while villagers from Chikhali and Ambewadi shifted to safer places on their own. Four teams of NDRF have been deployed for rescue and relief operations besides our own rescue teams of 800 volunteers with 51 boats, which were acquired last year after the floods,” he said.According to officials from relief and rehabilitation department, the Indian Air Force has been asked to be on standby to bring in additional NDRF teams from other states if required. “All the teams stationed in the state have been deployed. In case we need additional force, we will have to fetch them from other states,” the official said.Meanwhile, the water stock in the dams in Maharashtra has reached 44.8% against last year’s 52.29% on the corresponding day. Konkan, Pune and Nashik divisions have reported a deficit in rain as compared to last year. Water stock in drought-prone Aurangabad division is at 41.21% as opposed to 11.91% on the same day last year. The state has so far received 60.2% or 604.1mm rainfall against its average rainfall of 1,004.2 mm between June and September. Last year, Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara and other parts of the state were flooded in August which had led to massive damage to crops and houses. Around 6.45 lakh people had to be evacuated and around 3,450 houses were destroyed.Railway tunnel collapsesDue to heavy rainfall, the wall of a railway tunnel collapsed on railway tracks between Madure and Pernem railway stations falling under Konkan Railway, on Thursday.Due to the collapse, five outstation trains were diverted via Pune-Miraj and Londa railway stations.Outstation trains that were diverted include Ernakulam-Hazrat Nizamuddin Special, Thiruvananthapuram-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), New Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram special, Hazrat Nizamuddin-Ernakulam special, and LTT-Thiruvananthapuram special.(With inputs from Aroosa Ahmed)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/heavy-rain-lashes-western-maharashtra-citizens-evacuated/story-ONZT76ca5hlscHSOjkPzUO.html

Parshotam Singh Phaguwala led the activists who stated in a written appeal to jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh that Dhindsa, who is heading the management of the gurdwara, was responsible for the non-compliance with an edict that the highest Sikh temporal seat had issued in 2009. This edict directed the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to get the design of this controversial structure modified. However, its management never made mandatory alteration except for closing the ‘Har ki Paudi’. Seeking intervention of Akal Takht, the activists also alleged that Dhindsa was controlling the whole property attached with this gurdwara and using it for his political ends. They said the prevalence of the structure hurts Sikh sentiments, so Dhindsa should be removed from all his positions and the gurdwara should be handed over to the SGPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/row-over-golden-temple-replica-sikh-activists-urge-akal-takht-to-summon-dhindsa/story-eHGj6sQjQoeNl8shOz6ipO.html

Kumar got electrocuted at 3.45pm and was rushed to Bombay Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.The exceptionally heavy rain of 331.2mm rain in 24 hours, accompanied by chaotic winds ranging from 70-80kmph, between Wednesday and Thursday not only broke the record for this season, but was the highest monsoon rain record for south Mumbai in 46 years and second-highest all-time rain record during monsoon, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. The highest all-time record was on July 5, 1974 with 575.6 mm rain in 24 hours. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 331.2 mm (exceptionally heavy) rain between 8.30am Wednesday and 8.30am Thursday. This was also the all-time high one-day rain in August.

It starts, then peaks and stabilises. There is an increase in cases, but there is no data that suggests that the situation has gone out of hand. While we are focused on containing the spread with the standard operating procedures that have been laid out, the case fatality rate is not shooting up. Our efforts are to keep that in control.

According to the Mumbai Police wall collapses were reported at nine locations while there were 339 instances of trees being uprooted in the past 24 hours. Later on Wednesday, a part of the retaining wall of the ridge road on NS Patkar Marg collapsed, leading to traffic congestion as both sides of the road were closed, said Pravin Padwal additional commissioner of police (traffic), adding, “Civic authorities are there and restoration work is underway.” Another landslide took place on the western express highway (WEH) near Kandivli on Wednesday night. “This is the second time that a landslide has occurred at the same location within 48 hours, due to which traffic was affected on WEH,” Padwal added more.‘BMC knew about vulnerability of Kandivli landslide site’The Geological Survey of India (GSI) said that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had prior information about the threat of a landslide at the site in Kandivli along the WEH. Though the incident took place during early hours of Tuesday when there was less vehicular movement, GSI scientists said BMC was told that the site was among 249 ‘vulnerable’ locations in the 2018 report tilted Identification of Vulnerable Inhabited Hill Slopes in Mumbai. The work for the report was undertaken at the request of BMC in 2017. “It is a 250-metre-long stretch of the cut slope with 2m-5m space between the slope and the main road. The particular location was identified as a low to moderately vulnerable (Class-IV) area and precautionary and protection measures were suggested,” said Dr Saibal Ghosh, director (Geology), GHRM Centre, GSI. The report had highlighted that the expressway was the most-affected area at risk and slope protection and had suggested that no further tree cutting or hill tampering are carried out. It had also suggested suitably designed retaining walls, proper drainage for surface water, and regular cutting of tree roots and removal of small trees.A senior official from BMC’s R-South ward said all measures had been undertaken except construction of the retaining wall. He, however, added that immediate efforts would be taken to address the concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wall-collapses-landslide-hit-traffic/story-EQJDijtbdcrbBf5WCuzB4I.html

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Sero survey to determine virus exposure to begin next week in Haryana||For measuring the proportion of population exposed to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including the asymptomatic individuals, the Haryana health department will begin a comprehensive statewide sero survey from next week. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said the survey recommended by the ICMR will begin from Panchkula and Ambala. He said the department plans to conduct 21,120 immunoglobulin enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (IgG- ELISA) tests across 22 districts in collaboration with PGIMER, Chandigarh. “About 960 blood-based ELISA tests per district have been planned by the health department. Stratified multistage random sampling will be done and the samples will be divided into rural and urban clusters,” the ACS said. Health officials said immunoglobulin antibodies generally start appearing after two weeks of onset of infection and last for several months. “The test can be performed to indicate episode of coronavirus infection in the past. Detection of IgG antibodies would help us to understand the proportion of population exposed to the viral infection, including asymptomatic individuals,” the ACS said. Officials said depending upon the findings of sero-prevalence of infection, public health interventions will be planned and implemented for the prevention and control of the disease by the policy makers. The information obtained from survey will also help the districts to understand the proportion of population exposed to Covid-19 infection. The ACS said that state government would seek the co-operation of public in conducting the sero survey and confidentiality will be maintained. “We would want to know how many people have already suffered from this virus. A lot of people get infected, but do not show any symptom like fever, cough and cold. In many cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go unnoticed. The immunoglobulin ELISA blood tests can tell us if they got this infection in the recent past,” Arora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sero-survey-to-determine-virus-exposure-to-begin-next-week-in-haryana/story-S7ugBO1Y5XOhREdJ1GodmO.html

Anguished HC pulls up Delhi govt, civic body||A towering banyan tree, believed to be at least 300 years old, stands hemmed in by concrete and cement on Nai Sadak, Chandni Chowk, with metal rods from a neighbouring under-construction building tearing through its branches and the dug-up ground laying exposed its roots. Although its canopy has become sparse, from the abuse it was made to endure over the years, Chandni Chowk’s majestic banyan continues to stand tall. On Thursday, it found an unlikely advocate and ally in the Delhi high court.The court minced no words in pulling up the authorities for the damage caused to the “heritage” tree and directed the Delhi government and North Delhi Municipal Corporation to take steps for its “immediate restoration”. Justice Najmi Waziri, while hearing a plea regarding illegal construction in Chandni Chowk filed by area resident Nitin Gupta, was astonished by the condition of the tree which had its aerial roots chopped and its trunk hemmed in by concrete. Expressing his anguish and displeasure, Wazri said photographs show the “horrific” condition of the “grand old tree, which has seen the unfolding of the city”. “How can you do this to a 300-year-old tree? It has existed even before the Britishers could even think of coming to India. It is a part of the heritage of this city. How can you damage it in this manner?” Wazri said. He then went on to issue a slew of directions, including action against erring officials and the builder. Even though the North Delhi Municipal Corporation does not have records showing the exact age of the banyan, long-time residents, recalling stories passed on by their forefathers, estimate that the tree was planted around the 17th century. Residents say the neighbourhood, ‘Kothi Barwali (the house around the Banyan tree)’, got its name after the banyan. Kushmakar Rastogi, a resident who filed an application impleading to save the banyan, said the tree used to be surrounded by houses on three sides. “This property belonged to one Satyanarayan Gurwali, who was believed to be the richest man in the area about 300 years ago. His family planted this tree. There used to be melas under the tree and everyone from the neighbourhood used to gather around,” Rastogi said. Environmentalist Pradip Krishen said many “heritage” trees in Old Delhi are suffering a similar fate. “The problem is that unless we know where these trees are located, how can the government or the courts direct its restoration? We need a detailed survey to know the location of such trees and an elaborate plan to restore them,” Krishen said. On the last date of hearing, July 14, advocate RK Kapoor, appearing for Gupta, brought to the court’s notice the dereliction of the tree. The court then sought a status report from the authorities, including the tree officer and the Delhi government. On Thursday, during the impleadment hearing, Rastogi said that even he was aggrieved by the illegal construction. The plea also said Rastogi had written to the conservator of forests against the pruning of the banyan and taking note of this, the conservator had slapped the builder with a fine of ₹8,000. Appearing for the Delhi government, standing counsel (civil) Ramesh Singh and additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan sought some time to file the status report. The court said strict action should be taken against the officers who in connivance with the builder have allowed the unauthorised construction to take place. The court later asked the authorities to work on “war footing” to restore the tree. It asked the authorities to file a status report and also take criminal action, if required, against the erring persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-can-you-do-this-to-a-300-year-old-tree-anguished-hc-pulls-up-delhi-govt-civic-body/story-9a9ZAV3wMBrNn4crMJA3EN.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt sends fresh proposal to L-G to open hotels, weekly markets, gyms||The Delhi government on Thursday sent a fresh proposal to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, seeking his permission to allow hotels, gymnasiums, and weekly markets to reopen in the national capital.The fresh proposal sent by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said such economic activities should be allowed to resume in Delhi since the Covid-19 situation had improved and the number of cases was coming down.“The L-G is aware that the situation in Delhi is fast improving and economic activities need to be opened up so that those people who have been suffering for the last four months due to imposition of the lockdown, can resume their jobs and business, albeit with restrictions,” read the proposal sent to the L-G.The new proposal was sent almost a week after the L-G rejected a similar suggestion of the Delhi government to open hotels and weekly markets. In Thursday’s proposal, the government included its request to open gyms and yoga centres also. Delhi on Thursday recorded 1,299 new cases of Covid-19, a sharp drop from the middle of June, when more than 2,000 new cases were being added regularly. Daily new cases hit a high of 3,947 on June 23.Gahlot said the people of Delhi are conscious of the risk of Corona and cited examples of UP and Karnataka, which have allowed these services to resume despite a surge in Covid cases.“When the central government is allowing some sectors to be opened in those states, which have become hots pots of Corona, and at the same time Centre is stopping Delhi from opening these sectors, when Delhi, through its hard work and discipline, has been able to control Corona so well, then Delhiites are asking ‘why are we being made to suffer? Why is our livelihood under attack?’,” Gahlot wrote.The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter till this report was filed. The minister wrote that hotels contributed to 8% of the state’s GDP, while weekly markets provide employment to 5 lakh poor families.He wrote, “Since the time the L-G rejected our recommendation (to open up these sectors) last week, there has been a huge public uproar. The entire Delhi now wants to work towards economic recovery. Delhi should not be stopped. Delhi showed the way to the country to tackle Corona. Delhi will now show the way for economic recovery also.”“Therefore, I would urge that considering the improved Corona situation and the sentiments of Delhiites, we should open up these sectors. It has been a week now when our recommendation was rejected by the LG. We may now urge the L-G to reconsider his decision. MHA has also permitted the opening of yoga centres and gyms in its latest guidelines. These activities should be permitted in Delhi. However, the SOPs issued by the Government of India should be followed,” Gahlot wrote.On July 30, Delhi had decided to allow hotels, hospitality services, street hawkers to operate and do away with the night curfew hours between 10pm and 5am under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan. The government intended to allow weekly bazaars to operate for a week on a trial basis to check if social distancing norms are adhered to. A day later, Baijal rejected the decision,saying the Covid-19 situation continued to be “fragile” in Delhi and the threat is still “far from over”. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah, urging him to allow hotels and weekly markets to reopen and issue directions to the L-G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-sends-fresh-proposal-to-l-g-to-open-hotels-weekly-markets-gyms/story-ZQbAtL6pxoGNOSwp4wcUQI.html

This last happened only a day before on Wednesday with 143 cases, reflecting no let-up in the spread of infection.Mohali, with 68 fresh cases, also saw the steepest surge within 24 hours, which took the tally to 1,119. This is also the highest number of Covid cases any of the tricity towns have recorded till now. Panchkula confirmed 65 cases on July 21, while Chandigarh’s highest count remains 64.Since the very first case on March 18, the tricity’s Covid count has soared to 3,262 in four months, with 1,363 cases still active (42%). As many as 40 people have succumbed to the virus.MOST MOHALI CASES FROM KHARARAmong the 68 new cases in Mohali district, 25 are from Kharar sub-division, 21 from Dera Bassi and 22 from Mohali city.

Under the plan, besides Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur, the Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Chandigarh University, Gharuan, has been started with 200 beds for asymptomatic patients. “Another 800 beds can be pressed into use if needed. Another CCC will be set up in Dera Bassi. Private hospitals have been put on alert and told to reserve more beds for isolation cases,” he said, adding that a dedicated facility had been set up at the Mohali civil hospital for Covid-positive pregnant women. Besides the infrastructure upgrade, testing capacity has been enhanced. Antigen testing has been commenced, allowing availability of test results within 30 minutes. “Our target is to test at least 100 contacts of positive patients in a day to check the spread of virus,” the DC said. Another TrueNAT machine for detecting of coronavirus has been installed at Dera Bassi. Besides this, a dedicated call centre will soon be started to provide quick medical consultancy to patients opting for home isolation. “Doctors from the centre will remain in touch with the patients. Video calling facility may also be extended to patients,” Dayalan added.

07-08-2020||Delhi||With limited public transit, traffic rises in unlocked Delhi||With the Metro still shut and other modes of public transportation plying only with restrictions on the number of passengers, Delhi’s roads have seen a surge in vehicular volume, leading to incessant traffic snarls, shows an HT analysis. This is happening even as people are not moving around as much as they were before the lockdown was imposed, according to data from Google’s community mobility trends. Experts say increased use of private vehicles in the absence of public transport explains the increased vehicle traffic.Delhi traffic police control room records show that from May 20 — when public transport and public movement resumed in the city after restrictions were eased — to August 5, at least 15 arterial stretches have seen an increase in vehicular traffic. Daily complaints of traffic jams have also seen a considerable spike, even during non-peak hours, senior officials said. Traffic estimates show that in the busiest stretches of the city, including ITO junction, Ashram intersection, Britannia Chowk, Mukarba Chowk, Delhi-Noida Direct Flyway and Dhaula Kuan crossing, traffic volume during peak rush hours has increased by nearly 15-17%, compared to pre-lockdown period. The police observed that this increase was observed primarily around commercial hubs and office complexes. For instance, in ITO intersection, the busiest commercial hub in the city, traffic volume after May 20 has increased from a daily average of 350,000 vehicles to 525,000 during peak morning and evening rush hours.Connaught Place, Rajouri Garden, Uttam Nagar, Kashmere Gate, South Extension, Hauz Khas and Dwarka Link Road have all seen a significant increase in snarls.“Especially with the Metro still not operational, the streets have seen an increased load. The number of buses is limited, and there are also restrictions on the number of passengers that can enter one, so anyone who owns a private vehicle now prefers to use it,” a senior traffic official said. Commuters too complain of serpentine vehicle-queues on roads and crawling traffic. Sumukhi Suresh, an IT professional who works in Noida, said that earlier she used to take the Metro to work, which took her 50 minutes from Dwarka Sector 10, but she is now forced to drive, and it now takes her nearly 1.5 hours to get to work these days. “I leave home at 8.30am and I still get a long jam on the Dwarka flyover. After the opening of the Pink Line, traffic on this stretch had reduced considerably, but now things have gone back to how it was. In fact, it has become worse now,” Suresh said.However, vehicular volume around shopping complexes and recreational spots had decreased, traffic police estimates show. People in Delhi are still not travelling as much as they used to before the nationwide lockdown was imposed from March 25, but overall mobility has been gradually increasing over time, according to data from Google’s community mobility trends. The tool tracks the number and length of visits people make to certain kinds of places compared to a baseline – in this case, a five-week period between 3 January and 6 February this year.After the lockdown was announced on 25 March, Delhi saw close to 80% drop in people’s mobility to retail and recreational places, parks, supermarkets, pharmacies and workplaces. Public transit, which includes places such as bus and train stations, saw the highest drop in people’s mobility in a week after the lockdown was announced, as much as 88%.This, however, has been gradually changing with the city-state easing the lockdown measures over time. For example, on 1st April there was a 73% drop in visits to supermarkets and pharmacies compared to the baseline, but the drop was 64% on 1st May, 27% on 1st June, 26% on 1st July and 20% on 1st August. Similarly, as people started travelling around, the drop in visits to public transits hubs changed from 87% on 1st April to 52% on 1st August.As Metro services continue to remain suspended, visits to travel hubs cannot be expected to be as high as the pre-lockdown period. Also, schools and many offices have still not resumed functioning, which in itself reduces vehicular traffic movement in the city. As on 1st August, Google’s community mobility data showed 44% drop in visits to workplaces compared to the baseline. The drop in visits to workplaces was more than 80% during the peak lockdown period.Transport experts said this increased dependence on private vehicles is likely to continue for at least another year. A survey released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in May had shown that the use of private vehicles is expected to increase and the ridership of Delhi Metro and public buses will reduce in the coming months.“The government will be facing the challenge of restoring commuters’ faith in public transport modes. Even after the metro is opened for people, a person who owns a car will prefer using travelling in the safe confines of their own vehicle, instead of travelling in the metro with hundreds of people where the chances of catching the coronavirus infection is more,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-limited-public-transit-traffic-rises-in-unlocked-capital/story-9MwiYmpePj6oKNwamOCsUJ.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Structural audit for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s official house||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s official residence at 6 Flagstaff Road in north Delhi’s Civil Lines is being assessed for its structural safety, senior officials in the government said on Thursday. The structural safety audit was commissioned after portions of Kejriwal’s official residence saw repeated damage, ranging from a ceiling collapse to a wall crumbling down.“Over the past two weeks, especially after the heavy rainfall the city witnessed in July, a lot of issues have emerged in the CM’s residence. Recently, the ceiling of the CM’s main office chamber, where he used to conduct public hearings, collapsed. Luckily, no one was injured because the chamber has not been used since the pandemic struck Delhi,” said a staff member deployed at the CM’s residence. The Public Works Department (PWD) has now been tasked with making the buildings within the CM’s residence structurally sound. However, while civil engineers worked on refurbishing the collapsed ceiling of Kejriwal’s chamber, the ceiling of its adjoining toilet, which was used by visitors also collapsed, an official said. Another PWD official said the building where Kejriwal lives is nearly 80 years old.“Workers were repairing the toilet’s ceiling after the collapse when a wall of the toilet also started to crumble,” he said. “CM Kejriwal moved into this house in March 2015 and since then, there has been some structural problem or the other. So, it was decided that a complete structural safety audit of the entire residence would be conducted. Based on the findings of the audit, the future course of action will be decided. The actions could be many ranging from a complete renovation to targeted repair works,” the official said.The CM’s office did not give any official statement on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/structural-audit-for-kejriwal-s-official-house/story-f12tZd8ZyFsvQr2Kgi3WSK.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Why Delhi woke up to a clear, blue sky||It took a rare confluence of five factors -- strong easterly winds, rain the previous day, low dust and emissions, a high ventilation coefficient, and bright sunshine -- for Delhi to wake up on Thursday to something it rarely does: a clean, clear, cerulean sky.To be precise, the wind speed was 30-40kmph, 13 mm of rain was recorded at the Safdarjang station on Wednesday, the contribution of dust to the air pollution was nil, and the ventilation coefficient was 45,000 metres square per second.A set of numbers in this ballpark -- which on Thursday equalled a blue sky with a mix of interspersed high and low white clouds -- coincide only a few times a year in the Capital.The data above is from the India Meteorological Department and the Air Quality Early Warning System under the Union ministry of earth sciences.“There was a cyclonic circulation over Madhya Pradesh that brought light rain on Wednesday. There are strong easterlies blowing at 30 to 40km per hour that helped clear the skies. On August 8, we are expecting a change in wind patterns. A low pressure area is developing again in the Bay of Bengal. We are expecting moderate category rain in Delhi on August 10, 11 and 12,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre.IMD in its Thursday bulletin said strong surface winds will continue to blow over north-west India till Friday.“The low pressure area that had formed over Bay of Bengal on August 4 now lies over south-west Madhya Pradesh. It is very likely to become less marked by August 7. There is strong south westerly/westerly monsoonal flow over the Arabian sea with wind speed reaching 50-60kmph along and off the west coast. Strong surface winds are likely to prevail over northwestern plains till Friday,” the bulletin said.According to an explainer by Nasa on why the sky the blue, when sunlight reaches the earth’s atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air, blue light is scattered more than the other colours because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.“A combination of clouds and radiation from sunlight determines the colour (or the blueness) of the sky,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.“We had a clear sky [on Thursday]. There were less clouds, but not the entire day. We had a mix of high and low clouds but no cumulonimbus clouds, which are associated with thunderstorms,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMDThe combination of factors also cleared the Delhi air. The air quality index (AQI) on Thursday was 69 -- in the “satisfactory” category -- for the second time this week , and also the second time since April 2. Delhi has recorded “satisfactory” air continuously for the past 10 days. The air has was also “satisfactory” for an unusually high number of days since March 25, when the lockdown was imposed, due to a fall in vehicular emissions sparked by reduced traffic flow, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data.“There were 60 satisfactory air days this year till July 31, compared to 15 last year. One ‘good’ air day (AQI less than 50) was also recorded in March,” said VK Shukla, in charge of air quality at CPCB.“Meteorological factors alone cannot bring such a change in air quality. Vehicular emissions are still relatively lower than before the lockdown period. This, in combination means pollutants are dispersing,” said Sachin Ghude, a scientist at IMD.A ventilation coefficient, which captures the ability of the atmosphere to dilute and disperse the pollutants over a region, of 6,000 is considered favourable for dispersion..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-delhi-woke-up-to-a-clear-blue-sky/story-lK5WJkavdVw7JlD91idXBO.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Suspect who sexually assaulted, stabbed minor girl arrested; Kejriwal hands over ₹10 lakh to her kin||The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested a 35-year-old man in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, who is undergoing treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in the national capital. Krishan, who goes by one name, has a criminal record and attacked the girl at her residence in outer Delhi’s Paschim Vihar area on Tuesday, according to Shalini Singh, joint commissioner of police (western range). The child was allegedly sexually assaulted when her parents and sister were away at work. She was stabbed multiple times with a scissors. Neighbours who spotted the bleeding child alerted the police, who rushed her to a hospital. She is in a critical condition. On Thursday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the girl at AIIMS and announced a financial aid of ₹10 lakh for her family. “The toughest punishment will be given to the culprit. We will appoint the best of our lawyers so that the culprit gets the strictest punishment,” Kejriwal said. Later in the day, Singh said Krishan’s interrogation confirmed the sequence of events. “He has four previous criminal cases registered against him — one of murder, one case of attempt to murder and two of burglary. Further interrogation is underway,” Singh said. The police have also established through CCTV footage that the man, also known as Kakka, entered the house at 4.40pm and left the building by 4.56pm, according to officials. The primary motive of the suspect was burglary, a police official said, requesting anonymity. “He said he was looking for a house that he could easily target....he found the house open and entered. The girl saw him and raised an alarm...he picked up a sewing machine and threw it at her. He said he also picked up a scissor and stabbed her. Because he was heavily inebriated, he doesn’t remember how many times he stabbed her,” the official said. Multiple teams were pressed into action to identify and arrest the suspect. Announcing help for the girl’s family during his hospital visit, Kejriwal said: “The Delhi government will offer financial assistance of ₹10 lakh to the family of the girl. The girl was the victim of a very brutal attack and this money is a means of providing support to her family.” “She has suffered serious internal injuries, which I find hard even to describe. She is currently unconscious and the doctors said she was in a really bad shape when she was brought in on Tuesday. Since then, she has undergone a surgery and it would take another 24-48 hours for her to make it out of danger. We hope that she recovers fully and goes back home,” he added. A second investigator, who did not want to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said when they started scanning CCTV footage, they spotted a man wearing a mask entering the building where the girl stayed. “After some time, the same man was spotted exiting the building, still wearing the mask. Because the time he spent inside the building matches with the time frame when the girl was sexually assaulted and stabbed, he became our prime suspect,” this official said. Then, the official added, CCTV footage checked from nearby areas. “In one footage, we spotted him removing his mask. We got that footage enhanced and he was identified,” he said. When shown his image, the girl’s parents said they did not know the man, the police said. “Delhi Police have taken the case registered under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) at Paschim Vihar police station seriously,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal. Meanwhile, Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal, too, visited AIIMS to meet the girl’s family on Thursday. DCW also summoned the Delhi Police and sought a detailed action taken report in the case. “Finally, now the police has arrested a person. There should be no delay in getting justice for the daughter. May God bless the girl with good health. Rape cannot be allowed to become a common practice in the country,” Maliwal tweeted after the arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/suspect-who-sexually-assaulted-stabbed-minor-girl-arrested-kejriwal-hands-over-10-lakh-to-her-kin/story-7XSIyHTIT66fOWAggnhUcI.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Labourer thrashed to death on suspicion of stealing cash; suspects nabbed||Two truck drivers on Monday morning beat a 25-year-old man to death, on the suspicion that he stole ₹90,000 cash and mobile phones from them.The police arrested the two men later that day, apprehending them as they tried to flee the city with the victim in their truck. Senior officers aware of the matter said there was no evidence to suggest the victim had stolen anything from the drivers.Police found the victim, Vishal, a labour worker, unconscious in the back of the truck during a routine check at the Singhu Border in north Delhi. He was declared dead on arrival at a hospital later that day.Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said the allegations that Vishal had stolen their phones and cash was unfounded, and there was no evidence to suggest as much. “He has no criminal past as well,” Arya said.The two truck drivers, Sandeep Kumar and Sanjeev Kumar, have been booked for murder, kidnapping and destruction of evidence. DCP Arya said the brothers would make frequent trips from Himachal Pradesh to Delhi to transport apples. They had driven from Bilaspur in Himachal Pradesh, and sold apples at Azadpur Mandi worth ₹90,000 late on Sunday night, she said. When they were preparing to make their way back, they allegedly realised the cash and their cellphone were missing from the truck.Vishal lived with his parents in a slum in nearby Haiderpur and earned his living by loading and unloading fruits and vegetables at the market. Often, he would spend his nights at the market itself, am investigator who asked not to be identified said.He came under the radar of the two truck drivers around 2am on Monday.Since they found Vishal around near their truck in the market, they suspected him of stealing the cash and allegedly began beating him up.Pintu, a labour worker who lives and works at the mandi, said he woke up around 2.30am to loud noises from outside. “I went out and saw two men beating a labourer up, and accusing him of stealing their cash,” he said.“After thrashing him, the two men tied him up, threw him into their truck and drove away,” Pintu, who goes by a single name, added.The truckers weren’t able to drive very far. In about an hour, they found themselves in a traffic jam at the Singhu Border adjoining Haryana.“The traffic police were checking the trucks and other vehicles for violations. They checked the insides of this truck as well and found an injured man tied up inside an otherwise empty truck,” DCP Arya said.The police untied Vishal and rushed him to Ambedkar Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.The two suspects, meanwhile, were arrested and handed over to Mahendra Park police station.An investigator said the two truckers thought that they would torture him further ahead in Himachal Pradesh in the hope of making him speak up about the location of the allegedly stolen cash.The police, meanwhile, took the two suspects to the Mandi where Pintu identified them as the people who had assaulted Vishal. In the absence of an identity card on Vishal and since hardly anyone at the market knew him, it took the police an entire day of asking around the market, before they could identify him and alert his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labourer-thrashed-to-death-on-suspicion-of-stealing-cash-suspects-nabbed/story-X9KiEn2Wy2si5B3rynx61M.html
07-08-2020||Delhi||Centre asks metro to seek Delhi govt’s help to repay loan||The Union housing and urban affairs (HUA) ministry has asked Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to approach the Delhi government for financial assistance to repay its loan instalment for this year. The DMRC had taken a soft loan of Rs 35,198 crore for construction work from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)With Metro shut since March 22 due to the Coronavirus pandemic, DMRC has suffered a revenue loss of about Rs 1,300 crore. Last month, it had written to the Centre, requesting it to defer the payment to next year.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said, “We have received such a communication from the ministry recently. The same is being examined and processed. “The DMRC is yet to write to the Delhi government or take a decision in this regard.The Delhi government spokesperson did not offer a comment.A ministry official said they asked DMRC to contact the state government for financial aid.DMRC has repaid Rs 3,337 crore of the loan to JICA. According to another DMRC official, Metro has to pay Rs 1242.83 crore as instalment for the financial year 2020-21.According to the DMRC official, “The Metro has paid Rs 79.19 crore on account of interest for this financial year and the balance liability of Rs 1163.64 crore is yet to be paid.”The loan has been granted at a concessional rate of interest, varying from 1.2% to 2.3%, and has to be repaid in 30 years with a moratorium period of 10 years.The Metro, which has a network of 389km with 285 stations, earns nearly Rs 3,600 crore from fare and by renting out its space at stations to commercial establishments. Commercial establishments operating at metro stations had written to the DMRC to defer rental payments as there had been no business since March.There are about 400 shops apart from property development at stations such as Nehru Place and HUDA City Centre, etc., which attracts a lot of crowd due to the restaurants. DMRC is yet to take a decision in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-asks-metro-to-seek-delhi-govt-s-help-to-repay-loan/story-1kkfxiUziyA2if0biJrFSK.html

The civic body is also coming up with jumbo facilities on the College of Engineering, Pune [COEP] ground which will add to its Covid bed facilities. As of August 5, Pune city has reported over 60,000 progressive positive cases out of which over 42,000 have been recovered. The number of deaths is 1,459 and 16,758 active cases. In addition, over 17,199 are in home isolation as per the information from the district health department.

07-08-2020||Pune||Health facilities in Pune: Infrastructure can be created, but what of medical staff?||The neglect by authorities to set up medical and nursing colleges to cover the expanding city has left public healthcare facilities at a new low because of medical staff crunch. And an epidemic like coronavirus has complicated the problem even further. While Pune district saw scores of engineering colleges built over the years, only six medical colleges, including the most recent Baramati college, and a few nursing institutes, mostly private, were set up during the period. And the lack of planning by authorities caused shortage of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had proposed to start a medical college named after Atal Bihari Vajpayee a decade ago, but not much progress was made till recently when the plan got the nod from the state government. More than doctors, there has been a huge shortage of nurses across the city. According to Jibin TC, president, United Nurses Association, the administration was alerted about manpower shortfall in advance, but no step was taken. “Contract nurses are often given inhumane working hours wherein they have to attend to 5-6 ICU patients when the protocol states that one ICU patient must get one dedicated nurse. They are not given leaves and now we are seeing that nurses at private hospitals are not paid their dues on time. The jumbo facilities in many places across Mumbai are lying vacant because they do not have staff and PMC is also doing the same thing. They can buy the best machines and occupy all hotels or hospitals, but from where will they get the staff?” said Jibin. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association said, “The government’s policy to not build enough hospitals over the years has led to this situation. While engineering colleges sprawled especially in Pune, there are hardly any medical colleges. Even during the swine flu pandemic, many promises were made but nothing happened. The government’s policy now to offer more money to hire more staff is only leading to poaching from private hospitals who are feeling the pinch now.” PMC’s long-pending proposal to build its own medical college at Naidu hospital has recently got approval for the state which has asked the civic body to form a medical trust. A proposal which was only on paper for years got its much-needed approval only when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Over the years, the city has had only 8 medical colleges and a few nursing schools which are mostly owned by private entities. Former Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram had said that the administration is recruiting staff from private hospitals on contract, from rural areas and also from nearby districts. The senior official said that contractors or third parties have been appointed to set up jumbo facilities and they will be responsible to recruit staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-facilities-in-pune-infrastructure-can-be-created-but-what-about-medical-staff/story-EcgXVuSmQTq6CwTSQ9qeZL.html
07-08-2020||Pune||Stuck in Pune due to Covid, Hong Kong-based doc’s murals spread positivity||Dr Pratishtha Banga, an MD in Pharmacology from GMC Aurangabad, and an MBBS from the BJ Medical College in Pune, is acutely aware of the challenges the medical fraternity in the city face on a daily basis battling the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Banga lives and practices in Hong Kong, but given the lockdown scenario, both here and abroad, she has been in Pune for the last five months. Dr Banga has been making her presence felt in Kalyaninagar, not with her medical prowess per se, but with a paint brush and the area’s walls as her canvas. “I don’t have to do clinic duties, but watching my other friends during these Covid time gave me the inspiration to paint a mural of a female doctor – who is currently multi-tasking. I just want people to notice how bravely doctors and nurses are managing everything during these Covid time, and that they should be respected and not attacked,” says Dr Banga, who by her art, a mere hobby of hers, is spreading a positive vibe and giving Kalyaninagar an uplifting aesthetic in these pandemic times. Dr Banga’s murals adorn the Vitthalrao Vandekar road in Kalyani nagar and Rajesh Bankar, assistant commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) fully supported her, when she asked for permission. Every day, for three days, from 9am to 7pm, Dr Banga was out on the street painting. Dr Banga, who is in Pune visiting her parents who live here, began the art work on July 9 and was done by July 11. She used exterior Acrylic Emulsion paints and has put in around Rs 3,500 for the art work.“I came here in December 2019. Since the Covid cases were increasing in Hong Kong at the time, I stayed back and had no idea that India would go into lockdown. Painting walls is my hobby for which I spare seven hours a week since my college days,” she says. “These paintings are for all the doctors who are performing high-risk duties. I have my brother who works in Mumbai treating Covid patients and after work he comes home to a three-year-old son. Doctors are having the hardest life and if I get the chance I would like to do some more such paintings to inspire them,” she says. The murals are now an attraction in Kalyaninagar. “A few days back I noticed the paintings – and it is a wonderful way to thank the doctors. Being a doctor who is treating Covid patients, I feel good looking at the wall while going home every day,” says Dr Dhanshree Rapitwar, who works in one private hospital and lives in Kalyaninagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stuck-in-pune-due-to-covid-hong-kong-based-doc-s-murals-spread-positivity/story-CzWAlbUm9FxzFCnjJKRGUI.html
07-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s Aditya Birla memorial hospital nursing staff stage protest over alleged long working hours, pay hike||Pune: The nursing staff at Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital (ABMH), Chinchwad, staged a protest at the hospital premises and outside the main gate on Thursday against alleged long working hours and pay hike. The protesters claimed that they have been forced to work for 12 hours instead of six-hour shift, improper rotation of work shifts, salary increment, unclear leave of absence and flouting of quarantine protocols. They said that separate accommodation should be provided to nurses looking after Covid cases. The protestors have also written a letter to Rajesh Tope, health minister of Maharashtra. HT has a copy of the letter. While the hospital management has denied the allegations, the protesting staff, mostly coming from out of state, allege that they have been asked to vacant the hostel if they don’t want to work as per the terms of hospital management. Rekha Dubey, CEO, Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital, said, “They don’t want to work which is their right, and we cannot force anyone to work. We are taking steps to sort the issue and find an alternative.” On salary increment, Dubey said, “Like every year, the staff were given an increment in July this year also. Plus we did market correction and they got almost double the increment. With the healthcare industry under recession, very few organisations like us have provided this financial relief. Also, we started giving Covid allowance to staff from April this year, besides holistic care.” “We are telling them to increase staff or stop taking more patients. It is a private hospital, people pay more as compared to other hospitals but are not getting proper treatment because of staff crunch,” said one of the staff members on request of anonymity. Staff also claimed that the hospital is not keeping non-Covid and Covid patients in separate areas. On July 15, 25 nurses from the hospital were tested positive. A nursing staff claimed that the annual increment was not double the amount as stated by the management. “I used to get Rs 20,000 and this month I got Rs 21, 000. We have been on protest from 9am till evening, but the management has told our union to resume duty or resign,” said a protesting staffer on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aditya-birla-memorial-hospital-s-nursing-staff-stage-protest-over-alleged-long-working-hours-pay-hike/story-4WYjBUB6avwEkpY54y1X6H.html

07-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin businessman banned for false UK tax returns||Hardip Singh Khaira, who owned a construction company in Scotland, was on Thursday banned from acting as a director of a company for nine years after officials found that he knowingly caused the company to submit false tax returns. Khaira, 43, was director of HK Construction incorporated in 2011 to provide groundwork construction services, including drainage and concreting. The company traded from its premises in Coatbridge, north Lanarkshire, until July 2019. In September 2019, the company was subject to creditors voluntary liquidation. He is now banned from acting as a director or directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a company. According to the Insolvency Service, investigators uncovered that between November 2011 and February 2015, Khaira knowingly caused the company to submit false tax returns. Some invoices had been brought down to zero rated sales to reduce the company’s tax liability. The tax authorities determined that just over £225,000 (Rs 2.22 crore) was owed by the company, which increased to more than £426,000 (Rs 4.2 crore) when interest and penalties were applied for the deliberate concealment and failure to pay. Aware of the liability owed to the tax authorities, Khaira placed the company into creditors voluntary liquidation, resulting in outstanding liabilities to the tax authorities of more than £426,000. The secretary of state accepted a disqualification undertaking from Khaira in July after he did not dispute concealing tax to the detriment of the tax authorities. Robert Clarke, chief investigator for the Insolvency Service, said: “It was clear from our investigations that Hardip Khaira deliberately caused the construction firm to submit false returns to reduce the amount of tax the company had to pay.” “This is serious misconduct and a nine-year ban not only demonstrates the severity of what Hardip Khaira has done but also confirms that we will take action to remove the privilege of limited liability against those who think they can do the same”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-origin-businessman-banned-for-false-uk-tax-returns/story-9KlDPukjoqFtvzkTeGvq3I.html

(hereafter referred to as Dongfeng) has caused the death of Chinese soldiers during the China-India border clash,” the write-up published in eng.chinamil.com.cn said.Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a brutal brawl at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which India lost 20 soldiers during the hand-to-hand clash. China is yet to reveal the number of casualties it suffered in the fight.“On August 3, after learning via the Internet that online-user Zhou had posted rumours on his “WeChat moments” by claiming that internal corruption of the Dongfeng Company had led to the poor quality of the its military vehicles, which resulted in the casualties of Chinese soldiers on the China-India border, the Dongfeng Company immediately reported to the local police and established a special working group to investigate and verify the case,” the website reported.“At about 18:00 on August 4, Zhou was arrested by local police. He confessed to his crime of rumour-mongering, showed remorse, and wrote a sincere apology letter.”The website also published the confession letter written by Zhou in Chinese along with the story.In the confession letter, Zhou wrote that he “fabricated” the story on the evening of August 2 after drinking.Zhou wrote that he made up that poor quality of vehicles caused the death of Chinese soldiers and 500 vehicles of the Dongfeng company had to be recalled.The social media update was then forwarded by friends and family, he wrote.Zhou then “deeply” apologises netizens and the Dongfeng company in the letter, and said he was “…willing to accept the treatment from relevant departments”.“I hope that the majority of netizens can learn from me, (and) do not make rumours, do not believe rumours, do not spread rumours…,” he wrote.“The Dongfeng company has been engaged in the R&D and manufacturing of high-mobility off-road vehicles for military operations for a long time, being considered as China’s top military vehicles manufacturer,” the write-up said.The website eng.chinamil.com.cn is the only official English language military news website of the PLA.“Authorised by the Central Military Commission of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and sponsored by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) News Media Center, China Military Online is the only official English-language military news website of the Chinese Armed Forces and an important platform for building up the online international communication capacity of the Chinese military,” the website says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-arrests-citizen-for-claiming-chinese-soldiers-died-in-clash-with-india-because-of-corruption/story-nl0RdNbNB0FRUekTlDOkUL.html

But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP).A bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP since the last few weeks after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” The opponents of Oli are also against his autocratic style of functioning.“Our main concern is not about gaining power, what we want is to follow the proper procedure while running the NCP. We are not focusing on gaining any position, but our fight is against the wrong trend developing in the party,” Prachanda told a select group of journalists during a special briefing on Wednesday.He held the press conference along with three senior party leaders Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal and party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha, according to Nagarik daily.The dissident group accused Oli of trying to damage the image of other senior leaders of the party, the daily reported.Prachanda and Nepal have claimed that the majority of the powerful Central Working Committee members have supported them while raising voice against Oli. Prachanda also alleged that while the Standing Committee meeting was in progress, at the initiative of Prime Minister Oli a new party was registered under the name of a lesser-known person at the Election Commission with the intention to split the ruling party.“If one chairman (PM Oli) does not follow the proper procedure of the party then how can the unity of the party remain intact,” he wondered.Prachanda claimed that he and other senior leaders of the party were trying to save the party by creating a favourable situation.“We are trying for the best outcome but the communists of this country should also be prepared for the worst thing to happen,” Prachanda told media persons, indicating a possible split in the ruling party.“I had agreed to make Oli Prime Minister for a full 5 years term and enjoy the executive chairman’s position in the party for creating a better environment within the party,” said Prachanda. “Oli has dragged the party towards anarchism by calling separate gatherings,” Prachanda said.During the press briefing, the senior leaders also accused Prime Minister Oli of making political appointments on his own choice without consulting with the party.Madhav Nepal accused Oli of working in the vested interest of a certain group and encouraging corrupt people while making appointments.Party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha said that Oli is running the government on his personal whim.Does the government belong to the party or a person? He asked.Meanwhile, PM Oli’s chief advisor Bishnu Rimal has slammed Shrestha.“Don’t encourage groupism in the party at a time when the country is passing through a crisis. Enough is enough,” he wrote on Twitter.On July 28, Prime Minister Oli postponed the crucial Standing Committee meeting for the ninth time.While Oli wants to call the Secretariat meeting to resolve the differences, Prachanda says it would be inappropriate to call the Secretariat meeting as the Standing Committee meeting that was put off on July 28 is yet to be over.Prime Minister Oli wants the Secretariat meeting to resolve the key issues of an intra-party dispute as he now commands a majority in the nine-member body.Prachanda, who is backed by senior party leader and former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, believes that the Standing Committee could take decisions favourable to him as their faction commands a comfortable majority, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/locked-in-power-tussle-with-nepal-pm-oli-prachanda-tells-party-workers-to-prepare-for-worst/story-unlsbxNcOMwWvHci28RqYP.html

There is a possibility of external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act,” President Michel Aoun said in comments carried by local media and confirmed by his office.He said the probe into Tuesday’s blast at a warehouse housing highly-explosive material was being conducted on three levels. “First, how the explosive material entered and was stored ... second whether the explosion was a result of negligence or an accident ... and third the possibility that there was external interference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-rocket-or-bomb-or-other-act-lebanese-president-on-external-interference-in-beirut-blast/story-azdFF7jses6zd85JvHmXKI.html
07-08-2020||World||‘The world exploded’: Beirut blast takes a husband, father||Soha Saade had not seen her husband since Christmas. The coronavirus pandemic had kept 44-year-old Jihad in Nigeria, where he worked far from his family in Beirut. Once travel restrictions eased, he flew home with a new sense of urgency: His 6-year old had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.Together, Jihad and Soha spent 13 days with their daughter, Gemma, as she received treatment. “We only had one more day left in the hospital,” Soha said.When smoke billowed outside the hospital window Tuesday, the couple lamented Beirut’s pollution and disorder. Soha began to film it on her phone, then went out to check with nurses if there was reason to worry.As she opened the door, “the world exploded.”In an instant, she had to make a wrenching decision — focus on her daughter, who suddenly was watching blood gush from her stunned father’s head, or leave the girl with others and try to save the life of the man she loved.Soha carried her burly husband down nine floors, walking barefoot on broken glass. The hospital was no longer functioning. She had to find another.Strangers appeared and helped her down the stairs. Her brother arrived to help. Soha reached a doctor friend on the phone who talked her through basic first aid.“Jihado, answer me, don’t go,” she pleaded with her husband.But it was too late. Other hospitals, overwhelmed, turned the couple away. Soha’s husband died in her arms. He never said a word.“He didn’t even open his eyes. I saw his soul (leaving his body),” Soha said.She only removed the broken glass from her feet three days later.She doesn’t know how to ever remove the pain.Tuesday’s blast killed nearly 150 people. Search teams are still looking for bodies as some families don’t know whether to mourn.“You are not supposed to die in a hospital. This is what is killing me,” Soha said.The couple’s love had survived so much. Jihad, a hotel manager, grew up in Nigeria but never severed ties with Lebanon. He was known for his generosity and for being a family man, his wife said.They married in 2009 but Soha had to return home from Nigeria when the West African country was shaken by an Ebola virus outbreak a few years ago and she had a baby. Violence in Lebanon then thwarted their plans to live together there.In their long-distance conversations “he would tell me every day, ‘Don’t worry, my love. Don’t have a concern,’” Soha recalled. “If I wanted the moon, he would bring it to me. He would never make me angry. ... He would never make anyone angry.”The couple met every two months until, again, a virus outbreak disrupted their plans. And then their daughter received her diagnosis.Finally, when Jihad could travel, he came bearing gifts. After days in the hospital by his family’s side, he visited their 9-year-old son, Karl, for a weekend. He returned two days before the explosion, bearing new pajamas for his wife and a plate of tabbouleh for his daughter, who had craved it.“His biggest concern was his family. He was carrying a big load. Everyone was counting on him,” Soha said.“He used to give me peace of mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-world-exploded-beirut-blast-takes-a-husband-father/story-OrCG09Q9rdXTYokBkVdhkL.html
07-08-2020||World||What we know about the explosion in Beirut||Three days after a massive explosion rocked Beirut, killing at least 149 people and causing widespread devastation, rescuers are still searching for survivors and the government is investigating what caused the disaster.Here’s what we know at this point:A CATASTROPHIC TOLLTuesday’s blast killed at least 149 people and wounded more than 5,000. It struck with the force of an earthquake, blowing out windows and doors across the capital and leaving several city blocks littered with broken glass, rubble and demolished vehicles. It was the biggest explosion ever seen in the city, which was split in half during the 1975-1990 civil war and has a long history of bombings and terror attacks. Authorities estimate that 300,000 people were initially left homeless — about 12% of the city’s population — and that the city will need $10 billion to $15 billion to rebuild. The blast also obliterated the main port of a tiny country that relies on imports, and shredded a towering silo that had held an estimated 85% of Lebanon’s grain.___A WAREHOUSE FULL OF EXPLOSIVESThe blast appears to have been caused by the ignition of a stockpile of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in fertilizers and explosives, that had been stored at the port since it was seized from an impounded cargo ship in 2013. Video footage shows a fire at the port, with what appear to be fireworks going off, before a massive explosion rocks the city and sends a mushroom cloud into the sky. It’s unclear what caused the fire, but there is so far no evidence of an attack.___AN ONGOING INVESTIGATIONThe government has launched an investigation that appears to be focused on port and customs officials, with at least 16 employees detained and others brought in for questioning. Officials at the port have sought to shift blame, saying they warned senior officials of the dangers posed by storing a huge amount of ammonium nitrate in a civilian port but that no action was taken. Many Lebanese place the blame squarely on the political class that rose to power during the civil war, which is widely seen as corrupt and incompetent. Scattered protests have broken out, with some people chanting “revolution,” and more unrest seems likely as the full extent of the tragedy sinks in.___A COUNTRY ALREADY ON THE BRINKLebanon was already in the grip of a severe economic crisis rooted in decades of misrule that spawned mass protests last autumn. The currency has plunged in recent months, leading to a painful spike in the prices of basic goods and wiping out many people’s life savings. The explosion sent thousands flooding into hospitals that were already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, potentially worsening the country’s outbreak. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to move in with friends or relatives, which could also accelerate the spread of the virus. One major hospital was forced to close after it was severely damaged.___AID APPEARS ELUSIVESeveral countries have dispatched emergency aid and search-and-rescue crews to Beirut. But foreign donors are unlikely to provide the sustained, large-scale assistance Lebanon needs without substantial reforms by the country’s long-entrenched political leadership. The government, which defaulted on its sovereign debt in March, has been negotiating an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund for months, but the talks faltered over Lebanese infighting and resistance to demands for reform. On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron promised aid but also called for a “new political order.” As he toured one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods, an angry crowd vented its fury at Lebanon’s leaders. But while the blast shattered Lebanon’s capital in an instant, its dysfunctional political system remains stubbornly intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-we-know-about-the-explosion-in-beirut/story-wgYkskWbfMdRU04DWqVgFJ.html
07-08-2020||World||‘No way we can rebuild’: Lebanese count huge losses after Beirut blast||Beirut residents began trying to rebuild their shattered lives on Friday after the biggest blast in the Lebanese capital’s history tore into the city, killing at least 154 and leaving the heavily indebted nation with another huge reconstruction bill.The search for those missing since Tuesday’s blast intensified overnight, as rescuers sifted rubble in a frantic race to find anyone still alive after the explosion smashed a swathe of the city and sent shockwaves around the region.Security forces fired teargas at a furious crowd late on Thursday, as anger boiled over at the government and a political elite, who have presided over a nation that was facing economic collapse even before the deadly port blast injured 5,000 people.The small crowd, some hurling stones, marked a return to the kind of protests that had become a feature of life in Beirut, as Lebanese watched their savings evaporate and currency disintegrate, while government decision-making floundered.“There is no way we can rebuild this house. Where is the state?” Tony Abdou, an unemployed 60-year-old, sitting in the family home in Gemmayze, a district that lies a few hundred metres from the port warehouses where highly explosive material was stored for years, a ticking time bomb next to a densely populated area.As Abdou spoke, a domestic water boiler fell through the ceiling of his cracked home, while volunteers from the neighbourhood turned out on the street to sweep up debris.“Do we actually have a government here?” said taxi driver Nassim Abiaad, 66, whose cab was crushed by falling building wreckage just as he was about to get into the vehicle.“There is no way to make money anymore,” he said.The government has promised a full investigation and put several port employees under house arrest. State news agency NNA said 16 people were taken into custody. But for many Lebanese, the explosion was symptomatic of the years of neglect by the authorities while state corruption thrived.SHOCKWAVESOfficials have said the blast, whose seismic impact was recorded hundreds of miles (kilometres) away, might have caused losses amounting to $15 billion - a bill the country cannot pay when it has already defaulted on its mountain of national debt, exceeding 150% of economic output, and talks about a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund have stalled.Hospitals, many heavily damaged as shockwaves ripped out windows and pulled down ceilings, have been overwhelmed by the number of casualties. Many were struggling to find enough foreign exchange to buy supplies before the explosion.In the port area, rescue teams set up arc lights to work through the night in a dash to find those still missing, as families waited tensely, slowly losing hope of ever seeing loved ones again. Some victims were hurled into the sea because of the explosive force.The weeping mother of one of the missing called a prime time TV programme on Thursday night to plead with the authorities to find her son, Joe. He was found - dead - hours later.Lebanese Red Cross Secretary General George Kettaneh told local radio VDL that three more bodies had been found in the search, while the health minister said on Friday the death toll had climbed to 154. Dozens are still unaccounted for.Charbel Abreeni, who trained port employees, showed Reuters pictures on his phone of killed colleagues. He was sitting in a church where the head from the statue of the Virgin Mary had been blown off.“I know 30 port employees who died, two of them are my close friends and a third is missing,” said the 62-year-old, whose home was wrecked in the blast. His shin was bandaged.“I have nowhere to go except my wife’s family,” he said. “How can you survive here, the economy is zero?”Offers of immediate medical and food aid have poured in from Arab states, Western nations and beyond. But none, so far, address the bigger challenges facing a bankrupt nation.French President Emmanuel Macron came to the city on Thursday with a cargo from France. He promised to explain some “home truths” to the government, telling them they needed to root out corruption and deliver economic reforms.He was greeted on the street by many Lebanese who asked for help in ensuring “regime” change, so a new set of politicians could rebuild Beirut and set the nation on a new course.Beirut still bore scars from heavy shelling in the 1975-1990 civil war before the blast. After the explosion, chunks of the city once again look like a war zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-way-we-can-rebuild-lebanese-count-huge-losses-after-beirut-blast/story-UK0WtGJxwy9luv1UKTtVpJ.html

In a statement, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asserted that they (the Chinese apps) were ‘stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.”Reacting to the US decision, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said Washington should provide non-discriminatory business environment to all countries.“China urges the US to correct its wrongdoings, stop politicising economic issues and cracking down on related firms, and provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for normal operations and investment by businesses from all countries,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Friday.Also read: Firmly oppose US orders against TikTok and WeChat, says China“The US will eventually taste the bitter fruit of choosing self-interest over market principles, international rules, which will only lead to the decline of morality, national image, and international trust,” Wang said.Calling it a “shameless act of hegemony”, Wang said the US frequently uses national security as an excuse to abuse state power and groundlessly clamp down on related firms.On Thursday, Trump said that the spread in the US of “…mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People’s Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”Trump’s orders on Chinese follows the tit-for-tat closing of consulates – in Houston and Chengdu – while the two countries remain at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms-sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hegemonic-us-will-taste-bitter-fruit-of-self-interest-says-china-after-tiktok-wechat-targeted-by-washington/story-UEh40xyAc8JjASPSxj5QhM.html

The study, published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, evaluated a group of healthy volunteers who received the BCG vaccine in the five years before the ongoing pandemic, and compared their immune system function to that of healthy volunteers who were not administered the shots. According to the scientists, including those from Radboud University in the Netherlands, the Bacille Calmette-Guerin or BCG vaccine was originally intended to treat tuberculosis, but was later proven to provide a long-lasting, general boost to the immune system. The current study determined if there was an effect of this vaccine on the symptoms attributable to infection with the novel coronavirus. It showed that those who received the vaccine did not have more symptoms, did not get sick more often, or become more seriously ill, during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. “What the comparison between the groups shows is that at least those who received the vaccine did not get sick more often or become more seriously ill. It therefore does not hurt to vaccinate people with BCG,” the scientists noted in a statement. The researchers noted that the country reported a lower number of sick people in the period March-May 2020 among the BCG-vaccinated group, with lower incidence of extreme fatigue among the vaccinated individuals. However, they also cautioned that the study had limitations which prevent conclusions from being drawn regarding the benefit of the BCG vaccine against Covid-19. “It is very important to confirm that someone who has been vaccinated with BCG does not experience any increased symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we see less sickness in the people who have had the BCG vaccination, only the ongoing prospective BCG vaccination studies can determine whether this vaccination can help against Covid-19”, said study co-author Mihai Netea from Radbound University. The scientists believe clinical randomised trials evaluating the BCG vaccine’s effects against Covid-19 -- currently underway in several parts of the world -- can answer this question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bcg-vaccine-safe-does-not-lead-to-increased-risk-of-covid-19-symptoms-scientists-say/story-GRASROfKHcAal5DjCMHlIO.html

Trudeau has also apologised for not recusing himself from a Cabinet decision for granting the contract to the organisation. The contract was later cancelled after the controversy erupted with revelations that his mother, brother and wife had been paid for appearances by the organisationIt appears, however, that Trudeau’s apology has not cut any ice with Canadians. A new survey from the polling agency Leger in collaboration with the Association for Canadian Studies shows that 49 per cent of Canadians want Trudeau to quit and call fresh elections if he is found guilty of ethics violations. The PM was found of guilty of similar violations twice during his first term.But that’s not the only data point working against Trudeau: 49 per cent also said their opinion of Trudeau had worsened due to the WE scandal and 42 per cent said their view of his Liberal Party had suffered adversely. The news agency Canadian Press quoted Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque as saying that “these are numbers that will certainly worry or concern the Liberals at this moment.” Trudeau’s Liberal Party is running a minority government and had enjoyed an upswing in support due to the perception of efficient handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the new controversy has taken a heavy political toll on the ruling party as it has dropped six points in two weeks and it seems to be in a statistical tie with the principal opposition Conservatives at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-half-of-canadians-want-fresh-polls-if-pm-trudeau-found-guilty-in-we-charity-probe/story-FKROREAQGMWrh3Mgn42u9L.html

Heavy rain across the Korean peninsula has brought flooding to both North and South Korea in recent days, and concern is growing about damage to North Korean crops.“It is of priority importance to quickly supply sleeping materials, daily commodities, medicines and other necessities to the flood-affected people to stabilize their living,” Kim said in comments carried by KCNA.Kim made the remarks while inspecting a flood-hit part of North Hwanghae Province, on the border of South Korea, as he “clarified tasks” for recovery work with officials there.Torrential rain for several days has inundated more than 730 single-story houses, destroying 179 of them, and flooded rice-growing land, KCNA said.There were no reports of casualties.Kim would also mobilise the army for rehabilitation, in particular work on homes and roads, and he called on architects to build 800 model houses in a badly hit farming village in Unpha County, KCNA said.The rain during the harvest season in the rice-growing area is raising concern about North Korea’s food security.North Korea’s ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, cited a study that said rice and corn would suffer if the crops were under water for just two or three days.“The fate of this year’s farming depends on how to protect farmland and crops from the flood,” the newspaper said.South Korea on Thursday donated $10 million to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) for its efforts to help North Korean children and women. Parts of South Korea have seen more than 40 consecutive days of rain, the longest monsoon since 2013, and more is expected across the peninsula.

Trudeau made his reaction public in a tweet: “In response to the American tariffs announced today, Canada will impose countermeasures that will include dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs.” He did not specify what shape and which sectors the countermeasures will impact. But his stand was also that of Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who made the same point in a statement released by her office and added, “Canadian aluminium does not undermine US national security. Canadian aluminium strengthens US national security and has done so for decades through unparalleled co-operation between our two countries.”The tariff war between the neighbouring nations comes as a repeat of events in 2018 when Canada had also retaliated by imposing $ 16.6 billion worth of tariffs on American products entering the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-imposes-dollar-to-dollar-retaliatory-measures-after-us-slaps-new-tariffs/story-37hCUTa7MlYSQu5se8n3AK.html

It has been conducting follow-up visits with ‘100 recovered patients’ since April.The findings of the research have been startling. Peng’s team said that the recovered patients could only walk for 400 metres in six minutes, unlike their healthy peers who could cover a distance of 500 metres in the same time. This is based on the walking test with the patients.Also Read: US will end reliance on China, other nations for pharmaceuticalsThe first phase of this one-year programme finished in July.

Asad Umar, minister for planning, announced on Thursday restrictions on the hospitality and recreational sectors would be lifted from August 10. “Restaurants and cafes, outdoor and indoor, will be allowed to open from Monday, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be finalised in the next two to three days,” Umar said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe recreational sector, which includes public and amusement parks, theatres, cinemas and arcades will also be allowed to open from Monday along with business and expo centres and salons. Marriage halls can open from September 15 and hotels can host wedding ceremonies, he said.Permission was also being given for organising tournaments and matches involving non-contact sports without the presence of an audience from Monday, in addition to allowing indoor gymnasiums and sports clubs to open.Educational institutions will open from September 15, but a final review of the situation will be carried out on September 7.Umar added that restrictions on transport, specifically railways and airlines, were also being lifted. “But restrictions on the number of people that can be present on trains and planes, and the condition to seat passengers with a gap, will remain in place till September.”He explained that these would also be lifted by October if the situation allowed. Restrictions on road travel were also being lifted on Monday but permission will not be given for standing and travelling on buses.Permission was also being given for opening shrines. However, in case of a large gathering, citizens will be bound to follow the guidelines issued by the government.“The threat has not gone away. The situation has improved because the government formulated a clear strategy which was implemented by the administrative machinery,” the minister said.Seen as a brave move by the Imran Khan government to return the country to normalcy, many have cautioned that Pakistan is moving too quickly.

Here’s everything you need to know about them||Researchers and pharmaceutical companies around the globe are racing to find a vaccine for the coronavirus disease. While some companies are still focussing on the initial round of clinical trials for their vaccine candidate, others have raced ahead to third and final phase of testing.In fact, US President Donald Trump, whose government is pouring in billions for a Covid-19 vaccine, said on Thursday it was possible that the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine before the November 3 election.However, top US infectious diseases official Anthony Fauci, a leading voice in the healthcare fraternity, had given a more conservative outlook. He had said on Wednesday that drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year. Fauci said there could be a billion vaccine doses available by the end of 2021, and that the world could get past the pandemic by then.Also Read: Who should be the first in line for Covid-19 vaccine? Experts debateThe companies which are the front runners in the race to find a Covid-19 vaccine are Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax.Here is a look at how these companies are preparing their vaccine candidates and where do they stand:Moderna is developing the mRNA-1273 vaccine to fight the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19. The company announced last week that it has started phase 3 clinical trials in the United States. The trial is being conducted at nearly 100 research sites in the US. Moderna had conducted the second phase of clinical trial in May, but the results are available only for the first phase. Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine generated an immune system response, but many volunteers participating in the company’s drug trial reported side effects like fatigue, chills, headache and muscle pain.Pfizer has more than one vaccine candidate and CNN reported that it has started combined Phase 2/3 trial with one of them, BNT162b2. The vaccine is being developed jointly with German company BioNTech. CNN further reported that the trials are being conducted at about 120 sites worldwide. Pfizer is expected to apply for regulatory approvals as early as October. In its initial trial, the vaccine produced antibodies and also generated immune response. Pfizer claimed that the vaccine created a tolerability profile and led to mild side effects like fever, fatigue and chills.Novavax will start the Phase 3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 next month. The first phase of the trial showed it generated antibodies to fight the coronavirus disease, the company said in a release. It further claimed that the level of antibodies the vaccine generated was four times those developed by the people who recovered from the coronavirus disease. Talking about the side effects, Novavax said that the volunteers experienced muscle pain, nausea and joint pain, and at least of them had mild fever. The US-based company said that it has entered a supply and license agreement with Serum Institute of India for the development and commercialisation of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The deal was signed on July 30, according to an SEC filing by Novavax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-set-to-enter-final-stage-of-trial-here-s-everything-you-need-to-know-about-them/story-c6WiI6BpU5w14ik7gm6zlM.html

The researchers from National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Russia noted that the structural elements of the novel coronavirus that are less subject to mutation during its evolution should be chosen as a target for the potential treatment. Otherwise, a medication effective against one strain would no longer be effective against another, they said. The best candidates for this are conservative proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus main protease M pro, according to the study published in the Mendeleev Communications journal. In addition to being resistant to mutations, M pro plays a major role in coronavirus replication, which means that its inhibition is able to slow down or even completely stop its reproduction inside the body, the researchers said. The potential drugs were taken from the database of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The modelling data demonstrated that sulphur-containing drugs show unusually high ligand efficiency at the active centre of SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro, but only disulfiram 4 retains stable interactions. Most commonly used for treating alcoholism, disulfiram fights SARS-CoV-2 in two ways, the researchers said. First, as previously demonstrated in vitro with SARS and MERS coronaviruses, it is a covalent inhibitor, they said. It fights Covid-19 symptoms such as the significant decrease in reduced glutathione, which is an important antioxidant, according to the researchers. This deficiency may lead to severe manifestations of the disease, they said. The Russian chemists said they were also the first to predict the potential efficiency of neratinib, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, against SARS-CoV-2. According to the researchers, the tests that were performed on July 27, 2020, demonstrated that disulfiram really inhibits M pro in 100 nm concentration, which confirmed the results of the modelling. The second substance -- neratinib -- demonstrated activity on M pro, but it was insufficient for clinical use, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alcoholism-drug-may-help-in-fight-against-covid-19-study-says/story-suvtkWAxNU7Lnc5zOic7yJ.html

China, however, has denied US’ accusation of covering up the extent of its coronavirus outbreak and accused America of attempting to divert public attention by insinuating that the virus originated from a virology laboratory in Wuhan. “What China did is a terrible thing. Whether it was incompetence or on purpose, it was a terrible thing that they did … not only to the United States, but to the world. A terrible thing,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday before flying to Ohio to visit a Whirlpool manufacturing plant.What China did to the rest of the world and the US is a disgrace, said the president, asserting that Beijing would have to pay the price for the wound it has inflected on America and the world by spreading the deadly coronavirus.Hours later addressing workers at the manufacturing plant in Ohio, Trump alleged that the previous Obama-Biden administration was perfectly happy to let China win. “Over the course of the next four years, we will bring our pharmaceutical and medical supply chains home and we will end reliance on China and other foreign nations,” Trump said as he laid out his vision to bring millions more jobs and thousands more factories back to American shores. “Today, to define our path forward, I am making our incredible workers six more promises that I will keep over the next four years. First and foremost, we will defeat the China virus,” he said, adding that the strategy shelters those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to get safely back to work and school. Instead of a never-ending blanket lockdown, causing severe long-term public health consequences, “we have a targeted and data-driven approach”, he said.“Today, using the Defense Production Act, we are engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilisation since World War II. Over the last six months, we have witnessed one manufacturing miracle after another,” he said. Trump said he had signed a new executive order to ensure that when it comes to essential medicines, the US buys American. This executive order will require that the US government agencies purchase all the essential medicines it needs from American sources. “My fifth promise to American workers is to bring back American jobs and factories using every tool at my disposal—including tariffs, countervailing duties, and new trade deals based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity,” he said. “As long as I am President of the United States, I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and strength that I have. I will be your voice. I will defend your jobs. I will stand up to foreign trade cheaters and violators,” Trump said. As seen in this pandemic, the United States must produce essential equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals for itself, he said. “We cannot rely on China and other nations across the globe that could one day deny us products in a time of need. We can’t do it. We can’t do it. We have to be smart,” he said.“And speaking of pharmaceuticals, we instituted four moves, rebates, favourite nations, and other things buying from other nations where they have the product, the same exact pills, identical, made in the same factory for a fraction, just a small fraction of the cost. We buy from other countries as opposed to buying through this ridiculous quagmire of political scam that we’ve been going through for many years,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-end-reliance-on-china-other-nations-for-pharmaceuticals-says-donald-trump/story-dAcJNEjPlKaRpyJzufUN9I.html

The official results declared showed that the Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) alone had won 145 seats and with its allies have 150 seats, a two thirds majority in the 225-member parliament. The party led by the prime minister won all but 4 of the 22 electoral districts on offer. The victory margins in the South, dominated by the majority Sinhala community, were in the high 60 per cent mark in most areas. The party polled 6.8 million votes at 59.9 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first world leaders to congratulate Rajapaksa on the outcome of the elections and said the two sides will work together to further advance all areas of bilateral cooperation and to take their special ties to ever newer heights.“Thank you PM @narendramodi for your congratulatory phone call. With the strong support of the people of #SriLanka, I look forward to working with you closely to further enhance the long-standing cooperation between our two countries. Sri Lanka & India are friends & relations,” Rajapaksa tweeted.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who won the November presidential election on the SLPP ticket, had called a snap election six months ahead of the schedule. In the parliamentary election, he was seeking 150 seats mandatory to execute constitutional changes in the main to repeal the 19th amendment to the Constitution which had curbed presidential powers while strengthening the role of parliament. The biggest casualty from the result was the United National Party (UNP) of former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The UNP managed to win only one seat and that too came thanks to the cumulative votes polled nationally. The country’s grandest political party failed to win a single seat from any of the 22 districts. Its leader and a four-time prime minister was unseated for the first time since he entered parliament in 1977. Wickremesinghe failed to win from Colombo district as his party finished fourth in most constituencies. The UNP only polled 249,435 votes or just 2 per cent of the vote and was relegated to the fifth position nationally. Wickremesinghe’s former deputy and the presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa, who had broken away from the UNP to form his own party SJB, has done well by winning 55 seats with its main Muslim party ally bagging it the solitary district win in the eastern port district of Trincomalee. The SJB polled 2.7 million or 23 per cent and has emerged the second largest party., according to the results. The main Tamil party TNA did not fare too well as their parliamentary representation saw a reduction for a total of 10 seats from the 16 it had won the last time. The party managed to win three districts in the Tamil-dominated North and polled 327,168 votes or 2.82 per cent, the results showed. The Marxist JVP despite winning only 3 seats from their 6 in the previous election retained its position as the third force in the country by pushing the former ruling party UNP to the fourth and in many areas to even fifth and sixth places. They polled 445,958 or 3.84 per cent of the total vote. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 2 dissolved parliament, six months ahead of the schedule, and called for snap polls on April 25. However, the election commission in mid-April postponed the elections by nearly two months to June 20 due to the coronavirus outbreak in the island nation. In June, the commission informed the apex court that the polls cannot be held on June 20 because of the coronavirus pandemic and the new date was decided following a unanimous decision reached between the members of the commission. The election commission held several mock polls to put into practice health guidelines and even extended the poll time by one hour in view of the pandemic. There are over 16 million eligible voters in the country. The August 5 poll will elect a 225-member parliament for a five-year term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahinda-rajapaksa-led-slpp-registers-landslide-victory-in-sri-lanka-s-parliamentary-polls/story-oIfCmwPQlInfKRCeU3ETUO.html

07-08-2020||World||TikTok’s sale to US firm may alleviate security concerns: Expert||The uncertain future facing the popular Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok and its potential sale to a US-based company could alleviate national security concerns about access to American user data, according to a tech expert. Mike Horning, an associate professor of multimedia journalism in the Virginia Tech School of Communication, said the growth of TikTok has raised concerns among security experts because it uses a powerful algorithm that customises content to users based on a number of user characteristics. His remarks came days after technology giant Microsoft said it will continue talks to purchase TikTok’s American business following a conversation between its India-born CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald Trump. The statement from the Redmond-headquartered Microsoft came after Trump said that he could use the emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok in the US over national security issues. “The app has gained attention because it uses a powerful algorithm that customises content to users based on a number of user characteristics. This algorithm collects such sophisticated data about users that the data is attractive to both corporations and governments,”Horning said. “However, the company has not been very transparent about who it sells your data to. Analyses of their data capturing methods have shown that personal data could be shared with hundreds of other companies,” he said.Also read: Donald Trump says TikTok must sell US operations by September 15 or close Horning said that because the app is located in China, its data sharing practices are susceptible to Chinese law which requires that data be made available to Chinese officials, raising security concerns. “The sale of the app to an American-based company could alleviate concerns that American data is being shared with foreign powers that are not always working in our mutual interests. An acquisition by Microsoft would provide another asset to the company which has been making investments in some social networks such as LinkedIn. It would also have the potential for lawmakers to provide certain restrictions on data sharing and collection practices in the future,” said Horning, director of social informatics research in the Center for Human Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. His research examines how communication technologies impact social attitudes and behaviours, with a current focus on the impact of “fake news” and misinformation in democratic processes.Also read: What US ban on Chinese app TikTok would mean India has banned as many as 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, a move welcomed by both the Trump administration and the US lawmakers. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently said TikTok cannot stay in the current format in the US as it “risks sending back information on 100 million Americans”. In recent weeks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused TikTok of collecting personal information of Americans. TikTok has previously stressed that its US user data is already stored on US-based servers and backed up in Singapore, and is therefore not subject to Chinese law as some US officials have feared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-s-sale-to-us-firm-may-alleviate-security-concerns-expert/story-d8IucWOGtLFFUtNsXcu5iI.html
07-08-2020||World||Canada’s last fully intact Arctic ice shelf collapses||The last fully intact ice shelf in the Canadian Arctic has collapsed, losing more than 40% of its area in just two days at the end of July, researchers said on Thursday.The Milne Ice Shelf is at the fringe of Ellesmere Island, in the sparsely populated northern Canadian territory of Nunavut.“Above normal air temperatures, offshore winds and open water in front of the ice shelf are all part of the recipe for ice shelf break up,” the Canadian Ice Service said on Twitter when it announced the loss on Sunday.“Entire cities are that size. These are big pieces of ice,” said Luke Copland, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa who was part of the research team studying the Milne Ice Shelf.The shelf’s area shrank by about 80 square kilometers. By comparison, the island of Manhattan in New York covers roughly 60 square kilometers.“This was the largest remaining intact ice shelf, and it’s disintegrated, basically,” Copland said.The Arctic has been warming at twice the global rate for the last 30 years, due to a process known as Arctic amplification. But this year, temperatures in the polar region have been intense. The polar sea ice hit its lowest extent for July in 40 years. Record heat and wildfires have scorched Siberian Russia.Summer in the Canadian Arctic this year in particular has been 5 degrees Celsius above the 30-year average, Copland said.That has threatened smaller ice caps, which can melt quickly because they do not have the bulk that larger glaciers have to stay cold. As a glacier disappears, more bedrock is exposed, which then heats up and accelerates the melting process.“The very small ones, we’re losing them dramatically,” he said, citing researchers’ reviews of satellite imagery. “You feel like you’re on a sinking island chasing these features, and these are large features. It’s not as if it’s a little tiny patch of ice you find in your garden.”The ice shelf collapse on Ellesmere Island also meant the loss of the northern hemisphere’s last known epishelf lake, a geographic feature in which a body of freshwater is dammed by the ice shelf and floats atop ocean water.A research camp, including instruments for measuring water flow through the ice shelf, was lost when the shelf collapsed. “It is lucky we were not on the ice shelf when this happened,” said researcher Derek Mueller of Carleton University in Ottawa, in an Aug. 2 blog post.Ellesmere also lost its two St. Patrick Bay ice caps this summer.“We saw them going, like someone with terminal cancer. It was only a matter of time,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado.Serreze and other NSIDC scientists had published a 2017 study predicting the ice caps were likely to disappear within five years. The ice caps were believed to have formed several centuries ago.The vanishing was confirmed last month, when NASA satellite shots of the region revealed a complete lack of snow and ice, said Serreze, who studied the caps as a graduate student on his first trip to the Arctic years ago. At the time, he said, the caps had seemed like immovable parts of the geography.“When I was there in the 1980s I knew every square inch of those ice caps,” he said. “You have the memories. It’s like your first girlfriend.”Meanwhile, another two ice caps on Ellesmere - called Murray and Simmons - are also diminishing and are likely to disappear within 10 years, Serreze said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-last-fully-intact-arctic-ice-shelf-collapses/story-sIcnbxddqNCXcmbwJrmBFK.html

Globally, 40 percent of all cases have been recorded in the two countries.Germany is the latest to introduce mandatory tests for travellers returning from designated risk zones, starting on Saturday, as fears grow over rising case numbers blamed on summer holidays and local outbreaks.Germany’s list of “risk zones” currently includes most non-EU countries, as well as certain provinces in Belgium and Spain. Neighbouring Austria on Thursday announced it would issue a travel warning for mainland Spain, becoming the latest country to do so amid a rise in new coronavirus cases in the fellow EU member.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Finland also introduced new controls on arrivals from some EU countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands and Andorra, putting a stop to tourists arriving from there and imposing a 14-day quarantine on other returnees.“The situation is extremely delicate,” the health ministry’s strategic director Liisa-Maria Voipio-Pulkki said, adding that “some sort of second stage has begun.”“Whether we can expect a smaller wave or a larger wave depends on how we respond.”Britain has reimposed quarantine for travellers from Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas.Norway announced Thursday that France would be considered a red zone due to the resurgence of coronavirus cases there, meaning all travellers arriving from France face a mandatory ten-day quarantine. Switzerland, Monaco and the Czech Republic were also hit with similar restrictions, as well as two Swedish regions, the Norwegian foreign affairs ministry said.“The infectious situation can change quickly, as can the restrictions,” Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide said.The United States bucked the trend despite its own soaring death toll, lifting a blanket warning against all foreign travel.“Health and safety conditions (are) improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others,” the State Department said in a statement.Business struggles Many nations are seeing new outbreaks, forcing local or citywide lockdowns and other quarantine measures.Poland will re-impose compulsory face masks in all public spaces in nine districts amid a new high in infections.The restrictions will come into force from Saturday and will also affect sports and cultural events in those areas, mainly in the south and east.Greece’s government on Wednesday announced a “wake-up week” on COVID-19, tightening restrictions after the steady rise in mostly domestic infections.Officials have blamed the increase on overcrowding in clubs and social events.The new virus outbreaks are forcing officials into an uncomfortable trade-off between public health and the need to bring economies back to life.German airline Lufthansa on Thursday became the latest to reveal the fallout from the pandemic, announcing forced layoffs and a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) loss in the second quarter.

07-08-2020||World||Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God||President Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president’s faith in God.Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump’s remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.“He’s following the radical left agenda, take away your guns, destroy your 2nd Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy, our kind of energy. I don’t think he’s going to do too well in Ohio,” Trump said.Biden’s campaign responded that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s faith is “at the core of who he is.”Trump also used his trip to Ohio to talk trade, telling workers at a Whirlpool plant, “I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country.”Barely one month after a new North America trade agreement went into effect, Trump announced his intention to reimpose 10% tariffs on aluminum imported from Canada, saying that United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has advised him the step was necessary to defend the US aluminum industry. However, the move also sets up the possibility of retaliation against US companies and producers.“Canada was taking advantage of us as usual,” Trump said.The administration said the president had exempted Canada last year from tariffs he had imposed as long as imports of steel and aluminum from Canada remained at historical levels. But there has been a surge that has intensified in recent months despite a contraction in US demand.Trump also sought to remind voters of the economic prosperity that much of the nation enjoyed before the coronavirus pandemic and said that he is best suited to rebuild a crippled economy. But his handling of the outbreak has weakened his bid for a second term, causing Trump to spend time and resources in a state he won easily in 2016 but now could be in danger of slipping away.The virus already altered the trip even before Trump landed, with word that GOP Gov. Mike DeWine had tested positive for the coronavirus. DeWine had planned to meet with Trump and join the president on a visit to the Whirlpool Corp. plant in northwest Ohio. DeWine’s office said the 73-year-old governor had no symptoms and was returning to Columbus.Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded to Trump’s comments by saying, “Joe Biden’s faith is at the core of who he is; he’s lived it with dignity his entire life, and it’s been a source of strength and comfort in times of extreme hardship.”Bates also accused Trump of using a Bible “for his own cynical optics as he sought to tear our nation apart at a moment of crisis and pain,” a reference to when federal law enforcement officers drove protesters out of Lafayette Square shortly before a photo opportunity in which Trump held a Bible.For Trump, the Ohio trip kicked off a long weekend of fundraising that comes as Biden has chipped away at Trump’s financial advantage with the race entering its final three months.The virus upended Trump’s plan to run on the back of a strong economy, and Biden has charged that the president has pushed to reopen states too soon in hopes of jump-starting the markets and lifting his standing in the polls. But several states have had to slow down the pace of their reopening, and officials are warily watching a rise in coronavirus cases in the Midwest, including Ohio.When Trump swept through the region in 2016, his economic populism argument was one of the factors that led him to narrowly capture Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. He handily won Ohio, which had been a swing state for decades, by eight percentage points.He promised a manufacturing renaissance, but that has failed to materialize. Manufacturers added jobs during the first two years of his presidency, but the gains effectively stalled in 2019 as industrial Midwestern states such as Michigan and Ohio began to shed factory workers.The import taxes charged by his administration hampered manufacturing companies’ supply lines and created uncertainty. The economy had roughly 12.85 million factory jobs at the start of the election year, compared with the 14 million before the 2008 financial crisis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The pandemic only compounded the pain. Manufacturers cut 1.36 million jobs between February and April as the economy went on lockdown. Hiring in May and June has pointed to a slight recovery. But even if factories add 267,500 jobs expected in the July employment report being released Friday, the sector would still have 500,000 fewer jobs than it did before the outbreak.Trump now finds himself severely tested in battleground states, and campaign aides have privately all but written off Michigan. The president now has been forced to spend time in states that his campaign once thought he had locked up. The Ohio trip comes a week after he visited once deeply Republican Texas.“We’re going to win Ohio by even more this time,” Trump claimed.In Ohio, Trump signed an executive order requiring that the federal government purchase certain drugs from US manufacturers rather than from foreign companies. The order would instruct the government to develop a list of “essential” medicines and then buy them and other medical supplies solely from US manufacturers.The administration has long looked to reduce US dependency on drugs made overseas, particularly in China. The new order invokes the Defense Production Act to procure essential medicines and other equipment from the United States, but does not stipulate precisely which drugs would fall under the requirements.Trump has said he wants to prepare for future pandemics by replenishing the national stockpile and bringing manufacturing of critical supplies and equipment back to the US His critics have suggested that his administration was woefully unprepared for coronavirus, which has killed more than 157,000 Americans, and that Trump has faltered in mobilizing the nation’s resources to battle the virus.After his trip to Ohio, Trump plans a long weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with a high-dollar fundraiser in the Hamptons on New York’s Long Island and a second near the Jersey shore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/playing-electoral-defense-trump-claims-biden-opposes-god/story-uREdpPARIalqrMtaV5A6BM.html
07-08-2020||World||Trump targets Canada, reimposing tariffs on aluminum||President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States is reinstating a 10% import tax on Canadian aluminum, raising tensions with an American ally just weeks after his trade pact with Canada and Mexico took effect.Canada quickly vowed to respond in kind.Trump originally imposed the tariffs on aluminum imports in 2018. He then lifted them last year on Canadian and Mexican metals to smooth the way for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. The USMCA took effect July 1 and was expected to bring stability to North American trade.Instead, Trump declared Thursday that he is reimposing the tariffs on Canada. Speaking at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio, the president said that Canada had promised that “its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all of our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they did.’’Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called the tariffs “unwarranted and unacceptable” and said Canada intends to swiftly impose dollar-for-dollar countermeasures.“In the time of a global pandemic and an economic crisis, the last thing Canadian and American workers need is new tariffs that will raise costs for manufacturers and consumers, impede the free flow of trade, and hurt provincial and state economies,” Freeland said in a statement.Trade lawyer Daniel Ujczo with Dickinson Wright PLLC in Columbus, Ohio, predicted that Canada will retaliate with tariffs of its own — unless US and Canadian negotiators can reach a truce before the tit-for-tat import taxes begin.Ujczo said the tariffs appear designed to win Trump election year support from voters in Ohio, an industrial state. But the tactic, he said, might not work during an economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.“Voters here in Ohio were willing to give the president a long leash on tariffs when the economy was strong’’ and Trump was using the sanctions as leverage to get a North American trade deal, Ujczo said. But “the dealmaker in chief already got his win with Canada and Mexico. These folks will see it as nothing more than a political tool in a time of economic hardship.’’Aluminum imports from Canada rose sharply from February to March but have since leveled off and actually dropped 2.6% from May to June, according to the Aluminum Association trade group.“Claims of a ‘surge’ of primary aluminum imports from Canada are simply not accurate,’’ said Tom Dobbins, the association’s president. He added: “Especially now, the US should be focused on getting the manufacturing economy going again in the region – not picking battles with USMCA trading partners.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-targets-canada-reimposing-tariffs-on-aluminum/story-w4rbvHYEvdQ7pe2uhRMjkM.html

07-08-2020||India||Air India jet skids off runway, breaks apart; at least 15 dead||At least 15 people are dead after an Air India Express plane carrying 191 passengers and crew skidded off the runway and broke apart while attempting to land in southern India.The Boeing Co. 737 operating Flight 1344 from Dubai came to rest in a valley near a hilltop airport in Kozhikode, India. The plane touched down with a tail wind, according to archived data of the airport’s weather. The area surrounding the airport has been hit by torrential rains since Thursday, India’s weather office said.Most passengers were workers returning home after losing their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic, while some others were visitors who were stranded. India has banned scheduled international commercial service because of Covid-19 and only allowed repatriation flights with special permission from regulators.Rescue personnel were on the scene and survivors were being taken to the hospital for treatment. No fire was reported at the time of landing.“We regret that there has been an incident regarding our aircraft,” Air India Express said in a statement. Help centers were being set up in Sharjah and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.Aviation regulators in the UAE had no immediate comment.Table-Top AirportThe plane operated by Air India Ltd.’s overseas, low-cost unit overshot the runway at 7:41 p.m. local time. According to a playback on flight-tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane circled the airport in the southern state of Kerala several times before attempting to land.The so-called table-top airport is located on a hill with limited space at the end of the runway, and several international airlines had stopped flying bigger aircraft including Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 jets into Kozhikode due to safety issues over the length on the runway.The Hindu newspaper reported in 2018 that authorities ignored a proposal to install a system to stop planes from plunging off the edge.The last fatal plane crash in India was in 2010, when an Air India Express Boeing plane overshot the runway at Mangalore -- also a table top -- and burst into flames, killing 158 people. That was the first fatal crash of a passenger aircraft in India in a decade.Common AccidentsWhile not as deadly as some types of crashes, accidents during landing are among the most common, according to statistics compiled by Boeing.Almost half of all fatal crashes from 2009 through 2018 occurred during final approach and landing, according to Boeing.Such accidents have mostly occurred as a result of actions by pilots, such as touching down too far along a runway, approaching at higher speeds or failing to properly slow a plane, according to accident reports.Weather can sometimes play a role, such as when runways are wet and braking is less effective. However, standard flight procedures are designed to take weather into account, so landings are only permitted when conditions are safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-jet-skids-off-runway-breaks-apart-at-least-15-dead/story-CXSdZfWx45LQrq8rrEuMdI.html

07-08-2020||India||No objectionable media report on Markaz, Centre tells Supreme Court||The Centre on Friday told the Supreme Court that it did not find any objectionable content being aired by the media about the Nizamuddin Markaz event even as the National Broadcasters Association (NBA) and the Press Council of India (PCI) informed of 150 complaints pending with them with regard to the same incident. The top court was hearing a petition filed by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind that pointed out media reports were trying to demonize Tablighi Muslims who attended the Markaz and related stories showing how they were responsible for defying Covid-19 prevention protocols and causing the pandemic to spread. The Jamiat highlighted the issue so that in future the Centre could take corrective steps to prevent such reporting. Jamiat’s petition was heard on Friday by a bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. The Court allowed Jamiat to file its response to the Centre’s affidavit and posted the matter for hearing on August 26. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting filed its affidavit disclosing its stand that it totally opposed the prayer in the petition which amounts to a “blanket gag order” against the entire media in respect of reporting on the Nizamuddin Markaz event which is a free speech right protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The affidavit said, “Such an order (to gag the media) would inevitably also impinge upon freedom of the citizen to know about the affairs of the society and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society.” About the incident in question, the Centre said, “Insofar as the Markaz issue is concerned, Union of India has neither come across nor has been intimated with any specific media report which has violated the provisions of Cable Television Network Rules 1994, Guidelines for Up-linking from India, and the Programme Code prescribed under Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995.” During the hearing, the Court sought to know the stand of NBA and PCI who are parties to the petition. NBA counsel Nisha Bhambani said, “We have received around 100 complaints and we are going to issue notices (to media organizations).” For PCI, senior advocate Preetesh Kapur said, “We have taken cognizance of around 50 complaints.” The bench observed, “It is our experience that governments don’t act till Court gives directions…We want to pass order but feel handicapped. We want opinion of an expert body which is equipped to go into all this.” The bench suggested seeking the view of NBA headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice (Retd) AK Sikri. Jamiat’s counsel senior advocate Dushyant Dave told the Court, “NBA is an advisory body which can only deal with complaints filed before it.” The Court has asked both NBA and PCI to submit their reports based on complaints received. Jamiat’s petition had referred to news reports which sought to paint a picture that “demonized” the Markaz attendees as persons who spread the COVID-19 pandemic. The petition also highlighted media reports which showed some of the attendees who refused to follow social distancing and openly defied COVID-19 prevention protocols. Dave submitted to the Court that the Centre’s response indicated an adversarial stand. The Centre said that the facts cited in these news reports are “neither per se false nor per se fake” and such reports cannot be censured. It further added, “Dissemination of such facts by the media houses, even though they may appear to be offensive or distasteful to certain individuals or section of society is nevertheless protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-objectionable-media-report-on-markaz-centre-tells-supreme-court/story-2blYPvcItNpFJIPWBwzTlM.html

07-08-2020||India||Sushant Rajput case: Centre moves SC amid tussle between Mumbai and Patna||The Union government approached the Supreme Court on Friday to be made a party in the transfer petition filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty challenging the case against her in Bihar in the death of her boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.“The impleadment is in the interest of justice and would not cause prejudice to any of the parties in the present transfer petition,” the Centre told the top court. The actor wants the FIR filed against her quashed on the ground that the Bihar Police lacks jurisdiction to probe the case. The FIR accuses Rhea and her family of abetting the 34-year-old actor’s suicide. The case is now being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The apex court had recently sought responses from Bihar, Maharashtra and Krishna Kishore Singh, father of the late actor, on Rhea’s plea.The probe into Sushant’s death at his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14 has been a bone of contention between Bihar and Maharashtra. Before the CBI stepped in, the two states – Maharashtra and Bihar - were locked in a battle over who has the right to investigate the case. While the Mumbai police has claimed it had the exclusive right since the incident occurred under its jurisdiction, the Bihar police filed an affidavit on Friday claiming that Section 179 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) says offence may be inquired into or tried by a court where the consequence of an offence has ensued. In this case, the consequence of the unnatural death was in Patna, where the late actor’s family resides. The Bihar government, in an affidavit filed through advocate Keshav Mohan, said that the non-cooperation “casts a serious aspersion on the role of Mumbai police, who is apparently siding with the petitioner for the reasons best known to them.” Crucial case evidence such as inquest, post-mortem and FSL (forensic science laboratory) reports, CCTV (closed-circuit TV) footage etc have not been provided to Bihar Police despite several requests, the affidavit stated. In their probe so far, the Bihar Police claimed to have recorded statements of 10 persons linked to Rajput. The Bihar SIT even verified bank account details of Rajput based on his father’s complaint that close to Rs 15 crore were transferred from his account to unknown persons not linked to him. The father had even complained that his son’s finances, including bank account and credit cards, were being looked after by Chakraborty. “Given the sensitivity of the matter and the inter-state ramification and presence of most of the accused in Mumbai,” the Bihar top cop recommended the investigation of the case to be handed over to the CBI. With the case now firmly resting in CBI’s hands, Bihar’s jurisdiction is out and it is the Centre which Maharashtra has to contest against in continuing with its probe. A fresh petition came up before the Supreme Court on Friday which demanded that the entire case has not yet gone to CBI as the agency is only examining the FIR filed by Bihar Police. The petition, filed by a law student, Dwivendra Dubey, failed to impress a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde. “You are a total stranger who is unnecessarily interfering in the case. The victim’s father is pursuing the case,” the court said dismissing the petition. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared in the matter to inform that the CBI has taken over the probe from Patna police. Rhea’s transfer petition remains the focus as the apex court had clarified on Wednesday that it would determine which investigation agency has jurisdiction to probe the case. The Mumbai police is yet to respond while the Bihar police has dismissed Rhea’s petition to be “misconceived, premature and not maintainable”. “The possibility of the Rhea Chakraborty case being argued out on the next date in the Supreme Court can only be possible if the Maharashtra government defends its jurisdiction. “The CBI cannot operate without express consent of Maharashtra. I also see the possibility of Mumbai Police completing its probe and putting it before the Court on the next date and saying we have nothing more to investigate. Only a thin chance remains that Maharashtra will accept the situation as fait accompli and concede ground to CBI, which I doubt will happen,” Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde told Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-rajput-case-centre-moves-sc-amid-tussle-between-mumbai-and-patna/story-6904cjMmhORATSyzJyQVFK.html
07-08-2020||India||1st ‘Kisan Rail’ for perishables flagged off, transportation cost may dip by Rs 1000 per tonne||The first ‘Kisan Rail’ train for transportation of perishable goods with refrigerated coaches to assist farmers aimed at ensuring a fast transportation of agricultural produce across the country was flagged off on Friday from Deolali in Maharashtra to Danapur in Bihar. It is expected to reduce transportation costs by Rs 1000 per tonne compared with roadways and reduce travel time by around 15 hours, a railway ministry official said. The train will operate from Deolali to Danapur. Central Railway’s Bhusawal Division is primarily an agriculture based division. This train has been provided scheduled halts at Nasik Road, Manmad, Jalgaon, Bhusaval, Burhanpur, Khandwa, Itarsi, Jabalpur, Satna, Katni, Manikpur, Prayagraj Chheoki, Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay Nagar and Buxar. This is a weekly service which will run every Friday form Deolali, and return on Sunday from Danapur. The scheduled time of the journey is 31 hours and 45 minutes (one-way).“Nasik and surrounding regions produce huge quantities of fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers, other perishables, onions and other agro products. These perishables are mainly transported to areas around Patna, Prayagraj, Katni, Satna etc,” the railway ministry said.The Centre had announced plans of starting special parcel trains called ‘Kisan Rail’ in the Budget this financial year. In her Budget 2020 speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Indian Railways will set up a “Kisan Rail” through public private partnership (PPP) with refrigerated coaches for transportation of perishable goods inclusive of milk, meat and fish.“The Nasik/Bhusawal region has a huge production of fruits as well as green vegetables, such as onions and green chilies. This produce was moving largely by road towards the eastern part of country, and Railways’ share in this transportation was miniscule. But with efforts of Railway officials, this traffic is now coming towards Railways – as the time to be taken by Rail is approximately 15 hours lesser than the road, and the freight charges are also cheaper by more than Rs 1,000 per tonne,” the official said.Reefers, or refrigerated containers, facilitate the movement of cargo that requires a strict temperature-controlled environment. At present, the railways’ subsidiary CONCOR provides reefer services. Cold chains as a business area involve providing transportation to perishable products from source to end-user while maintaining a certain temperature along the route.“Out of nearly 2000 loaded freight trains running every day, around 10 trains are of perishables where onion is the main commodity. When loaded in wagons we are nearly 25%, when loaded in parcel we would be around 10 % cheaper approximately. As of now we are pretty insignificant in perishables but since there are volumes here we have targeted this for getting a larger share,” the official said.Absence of reefer container linkages and high and increasing power costs are proving to be a major hurdle in the growth of import and export of perishable cargo.“Indian Railways aims to help double farmers’ income with the launch of Kisan Rail. This train will help in bringing perishable agricultural products like vegetables, fruits to the market in a short period of time. The train with frozen containers is expected to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of fish, meat and milk, the ministry said in a statement.The train is presently planned with 10 parcel vans with a total capacity of 238 tonnes.“Any farmer or any other interested party can directly book their consignments in this train, without any lower limit on the size of consignment. The consignment can be as small as 50-100 kgs, and can be booked from any stopping station to any other stopping station – giving full flexibility. Regarding loss/damage of products for any reason, Railways already have a well-established claim/compensation system – through which the party can get compensation for its losses,” the official added.The train was flagged off via video conferencing by union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railway minister Piyush Goyal.Speaking on the occasion, Goyal said, “This train will serve as a milestone in doubling farmers’ income. Indian Railways and farmers have been at the forefront in the battle against Covid-19 and the challenges it led to. Foodgrains freight was doubled during the period. Interest of Indian farmers is being looked after like never before. I am looking forward to see the day when apples of Kashmir reach Kanyakumari through Kisan Rail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-kisan-rail-for-perishables-flagged-off-transportation-cost-may-dip-by-rs-1000-per-tonne/story-rrcCSaM2LuIH868WoB8CUL.html

While the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh is the focus of the current border tensions, Indian forces are in a heightened state of alert all along the border with China stretching from Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh. Top commanders briefed Naravane on the prevailing security situation, deployments and the army’s operational preparedness in the eastern and central sectors at Tezpur on Thursday and Lucknow a day later, the people said.

The attack resulted in the loss of more than 250 innocent lives and damage to property worth millions of dollars. The perpetrator of that incident also, unsurprisingly, continues to enjoy patronage in a neighboring country, a hub for arms trafficking and narcotics trade, along with other terrorists and terrorist entities that have been proscribed by the United Nations,” India said during the debate.Watch: ‘Absurd’, ‘obsessed’: India slams Pakistan over map claiming Gujarat, J&K partsIndian agencies believe that Dawood Ibrahim is being protected by Pakistan’s ISI, which has further used his network for its own objectives. Pakistan, aided by China had attempted to raise Kashmir issue at the UNSC for the third time since last August to coincide with the anniversary of the revocation of the Article 370, but UNSC rebuffed the attempts calling it a bilateral issue. During the discussions, India called out Pakistan for cross border terrorism and stressed that there can be no justification of any form of terrorism to counter Pakistan’s narrative on Kashmir.“Terrorism is one of the most serious threats that mankind faces today. The scourge of terrorism does not distinguish between countries and regions. It is the grossest affront to the enjoyment of the inalienable human right to life and to live in peace and security. India strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. There can be no justification of any form of terrorism. And looking for root causes for terrorism is akin to finding a needle in a haystack,” India said at the UNSC debate.New Delhi highlighted that it has been a victim of terrorism sponsored from across the border and explained in detail the linkage between transnational organized crime and terrorism, stating that it had “first hand” “experience” of the “cruel linkage”.Also Read: Reject China’s interference in internal affairs: IndiaIndia also urged the United Nations to enhance its coordination with bodies like Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which have been playing a significant role in setting global standards for preventing and combating money laundering & terrorist financing.The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

07-08-2020||India||Explore restoration of 4G mobile internet services in J-K: SC tells Centre||The Central government should explore the possibility of restoring 4G mobile internet services in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir (J-K) in view of the statements by former Lieutenant Governor (LG) of J-K GC Murmu advocating the same, the Supreme Court said on Friday.The top court was hearing a petition filed by NGO, Foundation for Media Professionals in June seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the Central government and J-K for failure to comply with the apex court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speed in the union territory.“LG has said that there is no difficulty in restoring 4G. You have to give (an) explanation to that,” Justice R Subhash Reddy, who was part of the three-judge bench hearing the matter, told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who appeared on behalf of J-K.Mehta pointed out that the LG of J-K has changed and new LG Manoj Sinha has taken over.“LG is not part of the review committee. In your response, don’t go strictly by whether or not contempt is there. You should also say whether 4G can be restored in areas (where there is no trouble),” Justice Reddy remarked.The apex court had on May 11 ordered the constitution of a committee comprising high ranking government officials to review restrictions on 4G in the union territory. The committee was to comprise the secretary of ministry of home affairs, secretary of ministry of communications and the chief secretary of J-K. This order was passed in an earlier plea filed in April by the same NGO pointing out that lack of 4G services in the union territory was causing great difficulties to medical health professionals and general population during the Covid-19 pandemic.The NGO then approached the apex court in June filing the present contempt petition claiming there is no information available in the public domain about whether the constitution of the special committee has been notified and whether it has conducted any meetings or passed any orders.The Centre filed a response to the contempt plea on July 21 stating that the review committee was constituted as per the May 11 directions of the court and it took a decision against resuming 4G services for the time being. The Centre has consistently maintained that restoring 4G will benefit anti-India elements and terrorists who will utilise the same for speedy communication.Former LG of J-K, GC Murmu told the media on July 24 that restoration of 4G services in J-K will not be a problem and Pakistan will continue with its propaganda even if mobile internet speed is restricted to 2G. The petitioners highlighted Murmu’s statement to augment their case when the matter was heard on July 28.“We have attached a news report showing the L-G has made a statement that 4G services should be restored. It is also in line with the statements by J-K interlocutor Ram Madhav. I have submitted those media reports,” senior counsel Huzefa Ahmadi, who was appearing for the petitioner, had told the court.The Centre had then said that it will verify the statement and get back to the court.When the matter came up for hearing on Friday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for J-K sought time to file a response to the rejoinder affidavit filed by the petitioner. The court allowed the same and adjourned the case for August 11 while making it clear that no further adjournments will be allowed.The J-K administration had issued an order on March 26 restricting internet speed in mobile data to 2G.The petitioner had moved the top court against that order claiming that patients, doctors and general public were unable to access latest information, guidelines and advisories about Covid -19 due to restrictions on mobile internet speed. It was also pointed out that slow internet speed also renders telemedicine (diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunication) or online video consultation impossible.The Supreme Court, in its May 11 judgment, refrained from passing directions to restore 4G mobile internet services in J-K instead constituting the special committee comprising high level government officers to take a call on the same and examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain geographical areas of the newly formed union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explore-restoration-of-4g-mobile-internet-services-in-j-k-sc-tells-centre/story-rt7dcMOSuVL3L9nJsNsQsI.html

07-08-2020||India||2 MP officials shunted out over alleged mishandling of youth celebrating Ram temple ceremony||Two officials, including one from the police, were shunted out from Madhya Pradesh’s (MP) Khargone district late at night on Thursday following a protest by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and traders over the alleged manhandling of youths by the district and police authorities, who were celebrating the bhoomi pujan ceremony for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on the previous day. The youths, who were celebrating after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday presided over a bhoomi pujan ceremony in Ayodhya for the construction of the Ram temple on the site of the 16th Century Babri Masjid, was allegedly manhandled following the district and police authorities’ orders. Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Abhishek Gehlot and sub-divisional officer of police (SDoP) Gladwin Edwardkar have been shunted out to the state secretariat and police headquarters, respectively, by the Shivraj Singh-led government in MP. The transfer order was issued after angry traders downed shutters in Kharogone town and took out a protest march on Thursday, demanding action against the alleged errant officials. BJP’s Gajendra Singh Patel, who represents Khargone constituency in the Lok Sabha, and the party’s national general secretary, Kailash Vijayvargiya, also demanded action against the two officials for their alleged out-of-line action. The members of jewellers’ association in Khargone alleged that the police officer beat the youths in Sarrafa Bajar while they were celebrating by bursting firecrackers, as the centuries-old dream of constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya became a reality on Wednesday. SDM Gehlot allegedly misbehaved with the youths. While police seized the firecrackers, beat a section of the youngsters and took around 10-11 of them to the local police station, leading to mob fury, allegedly unleashed by unidentified goons, in the town at night on Wednesday. Vallabh Bhandari, a member of jewellers’ association in Khargone, narrated the sequence of events. “A section of youths, including an employee in my showroom, Neeraj Joshi, were celebrating at Sarrafa Bazarthe on the occasion of bhoomi pujan for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. However, two officials, along with a team of police personnel, reached the spot and thrashed some of the youths, who were in a joyous mood. They took around 10-11 of them to the police station. None of the elected public representatives came to our help. The youths were released after around 700 people reached the police station. The district and police administration’s reckless act emboldened a mob that went on a rampage at night in our locality, where a number of local residents sustained injuries. However, no first information report (FIR) was filed regarding the mob fury,” Bhandari said. He maintained that the local residents have protested, as the district and police authorities manhandled the youths for celebrating a momentous joyous occasion. The district police authorities, however, joined issued with Bhandari’s assertions. “There is a ban on the bursting of crackers in Khargone, a communally-sensitive town. The situation could have snowballed into a communal conflagration had timely action was not taken,” said a police official, requesting anonymity. State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta was quick to wade into the row and blamed the ruling BJP for the incident. “Similar incidents have been reported from Guna, Dewas, and other places, where district authorities have a free hand to run amok and harass locals. Officials have been transferred to divert the public’s attention from the issue. The BJP is responsible for a spike in such incidents,” Gupta alleged. State home minister Narottam Mishra justified the officials’ transfer. “Prima facie, the SDM and SDoP were found guilty and they have been transferred. The state government is in control of maintaining law and order Khargone town,” Mishra told media persons. SDO Gehlot evaded his transfer issue and said that he “is busy in a meeting and will speak later”. While SDoP Edwardkar was not available for his comment, despite repeated attempts. KS Sharma, ex-chief secretary, MP, said, “The district authorities need to do a tightrope walk between maintaining law and order and taking actions that come across as prudent and efficient for the larger community good.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-two-officials-shunted-out-over-alleged-mishandling-of-youth-celebrating-ram-temple-ceremony/story-aLCn5e3XQyS4bj7essmSeL.html
07-08-2020||India||Seers demand memorial pillars for those who lost lives for Ram temple||Hundreds of seers, led by the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), want ‘kirti stambhs (memorial pillars)’ to be built in Ayodhya and Prayagraj (near Sangam) with names of people who dedicated or lost their lives in the Ram temple movement. ABAP is the apex decision-making body of 13 top Hindu sects in the country. The seers plan to get a resolution passed by the Akhara Parishad in this regard and then send a formal proposal for the pillars to the Centre through the state government. Parishad general secretary Swami Hari Giri said the struggle for Ram temple in Ayodhya continued for decades and many people lost their lives during it. “Take the example of former VHP chief Ashok Singhal who even gave his home for the struggle or Kothari brothers ((Ram Kumar and Sharad Kothari of Kolkata), who died in police firing in Ayodhya on November 2, 1990. Now that the construction for the temple is all set to start after the ‘bhoomi poojan’, we want ‘kirti stambhs’ to be constructed in their honour in Ayodhya and Prayagraj,” he said. Giri said he has prepared a proposal for these ‘kirti stambhs’, including installation of a statue of Ashok Singhal, to be built near the Sangam with names of those who played important roles in the struggle engraved on it. “The plan is to get the proposal passed by the Parishad members and then send it to the central government for implementation,” he claimed. He also said that seers also want all cases registered against people during the struggle to be withdrawn. “Now that this struggle for a Ram temple in Ayodhya is over, cases registered in connection with it should also be withdrawn. We have already made a formal request in this regard to the state government,” he said. ABAP chief Mahant Narendra Giri said the seers have also decided to henceforth celebrate August 5 — the Ram temple ‘bhoomi poojan’ day – like Diwali every year. On August 5, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally launched the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying the temple will be testimony to a “modern symbol of Indian culture”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seers-demand-memorial-pillars-for-those-who-lost-lives-for-ram-temple/story-unubnYUrH7GXaMnQ6DX5jK.html

The committee would hand over its report to the state government for compliance and further necessary action in two months. The committee constituted under the chairmanship of inspector general (SDRF) Uttarakhand police will have expert members from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, Geological Survey of India (GSI) and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). HT has a copy of the order. These three institutions have been mandated to “nominate suitable officers, scientists, faculty members in the committee who are well qualified, trained and experienced in shallow subsurface investigation to identify objects/human remains as also in retrieving these and having experience of working in the high altitude Himalayan terrain” According to the order issued by secretary disaster management department, the committee would “meet as and when required and deliberate upon various aspects of the problem and would if required, visit the Kedarnath area”.Also Read: To boost religious tourism in Himalayan state, Uttarakhand to develop ‘Ramayana Circuit The committee, according to the order, has been mandated to invite any expert that it deems fit for discussion, consultation and advice. The state government apprised the high court about the order in its affidavit to the court on Friday during the hearing of a PIL filed by Delhi-based activist Ajay Gautam in 2014. The PIL had sought directions from the HC to authorities concerned to take proper and expedient steps to search missing persons in the June 2013 Kedarnath tragedy so that their last rites could be performed according to the Hindu tradition. Ajay Gautam said he had suggested the HC that a committee of experts should be constituted to look into the issue and come up with some mechanism through which the missing bodies could be recovered and their last rites could be held as per the Hindu tradition. Also Read: India objects to omnidirectional CCTV cameras set up by Nepal at Uttarakhand border“I am happy that a high-level committee has been formed. After this decision, the PIL has been disposed of by the HC. I have been fighting for this cause since 2014. I hope in the coming time this will provide closure to families of these thousands of missing people,” said Gautam. On June 22, 2020, HC had directed Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology to suggest scientific ways that can be adopted to trace 3,075 bodies of missing people in Kedarnath region without harming the Himalayan environment Since the tragedy in 2013, 699 dead bodies/skeletons/remains have been recovered so far from Kedarnath area. In November 2016, the HC had directed the state government to form special investigation teams (SITs) to trace and cremate the bodies of the 2013 disaster victims. Following the directions, the state government in May 2017 had constituted five SITs for searching the bodies of the victims. On September 4, 2019, Uttarakhand government had filed an affidavit, stating that excavating the fragile Himalayan terrain to trace the bodies of 3,075 people still missing in the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy could cause “irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment”. The state government in its affidavit stated that “it is not possible technically to pinpoint the location of human remains under the debris and excavating the recently accumulated thick pile of debris in search of human remains would amount to inviting yet another disaster in this ecologically highly fragile zone. It is, therefore, most humbly prayed that unearthing of human remains be left to forces of nature and the state government commits to DNA sampling and ceremonial cremation of these”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kedarnath-tragedy-expert-panel-to-find-remains-of-3-075-people-missing-since-2013-floods/story-ChhsKNaQf4qvqO4OrNgAvI.html

He was asked not leave Kerala and appear before it on Aug 13 when the charge sheet will be read out in the court. The court had cancelled his bail last month when he repeatedly failed to appear before it. Later, he moved the High Court and Supreme Court, but both refused to entertain his plea to quash the case. ALSO READ | ‘See no merit in your petition’: SC to rape-accused bishop Franco MulakkalPublic prosecutor Jithesh Babu told the court that earlier Mulakkal had claimed he had tested positive for Covid-19, but had failed to produce a certificate showing that he recovered from the illness. Then the court directed health officials to check the claim. On the last two occasions, he skipped the court saying he was staying in a containment zone in Jalandhar and later he said he had tested positive for coronavirus. But the prosecution questioned the veracity of both claims. The case surfaced in 2018, after a 43-year-old nun complained to the police in Kottayam that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab.

07-08-2020||India||Now, QR code scanner to help get hospital beds for Covid patients in Andhra||Amid complaints that Covid-19 patients were being denied admission in government and private hospitals citing non-availability of beds, Andhra Pradesh administration has come up with a digital solution to help ease the situation. The state medical and health department has developed a “QR code” to help find available beds in 138 hospitals across the state. The people can scan the QR code and check for availability in their respective areas. “The code will disclose which hospital has how many beds and how many of them are available for admission,” an official in the chief minister’s office familiar with the development said on Friday. According to the official, the QR code facility has been created in the wake of several complaints about non-availability of beds, forcing the Covid-19 patients to run from one hospital to another. “This initiative to use the ‘QR code’ technology is an attempt to not only diversify the options but also reduce the response time in case of emergencies,” the official said. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has instructed that the patients must be provided beds in hospital within 30 minutes of contacting the authorities on toll-free numbers 104 and 14410. The CM warned of stringent action against hospitals that deny admission to people who contracted coronavirus. He also asked the medical and health department officials to monitor the facilities available in the hospitals and see that the bed availability be displayed online. The officials said there are about 32,000 beds in the 128 district Covid-19 hospitals, and 8,000 in 10 state-level Covid-19 hospitals, and patients are admitted to either of these facilities based on their health. “With the rise in the number of cases the workload on the state-level helplines has been increasing. So, the QR code facility will help people get access to the information about hospital beds,” the official said. The total number of positive cases for Covid-19 in the state is nearing two lakh and the number of deaths has mounted to 1,753. However, the state government has claimed that the positivity rate for the disease and the mortality rate in the state are less than the national average. “While the national average of Covid-19 positivity is 8.87 per cent, Andhra Pradesh average has been 8.56 per cent, while that of Karnataka is 9.88 per cent, Tamil Nadu 9.26 per cent, Maharashtra 19.36 per cent and Delhi 12.75 per cent. When it comes to mortality rate, the national average is 2.07 percent while the state average is 0.89 per cent,” said an official to CM Reddy at a review meeting earlier today. Stating that the state had conducted more than 2. 3 million tests till now, Jagan said about 85 to 90 per cent of the tests are being conducted in the containment areas. He also directed that the authorities ensure timely admission of Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms in the hospitals so as to reduce the mortality rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-qr-code-scanner-to-help-find-beds-for-covid-19-patients-in-andhra/story-seqbZBX4xXNBiiFWGD8ULO.html
07-08-2020||India||Supreme Court junks ‘unnecessary’ PIL for CBI probe into Sushant Singh’s death||The Supreme Court Friday dismissed a PIL seeking a CBI or NIA probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, saying “strangers” are “unnecessarily” coming when his father is already pursuing the case. Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. Mumbai police has been probing the case and recorded statements of 56 people including Bollywood directors like Aditya Chopra, Mahesh Bhatt and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian junked the PIL filed by Mumbai-based law student Dwivendra Devtadeen Dubey on the issue. “Deceased’s father is pursuing the case. There is no reason that he will not pursue it properly. You are an stranger in this matter and you are unnecessarily coming in this. We will not permit this,” the bench said. “Don’t waste our time. Dismissed,” it said. During the brief hearing conducted through video conferencing, the apex court was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the CBI has taken over the investigation in Patna case. “One case is lodged in Mumbai and other in Patna. The Bihar government had requested for CBI probe and we agreed,” he said, adding that the Mumbai case has not been transferred to the CBI so far. Dubey, a law student, had sought the transfer of the FIR, lodged by Sushant’s father Krishan Kishore Singh at Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna to either to the CBI or the NIA to ensure that the investigation is carried out “impartially, effectively and efficiently”. Earlier during the day, the Bihar government filed an affidavit in the apex court seeking dismissal of Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty’s plea for transfer of the Patna FIR against her to Mumbai in actor Rajput’s death case terming it “premature, misconceived and non-maintainable”. The apex court had on July 30 junked a similar PIL seeking transfer of probe into Rajput’s death case from Mumbai police to the CBI. “Go to Bombay High Court if you have anything concrete to show,” the court had said while dismissing the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-junks-unnecessary-pil-for-cbi-probe-into-sushant-singh-s-death/story-CbtyUGvNKbxOYOrg0AA1aK.html

We will develop all of them and bring it under our initiative of Ramayana circuit to boost religious tourism in the state,” state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said. The minister was among the saints present in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya during the foundation stone-laying ceremony. “We have some holy sites and temples in the state which are linked with Ramayana. We will develop all of them and bring it under our initiative of Ramayana circuit to boost religious tourism in the state,” Satpal said. Revealing more details on the concept, Satpal said, “We have Bharat and Shatrughan temple in Rishikesh where it is believed that the two met Lord Ram to urge him to return to Ayodhya from his sojourn in the forest. Apart from this, we also have Raghunath temple in Devprayag which was visited by Lord Ram.” “We will link all of these places and develop them. It will help the people know about the significance of Uttarakhand in Ramayana as well as attract them to visit,” said Maharaj. The tourism minister also said that he had discussed the concept with Union minister of tourism Prahlad Singh Patel a few days ago. “I urged him to assess the possibility of developing similar circuits in all those states which have some connection with Ramayana. I also urge him to get a study done on the significance of Ramayana on some of the South East Asian countries where it is a part of their culture,” said Maharaj. Uttarakhand tourism department has also been developing Mahabharat circuit and Sita circuit in the state to boost religious tourism. “We are already working on them. This new circuit will also open new avenues of religious tourism in the state,” said Maharaj. In November last year, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had announced that the state government will be developing a Sita Mata circuit in Pauri Garhwal district to attract pilgrims and tourists from across the world. It is in this part of the Himalayas, according to Hindu tradition, Sita went inside earth. It is believed that Goddess Sita went inside the earth in the Phalswari village of Pauri Garhwal district where a small Sita Mata temple stands to mark the event. The village is situated at a distance of 15 km from the Pauri town, which witnesses a Sita Mata fair every year for three days in the month of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-boost-religious-tourism-in-himalayan-state-uttarakhand-to-develop-ramayana-circuit/story-O5vNKvg7v1QzLvyHUO5uVM.html

All states in the region have boundaries with other neighbouring nations and several of them are also battling insurgency and heavy deployment of armed as well as paramilitary forces are common in most of the seven states. The north-east has recorded around 68,000 Covid-19 cases to date. Assam tops the region’s viral caseload with 52,817 Covid-19 cases, followed by Tripura (5,743), Manipur (3,217), Nagaland (2,580), Arunachal Pradesh (1,948), Meghalaya (990), and Mizoram (539). “In Nagaland, over 40% of the total Covid-19 cases are detected among the personnel of paramilitary forces. We held a meeting with various security forces on Thursday, where they themselves decided to reschedule the entry of their personnel to the state until September or such time the situation stabilises,” said Abhijit Sinha, principal secretary (home), Nagaland. Of the 2,580 positive cases detected in Nagaland until Thursday, 1,117 were from paramilitary/military personnel. While testing is done by the state health department, the Covid-19 patients’ management is done by the paramilitary forces themselves. Faced with an increasing number of Covid-19 cases among paramilitary forces, the Mizoram government on Tuesday imposed a ban on the entry of the security forces personnel to the state until August 15. Around 250 of the total 539 Covid-19 cases in Mizoram are from paramilitary forces. The development came a day after Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to temporarily withhold inter-state movement of paramilitary personnel in August to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state, whose healthcare infrastructure is less than basic. “A large number of Covid-19 cases have been detected among paramilitary forces in Manipur. The government has regulated the entry of paramilitary forces into the state and those who enter will have to follow the Covid-19 safety protocols,” said Manipur health minister L Jayantakumar Singh. Of the 3,217 Covid-19 cases detected in Manipur until Thursday, 536 were from security forces. “Since we share a border with China, we can’t stop the entry of paramilitary or defence forces to Arunachal Pradesh because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But we are conducting rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests of all those security personnel, who is entering the state,” said Arunachal Pradesh health minister Alo Libang. Those found asymptomatic are sent to facilities managed by paramilitary forces, while the symptomatic Covid-19 patients are shifted to government-run hospitals, he added. In Arunachal Pradesh, of the total 1,948 cases detected until Friday morning, 738 were from the military and paramilitary forces. “Meghalaya also has seen a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases among paramilitary personnel, including 80% of them have reported to the state’s viral caseload to date. We are conducting RAD tests in all the six border entry points to the state,” said Meghalaya health minister AL Hek. Until Thursday, 248 personnel from various armed forces have tested Covid-19 positive in Meghalaya, including 201 from the Border Security Force (BSF) alone. Indian Army and BSF officials in Assam failed to provide details of Covid-19 cases detected among their personnel in the north-east’s most populous state. According to Assam Police’s additional director-general of police (ADGP) (law and order) GP Singh, 2,078 personnel from Assam Police has been found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, until Thursday. While 1,495 of them have recovered from their viral infection, five have died due to Covid-19. Of the 5,743 Covid-19 positive cases detected in Tripura until Thursday, 306 were BSF personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paramilitary-forces-contribute-sizeable-chunk-to-covid-19-cases-in-northeast/story-IKU0WBFQjYkSgPtfRNJZjL.html
07-08-2020||India||Italy has assured to prosecute marines for killing Indian fishermen: Centre||The Indian government has told the Supreme Court that Rome has assured New Delhi that the Italian marines responsible for killing two Indian fishermen in 2012 will be prosecuted there after an international court held that they could not be tried in Indian courts due to immunity cover enjoyed by them.The government made the above statement during hearing of its petition in the Supreme Court to close the case against two Italian Marines guilty of shooting Indian fishermen but the court said that it would first hear victim fishermen’s families before allowing Centre’s plea for closure and asked it to file a fresh plea making victims’ family members as parties to its application. The court has also asked the Centre to ensure that adequate compensation is paid to families of fishermen killed by Italian marines.The case against Italian marines was being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The agency officials had indicated earlier this month that the Centre will move SC for closure of the case in the aftermath of the judgement by the UN Tribunal that said India couldn’t prosecute the marines.Also Read: India to follow UN court order in Italian Marines case, Supreme Court toldThe five-member arbitral tribunal, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, said India is entitled to compensation in the case but said the marines deserve immunity and that India is “precluded from exercising its jurisdiction” in the case. The UN tribunal said the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials and ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them.Kerala High Court had earlier in a May 2012 judgment held that India had the jurisdiction to try the Italian marines since their act of shooting fishermen was neither in the defence of the vessel nor the state.The Italian marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, moved the Supreme Court against the judgement following which the Supreme Court later granted them conditional bail allowing them to return to Italy in 2016.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has opposed the withdrawal of the case against the marines and asked the Centre to explore the possibility of a review petition.Also Read: Italian Marines case ruling won’t affect India’s rights in exclusive economic zoneThe two fishermen were killed after the marines fired upon them, in Indian waters off the shore of Kerala, from an oil tanker they were deployed to protect from pirates. The ship was intercepted and brought to Kochi, where the marines were arrested and charged with murder. NIA finalised a charge sheet against the marines in November 2013 when the probe report was submitted to the home ministry.The ministry, in January 2014, had initially given a sanction to prosecute the marines under the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms on Continental Shelf Act and for murder and attempt to murder. The act provides for a death penalty. The sanction was withdrawn a month later after a review of charges held that the case did not warrant applying this act.NIA was then asked to press charges related to murder, attempt to murder and causing damage to the boat of the fishermen. India had accused Italy of attempting to delay the process of prosecution at every step.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/italy-has-assured-it-will-prosecute-italian-marines-for-killing-indian-fishermen-centre-tells-sc/story-McKDAoBxCoKJ9LbwuFITPN.html

According to the police, the incident took place in the wee hours of Wednesday when the baby, who was sleeping with his parents, was kidnapped from his house in Sonai Kajidahar area after the abducters s gained entry by breaking the window panes. “As soon as we got information we started the investigation and were able to nab all the three accused on Wednesday evening itself. On sustained interrogation they admitted to murdering the child soon after the kidnapping,” said Cachar superintendent of police Bhanwar Lal Meena. Based on the information provided by the accused, the body of the infant was dug out from a forest area on Thursday night. “Though the kidnappers made ransom calls in order to divert probe or maybe try and extract some money, the ransom doesn’t seem to be the main motive. We are trying to ascertain the motive, which could be something personal as one of the accused is the maternal uncle of the dead child,” said Meena. The body has been sent for post mortem and a case has been lodged under various section of IPC for kidnapping for murder, theft and trespass. Following detection of the infant’s body, dozens of local residents blocked a road in the area demanding stringent punishment for the accused. According to the police, the situation is under control and vehicular movement has been restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-arrested-in-assam-for-abduction-murder-of-5-month-old-infant/story-WRIuAeeG5qk544RxeHqsSJ.html
07-08-2020||India||Long-term symptoms likely to be experienced by hospitalised Covid-19 patients identified||Scientists, including one of Indian origin, have identified a pattern of longer-term symptoms likely to be experienced by people hospitalised with the Covid-19 infection, which include fatigue, breathlessness, psychological distress and a general decline in quality of life. The study, published in the Journal of Medical Virology, found that some patients, particularly those who had been in intensive care, had symptoms associated with cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “Covid-19 is a new illness and we have very little information on longer term problems in individuals after discharge from hospital,” Manoj Sivan, Associate Clinical Professor at the University of Leeds in the UK. “The emerging evidence is that for some, the road to recovery may take months and it is vital specialist rehabilitation is on hand to support them. This research gives an important insight into patient needs, and that will help shape services in the community,” Sivan said. The research team followed 100 people recovering from Covid-19, four-to-eight weeks after being discharged from hospital in Leeds. The Covid-19 survivors were divided into two groups: those who had become critically ill and needed intensive care -- 32 people were in this category; and those who were treated on a ward without needing intensive care -- 68 people were in this category. Patients were contacted by a member of the hospital’s rehabilitation team and asked a series of questions about their recovery and symptoms they were still experiencing. The most prevalent symptom was fatigue, the researchers said, adding over 60 per cent of people who had been treated on a ward reported fatigue, and one-third of them described it as moderate or severe. They noted that for patients who had been in intensive care, 72 per cent reported fatigue. Of those, more than half said it was moderate or severe. The study found that the second most common symptom was breathlessness. People in both groups said they had feelings of breathlessness which had not existed before they contracted Covid-19, according to the researchers. This was higher in the group that had been the most ill, the intensive care group versus those who had been treated in a ward, they said. The third most prevalent symptoms, the researchers said were neuropsychological. They found that almost one quarter of the people who had been on a ward and just under a half of the people who had been in intensive care had some of the symptoms of PTSD. “PTSD symptoms are a well-recognised component of post- intensive care unit syndrome caused by a variety of factors including fear of dying, invasive treatment, pain, delirium, inability to communicate, weakness, immobility, and sensory problems and sleep deprivation,” the researchers said. More than two-thirds (68.8 per cent) of patients in the intensive care group and just under half (45.6 per cent) of the other group said their overall quality of life had deteriorated, they noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/long-term-symptoms-likely-to-be-experienced-by-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-identified/story-qdeLq4WmACg2DPBPcu7adI.html

A tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the Rashtriya Swachhata Kendra (RSK) was first announced by the prime minister on April 10 2017 on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of Gandhiji’s Champaran ‘satyagraha’.After taking a tour of the RSK, located near Raj Ghat, Modi will interact with 36 school students from Delhi, representing the 36 states and union territories, at the amphitheatre of the RSK, adhering to social distancing protocols, an official statement said. This will be followed by his address.The installations at the RSK will introduce future generations to the successful journey of the world’s largest behaviour change campaign, the Swachh Bharat (clean India) Mission, it said. A balanced mix of digital and outdoor installations in the RSK will impart information, awareness and education on swachhata (cleanliness) and related aspects. The complex interplay of processes and activities will be presented through assimilative learning, best practices, global benchmarks, success stories and thematic messages in an interactive format.In hall 1, the visitors will experience a unique 360 degree audio-visual show, which will narrate India’s Swachhata story -- a journey into the largest behaviour change campaign in the history of the world, the statement said. Hall 2 contains a series of interactive LED panels, hologram boxes, interactive games and much more, to tell the story of the work done to achieve Gandhi’s vision of a Swachh Bharat. The open air displays in the lawn adjacent to RSK will showcase three exhibits which are anecdotes from the journey of India from “Satyagraha to Swachhagraha”. The artistic wall murals around the centre also chronicle the core elements of the Mission’s success, the statement said. The Swachh Bharat Mission has transformed rural sanitation in India and has changed the behaviour of over 55 crore people from open defecation to using a toilet. India has received high praise from the international community for this and we have set a precedent for the rest of the world to follow, it observed. The mission is now in its second phase, aiming to take India’s villages from Open Defecation Free (ODF) to ODF Plus, with a strong focus on sustaining ODF status and ensuring solid and liquid waste management for all, it pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-rashtriya-swachhata-kendra-on-saturday-interact-with-students/story-GTdO67dDnAVitGjMC1IAQI.html

He said that it is not effective after an advanced stage of the infection. If given on time, before the patient needs a ventilator, then it is effective,” Jain said. A total of 1,299 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in New Delhi on Friday, taking the total number of cases to 1,41,531, including 10,348 active cases, he said. On the incident of rape of the 12-year-old girl in Delhi’s Paschim Vihar, Jain said that it was a very unfortunate incident and strict action should be taken against the perpetrators. Jain also spoke about the condition of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s official residence that reportedly had a cracked roof and leakage problems. “It is a very old building and nothing concrete has been decided about shifting from his current residence.

07-08-2020||India||‘No allegation of any bias in NEP’: PM Modi on teaching in students’ mother tongue||Asserting that the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 brought in by his government was free from any “bias or inclination” Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday strongly backed initiatives like using the mother tongue as the medium of instruction in schools in the much-awaited reform.Addressing senior educationists in the Conclave on Transformational Reforms in Higher Education, organized by the HRD ministry and the UGC, PM Modi said rather than effect changes in the teaching-learning system, the new policy could even lead to changing the way the society thinks.“After the NEP came, there was no allegation from any region or segment that it had any kind of bias or inclination. This is an indicator that the changes people wanted to see for years in the education system, they have got to see,” the Prime Minister said.ALSO READ | PM Modi says ‘fully committed’ to ensure complete implementation of NEP 2020He said now there was the question of the implementation of the NEP and as far as political will was concerned, he was completely there.“Every country aligns its education policy with its values and carries out reforms keeping in mind the national goals. The aim is to ensure the education system can make the coming generations future-ready,” PM Modi said.The NEP will prepare the foundation of 21st century India, he said adding areas like skills had been given special focus.“For a long time there were no major changes in our education system. Rather than promote curiosity and imagination, the emphasis was on a rat-race whether it was to become a doctor, engineer or some other profession,” the Prime Minister said.ALSO READ | NEP focuses on ‘how to think’ instead of ‘what to think’: PM ModiA new world order and standard is evolving with time, said PM Modi adding we have to make our students global citizens but also stay connected to the roots.“There is no debate that the children when they are taught in school in the same language that is spoken at home, their pace of learning becomes faster. This is a major reason, wherever possible, permission has been granted to teach students till class V in their mother tongue,” the Prime Minister said.Language was a major contentious aspect in the NEP and the HRD ministry has tried to steer clear of controversies by repeatedly emphasizing that no language would be imposed on any state or region.In his speech, the Prime Minister said the focus in the country’s education policy in the past was ‘what to think’.“In the new policy the focus is on how to think,” he said adding students should get a chance that they should follow their passions. And if the student wants, he or she, should be able to leave it, he said.The Prime Minister said it was important to know - what to study - in an age when all kinds of information is available on the phone itself. We are also moving towards an era where a person may not stick to a profession throughout life and re-skilling and up-skilling are important aspects, he said.The Prime Minister also delved into the issue of social mindset.“We have to think how in a country with a rich culture did evils like upper and lower classes, considering labour as less dignified – creep into the mindsets of people. One reason is that the education was disconnected with a segment of our people,” said PM Modi.He said there are concepts like virtual labs, introduction of coding and others in the NEP 2020. This can help in changing not just the education system but the thought processes of the entire society, he said.The National Education Policy is not a mere circular but requires thorough strategy and roadmap for proper implementation. Willpower is needed for its implementation, he said.An attempt has also been made in the policy that the talent of India should stay in India, he said. Speaking further PM Modi said the route to good quality education falls somewhere between autonomy and government control. The National Education Policy (NEP) has focussed highly on student education and dignity of labour, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-allegation-of-any-bias-in-nep-pm-modi-on-teaching-in-students-mother-tongue/story-R4njHsl7KrCqQE2edKh7dO.html

07-08-2020||India||Karnataka issues revised guidelines for disposal of bodies of Covid patients||Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Karnataka, the state’s health department has issued fresh guidelines for the disposal of bodies of Covid patients.“Although an increased risk of Covid infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling the body is unlikely, the lack of scientific data requires the utmost care to avoid the inadvertent spread of Covid-19 during these times,” the statement from the health department’s press release read, emphasising on the dignity of the dead and the religious and cultural tradition. The 23-page press release elaborated on guidelines regarding testing, handling of dead bodies and other specificities in relation to the management of Covid-19 bodies. “Testing should not be insisted in every case of death, but only when they have a recorded history of influenza-like symptoms. The body should be handed over to the family members/ relatives in a dignified manner immediately after swab collection and hospitals should provide handouts with a list of dos and don’ts in English and Kannada laying down relevant information,” the statement said. It added, “At the mortuary, health care workers, mortuary staff and the family of the deceased body shall not come in direct contact with the dead body and must wear full personal protective equipment (PPE). If the family or relative are for any reason unable to cremate or bury the body, the local health authority shall arrange for the dignified last rites as per the religious traditions of the family.”Regarding autopsies (post mortem) on Covid-19 bodies, the state department said that they should be avoided, except in necessary circumstances.The statement also gave detailed guidelines regarding the appropriate recording of Covid-19 deaths in line with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. Additionally, the health department made a statement about the admission procedure for Covid positive patients referred by other district administrations saying, “It is now mandatory for all the referrals from the BBMP admission and discharge of Covid positive patients to be done through the online Covid Hospital Bed Management System (CHBMS).”The state’s count of coronavirus cases was 1,51,449 in the past 24 hours.So far, a total of 2,804 people have died due to Covid-19 in the state, while the average recovery rate in Karnataka is 49.3 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-issues-revised-guidelines-for-disposal-of-bodies-of-covid-patients/story-j97UYZRuSguwNxDb9NpNxH.html
07-08-2020||India||Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh may see temperature rise of 7 degrees by 2100: Study||Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh may witness a temperature increase of up to 6.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the century due to climate change, according to a study which warns that the glaciers in this Himalayan region could shrink by 85 per cent if the projections come true. The study, published in the journal Climatic Change on July 29, predicted the impact of future climate change in the Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh Himalaya, by the end of the twenty-first century using an ensemble of 11 models under three greenhouse gas emission scenarios. It also highlights the changes in the distribution of the prevalent climate zones in the region. “The study has been carried over the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir, including Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Aksai Chin and other regions across the Line of Control (LoC),” noted Professor Shakil Ahmad Romshoo, Dean of Research at the University of Kashmir. “The average annual temperature is projected to increase by 4.5 degrees Celsius, 3.98 degrees Celsius, and 6.93 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty first century under three different scenarios, respectively,” Romshoo, lead author of the research, told PTI. The temperature increase of 6.9 degrees Celsius for the Jammu and Kashmir Himalayas is way more than the projected average rise in the global and national temperatures by the end of the century. Romshoo added that if the current emission rates of greenhouse gases are sustained, the global average temperature is likely to rise by nearly 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century under the worst case scenario. Similarly, the average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4 degrees Celsius under such a scenario, he said. Romshoo noted that there will be significant impacts on almost every sector of the economy in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh due to this climate change driven temperature increase. “The glaciers, the most important resource of the region, are going to shrink by around 85 per cent by the end of the century if the projections come true,” the professor at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, noted. He explained that this would lead to significant depletion of the streamflows in the Indus basin, the waters of which are shared between several countries in South Asia. Similarly, the impacts on agriculture, horticulture and even tourism shall significantly threaten the livelihood of the dependent population in the region, the environmentalist warned. The researchers, including Jasia Bashir and Irfan Rashid from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, noted that the drivers of climate change are primarily the increasing emission rates of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emission is directly related to fossil fuel use, industrialisation, deforestation, air pollution, and other environmental unfriendly activities across the globe, they explained. “Though, the mountainous regions like Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are the least industrialised, unfortunately, they are bearing the brunt of the climate change as the phenomena has global dimensions and footprint,” Romshoo noted. The projected climate change under the three emission scenarios also indicates significant changes in the distribution of prevalent climate zones. The projected climate change under different scenarios revealed that the subtropical and temperate climatic zones would expand while the cold desert climate zone is projected to shrink significantly under all the three scenarios, the researchers noted. “The cold desert climate zone in the Ladakh region would shrink by 22 per cent and correspondingly the subtropical and temperate zones would expand due to the projected climate change,” the researchers noted in their study. “The projected changes in the climate and climate zones by the end of the twenty-first century would have significant impacts on various sectors in the region which might lead to the redistribution and changes in the composition of vegetation, enhancement of snow depletion and glacier recession,” said Romshoo. He noted that the situation would also lead to an increase in the frequency of climate extremes, changes in streamflows, in the faunal and floral biodiversity, plant invasions, changes in agriculture and horticulture productivity. This is in addition to the loss of hydropower generation, ecosystem services, and impacts on other key economic sectors in the region, according to the researchers. “The vital information generated in this research would inform policymaking for framing robust strategies for adaptation and mitigation of the impacts of climate change on various socioeconomic and ecological sectors in the region,” Romshoo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-jammu-and-ladakh-may-see-temperature-rise-of-7-degrees-by-2100-study/story-ckOBym5AK3pHy9EcrsXxOM.html
07-08-2020||India||15 killed, 53 feared trapped in Kerala landslide; massive rescue operation on||Fifteen people have been killed and around 50 others are feared trapped in a mound of slush and rock debris after a massive landslide razed a tea plantation workers’ settlement in Rajakkad in Idukki district of Kerala in the early hours of Friday.At least 16 people were rescued and rushed to the hospital, said Idukki district collector H Dineshan, adding that heavy downpour and foggy climate in the area is hampering rescue operations. He said the tragedy came to light in the morning after one of the escaped workers alerted forest officials at the Eravikulam national park.“It is a major tragedy. It is a hilly terrain and some roads connecting to the settlement were washed away in torrential rain. We have sought the Air Force help for airlifting the injured but we were told it will be difficult in inclement weather,” said State Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan adding a team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has arrived at the scene. Local people said the area has been witnessing heavy rains over the last three days and power and communication networks in the area were disrupted due to this. This delayed the rescue work. Since the mishap took place in the early hours, many of those affected were in deep slumber due to which they couldn’t escape, they said. “We have information that at least 84 people lived in the settlement. Most of them are from neighboring Tamil Nadu. And there was also a canteen to cater to their needs at the settlement,” said Parthasarathy, a social worker from the area. He added that the the toll may go up.The place where the incident took place is about 25 kilometre away from hill resort Munnar which was ravaged by 2018 flood.The India Metrological Department (IMD) has declared red alert in three districts, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Idukki, and orange alert in five other districts. Many rivers are in spate after heavy downpour and the irrigation department said shutters of some dams, including Idukki, will be opened if the wet condition continued.The Met office said a low pressure area was brewing in Bay of Bengal and it is expected to gain speed by Saturday triggering heavy rains which will last till Sunday. The NDRF has rushed six teams to Wayanad and Idukki. In the hilly area many families were shifted fearing landslides and health authorities said Covid-19 protocol will be in force in all the relief camps. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has asked people to be more vigilant in view of twin threats of inclement weather and Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-killed-60-feared-trapped-in-kerala-landslide-locals-say-toll-may-go-up/story-qR4ZLrT26DuPYI18fCJq4N.html
07-08-2020||India||‘Unheard in law’: SC on 2008 Congress-Communist Party of China MoU||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to entertain a petition seeking a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the Congress and the Communist Party of China in 2008.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, asked the petitioners to approach the high court first before moving the Supreme Court. The petitioners subsequently proceeded to withdraw the petition.“How can a political party enter into an agreement with China. It is unheard in law,” the bench remarked.The petitioners - Shahshak Shekhar Jha, a Delhi-based advocate and Savio Rodrigues, the editor of Goa based online news portal, Goa Chronicle - submitted that the MoU raises concerns regarding national security and should be investigated by the NIA for offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) or the CBI.Senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani, representing the petitioners, submitted that there are sinister motives behind the agreement and it should be brought out in public domain.He also asked for permission to amend the petition.The court, however, asked the petitioners why they have not approached the high court first.“The case involves issues relating to national security,” Jethmalani replied.Responding to it, the bench said that is not a bar to file the petition before the high court.The petitioners had alleged that the Congress had signed the MoU when it was leading a coalition government at the centre and it also failed to disclose the facts and details of the agreement to the public.“Petitioner No. 2 (Savio Rodrigues) had demanded the respondents to make the said MoU public, however no heed was shown in that respect which shows the malafide intention of the Respondents (Congress party and its leaders)”, the petition stated.Both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have also been made party to the case apart from the Congress party.“Issue an order directing NIA to investigate the said agreement under UAPA”, it was prayed by the petitioners.The UAPA is a law aimed at punishing those involved in terrorist activities and activities intended to bring about secession of any part of the country from the union of India.As an alternative, Jha and Rodrigues sought a court-monitored probe by the CBI. After the recent faceoff between Indian and Chinese armies at Ladakh, the Congress party had stepped up its attack on the Narendra Modi government alleging that the government failed on diplomatic and military fronts.The ruling BJP, on the other hand, countered by pointing out the MoU signed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on behalf of the Congress with the Chinese Communist Party. The MoU was signed at Beijing in the presence of Sonia Gandhi, who was then the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) headed by the Congress.Placing reliance on media reports, the petitioners submitted that at least 600 incursions happened from the Chinese side into Indian territory between 2008 and 2013.“The Congress party brought the Right to Information Act during its rule, yet it failed to be transparent in this matter which is of national importance”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unheard-in-law-sc-on-plea-for-probing-congress-china-mou-of-2008/story-4MY2oDIFplh5LNr9uvHVTJ.html
07-08-2020||India||Children painting on mother’s semi-nude body gives wrong impression about our culture: SC||The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday took exception to a Kerala-based activist uploading a video on social media of her two minor children painting on her semi-nude body. A three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, remarked that such acts are in bad taste and give children the wrong impression about the country’s culture. “You might be an activist, but why do you do all these? What kind of nonsense is this? What impression will your kids get about the culture of the country?” Justice Mishra asked. The court was hearing an anticipatory bail by Fathima AS, who is apprehending arrest for offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, after she uploaded a video on social media of her two minor children painting on her semi-nude body in June. The controversial video led to the registration of the case against her indulging in child pornography under the POCSO Act, 2012, and for publishing such content, which is an offence, under the IT Act, 2000. The Kerala high court (HC) had rejected her anticipatory bail plea on July 24. “It is an obscenity. And you are spreading it. It will leave a very bad taste,” Justice Mishra said. Senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who appeared on behalf of Fathima, pointed out that provisions relating to child pornography have been invoked against her and not obscenity. “How can it be child pornography? The children are fully clothed,” he submitted. He argued that the petitioner is not someone, who will abscond, and there was no requirement of custodial interrogation. The bench, however, dismissed the case stating the offences against the accused are prima facie made out. Fathima, in her petition, had contended that female nudity, per se, will not constitute obscenity and children painting on their mother’s body cannot be construed as child abuse. “The petitioner, while being semi-nude, has allowed her body to be used as a canvas for her children to paint on and there can probably be nobody, except a pervert, who would be aroused to sexual desire by seeing the nature of the work,” advocate Renjith Marar argued. Her message, accompanying the uploaded edited video, illustrated that she intended to normalise the female form for her children and not allow distorted ideas about sexuality to pervade their mind, Fathima submitted. “The petitioner feels that she should teach sex education to her children. For that purpose, she asks her children to paint on her semi-nude body and then uploading the same on social media. I am not in a position to agree with the petitioner that she should teach sex education to her children in this manner,” the Kerala HC had said in its order. She also cited two SC judgments in this regard to buttress her case. The first was the 2014 judgment in Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal in which the top court held that a photograph, taken by a father of his semi-nude daughter and nude son-in-law in black and white, respectively, was intended to convey an anti-apartheid message and cannot be dubbed obscene. The second judgment referred to Bobby Art International v. Om Pal, or, what is famously known as the Bandit queen case. In this case, the movie, Bandit Queen, which depicted the life of bandit-turned-politician late Phoolan Devi, had nude scenes. The apex court, however, held that nudity in the movie was not intended to arouse carnal desires, but should be considered in the context of the story and the situation in the movie. “Goddesses in Kerala are frequently depicted in idols and murals with bare breasts. When one prays at a temple, the feeling is not of sexual arousal, but one of divinity. The body painting of men is part of pulikali (a popular folk dance, where men dance with their bodies painted with tigers and leopard prints). It cannot suddenly become obscene, when the same is done on a woman,” the plea stated. Earlier, Fathima had courted controversy, when she attempted to enter the Sabarimala temple in 2018 after the SC had struck down a law prohibiting entry of women, aged between 10 and 50 years,in the hilltop shrine in Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district.She had to abandon her journey following massive protests by a mob, who had blocked her entry to the sacred shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-painting-on-mother-s-semi-nude-body-gives-wrong-impression-about-our-culture-sc/story-sC7M1hXt6OwzHCH4WOHh2J.html

07-08-2020||India||Bihar tells SC, Mumbai Police siding with Rhea, obstructing probe||The Bihar Police authorities have presented the Supreme Court (SC) tell-tale evidence that showed how the Mumbai Police was siding with late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and obstructing the probe conducted by them regarding the reasons that caused his death by suicide at his Bandra apartment on June 14. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) in the case on Thursday, a day after it was transferred to the central agency on Bihar government’s recommendation. Bihar government told the SC that the Mumbai Police did not share crucial evidence of the case and obstructed further probe and “forcibly” quarantined a Bihar-cadre Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, Vinay Tiwari, City Superintendent of Police (SP), Patna (Central), who was sent to Mumbai on Sunday (August 2) in connection with the case. An affidavit, drafted by advocate Keshav Mohan, was submitted before the SC in response to a petition filed by Chakraborty, seeking a transfer of the FIR, filed by Rajput’s father KK Singh, from Patna to Mumbai. “The non-cooperation by the Mumbai Police with the Patna Police is clear from the fact that the former has not supplied any documents such as inquest, post-mortem and FSL (forensic science laboratory) reports, CCTV (closed-circuit TV) footage etc; to the latter, despite several requests,” the affidavit stated. The affidavit pointed out that Tiwari’s quarantine was an “afterthought” by Mumbai Police to block the probe, as none of the other Special Investigation Team (SIT) officials of Bihar Police, who were in the city since July 27, were made to follow similar coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced protocols.“The aforesaid fact casts a serious aspersion on the role of Mumbai Police, who is apparently siding with the petitioner for the reasons best known to them, “ the affidavit stated. So far, Bihar Police has recorded statements of 10 people related to the Rajput death case. The statements of Chakraborty or her family members, named in the FIR, have not been recorded yet. Bihar Police also verified bank account details of Rajput based on his father’s complaint that close to Rs 15 crore was transferred from his account to unknown persons not linked to him. Rajput’s finances, including bank account and credit cards, were in Chakraborty’s custody, his father had alleged in his complaint accusing her and her family of abetting his son’s death by suicide. Bihar Police cited the reason behind recommending the CBI probe. “On the basis of preliminary investigation conducted by the Patna Police, it surfaced that the various facts and shreds of evidence surrounding the present case may be obtained in Mumbai or the rest of India and given the sensitivity of the matter and the inter-state ramification and presence of most of the accused in Mumbai, the director-general of police (DGP), Bihar, requested the Bihar government to recommend the investigation of the case to CBI,” stated the affidavit. Bihar Police denied that it lacked jurisdiction to probe the FIR lodged by Rajput’s father citing Section 179 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The provision states: “When an act is an offence by reason of anything which has been done and of a consequence which has ensued, the offence may be inquired into or tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction such thing has been done or such consequence has ensued.” Bihar Police claimed that since Rajput’s father is a resident of Patna, the state police and courts have the jurisdiction to try the offence. The affidavit stated that the case probed by the Mumbai Police relates to the probe of unnatural death under Section 174 of the CrPC, which has a limited scope and cannot be classified as information relating to a cognisable offence. Bihar Police’s affidavit held that Chakraborty’s petition is without jurisdiction, premature, misconceived and not maintainable. She had filed a petition under Section 406 of the CrPC to transfer investigation in the FIR filed at Patna to Mumbai. The affidavit said, “The FIR has been registered on July 25 and the case is still at the primary stage of the investigation. Hence, the transfer petition filed by the petitioner under 406 CrPC is not maintainable and it is liable to be dismissed at the very outset.” Bihar Police also claimed that there is nothing in Chakraborty’s petition that showed bias on their part towards Rajput’s family members to demand probe to be shifted out of Patna to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-tells-sc-mumbai-police-siding-with-rhea-obstructing-probe/story-qjiNaaMPBDM45aXxF1Mp5K.html

07-08-2020||India||Manoj Sinha takes oath as new Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir||Former union minister and BJP leader Manoj Sinha took oath as the new Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. He is the second Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir after the state was bifurcated and made into a union territory last year. Sinha replaced Girish Chandra Murmu, who after his resignation on Wednesday was appointed as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).A three-time member of Parliament and a minister in the Narendra Modi government’s first term at the Centre, Sinha’s appointment as Lt Governor comes at a time when the region is grappling with multiple issues, from security concerns to a tumultuous social and political landscape .Choosing a politician instead of a bureaucrat or a retired army man is also being read as a signal of New Delhi’s intent to foster friendly ties with the state’s bureaucracy and its people and bank on Sinha’s ability to juggle statecraft with legislative limitations.On Thursday morning while leaving home for his new address in J&K, Sinha’s only comment to the waiting media retinue was “accha hai” (it is good).After Satyapal Malik, who was governor of erstwhile J&K state, Sinha is the new political touch to the Valley - both Malik and Sinha are grassroot politicians with the latter an alma mater of IIT-BHU, Varanasi. He lost the last Lok Sabha election to strongman and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Afzal Ansari.Sinha has represented the parliamentary constituency of Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh thrice in the Lok Sabha. He has also served as minister of communications and minister of state for Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manoj-sinha-takes-oath-as-new-lieutenant-governor-of-jammu-and-kashmir/story-wGLUEciEj4LMtuRmyMBoPJ.html

07-08-2020||India||Donald Trump cites India to ban ‘national security risk’ Chinese TikTok||US President Donald Trump’s order to ban US transactions with Chinese owners of short video-sharing app TikTok and messenger app WeChat cited India’s decision to purge the two applications earlier in June. The US restriction on the transactions will kick in after 45 days, mid-September.“The risks are real,” the presidential directive said, accusing the mobile applications of capturing vast swaths of information from its users that may potentially be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. The data captured by TikTok could potentially allow China to track locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.The US President went on to cite restrictions on use of TikTok on federal government phones by the US armed forces, homeland security and the transportation security administration.Then he turned to India’s ban on Chinese mobile applications to build the case for his own set of restrictions.“The Government of India recently banned the use of TikTok and other Chinese mobile applications throughout the country; in a statement, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asserted that they were “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India,” President Trump said.For its ban on WeChat, a mobile app largely used by the Chinese community in the United States, Trump referenced restrictions placed by India and Australia.“These risks have led other countries, including Australia and India, to begin restricting or banning the use of WeChat. The United States must take aggressive action against the owner of WeChat to protect our national security,” he said.India, which has been locked in a standoff with China at its border in East Ladakh, was the first country to axe 59 mobile applications with close links to China. India said these apps threatened the country’s “sovereignty and integrity”India’s 29 June order did not explicitly ban people from using the mobile apps. But it forced app stores to boot out the 59 applications, and later their proxies, presenting the world with a model to strangle the ability of Chinese mobile apps to operate.Trump’s ban uses the same template, his payback to China that has right from the beginning shut out US apps and websites such Facebook and Google from operating in China and instead, helped build its brand of technology firms such as Alibaba Group holding to Tencent Holding.The first impact of the US directive was visible in the share market, erasing $ 30 million from the Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd ’s market value and sending the yuan to its biggest slump in two weeks, according to news agency Bloomberg. Before Friday’s drop Tencent was worth $686 billion, making it the world’s eighth-largest company by market capitalisation and bigger than Berkshire Hathaway Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donald-trump-s-ban-on-tiktok-leans-on-india-says-risks-are-real/story-9qr2rA5D0Lv5T4EJCLnNsI.html

The ED had filed a money laundering case in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput based on the basis of a First Information Report filed by the Bihar police.Sushant’s father, KK Singh, had alleged that there were unexplained transfers from his son’s bank account involving actor Rhea Chakraborty and others.The late actor’s father had accused Chakraborty of having befriended his son in May 2019 with the intention of furthering her own career, said officials.Watch : Sushant death case: Rhea Chakraborty appears before ED l Key details The ED will probe allegations of alleged mishandling of Rajput’s money and his bank accounts. The agency will probe if anyone used Rajput’s income for money laundering and creating illegal assets, the officials said.Legal experts said that an ED probe is different from the one conducted by the local police as according to normal criminal law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but under PMLA (prevention of money laundering act), a person is presumed guilty until he proves his innocence.The 34-year-old actor, who had starred in films such as Chichhore, Kai Po Che and Kedarnath, was found dead at his Mumbai home on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhea-chakraborty-appears-before-ed-after-it-rejected-her-request-to-defer-questioning-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case/story-xe8ioIA8TDqA2W4dJku73M.html
07-08-2020||India||Jaishankar, Pompeo discuss meeting of Quadrilateral dialogue in near future||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his US counterpart Mike Pompeo discussed the holding of a meeting of the Quadrilateral dialogue or Quad in the near future, against the backdrop of growing tensions with China. The Quad, which also includes Australia and Japan, was upgraded to the ministerial level last September. China has always viewed the grouping with suspicion, though Indian officials have said it is not directed against any country. The matter figured in a phone conversation on Thursday night between Jaishankar and Pompeo, the external affairs minister said in a tweet on Friday. He described the conversation with Pompeo as wide-ranging. “Exchanged views on responding to the Coronavirus challenge. Discussed meeting in the Quad format in the near future,” Jaishankar tweeted. A readout of the conversation from the US state department said the two leaders discussed efforts to “address recent destabilising actions in the region” – an apparent reference to the India-China border standoff and Beijing’s activities in the South China Sea – and that the two leaders were looking forward to Quadrilateral consultations. The two leaders reviewed bilateral cooperation, “including working of relevant mechanisms” and shared “assessments on regional and global issues including South Asia, Afghanistan, Indo-Pacific & beyond”, Jaishankar said in another tweet. The US readout said Jaishankar and Pomeo “agreed to continue close cooperation on a full range of regional and international issues and look forward to Quadrilateral consultations and the US-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue later this year”. It added that Pompeo spoke to Jaishankar about bilateral and multilateral cooperation on issues of international concern, “including efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, support the peace process in Afghanistan, and address recent destabilising actions in the region”. Pompeo and Jaishankar “reiterated the strength of the United States-India relationship to advance peace, prosperity, and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe”, the readout added. India is preparing to include Australia in this year’s edition of the Malabar exercise, which brings together the navies of India, Japan and the US. Experts have also called for greater cooperation between members of the Quad in the face of China’s assertive actions across the region. Australia has been critical of China’s actions along the Line of Actual Control and in the South China Sea. After a recent meeting with Jaisshankar, Australian high commissioner Barry O’Farrell said his country Australia opposes any attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo on the LAC, as this will only increase tension and the risk of instability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-pompeo-discuss-meeting-of-quadrilateral-dialogue-in-near-future/story-gMhBG4BFshlOoKBCzZofSO.html

07-08-2020||India||PM Modi says ‘fully committed’ to ensure complete implementation of NEP 2020||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday he is “fully committed” to the National Education Policy (NEP), which was launched last month, as he assured it will be implemented fully.PM Modi said while addressing the conclave on ‘Transformational Reforms in Higher Education under NEP’ that the education policy was approved after extensive discussions for more than three to four years and taking over lakhs of suggestions into consideration.“It is natural for some people to question that after such a big reform was brought on paper, how will it be implemented at the ground level. That is, now everyone’s eyes are towards its implementation,” PM Modi said.“All of you are directly involved with the implementation of the National Education Policy and therefore your role is very important. As far as political will is concerned, I am fully committed to it and I am with all of you,” he added.The Prime Minister said the NEP 2020 is being widely discussed across the country and that people from different fields and different ideologies are giving their views and reviewing the policy. “This is a healthy debate. The more it is, the more benefit the country’s education system will get,” he said.“It is also a matter of happiness that after the National Education Policy was launched, no one raised any doubt whether it is biased or is leaning towards one side,” he added.The conclave is being organised by the ministry of education and the University Grants Commission (UGC) through video-conferencing. Union human resource development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and Union minister of state for communications Sanjay Dhotre were also present at the event.A number of dignitaries, including the chairperson and members of the committee for draft NEP, as well as eminent academicians and scientists also attended the conclave.The Prime Minister has said the Centre’s New Education Policy stressed on building job creators instead of job seekers and emphasised that the time had come for increased focus on learning, research and innovation in the field of education.“The 21st century is an era of knowledge. This is the time for increased focus on learning, research, innovation. This is exactly what India’s National Education Policy, 2020 does. We are focussing on the quality of education in the country. Our attempts have been to make our education system the most advanced and modern for students,” PM Modi told students at a virtual interaction last Saturday.The Union cabinet had passed India’s first new National Education Policy last month in at least 28 years, recommending primary education in local languages, facilitating the possible entry of foreign universities in India, creating a single higher-education regulator, and easier board examinations in wide-ranging reforms aimed at making the Indian education system more contemporary and skill-oriented. The policy also sets ambitious targets: increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to 50% from the current 26%, creating an additional 35 million seats in colleges, and increasing the education budget to 6% of the GDP from the present 4%. The NEP lays down that by 2040, all higher education institutions (HEIs) shall aim to become multidisciplinary. It also says that by 2030 there will be at least one large multidisciplinary institution in or near every district. It also moots Special Education Zones (SEZ) in backward districts.The policy, drafted by a committee headed by former Isro chief K Kasturirangan submitted its report last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fully-committed-pm-modi-assures-complete-implementation-of-nep-2020/story-Ew6NEWESmduIUMp58QeKOK.html
07-08-2020||India||Highlights | NEP will play role in reducing gap between research and education in India: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered the inaugural address at the ‘Conclave on Transformational Reforms in Higher Education under National Education Policy’ on Friday. The PM said that the New Education Policy was approved after extensive discussions for more than three to four years and taking over lakhs of suggestions into consideration. He also said that the National Education Policy will play a major role in reducing the gap between research and education in India,Here are the highlights of the PM’s address:- PM Modi congratulates Prof Kasturirangan for the NEP.- NEP is not just a circular, we have to show strong determination to implement it. - I urge you all to have webinars, discussions on New Education Policy: PM to teachers- In NEP, one important point has been ‘dignity of teachers’. There is a lot of stress on teacher training so that they continue to update their skills- Before NEP, our government took the initiative to give autonomy to educational institutions. I am sure that with NEP, this process will gain momentum- National Education Policy will play a major role in reducing the gap between research and education in India: PM Modi- In NEP, there is a lot of focus on ‘dignity of labour’-We are moving towards an era when a person will not stick to just one profession throughout life. Every one will have to upskill themselves. NEP has taken this into account- The NEP has given an option of ‘multiple entry-exit’ to students. They can leave the first course or take break from it and join another if they want.- Till now, our education policy focussed on ‘what to think’, but in the New Education Policy, the focus is on ‘how to think’.- We need to prepare our children to become global citizens while remaining attached to their roots-Every country goes ahead by connecting its education system to its national values & reforming it as per its national goals. It’s aimed at keeping its present & future generations ‘future ready’-After the National Education Policy came, no section of the country said that the Policy has any bias. It is a matter of happiness- NEP focuses on imparting relevant skills to the youth of our country: PM Modi- National Education Policy will set the foundation for 21st century India. We’ve given extra impetus to this national policy for ensuring that it makes Indians more empowered and easily attractive to opportunities: PM Modi- National Education Policy is being discussed across the nation today. People from different fields & ideologies are giving their views & reviewing the Policy. It’s a healthy debate. The more it is done, the more it will be beneficial to the education system of the country- National Education Policy was approved after extensive discussions over 3-4 years and deliberation over lakhs of suggestions: PM Narendra Modi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-address-at-conclave-on-transformational-reforms-in-higher-education-under-national-education-policy-highlights/story-dehOW8q8ZRrONbbFSRjg0H.html
07-08-2020||India||India’s west coast reports exceptionally heavy rain||Several weather stations in the west coast, including the Konkan region; parts of coastal and south interior Karnataka; the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu (TN), have received extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 centimetres (20 cm), in less than 24 hours, triggering landslides, urban flooding and the largescale destruction of crops and properties since Monday (August 3). Monsoon entered an active to vigorous phase over the west coast following the formation of a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday. The rain recorded in the past three days is unheard of, scientists said, even though they are yet to assess the historical data. On Monday, Mumbai’s Dharavi got 38 cm rain; Santacruz and Colaba recorded 26 and 25 cm, respectively; and Hosanagar and Bhagamandala in Karnataka recorded 21 and 19 cm, respectively. On Tuesday, Palghar recorded 46 cm; Talasari (39 cm); Dahanu (38 cm); Mahabaleshwar (32 cm); Khanvel (39 cm), while Vapi and Silvassa in Gujarat and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, respectively; Madikeri and Hosanagar in Karnataka; Jujumura and Nimpara in Odisha also recorded rainfall in excess of 20 cm. On Thursday, Vaibhavwadi in Sindhudurg recorded 71 cm rain; Avalanchi in the Nilgiris recorded 58 cm; Bhagamandala (49 cm), Colaba 33 cm, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. “These are examples of an exceptionally high volume of rain recorded in a very short span of time: between Monday and Wednesday (August 3 and 5). Monsoon trough was weak and north of the normal position during the first three days of August. With the formation of a low-pressure area, the trough shifted southwards and became active during the second half of the week. Stronger southwesterly winds prevailed over the Arabian Sea between Monday and Wednesday, with Mumbai reporting up to 107 kilometres per hour (kmph),” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. “While it is too early for an in-depth analysis of the ongoing floods, what we can say is that there is an increasing trend in heavy rainfall events on the west coast of India. In our analysis of rainfall data over the last 70 years, we find a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India. This is because the monsoon winds over the Arabian Sea are now exhibiting large fluctuations due to a warmer environment,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, in a statement. “Occasional surges in the winds drive a huge amount of moisture supply from the Arabian Sea, across the entire west coast. These episodes result in an intense rainfall spread over three days. Besides, some of my colleagues at New York University have found a slight northward shift of the monsoon westerlies in recent decades. This could mean that the chances of heavy rainfall might be larger towards the north of Western Ghats — but that aspect is yet to be explored,” he added. “Monsoon was in its vigorous phase in association with the development of a low- pressure area. Southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea were very strong. I cannot comment on each station but overall studies have shown that incidence of extremely heavy rain is increasing due to the impact of global warming,” said Dr. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general (D-G), IMD. The monsoon trough is active and is south of its normal position (Ganganagar to the Bay of Bengal), according to IMD’s latest bulletin issued on Thursday. Its western end is very likely to shift northwards gradually towards the Himalayan foothills on Saturday. Now, the low-pressure area lies over southwest Madhya Pradesh. It is very likely to become less marked by Friday. A cyclonic circulation also lies at north Konkan. Strong southwesterly/westerly monsoonal flow over the Arabian Sea with winds speed reaching 50-60 kmph along and off the west coast will continue till Saturday. Very heavy rain is expected over Gujarat, Konkan, Goa, and Madhya Maharashtra (Western Ghat areas) and isolated extremely heavy falls likely over Gujarat on Friday. Extremely heavy rain over coastal Karnataka, TN, Kerala, and Mahe is expected until Sunday. Another low-pressure area is likely to develop over west-central and adjoining north Bay of Bengal around Sunday. Under its influence, rainfall activity is likely to increase over east and central India again. There is a 1% rain deficiency over the country since June 1, with 22% deficiency over northwest India; 5% over central India; 16% excess over peninsular India and 9% excess over east and north-east India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-west-coast-reports-exceptionally-heavy-rain/story-oeYNiVr2jdWIksDyyUkYCM.html
07-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Bihar govt files affidavit in Supreme Court, says Rhea Chakraborty’s transfer plea wrong||The Bihar government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, saying the petition filed by Rhea Chakraborty to transfer the police complaint filed by Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s father in connection with his death is “misconceived and not maintainable”.According to news agency ANI, the Bihar government said it has the jurisdiction to investigate the matter. It also said that Chakraborty’s submission that the entire cause of action arose in Mumbai and it has no jurisdiction to register FIR is liable to be rejected in view of the provisions under section 179 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Bihar police started their investigation after a first information report (FIR) was registered by Rajput’s father KK Singh in Patna against Chakraborty under several sections including abetment of suicide. The Bihar government and Rajput’s family had filed caveats before the Supreme Court seeking to challenge Chakraborty’s petition.Chakraborty had last month moved the Supreme Court demanding that the FIR registered in Bihar against her be transferred to Mumbai where police are already investigating the actor’s death. She had alleged before the Supreme Court that Rajput’s father has used his “influence” in roping her in the FIR lodged at Patna accusing her of abetment of suicide of his son. The allegations in the FIR lodged in Patna against her “reflect the influence” of Rajput’s father in illegally roping her in the case, she had said in the petition seeking the transfer.“The petitioner is an actress and is into acting since 2012. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, the Petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case filed at the instance of Krishna Kishore Singh-father of the deceased…,” she had said in her plea.She had alleged that there cannot be an “impartial investigation” in Bihar for the case and sought transfer of the probe in the FIR to Mumbai.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-bihar-govt-files-affidavit-in-supreme-court-says-rhea-chakraborty-s-transfer-plea-wrong/story-cW1Ys3Tj3i3Ppnq9kTYqnM.html

07-08-2020||India||Bihar is going to change ‘disha and dasha’ of India: Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday ‘virtually’ sounded the bugle for the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar by launching a stinging attack on chief minister Nitish Kumar and his government for their alleged failure in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and flood situation in the state. Addressing a virtual meeting – his first ahead of the Bihar polls -- of around 1000 party leaders and workers, Gandhi also said the alliance with like-minded parties will be based on “mutual respect” and “reasonable give and take” and then only the coalition will be successful in defeating the ruling Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine. The Congress is a part of the opposition grand alliance or mahagathbandhan, which also has the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) leader and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) president Mukesh Sahani. The assembly elections are due in October-November this year but the seat-sharing talks between the opposition parties was yet to start. Gandhi alleged that the state government has failed in controlling the coronavirus pandemic and also the flood situation. “It even failed thousands of migrant workers from the state during the lockdown period,” he added. When Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh pointed out that Gandhi had warned the government in February that the country was going to be hit by a Covid-19 pandemic, the former party chief claimed that India is on its way to becoming the “vishwa guru of coronavirus as the situation is going to worsen” in the next six months. “Today, I am predicting a much bigger storm of unemployment and a sinking economy which may batter Bihar and the rest of the country in about six months,” added Gandhi. Attacking the chief minister over his claims of ‘sushasan (good governance)’, Gandhi said despite the people of the state being in despair, he “seems unmoved and his inability to take action in the face of crisis” is now known to all. Stating that Bihar has been the harbinger of change as Mahatma Gandhi launched his first Satyagraha from Champaran, he said the state even in the coming days will show the way and change the “disha (direction) and dasha (fate)” of the country. The former Congress chief exhorted the party leaders and workers to fight the upcoming battle by spreading the message of love and compassion and not hatred to defeat the alleged divisive politics of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS). Gandhi also told them that he would be available whenever the Bihar unit wants him to campaign physically in the state. A Congress leader said Gandhi had finalised a programme to visit flood-affected areas in Bihar but the security agencies did not give the required clearance. Senior Bihar Congress leader Shamim Akhtar said the party should take seriously Gandhi’s directive on ensuring the alliance percolates down to the ground level. In the absence of Gandhi, the meeting saw leaders stressing the need to giving tickets to loyalists and workers rather than “controversial and tainted” leaders who will spoil the party’s electoral prospects. There were also complaints of lack of coordination within the state unit and the launching of the app-based membership drive at a time when the elections are fast approaching. Senior leader Tariq Anwar spoke about a weak party organisation right from the booth level and stressed the need to strengthen it. State working president Shyam Sunder Singh Dheeraj said some Congress leaders were trying to push for an alliance with the RJD even at the cost of party’s respect. Akhilesh Prasad Singh praised Congress governments in Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh and also Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for “effectively” tackling the Covid-19 situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-is-going-to-change-disha-and-dasha-of-india-rahul-gandhi/story-OLZnIAfzQpMmn7Gr4mDrRP.html
07-08-2020||India||Gaganyaan: Astronauts-elect complete training on abnormal descent module landing in Russia||The four astronauts-elect for India’s first manned space mission Gaganyaan have completed training in Russia on crew actions in the event of an abnormal descent module landing, Glavkosmos, a subsidiary of Russian space organisation Roscosmos said on Thursday. The astronauts were in good health and determined to continue their training, it said. “To date, Indian cosmonauts have completed training on crew actions in the event of an abnormal descent module landing: in wooded and marshy areas in winter (completed in February 2020), on the water surface (completed in June 2020), in the steppe in summer (completed in July 2020),” Glavkosmos said.In June 2020, they passed training in short-term weightlessness mode aboard the IL-76MDK special laboratory aircraft, and in July, they were trained to lift aboard a helicopter while evacuating from the descent module landing point, it said on its website.The programme also included training in a centrifuge and in a hyperbaric chamber to prepare their organisms for sustaining spaceflight factors, such as G-force, hypoxia and pressure drops, it said, adding that these training are to be held in the near future.Four Indian Air Force fighter pilots are currently under training in Moscow and are likely to be potential candidates for Gaganyaan, initially planned around 2022.However, the city-based Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has indicated the mission may be delayed due to Covid 19 pandemic and the lockdown induced by it.The Indian astronauts are undergoing training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) following the courses of the general space training programme and of the systems of the Soyuz MS crewed spacecraft.The completion of their training at GCTC is scheduled for the first quarter of 2021, it said.The contract for the training of Indian astronauts between Glavkosmos and the Human Spaceflight Center of ISRO was signed on June 27, 2019, and their training in Russia started on February 10 this year. The entire process of preparation and training takes place in Russia, Glavkosmos said, it included a number of courses necessary for prospective Indian cosmonauts. The regular courses comprise medical and physical training, learning Russian (as one of the main international languages of communication in space), and studying the configuration, structure and systems of the Soyuz crewed spacecraft.Glavkosmos said the trainees’ health status is monitored on a daily basis, and once every three months, highly professional GCTC doctors conduct their thorough medical examination. “The GCTC instructors praise the effort and high motivation of the Indian cosmonauts. They also note their extremely serious and very professional attitude to the training process,” it added.Indian officials had earlier said that after training in Russia, the astronauts will receive module-specific training in India. In that, they will be trained in a crew and service module designed by ISRO, learn to operate it, work around it and do simulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaganyaan-astronauts-elect-complete-training-on-abnormal-descent-module-landing-in-russia/story-GZ4sLjF3B9tZesJ6sKL7hN.html

Shashidhar, a 1994-batch IPS officer of the Gujarat cadre, is the joint director of the central agency.According to HT’s sister publication Hindustan, the Gujarat cadre IPS officer was born in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur and grew up in the city.Also read: Rhea Chakraborty asked to appear before ED this FridayHindustan cited the IPS officer’s father, Yogendra Singh Gambhir, as saying that his daughter studied at school in the city. He said Gagandeep was a bright and hardworking student from the beginning. She moved to Punjab after her Class 10 and completed her higher education from Panjab University. She was also the topper of Panjab University.Gagandeep has been a senior superintendent of police (SSP) in many districts in the western state, including Rajkot and has been posted in CBI for the last year and a half. She has also been a part of teams probing many high-profile cases, including the big scams.She had also supervised the investigation into the alleged role of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the illegal mining case. She was later shifted to the unit probing the Srijan scam and the case against journalist Upendra Rai. She also had the additional charge of DIG in the special investigation team headed by Joint Director Sai Manohar.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput had a habit of tearing diary pages himself, says friend Siddharth PithaniThe team, which was earlier headed by Rakesh Asthana, is probing important cases like that of Vijay Mallya and Agusta Westland. It is also probing some coal scam-related cases, among others.The Maharashtra police have questioned the jurisdiction of the Bihar police in the matter. A final call on this matter—whether Bihar police have the jurisdiction to transfer a case to CBI—will be taken by the Supreme Court later this week.KK Singh has alleged in his police complaint that Rhea Chakraborty and his family drove his son to suicide and appropriated Rajput’s assets. After Rajput’s father lodged the complaint, Patna Police registered a case including charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and abetment to suicide against Chakraborty, her parents Indrajit Chakraborty and Sandhya Chakraborty, brother and common friends Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is separately investigating the case as it suspects there has been money laundering by some suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-bihar-s-gagandeep-gambhir-to-supervise-cbi-probe-team/story-LrObmf0Lxdp269HY99aAcL.html

07-08-2020||India||US Congressional Panel expresses bipartisan ‘concern’ over J&K situation||A US House of Representatives panel on foreign relations expressed bipartisan “concern” at the situation in Jammu and Kashmir in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, but India contended on Thursday that “positive changes” in the Union territory have ensured a “return to complete normalcy”. “We note with concern that conditions in Jammu and Kashmir have not normalised one year after India’s repeal of Article 370 and the establishment of Jammu and Kashmir as a Union Territory,” Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Michael T McCaul, a Republican member, wrote in the letter. It was a rare instance of bipartisan criticism of the changes in Kashmir. Democrats have condemned it before at many public forums, headlined most prominently by senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, an Indian-American. Republicans have been mostly supportive through their silence, taking the lead from the Trump administration’s response that it was an “internal matter” of India. Engel and McCaul sought to soft-land the criticism by averring themselves as “champions” of the India-US relationship. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “This letter reflects a strong bipartisan support for India in the US. Regarding the specific issue that you referred to, there have been several positive changes in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir over the past one year, whether it be in terms of ensuring good governance or socio-economic development or delivering justice to disadvantaged sections of the population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-congressional-panel-expresses-bipartisan-concern-over-j-k-situation/story-1AaL9wPGMgmXvavRfarGnO.html

Murmu has been appointed by President Ram Nath Kovind and he will take charge after incumbent Rajiv Mehrishi completes his term on Friday, the notification said. As the CAG, Murmu will be responsible for auditing all expenditures of the state and central governments. Murmu will hold the post for six years or till he turns 65. According to the Constitution, he cannot hold any government office following the completion of his tenure as CAG. Murmu took charge as the first L-G of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir on October 31, 2019, after the erstwhile state was stripped of its special status under Article 370 by the central government on August 5 last year, and split into two Union territories — J&K and Ladakh.Before his posting in J&K, Murmu served as the expenditure secretary in the Union finance ministry. Former Union minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader from Uttar Pradesh Manoj Sinha was named as Murmu’s replacement as the new L-G of J&K on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gc-murmu-named-as-next-cag-to-take-charge-today/story-5oTyxTqakuzraOjcgxBV8O.html
07-08-2020||India||Covid-19: Tracing India’s journey to two million cases||India’s Covid-19 tally crossed the two million-mark on Thursday. It is now only the third country after the US and Brazil to have reached the grim milestone.It took India three weeks (or 21 days) to post its second million. And the majority of the new cases - 42 per cent - has come from five states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar.The number of Covid-19 cases in India reached five lakh (or half million-mark) on June 26, in just a little over 19 days. The next half million came on July 16, according to analysis of data from states and union territories.After the one million-mark, India crossed the 1.5 million milestone on July 28 and two million on August 6.India’s journey to two million cases took 158 days, with at least 90 per cent of these cases coming after the lifting of the hard nationwide lockdown that was announced at the end of March - a strategy that officials and experts said bought the country precious time to set up isolation centres, add hospital beds, and strengthen testing infrastructure.While Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were the original hotspots, the trend has shifted in the last three weeks. Forty two per cent of the new cases have come from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar.If cases in the country continue to grow at the same rate they have till now, which is likely considering how new states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as hotspots, experts estimate that the next million cases may take just a little over two weeks.Meanwhile, the data from states and union territories show that the recoveries have surged to 13.70 lakh. In fact, the recoveries exceeded active cases of the coronavirus infection by 7,32,835 on Thursday, according to Union health ministry.The ministry also said that the daily new recoveries are increasing steadily.“The progressively increasing daily new recoveries are due to a focused attention on surveillance, containment and effective clinical management. India created a network of Covid Dedicated Hospitals to manage the cases,” it said. It also said that India has one of the lowest deaths/million compared to many countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tracing-india-s-journey-to-two-million-cases/story-o8ivL6ZmT0dGNrHwQK7KSJ.html

Sisodia said that the inability of Delhi govt-funded DU colleges to pay staff salaries despite a 70 per cent increase in budget allocation in the last 5 years indicates corruption,” the Office of Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi said in a statement.He also said that he has received multiple complaints of corruption in the administration of DU colleges. They are resisting or delaying the formation of governing bodies and rejecting nominees appointed by Delhi government to hide this corruption.Delhi Government has increased the budget of DU colleges from Rs 144.39 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 242.64 Cr in 2019-20 and Rs 243 Cr in 2020-21. Despite nearly 70 per cent rise in budget allocation in five years, DU is complaining of budget problems, the release said.“DU last year’s budget (2019-20) of Rs 242.64 crore was adequate to meet all their expenses, the previous year’s budget (2018-19) of Rs 216.13 crore was adequate to meet their expenses, why is DU now complaining of inadequate funds despite Rs 27 crore increased allocation in last two years alone?” said the Deputy CM.He said, “Of the Rs 243 core budgeted for 2020-21, Rs 56.25 crore has already been released by end of July 2020 i.e. approx. 23 per cent budget. So why are DU colleges not able to pay salaries for April, May and June? Apart from DU colleges, Delhi govt also funds many of the Universities that come directly under the administration of its Education Department. We never hear instances of them running out of funds or unable to pay the salaries of their staff.”Sisodia said, “The inability of Delhi govt-funded DU colleges to pay staff salaries despite a 70 per cent increase in budget allocation in the last 5 years indicates corruption. The reason is clear. There have been multiple complaints of corruption in the administration of DU colleges. That’s why they are resisting or delaying the formation of Governing bodies and rejecting nominees appointed by the Delhi government. I had written to DU Vice-Chancellor last month about these corruption allegations and am yet to receive a response.”The press release also mentioned the details of Budget allocation by GNCTD to Delhi govt-funded DU colleges. The press release read, “2012-13 - Rs 121.82 Cr, 2013-14 - Rs 140.65 Cr, 2014-15 - Rs 144.39 Cr, 2015-16 - Rs 181.94 Cr, 2016-17-- Rs 197 Cr, 2017-18 - Rs 214.78 Cr, 2018-19 - Rs 216.13 Cr, 2019-20 - Rs 242.64 Cr, 2020-21 (BE) - Rs 243 Cr (Rs 56.25 released).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/du-s-inability-to-pay-salaries-despite-70-budget-hike-indicates-corruption-sisodia/story-IAn4G5QxEBwuN3Gi60NZnL.html

The issue was raised by Indian officials during an informal border meeting between the two sides on Tuesday near Tanakpur border town of Champawat district.Several issues were raised during the meeting for discussion by India side including a request to instal omni-directional closed-circuit television cameras by Nepalese authorities near the no man’s land. “The Nepalese side had installed the CCTV cameras a few days ago at the border. When the meeting was held, the SSB [Sashastra Seema Bal] from our side raised the issue before Nepal as being omnidirectional CCTV cameras, there was an obvious risk that they might monitor activities of our security agencies also,” Surendra Narayan Pandey, Champawat’s district magistrate who attended the meet, said.“The Nepalese authorities reasoned that they are to keep an eye on activities on their side of the border on which we asked them to then replace them with uni-directional CCTV cameras away from the Indian side of the border. To that, they said that they will consider the request,” said Pandey. Meanwhile, an SSB official privy to the issues raised by them before Nepalese authorities in the meeting said, “We had raised the issue of omnidirectional CCTVs as it is a very important one from a security point of view.” “Not only this, we also raised objection against the Nepalese people stopping our men from patrolling near the disputed area of the border in our side as well the encroachment done by them on it,” said the official. RK Tripathi, SSB Commandant near the Indo-Nepal border affirmed the development. “We raised several issues in the meeting but didn’t get any assurance from their side. They just said that they will try to solve them by dialogues,” Tripathi said.The informal meeting was attended by Champawat’s district magistrate and superintendent of police (SP) and SSB’s commandant. From the Nepalese, the chief district officer (the equivalent of a DM) and SP of Kanchanpur district adjoining the border in Nepal and SP of the Armed Police Force (SSB’s counterpart). The border row had erupted between the two sides after some Nepalese nationals erected fencing pillars in the no man’s land near the border on July 22. Following the development, India’s border patrolling agency SSB held a meeting with Nepal’s APF on the issue on July 23 in which the latter assured of removing it but since then no action has been taken by them in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-objects-to-omnidirectional-cctv-cameras-set-up-by-nepal-at-uttarakhand-border/story-9ehk59cQXlJaf7JOKRatBJ.html

07-08-2020||India||Lok Sabha officials to learn foreign languages||Amid a debate over what should be the medium of instruction in schools, the Lok Sabha secretariat is encouraging senior officials to learn foreign languages, citing Parliament’s increasing engagement with overseas counterparts and international institutions. They are also being told to learn, at least at a basic level, local languages.“It has been decided to conduct beginner level learning courses in different foreign languages as well as scheduled Indian languages for the officers of Parliament. The duration of the programme would be three months with two classes per week,” an internal circular Lok Sabha circular, a copy of which was accessed by HT, said.Courses will be offered in four foreign languages—German, French, Russian and Spanish -- and may be expanded to cover other languages depending on the level of interest among officials in the Lok Sabha secretariat, according to speaker Om Birla. The French language course started on August 4.An official enrolled in the French language course said, “It will be very useful for us in our interactions with international hosts. French is a widely used language in Europe and also in Africa.” The linguistic exercise comes amid a debate triggered by the new education policy approved by the Centre last month that stressed the need for students to be taught in their tongue although it stuck to the three language formula -- English, Hindi and a regional language. The policy said that since children learn and grasp non-trivial concepts more quickly in their home language, which is often the mother tongue, it should preferably be the medium of instruction.“Wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language, mother tongue, local language or the regional language. Thereafter, the home or local language shall continue to be taught as a language wherever possible. This will be followed by both public and private schools,” the policy stated.This, however, led to concerns over the existence of thousands of English-medium schools across India. To ease the concerns in a country that has 22 official languages , officials said the policy does not aim to impose any language on anyone.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla wants senior officials in the lower house secretariat to hone their foreign language skills keeping in mind Parliament’s increasing international exposure and its multilateral engagements, officials said. The French course is open to officers who are at least executive assistants. Fifty-seven officials have enrolled themselves in the course. Parliament’s secretariat is a mini India in its profile, comprising officials from different corners of the country. But with most day-to-day work being done either in Hindi or English, officials have had little incentive to learn new languages. Over the past few years, Parliament has been increasingly engaging with its international counterparts. Apart from participating in multilateral forums such as Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and Commonwealth Parliamentary Union, legislative delegations make overseas visits on goodwill missions and receive guests from other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-officials-to-learn-foreign-languages/story-Iedo5f5wte8vOI1IRDw13J.html

The phrase ‘destabilizing actions’ was a clear reference to Chinese aggression in eastern Ladakh and it was part of an ongoing discussions on the border conflagration between two sides and on which the US has been extremely supportive of India. “We remain united to advance peace in Afghanistan, and to a secure and sovereign Indo-Pacific in which all countries can prosper,” Pompeo followed up in a tweet.Also read: India-China expand border talks, to revisit patrolling protocol to avoid skirmishesPompeo has hinted at American role in the Indian ban on Chinese apps in retaliation for the Galwan clashes.The two leaders also discussed ongoing bilateral and multilateral cooperation on issues of international concern, including efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and the Afghan peace process in Afghanistan, a State Department spokesperson Cale Brown stated.“ Secretary Pompeo and Minister Jaishankar reiterated the strength of the United States-India relationship to advance peace, prosperity, and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,” the spokesperson added.Also read: China calls article 370 move illegal; keep out of our internal affairs, says MEAThe two leaders agreed stay in touch in “continue close cooperation” on an entire range of regional and international issues and “look forward to Quadrilateral consultations” with Australia and Japan and the US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/s-jaishankar-mike-pompeo-discuss-destabilizing-actions-in-the-region/story-ROipOUDiq1Yk5wc8pafmZK.html
07-08-2020||India||42% of India’s Covid-19 cases reported from 5 states||Nearly 42% of new cases that have come since the day India’s tally crossed a million Covid-19 infections have come from five states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar. These states together were responsible for less than 19% of cases before July 16 – the day India hit the million-mark.Delhi, which was responsible for nearly 12% of the country’s first million cases, has reported less than 3% of the new cases in the second million. These statistics show how the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 has shifted geographies in the last three weeks, targeting the hinterland and the southern peninsula instead of just the ‘Big Three’ – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. THE FIRST MILLIONWhen India’s total caseload crossed the million-mark on July 16, around 56% of all cases could be traced to the ‘Big Three’. Maharashtra (284,281 cases) alone was responsible for 28.3% of all cases, followed by Tamil Nadu (156,369 infections) with 15.6% cases in the country and Delhi (118,645 cases) constituted 11.8% of the national tally. THE SECOND MILLIONAfter July 16, a lot changed in the way the virus spread in the country. Among the worst-hit regions, Delhi had the best rate of case growth in the country. The share of the Capital’s cases dropped to 2.2% from 11.8%.Maharashtra, however, continued to be worst-hit region, contributing nearly a fifth of the cases reported after July 16. Andhra Pradesh jumped from the eight spot to the second spot , responsible for nearly 16% of the cases. With 122,775 cases since July 16, Tamil Nadu dropped to the third highest contributor to the second million (12.1%).Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar, which accounted for less than 19% of the first million, reported nearly 42% of new cases since July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/38-of-covid-19-cases-reported-from-5-states/story-fHHvkpVuccACb2k0GFrUgN.html
07-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India crossed two million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Thursday, exactly three weeks after it crossed a million cases on July 16 (according to the HT dashboard, it ended the day with 1,004,652 cases). The number of active cases on July 16 (again, according to the HT dashboard) was 343,298. India ended Thursday with 2,022,730 cases. The number of active cases was 605,300. This means that in 21 days, the country has seen 1,018,078 new infections, and the number of active cases has increased by 262,002. India had recorded 25,594 deaths by the time it crossed a million cases; by Thursday, that number increased to 41,633, an additional 16,039 deaths in 21 days. No country is currently adding as many cases as India. And, at the two million mark (crossed only by the US and the Brazil before this), India’s growth rate in terms of cases is the highest . Indeed, according to five-day averages tabulated by the Johns Hopkins University, the US’s five-day average (as on August 5) is down, as is Brazil’s. In the top five countries by number of cases, only India and Colombia have five-day averages that are moving up. To be sure, the absolute numbers are still higher for the US (seven-day average of 56,966 according to the New York Times database), when compared to India (54,392) -- but only just. Brazil’s is 43,830. India’s number is set to increase even more in coming days as the virus spreads across the hinterland and the peninsula. One reason for this is higher testing – India had tested 10,539 people per million of its population on July 16, when it crossed a million cases; on August 5, poised at 1.96 million, it had tested 16,617 people per million (testing data comes with a lag). That is just around 1.66% of the population. The US has tested 18.8% of its population and Brazil 6.3%, according to data from worldometers.info. Russia has tested 20%, South Africa 5%, and the UK 25%. Among countries with a significant number of cases, only Mexico (0.8%) has tested less of its population than India. Even Iran has tested 3%.India needs to do more – for a start, target to test 5% of its population. This isn’t the first time I’m pushing for more tests – this column was the first to call for a million tests a day in India – and every time, I receive the same feedback from apologists for the government: India’s population is far too high; or India’s GDP is far too low. The truth is, in absolute terms, India ranks behind China, the US, and Russia, in terms of number of tests conducted. To reach the 5% mark, India has to test roughly 32 million more people – preferably using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, or RT-PCR test, which is the best way to diagnose current infections. The rapid antigen test has become popular with many state governments because it can offer tests within the hour -- as opposed to the RT-PCR tests whose results reach the subject only in 24 to 48 hours -- but it is not very accurate when it comes to identifying true negatives (some people shown to be negative for the virus in the test are actually infected), and should be used only in certain circumstances and places – in a containment zone, for instance; or in airports (where passengers can be tested before a flight). That may seem like an impossible target (it also needs to be completed soon, perhaps 32 days, sticking to this writer’s recommendation on the number of daily tests), but India conducts many large-scale exercises that other countries would consider impossible – for instance, a universal vaccine programme that covers almost 25 million children across the country; and elections. Last year, 611 million people voted in the general elections in seven phases. In 2017, about 86 million people voted in the Uttar Pradesh state elections, again, across seven phases. At the one million mark, I wrote a column on what India needs to do (called “A Million and a Manifesto”). That still holds, but at the two million mark, the only thing the central and state governments need to think about is testing. P.S: While on testing, states and Union Territories that have spare capacity (Delhi definitely has it) should consider offering free tests (RT-PCR) to anyone who wants to get tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-XdKmIyUfOpO0KpsyQGsH6K.html
07-08-2020||India||Congress gives opportunities to young across spectrum: RPN Singh||Former union minister and Congress’ Jharkhand in-charge RPN Singh says younger leaders have always been given good opportunities in his party as compared to other political parties. He says the ongoing old versus young debate in the Congress is uncalled for. In an interview with Aurangzeb Naqshbandi, he says the Congress needs to have a rejuvenated party organization and a narrative that resonates with the people of the country for its revival. Q: The seniors versus young leaders debate has reignited in the Congress. Are young leaders apprehensive of their future in the party with Rahul Gandhi apparently unwilling to assume the leadership role in the immediate future? A: I disagree with this whole debate of young and old. It is uncalled for. If you read the history of the Congress party right from 1920s, there have always been younger people trying to occupy positions and that is true of any organisation. I would definitely like to say that a lot of young people have got great opportunity in the Congress and it is a continuing process. But I find it strange when a section of the media says that old people should be replaced by the young. Life is about competence and experience. Would you say Mahatma Gandhiji or Sardar Patel should have been removed from the freedom struggle because they were too old? Young people necessarily don’t attract young people. Ideas and narratives do. Q: We saw the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and now the rebellion by Sachin Pilot. There seems to be a sense of despair in the party? A: I would not like to comment on individuals. But there are many instances of younger people having got opportunity in the Congress party. As far as Ashok Gehlot government is concerned, it had majority yesterday, has it today and will prove it whenever asked to. There is absolutely no problem. Q: Do you think time has come for senior leaders to make way for the young generation? A: Age is just a number. Definitely younger people should be given opportunity and Rahulji has given opportunity to many many people across the country but everybody has to wait their turn. People do have ambitions but everybody’s ambitions cannot be fulfilled. And always remember one thing that time waits for nobody. If you are old and have become irrelevant, you will get pushed out on your own or people will push you out. People have their own capabilities and experience and age is just a factor. In the Congress party, younger people have been given opportunities across the spectrum even in the Rajya Sabha, which is the House of Elders. No other political party has done that. So, I can’t understand this debate. Q: In the last CWC meeting, you suggested that instead of launching personal attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his policies should be criticised. Do you think that the move to attack Modi has backfired on the Congress? A: Well, what I said in the CWC is something I would not like to discuss in the media. CWC is a forum where every member has full freedom to express his or her opinion in a most democratic manner. It finally takes the call and whatever the CWC decides, every member of the Congress party has to follow that. Q: But what about the personal attacks on Modi? Do you think the Congress needs to change its strategy? A: I personally feel whatever attack has to be launched on the government or its policies and its leaders should be formulated by the CWC and collectively endorsed by the party and every member should follow that and stick to those lines. Q: But many Congress leaders say Rahul Gandhi is the only opposition leader who takes on Modi and Amit Shah and if he doesn’t who will? A: I would like to say that as far as I am concerned I have taken on the Prime Minister, his policies and those of his government and the BJP at various forums – be as a party spokesperson or as in-charge of Jharkhand. In my capacity, I have done that and many others in the Congress are also doing that. Q: You were a part of the UPA government in its second term. One of your party colleagues, Rajeev Satav, recently blamed the UPA 2 for the declining electoral fortunes of the Congress. We then saw a full blown war on the social media. What do you have to say? A: I think he has already clarified that. He might have said something in his over exuberance and he has made amends by clarifying his remarks. Let’s end it there only. But the kind of dignity Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh brought to politics is something that needs to be learned by all. Q: NCP chief Sharad Pawar has suggested that Rahul Gandhi should have conversation with his party leaders and also start touring the country. Is there a lack of conversation in the Congress? A: I would not like to comment on what Pawarji has said. He is an extremely knowledgeable, experienced and has great understanding of politics. His party is our alliance partner in Maharashtra. All I would to like say that we don’t need to look elsewhere. We have the greatest example of how to conduct oneself as a leader with propriety, dignity and taking along everybody’s views. We have our Congress president Sonia Gandhi who has been the epitome of what a politician should be – dignified, calm, taking all views on board and reaching out to the poorest of the poor and her sacrifice is known to all. Also, the kind of progress we made under the leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh in his 10-years rule is something the entire country is proud of and his economic policies have been praised world over. Q: But what about the suggestion of going on a nationwide yatra to reconnect with the masses? Also, do you think that hitting the streets is the only way for the party’s revival? A: Every member of the Congress party wants Rahul Gandhi as its president. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind. In fact, nobody had asked him to step down when he took the moral responsibility for the 2019 election loss. He did that on his own. He is the leader of the Congress party. As far as the touring is concerned, it has to be done by all members of the Congress party but we need to have a rejuvenated organisation and a narrative that resonates with the people of the country. Unfortunately, all the travel plans have come to a standstill due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Q: Coming to your home state UP, do you see the revival of the Congress with other opposition parties ceding their space? A: In Uttar Pradesh, new entrants have been given opportunities. There is definitely some plan and strategy. We have been in the party for many years and we are there for them. We will be helping and guiding them wherever needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-gives-opportunities-to-young-across-spectrum-rpn-singh/story-oIkFPCBShHvaYKiekAwmtL.html
07-08-2020||India||Aadhaar Card’s use may be widened further||The Centre may allow Aadhaar authentication on a voluntary basis for delivery of social welfare benefits by government entities in order to ensure good governance and prevent leakages, new rules issued by the ministry of electronics and information technology have said.Under the new rules, issued on Wednesday, any central or state government department or ministry can approach the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) -- the statutory body that manages Aadhaar and runs Aadhaar-based services -- to use the unique 12-digit biometric number for authentication. This request can be made for three purposes: usage of digital platforms for good governance, prevention of dissipation of welfare benefits and enabling innovation and spreading knowledge. Innovation and knowledge have not been defined. “The central government may allow Aadhaar authentication by requesting entities in the interest of good governance, preventing leakage of public funds, promoting ease of living of residents and enabling better access to services for them,” the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020, said.Activists said the move could lead to exclusion of poor people from getting benefits. To be sure, the rules are in consonance with the 2018 Supreme Court judgment that struck down section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, which earlier allowed private entities to use Aadhaar database for authentication. Currently, the central government allows seeding of Aadhaar number for delivery of social welfare benefits under some programmes such as the Public Distribution System. However, for delivery of the benefit such as food grains under the public distribution system or money under pension schemes, Aadhaar authentication is not needed.But with the new rules, Aadhaar authentication may become a part of withdrawing other government benefits such as pensions. A central government official privy to the developments said the purpose of the order was to ensure that “genuine” beneficiaries get benefits of the government schemes in real-time without any delay. “Authentication will also help in plugging the leakages, if any, in the schemes. The rules provide government agencies a framework to seek UIDAI’s authentication services,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Under the authentication mechanism, the UIDAI uses its database to verify whether an Aadhaar number or biometric detail provided actually belong to a particular individual. The UIDAI server replies only in “Yes” or “No” without providing any demographic details of the person whose identify is being verified. Currently, in the Aadhaar seeding system, the verification is done through the concerned department’s database -- not that of the UIDAI. According to the Aadhaar Act, a requesting entity means “an agency or person that submits the Aadhaar number, and demographic information or biometric information, of an individual to the Central Identities Data Repository for authentication”.The new rule makes it clear that only the government agencies would be allowed to use Aadhaar authentication services, not any private entity. This is in line with the 2016 Supreme Court judgment that upheld the Aadhaar law but struck down section 57 which allowed private entities to use Aadhaar database for authentication.Activists said poor connectivity in rural areas may hurt disadvantaged people.“There is already so much evidence to show that Aadhaar has led to exclusion of poor people in disbursement of subsidised ration in Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar. The decision could lead to further exclusion as in rural areas there is very poor connectivity and biometric of many people don’t work,” said Reetika Khera, a development economist working at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.A study done by the Abdul Lateef Jamil Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) in 10 districts of Jharkhand by economist Karthik Muralidharan in 2019 found that the Aadhaar seeding in PDS lead to many genuine persons getting excluded with little plugging of leakages.The rules say Aadhaar authentication will be voluntary.“If the department say that people will not get the welfare services without authentication, voluntary becomes mandatory,” said development economist Jean Dreze, who has been arguing against making Aadhaar mandatory to avail social welfare schemes..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-use-may-be-widened-further/story-gGTUFhyd2RKf9AJyvDrmjM.html
07-08-2020||India||CBI names Rhea Chakraborty, five of family in Sushant Singh Rajput death case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed a case into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput naming his ex-girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty and four other family members or known associates apart from unknown persons as accused, officials said. The Mumbai police have been probing the death since Rajput’s body was found at his apartment on June 14 but are yet to register a case. The case was handed over to CBI by the Bihar government after Rajputs father KK Singh and the Bihar police alleged a cover-up by the Mumbai police. They have accused the Mumbai police of destroying evidence and deliberately ignoring leads in the case in an attempt to derail it. The Maharashtra police have questioned the jurisdiction of the Bihar police in the matter. A final call on this matter -- whether Bihar police have the jurisdiction to transfer a case to CBI -- will be taken by the Supreme Court later this week . One school of thought is that it has -- because Rajput’s father is based in the state. Another is that it doesn’t -- that while it can register a case, it has to transfer it to Mumbai police. CBI has handed over the investigation to its Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is currently investigating the high-profile AgustaWestland chopper case and the bank fraud case against fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya. The SIT, also known as Anti-Corruption-6 and headed by Gujarat cadre IPS officer Manoj Shashidhar, was formed in June 2016 under then Special Director Rakesh Asthana to expedite probe against Mallya and in the chopper case. It has successfully secured Mallya’s extradition in a UK court and filed a charge sheet against former Air Chief SP Tyagi. A team from the SIT will station itself in Mumbai to begin questioning people connected with the late actor including his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, Bollywood producers and others who gave statements after his death or know about the circumstances related to his death, officials familiar with development said. The decision to hand over the probe to the SIT was taken as CBI’s Special Crimes unit, which usually investigates such cases, has its hands full. “The Special Crimes unit is currently probing high-profile cases related to the custodial death of the father-son duo of P Jayaraj and J Bennicks in Tamil Nadu in June as well as the suicide of SHO, Vishnudutt Vishnoi in Churu, Rajasthan, on May 23. In the SHO case, CBI had last month questioned Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s OSD – Devaram Saini,” an official at the agency said requesting anonymity. Around eight officials of CBI’s special crimes unit who had gone to investigate Tamil Nadu’s custodial deaths are in quarantine after some of them contracted Covid-19. CBI is likely to take the help of medical experts from reputed institutions to study the postmortem report of Sushant Singh Rajput, another official at the agency said. If it believes at any stage that Rhea Chakraborty or others are misleading it, the agency may even consider conducting lie-detection tests on them, this officer added, asking not to be named. KK Singh has alleged that Rhea Chakraborty and his family drove his son to suicide and appropriated his (Rajput’s) assets.Apart from Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty, CBI has named her family members and the manager of Rajput’s house, Samuel Miranda, as accused . The charges are criminal conspiracy, cheating and abetment to suicide. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is separately investigating the case as it suspects there has been money laundering by some suspects. The ED questioned Samuel Miranda on Thursday while Singh’s chartered accountant Sandeep Sridhar was examined on Tuesday. Rhea Chakraborty has been asked by the ED to appear before it on Friday. Her lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, “The Bihar government transferred a case with which it had no jurisdiction to investigate to CBI instead of the Mumbai Police, which is the legal position. The Supreme Court is seized of the issue pursuant to the transfer petition filed by Rhea Chakraborty. The SC has directed all parties to file their replies and Mumbai Police are directed to place the report of investigations.”“Pending the said proceedings, the CBI has registered and continued the illegality which was perpetrated at the hands of Bihar Police. CBI being a premier investigative agency in the country should desist from taking any further steps pending the SC proceedings. Apart from the same unless the Maharashtra Government consents to CBI investigating the case... it would be totally illegal and beyond any known legal principles, affecting the federal structure of the nation.”Rajput’s death, believed to be a suicide by Mumbai police, initially led to theories about how outsiders have it difficult in Bollywood and the role of nepotism in driving him to desperation, but soon moved on to darker conspiracy theories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-names-rhea-five-of-family-in-sushant-case/story-02m0jEczBjSJBWBxpgSjVM.html
07-08-2020||India||Covid-19: India posts its second million in just 21 days||India on Thursday became the third country in the world, after the US and Brazil, to report more than two million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases -- the second million coming in exactly three weeks since the country hit a million infections on July 16, with 42% of the new cases coming from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar. With a total of 62,088 new cases on Thursday taking the national tally to 2,022,730, the doubling rate — the number of days it takes for number of infections to double — in the country now stands at 22.7 days. This is significantly higher than it was in the US (60.2 days) and Brazil (35.7 days) on the day they crossed two million cases -- suggesting that India’s caseload could surpass the tallies in these two countries unless the trend reverses or a vaccine is developed.If cases in the country continue to grow at the same rate they have till now, which is likely considering how new states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as hot spots, experts estimate that the next million cases may take just a little over two weeks.Also read: 70% Covid-19 related deaths in Bengal due to delayed admission in hospitalsThe US total now stands at 4,993,508 cases and Brazil is at 2,873,304 million.With 898 new fatalities reported on Thursday, 41,633 people have died due to the disease in the five months of the outbreak in the country. The silver lining is that the country’s case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.06% — not only better than the global average of 3.75%, but also significantly better than the CFR in the US (5.72%) and Brazil (3.81%) when these countries had the same number of cases.Also read: Donald Trump says coronavirus vaccine possible before November 3Experts say the focus of the battle against Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – now needs to shift to the hinterland and the peninsula, both high population density regions with, in the case of the former, significant rural populations and relatively inadequate health care systems.On July 16, when the country touched a million cases, nearly 56% of all cases could be traced to the three regions that were the original hot spots of the disease in India – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In the last three weeks, however, this trend has shifted. Delhi, which was responsible for nearly 12% cases in the first million, has reported less than 3% of the new cases in the second million. The gains from the reduction in cases in Delhi, however, were undone with the outbreak spreading to new regions. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar, which together reported less than 19% of cases in the first million, reported nearly 42% of new cases since July 16.“There are reports of cases coming from rural areas but the advantage that we have there is that population density is low because of which cases can be identified, isolated and treated early. In these areas surveillance can be far better and also compliance, and that is instrumental in controlling spread of the disease effectively,” says Dr VK Paul, member, Niti Aayog, who also chairs one of the National Task Forces on Covid-19 management. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said during a briefing on Tuesday that even though infections had spread to newer areas, there was no cause for concern because almost 82% of the caseload was limited to 10 states. “Fifty districts account for about 66% of the current caseload, therefore, there’s no need to panic as the disease spread is limited,” he said. India’s journey to two million cases took 158 days, with at least 90% of these cases coming after the lifting of the hard nationwide lockdown that was announced at the end of March — a strategy that officials and experts said bought the country precious time to set up isolation centres, add hospital beds, and strengthen testing infrastructure. With crippling economic costs piling up, the country began unlocking in June, when the outbreak was on a sharp upward trajectory.On Thursday, during a virtual meeting of the regional director of World Health Organization (WHO) for South-East Asia with ministers of health of the member nations, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said that the lockdown was “effective in slowing down the rate of growth of cases and gave the government time to augment health infrastructure and testing facilities”. “From one lab (for Covid-19 testing) in January, India has 1,370 laboratories at present. Indians anywhere can access a lab within three hours travel time and 33 of the 36 states and UTs exceed WHO’s recommendation of testing 140 people per million per day,” he said.“India’s proactive and graded multilevel institutional response to Covid-19 made it possible to have very low cases per million and deaths per million in spite of having a high population density and low fractional GDP spending and per capita doctor and hospital bed availability as compared to other developed countries,” he was quoted as saying in a statement from the health ministry.Doctors also say that the number of severely ill patients is low, and most of those needing hospitalisation are recovering faster. “Most positive cases do not require hospitalisation, and those needing intensive care is actually a minuscule number. Most people in hospitals have moderate disease with good chances of recovery. The need is to take care of our old and vulnerable population with co-morbidities that is at high risk of developing severe illness,” says Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare. In the last week, India has added an average of 53,955 cases a day -- up from 30,076 a day in the week when it crossed a million cases. This increase in daily cases has been consistent with the rate at which testing has been ramped up across the country. In the last week, 565,000 samples on average were tested for Covid-19 every day, against 292,000 a day for the week ending July 16.At least some of the testing gains can be attributed to a decision by several states to rely on antigen tests instead of the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, or RT-PCR test, which is considered by scientists to be the gold standard. An antigen test, also known as a rapid test, has become popular with many governments as it offers tests within the hour as opposed to the RT-PCR tests whose results reach the subject 24 to 48 hours. Since the former can possibly lead to false negatives, several cases can slide under the radar. But experts say it can be used in small areas of hot spots to test every resident and quickly isolate as many patients as possible. In contrast, the RT-PCR test is the most definitive test currently available and experts say it should be used as often as possible.India’s average weekly test positive (or positivity) rate has risen from 6.5% in early June to 10% at present, but the aggregate level statistics mask sharp differences in testing performance across the country. Maharashtra, the state with the highest number of infections, at 479,779, has a test positive rate of 17% in the last week, while for Uttar Pradesh, this number is less than 5%.The WHO identifies 8-12% as the ideal range for test positive rate in a country with an active outbreak. A number too low or too high implies that volume as well as targeting of Covid-19 testing is inadequate to accurately detect the spread of the disease.“The Covid situation is quite dynamic and the numbers change on a daily basis, and same goes for the positivity rate. However, if you look at the overall trend, India’s current positivity rate is on the lower side, even in comparison with other countries. Same goes for the case fatality rate which is probably one of the lowest in the world. We have been able to manage the disease quite effectively so far,” says Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The number of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in India touched 1,375,797 on Thursday, bringing the proportion of recoveries to 68.01%, against the global average of 64.2% of all cases recovered. To be sure, India’s recovery rate is expected to eventually soar to over 90% — since current trends indicate the final fatality rate could lie between 2-3% — once the outbreak nears its end. This also means that a total of 605,300 cases (29.91% of total infections) in the country remain active. The number of active cases has been steadily increasing in the country, which may be a cause of concern for officials. It was 96,970 at the start of June, and 227,298 on July 1. Active cases -- those still under treatment -- is a crucial metric because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in any region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-posts-its-second-million-in-just-21-days/story-qfHRHyy9PPMv1kHoYozxrN.html
07-08-2020||India||We’re ready for an influx of students from private to govt schools: Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia spoke about the National Education Policy announced by the Union government, a plan for reopening city schools that have been shut in the wake of the Covid pandemic, a possible influx of students from private to government schools, and the issue of salaries in some MCD and DU institutions. Edited excerpts: As Delhi’s education minister, what is your view on the National Education Policy announced by the Centre recently? The NEP has many progressive ideas -- but the road map to achieve those is missing. It’s good that NEP has emphasised on foundational learning. The policy lists both anganwadi workers and pre-primary teachers for the purpose. However, with due respect, anganwadi workers have been selected with the intention of serving cooked meals, and not for assisting in foundational learning. The policy calls for the engagement of these workers in foundational learning without any expertise for a large segment of children. At the same time, children in private schools will be taught by pre-primary teachers. This will create a divide. It is good that the policy has mentioned providing breakfast in addition to midday meals. The policy talks about a revised 5+3+3+4 pedagogical structure. Will the replacement of the 10+2 system improve learning levels? The 5+3+3+4 formula will help, but there has to be the preparation for it, else it will be a disaster. The policy doesn’t give much clarity on how it will be implemented. For instance, the earlier structure separated the Class 9-10 from the Class 11-12 group. Under the new structure, the secondary level comprises Classes 9 to 12. I had asked if this group would be taught by trained graduate teachers (who teach till Class 10) or postgraduate teachers (who teach higher secondary). Basics such as these haven’t been clarified, and the drawback is that this policy could remain a piece of paper. Is there a paradigm shift from the previous education policy?I could not see any paradigm shift. Education is still not getting funds under the present policy. It leaves parents confused about whether they should enroll their children in government schools, or be uncertain about private school fees. The policy should have assured the country that it will focus on the improvement of the government schools and reduce dependency on private schools. This concept or commitment is missing from the policy. Since the national education policy gives encouragement to private schools, the intent becomes clear. However, in Delhi, it’s exactly the opposite. The AAP government is working on strengthening structure of public schools while regularising private institutes.The Covid pandemic has taught us that technology will be playing a crucial role in the education system in the future. However, it has exposed gaps in access. What’s the future of online education? Online education cannot be the only way, which is why we have a semi-online model. In addition to sharing resource material on WhatsApp, we created means for parents to come to schools and collect worksheets if they do not have access to devices or the internet. I was asked to increase the duration of online classes, but we wanted to keep online and offline learning at the same level. The learning curriculum during Covid has been prepared keeping that in mind. After reviewing these classes, we found out that nearly 85% of children are in touch with their teachers. Of these, around 70-85% are using e-resources and the rest are collecting worksheets from schools. Can the government give devices to all to bridge the digital divide? The idea is good and I wish I could give devices to all but the government doesn’t have the money. We don’t even have the money to pay our teachers. Teachers in the North Delhi municipal corporation-run primary schools have not been paid since May. They have now threatened to stop online classes. The corporation says that the Delhi government has not been releasing their funds on time. What the government’s position on this? The government has paid all the pending dues to the north MCD and other MCDs. The north MCD should make the data public mentioning the funds Delhi government had given them in the last five years and what they have done with it. If the MCD cannot pay their teachers even after getting the funds they should hand over their schools to us. We will run them and pay the teachers as well.Similar issues have been raised by the 12 Delhi University colleges that are fully funded by the Delhi government. They are alleging that the government is either delaying or giving insufficient funds. The Delhi government has been paying sufficient funds to its fully funded DU colleges. We have increased their salary funds over the past five years, and yet they are not able to pay their employees. They must answer where these funds are going, which is why audits must be conducted. The university has been delaying the formation of governing bodies in these colleges despite Delhi government’s orders. The problem with DU is that it’s trying to do both corruption and politics. If they want to work with the Delhi government, they will have to work with transparency and without politics. Otherwise, they should hand over our colleges to us (Delhi government). The situation is improving in Delhi now with the number of Covid-19 cases declining and the death rate has also come down. When will Delhi be ready to reopen schools? There is no discussion yet on the reopening of schools. We cannot decide this on the basis of the number of Covid-19 cases. We will have to take the decision considering the situation in neighbouring states as well since many of our students come from UP and Haryana as well. We are now working on removing the fear of schools from the minds of parents. I am regularly reviewing the suggestions we have received from parents, teachers and different stakeholders on the reopening of schools. We are still analysing the parameters based on which the decision of the reopening of schools will be taken. Will it be challenging to bring back students to the classrooms whenever the schools reopen? We had asked the schools to identify the students who are completely out of contact and we found that at least 15% of students enrolled in Delhi government schools are out of touch. We are trying to reach out to them through different modes. It’s after Delhi government’s continuous efforts that some of our students, who moved back to their home towns, are now attending online classes from those states.Several parents in the city are withdrawing their children from private schools due to financial constraints in the wake of the pandemic. Do you anticipate an influx of students from private schools to government schools in Delhi this year? I think there will be an influx of students from private to government schools this year. I would like to have them because no student should be left out of the education system. Although we are not letting private schools revise their fees structure, parents will still have to pay some amount of fee. It will be difficult for many parents who have lost their jobs amid the pandemic to pay fees. We are ready for the influx. We might have to increase the teacher-student ratio to accommodate more pupils this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-re-ready-for-an-influx-of-students-from-private-to-govt-schools-sisodia/story-jnIOHh1c5jJCtvkAfg8nQM.html
07-08-2020||India||Recovered Covid patients return to hospitals with respiratory illnesses||When Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, 55, thought of returning to work after recovering from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), he realised that he could not walk even small distances without his heart rate increasing.He had to be readmitted in hospital for an echocardiogram to check his heart health. Chatterjee has a family history of heart disease, but did not have a pre-existing condition. He had borderline diabetes and hypertension. “The echo was okay, but a cardiac MRI revealed that I had developed myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles),” said Dr Chatterjee, who has now recovered and has gone back to Covid-19 duty. He is a senior consultant of internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital. He says he is not alone. Some of his recovered Covid-19 patients have come back to the hospital emergency ward with complaints of variable heart rates, breathlessness and chest pain. “After recovering from Covid-19, some of the patients come in with reduced heart function and heart attack or even stroke. This could be owing to the damage to the small vessels caused by Covid-19 that leads to excessive clotting during the course of the disease,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, critical care specialist at Medanta Hospital, . Covid-19 is known to attack the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels, leading to clotting across the body. “Now that the disease has been in the country for five months, we need to start looking at post-Covid rehabilitation. After the acute phase of Covid-19 is over, patients come back to hospitals with symptoms such as lethargy, body aches and itchy throats even four to six weeks later. Some even get heart attacks or strokes, although a scientific link on Covid-19 causing it is yet to be established. Patients also have psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression,” said Dr Chatterjee. Tiredness, lethargy, loss of weight, and psychiatric issues because of remaining in isolation at hospitals have been reported from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) as well, said Dr Anjan Trikha, professor of critical care at the hospital. Dr Chatterjee said doctors should look out for neurological symptoms such asthe guillane barre syndrome wherein the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, leading to weakness and tingling in the extremities. Reports of the syndrome being linked to Covid-119 have come from Italy, China and Austria. Lung disease Doctors from hospitals across the city have reported patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) coming back to the hospitals with low oxygen saturation and secondary infections. A recovered Covid-19 patient in his mid-fifties had to be rushed back with low oxygen saturation to the emergency department of Max hospital, Saket a day after his discharge. “The patient had been admitted to the hospital for almost 20 days and had been discharged after he was doing well and all his symptoms had been resolved. Yet, just a day after he had been discharged he was brought back to the hospital emergency with respiratory failure and died. Since his symptoms were the same as Covid-19, we got him tested again, but the report was negative,” said Dr Sandeep Jain, head of the department of emergency medicine at Max Super Speciality hospital. He has seen about 1 to 2% of the Covid-19 patients treated at the hospital returning back after being discharged. “The recovered patients come back to the hospital emergency with a whole spectrum of lung diseases – from fibrosis (formation of hard fibrous tissues as the lung heals from an injury) to secondary infections and pneumonia. This is more likely in patients who have had severe symptoms of Covid-19 and needed either ventilator support or non-invasive ventilation like Bipap,” he said. The most common sequelae – or a condition caused by another disease -- that doctors have seen in patients who have recovered from severe symptoms of Covid-19 is residual lung fibrosis, wherein the lung capacity decreases as the lung tissues harden after healing from an injury. “Residual lung fibrosis is not restricted to Covid-19 and has been seen in other viral infections as well. This is something we have found in our patients too resulting in inadequate oxygenation. Various drugs are being tried – like a longer course of steroid or anti-fibrosis drugs but nothing is definitive. There is a need for pulmonary rehabilitation in such patients. Usually the fibrosis caused by other disease improves over time but Covid-19 is a very new disease and we do not know what will happen,” said Dr Trikha. His team is trying to analyse CT scans of patients taken six weeks after discharge to assess the extent of fibrosis. Secondary infection Again, a direct link hasn’t been established, but doctors have seen recovered Covid-19 patients return back with secondary infections. “The patients with moderate to severe symptoms of Covid-19 infection are administered steroids and sometimes medicines like Tocilizumab – both of which can suppress the immune system leading to secondary infections. Sometimes patients come out of the ICU {intensive care unit} and then deteriorate because of an infection,” said Mehta. As in the case of measles, Covid-19 may weaken immunity and result in reactivation of dormant infections such as tuberculosis, said Dr PS Narang, associate director of paediatrics at Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovered-covid-patients-return-to-hospitals-with-respiratory-illnesses/story-xi0dog4OJcEf9hfj7OYnBL.html
07-08-2020||India||Faithful throng Ram temple site in Ayodhya||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the “bhoomi pujan” ceremony for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, devout Hindus thronged the site on Thursday to worship an idol of Ram Lalla, the infant god, housed in a prefabricated structure.Devotees also visited the Hanuman Garhi temple, where Modi offered prayers on Wednesday. The shrine is located just a few metres from Ram Janmabhoomi, or birthplace of Ram, where the temple is being built by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, a trust formed to oversee the construction. The grand “bhoomi pujan” and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation in the ceremony were the talk of the town on Thursday. Modi offered prayers to the infant deity at the makeshift temple, performed a circumambulation and planted a sapling on the site before the groundbreaking in which a 40 kg silver brick donated by temple trust chief Mahant Nritya Gopal Das was used. “I saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi performing bhoomi pujan on television. It was a grand ceremony. Some changes might have been made at Ram Janmabhoomi. Out of curiosity I am here today to see those changes,” said Diwakar Maurya, 51, who travelled to Ayodhya from adjoining Gonda.  Saket Kureel, 55, from neighbouring Basti district, wanted to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at the temple in which PM Modi prayed to the deity. When Kureel last visited Ayodhya, the deity’s idol was in a tent from where it was shifted to the prefab structure on March 25 in a ceremony presided over by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.“I want to see the temple where Ram Lalla is residing at present. I saw PM Modi performing the deity’s arti on Doordarshan,” said Kureel. Next to Hanuman Garhi temple, a group of devotees from adjoining Gonda district was spotted. After paying obeisance to Lord Hanuman, the group wanted to visit the temple site. “Yesterday we watched Modiji on Doordarshan performing bhoomi pujan. My family and relatives wanted to visit Ram Janmabhoomi today itself,” said Radhey Shyam Varma, in his 50s. In Faizabad, (locals still use this name to differentiate between old Ayodhya and Faizabad for their convenience), it was business as usual and life was back to normal. Chief minister Adityanath renamed Faizabad district Ayodhya in November 2018. Moving from Faizabad towards Ayodhya, one can still see the decorations on the roadside with big hoardings put up by local MLAs and BJP MP Lallu Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faithful-throng-ram-temple-site/story-osqvJL3j0KMrbG3CK4MqiL.html
07-08-2020||India||Has Mandir edged out Mandal agenda?||On August 5, Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed bhoomi pujan – a customary laying of the first brick -- for the Ram temple at Ayodhya. This marks the culmination of a 135-year-long dispute, whose outcome was crucially shaped by the demolition of the Babri mosque on 6 December 1992. Today, August 7, marks 30 years of the implementation of the B. P. Mandal Commission’s recommendations by the V P Singh-led National Front government. The decision gave 27% reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in government jobs. This was extended to educational institutions under the first United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2006. Both kamandal (an oblong water pot used by sadhus), a term often used to describe the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindutva politics, exemplified by the demand for the temple, or mandir, and Mandal politics had to eventually seek judicial sanction for their goals, but political agitation played a crucial role in fulfilment of their demands. To be sure, the larger political motivation for both Mandal and mandir went beyond the immediate cause being championed. It was to capture political power. The protagonists of Mandal wanted to unite the socially backward against upper castes. This necessarily involved causing fissures in the Hindu vote. The BJP, in keeping with its ideological worldview of Hindu nationalism, has always wanted to consolidate the majority Hindu vote.Given India’s social arithmetic, successfully achieving either of these consolidations is a sure shot way to political power. According to the 2011 census, Hindus have a share of 79.8% in India’s population. The 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) shows that among these 45.7% belong to the Other Backward Classes (OBC), 22.2% to Scheduled Castes (SC) and 9.6% to Scheduled Tribes (ST). This is exactly why the conflict between Mandal and mandir has been the central fault line in Indian politics for a large part of the last three decades. The BJP, which enjoyed high levels of support among the upper caste voters even earlier, could not achieve its current political dominance until it was able to make a dent in the votes of Hindu OBCs and SCs. Interestingly, many experts believe that VP Singh’s decision on Mandal was partly motivated by a desire to stop the ascendancy of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which scripted a turnaround between 1984 and 1989 largely on the basis of its demand for a Ram temple.See Chart 1: BJP all India vote share and estimates of support among upper castes, OBCs, SCs and STs How did the BJP gain support among the votaries of Mandal? Mandal worked by creating fissures in a monolithic Hindu vote bank. The BJP has undermined Mandal by creating further fissures in this vote bank. One place where this strategy has been the most successful is Uttar Pradesh. A look at sub-caste wise vote shares for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the National Election Study conducted by the Centre for Studies of Developing Societies, Lokniti makes this clear. The only sub-castes where the grand alliance of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had an edge vis-a-vis the BJP were Yadavs and Jatavs. These two sub-castes are the primary support base of the SP and the BSP, but put together they only have around 20% share in the state’s population. The BJP had a huge advantage among all other Hindus, including OBCs and SCs. The coming together of the SP and BSP was described as a grand coalition of Mandal. In the end, it was just a coalition of two sub-castes and Muslims. See Chart 2: Vote share in Uttar Pradesh What explains this shift in favour of the BJP? Growing traction for the BJP’s overall politics and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity has definitely played a role. These generic factors have been complemented by a careful strategy. The BJP has been crafting a social justice agenda of its own to counter the narrative of forces which championed Mandal in the 1990s. This has been achieved by portraying dominant OBC, and even Dalit sub-castes, as the usurpers of the distributive gains of Mandal, both in the realm of jobs as well as political representation. This is something that appeals to those who, the BJP claims have been deliberately left behind. The biggest policy move in this direction has been the formation of the Commission to Examine Sub-categorisation of Other Backward Classes for OBCs. This commission, HT reported on 31 December, 2019, might recommend breaking the existing 27% OBC reservations into three bands — with 10% each going to those that have got no benefits so far or only some benefits, and another 7% to those who have thus far received the most benefits (see https://bit.ly/31mvg24). This move, if and when implemented, will create a huge rupture in OBC unity and consolidate the beneficiaries – there are 2633 OBC sub-castes in India – in favour of the BJP. The policy clearly has political undertones, but intra-caste inequality is an objective reality in India. While there is no systemic data at the national level, there exists region-specific research to show this. For example, a 2018 World Bank research paper, which is based on a field survey of 9000 poor households in Bihar shows that intra-caste divisions can play a bigger role in creation of inequality than inter-caste factors.Yadavs, an OBC sub-caste and the core supporters of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the main Mandal based formation in Bihar, reported a higher average land ownership than not just other OBCs and SCs but also some upper castes. The image of a dominant OBC isn’t entirely fiction. To be sure, not all of the BJP’s political success in usurping the erstwhile supporters of Mandal can be attributed to an exercise in social reengineering aimed at breaking OBC-SC unity while placating upper castes. The announcement of 10% reservations for economically weaker sections among those who were not entitled to reservations earlier is a move in the latter direction. In contrast to the usual rhetoric branding the BJP has pro-upper caste, the party has taken the side of the unprivileged on some key issues. The Modi government’s decisions to nullify two Supreme Court orders on dilution of provisions of Prevention of Atrocities against SCs/STs Act and implementation of reservations in higher education teaching jobs at the level of institutions rather than departments (which would have led to reduction in number of reserved positions) are examples of this. Such decisions have helped the BJP pre-empt political damage from the forces of Mandal even at the risk alienating upper caste interests.A reorientation of welfare policies has also played a role. A recently published paper by Yamini Aiyar and Neelanjan Sircar argues that the centralised and technology driven distribution of targeted welfare benefits, most of which go to SCs, STs and OBCs, has allowed the BJP to establish a direct connect with voters, while bypassing state governments and therefore regional parties. Given the fact that most state governments face greater fiscal constraints, this has created an additional problem for regional parties (most Mandal formations are regional), in countering the BJP’s efforts to consolidate their vote bank. With its subaltern social base being fragmented on the question of reservations and state governments’ ability to give an economic boost to the social justice project coming under squeeze, Mandal politics is facing the biggest challenge it has ever faced in its struggle against mandir politics. Conscious efforts to create a subaltern Hindutva narrative and promote local heroes, as was seen in Modi’s reference to Maharaja Suheldev – a lower caste king who fought against a nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni – during his speech at Ayodhya on 5 August, only increase Mandal’s political challenge by creating tensions between Muslims and the Hindu OBCs and SCs. Mandal’s initial success in countering the BJP was based on an electoral unity between Muslims, OBCs and SCs.Does this mean that the kamandal has triumphed over Mandal for good? Politics, especially in a country such as India, is always in a state of churn, and it is hazardous to make predictions. Fresh contradictions could undermine the BJP’s support among the subalterns. In an article published in The Indian Express, Christophe Jaffrelot and Kalaiyarasan A have argued that the Narendra Modi government has been taking decisions which are leading to a reduction in number of reserved jobs and a cut in funds earmarked for Dalits (see https://bit.ly/3a1fldb). Will the BJP be able to manage these contradictions? Or will it suffer a blowback for failing to fulfil the promises to those it claims have been betrayed by Mandal politics? Whatever the answer it is clear that 30 years after Mandal, Indian politics is entering a new phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-mandir-edged-out-mandal-agenda/story-SJyvk748bftQFan8W7ymxN.html
07-08-2020||India||Defence ministry statement on LAC taken down, row erupts||A political row erupted on Thursday over a defence ministry statement on Chinese aggression in eastern Ladakh --- uploaded on the ministry’s official website but later removed --- in which the government acknowledged that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had transgressed into multiple areas in the sensitive sector, with the Congress accusing the Prime Minister of lying on the Chinese intrusions. The statement, posted online on August 4 but removed two days later without any explanation, said Chinese aggression along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) had gone up and the ongoing border standoff was expected to be prolonged. It described the situation in the Ladakh sector as sensitive. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi mounted an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the statement, which summed up the major activities of the department of defence in June, was unexpectedly removed from the website. Also read: Upset at India’s big review of Confucius institutes tomorrow, China says ‘be fair’“Forget standing up to China, India’s PM lacks the courage even to name them. Denying China is in our territory and removing documents from websites won’t change the facts,” Gandhi tweeted. The defence ministry refused to comment on the statement or why it was removed, although it was widely seen as a belated move to skirt controversy. In a previous tweet and later addressing a virtual meeting of party workers from Bihar, Gandhi accused the PM of lying on Chinese intrusions. At an all-party meeting to discuss the situation along the India-China border on June 19, the PM said there was no intrusion into Indian territory. “Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives and the PM is saying that China has not entered our territory. Who will tell the family members of the soldiers how they were martyred? If Chinese forces had not intruded into our territory does that mean our soldiers had crossed over to China?” a senior Congress leader quoted Gandhi as saying during the virtual meeting. Gandhi was referring to the brutal Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15 in which 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed. Gandhi paid tributes to the Bihar Regiment soldiers killed in the violent brawl. “Our PM did not stand with our soldiers by saying that Chinese forces did not intrude into our territory. The fact is that China is still occupying our land in Ladakh,” the leader cited above, who requested anonymity, quoted Gandhi as saying. “My blood boiled and I was very angry when I came to know that China had captured a part of our territory and our soldiers were killed,” another Congress leader quoted Gandhi as having said.Meanwhile, BJP spokespersons declined to comment. The statement said the Chinese PLA transgressed into the Indian side in the areas of Kugrang Nala (near Hot Springs), Gogra and the north bank of Pangong Tso on May 17-18. Also read: India-China expand border talks, to revisit patrolling protocol to avoid skirmishesA transgression along the disputed border is of a fleeting nature and takes place when rival soldiers patrol grey areas on the LAC that both sides stake claim to, while an intrusion refers to the PLA troops encroaching into Indian territory and holding ground there. Both sides report hundreds of transgressions every year, but intrusions leading to standoffs are few and far between. “In any crisis, it is important that our communications are absolutely clear and convey our intent. Any kind of flip-flop only heightens confusion and should be avoided,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), on the statement and its subsequent removal. While the scope of the statement was confined to older developments, it came at a time when military talks on disengagement have hit a roadblock due to serious differences between the two armies related to the Finger Area near Pangong Tso and the PLA’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims to be Indian territory. The statement said Chinese aggression was increasing along the LAC, with specific reference to Galwan Valley where it (aggression) has gone up since May 5. “Consequent to this (the developments on May 17-18), ground level interactions were held between armed forces of both sides to defuse the situation. Corps commander level flag meeting was held on June 6. However, a violent faceoff incident took place between the two sides on June 15, resulting in casualties of both sides,” it said. The June 6 meeting was the first one between the corps commander-ranked officers after border tensions erupted in early May. The senior military commanders have so far met five times, with the last round of talks held on August 2. Limited military disengagement was initiated in Galwan Valley, Hot Springs and Gogra after the June 6 meeting between the senior commanders. However, the June 15 clash dashed disengagement hopes. The document, which only refers to developments in June, said subsequent military talks took place on June 22 to discuss modalities of the de-escalation process. “While engagement and dialogue at military and diplomatic level is continuing to arrive at mutually acceptable consensus, the present standoff is likely to be prolonged,” it said. The ministry said the situation in eastern Ladakh arising from unilateral aggression by China was sensitive and required close monitoring and prompt action based on the evolving scenario. The Finger Area --- a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the Pangong Lake --- has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process with little hope of immediate resolution, people familiar with the developments said. The next stage of disengagement has become highly complicated with the PLA proposing a mutual and equal withdrawal of soldiers from Pangong Tso, a proposal that has been rejected by India, they said, requesting anonymity. Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger Four overlooking Indian deployments, the Indian Army would patrol right up to Finger Eight that New Delhi considers is within Indian territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are 8 km apart.The external affairs ministry on Thursday made it clear once again that the disengagement and de-escalation process along the LAC had not made progress because of the lack of cooperation from the Chinese side. Responding to several questions on the troubled disengagement process during a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “India remains committed to this objective. We also expect that the Chinese side will work with us sincerely for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas.” Though China has sought to give the impression that the disengagement had been completed at most locations along the LAC, the Indian side said last month there had been “some progress” but the process “has as yet not been completed”. Srivastava also referred to the July 5 phone conversation between the Special Representatives of India and China on the border issue – National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi – and reiterated that the two officials had agreed that early and complete disengagement and de-escalation in border areas in line with bilateral agreements and protocols and full restoration of peace and tranquillity were “essential for the smooth overall development of bilateral relations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mod-statement-on-lac-taken-down-row-erupts/story-y3V9cKw2ROURtaDLlys4CM.html
07-08-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling suspect had good rapport with CM’s office: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday told a special court in Kochi that the prime suspect in the Kerala gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, had a good rapport with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office, triggering renewed opposition demands for the latter’s resignation. Assistant solicitor general P Vijaykumar made this submission in the NIA court while opposing the bail plea of Suresh. He said she had established a good rapport with the CM’s office through suspended senior bureaucrat M Sivasankar, with whom she had good relations and who helped her in getting the plum posting of an information technology consultant to the Kerala government.Vijaykumar, however, said investigations so far have shown that Sivasankar did not intervene to secure the release of a consignment addressed to the Thiruvananthapuram consulate of the United Arab Emirates that contained contraband gold when the customs department blocked it despite repeated pleas made by Suresh.The case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized from the consignment. P Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate who came to receive the consignment, was arrested by the customs department after the recovery of gold and two other suspects, Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from a hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Sivasankar, a senior Indian Administrative Service officer and chief minister Vijayan’s principal secretary, was suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced. Suresh’s counsel Joe Paul said she had become a victim in a tug of war between the central and state governments. A month after the investigation, the NIA had failed to produce any fresh evidence against his client, Paul said. He also denied the claim that Suresh had a good rapport with the CM’s office. The court said it will decide on the bail plea on Monday. The court asked the NIA how provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or UAPA, could be invoked against the suspect. The agency said a portion of the proceeds from the gold smuggling was diverted to fund anti-national activities. It also said that after a preliminary investigation it found that one of the suspects, K T Ramees, who is in NIA custody now, was in touch with some fundamentalist organizations. He also undertook many foreign trips including Tanzania in Africa and he was suspected to be a part of the international smuggling and drug racket, the NIA said. When two of Suresh’s bank lockers were opened by the probe team 10 days ago, it reportedly found Rs 1 crore in cash and two kg of gold. These lockers were in the joint name of Suresh and a chartered accountant. The latter reportedly told the team that he was asked by Sivasankar to help Suresh to open lockers three years ago.

After the NIA filed its affidavit, the opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stepped up pressure on the CM to resign. “The CM can’t get away sacrificing his secretary. He should resign at least now,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader A Ananthan said: “Investigation is on in the case and the CM also said it is in the right direction.

07-08-2020||India||Indian Railways ends ‘bungalow peon’ practice||Indian Railways has decided to end the colonial-era practice of posting “bungalow peons” known as Telephone Attendant-cum-Dak Khalasis (TADKs) at the residences of senior officials of the 167-year-old national transporter.The announcement was made in an order issued by the railway board on Thursday amid a review of the British-era legacy following allegations that railway officers tended to misuse the services of TADKs. No new appointment to the post will be processed starting with immediate effect, said the order, a copy of which was reviewed by Hindustan Times.“The issue regarding appointment of TADK is under review in Railway Board. It has, therefore, been decided that any appointment of fresh face substitutes as TADK should not either be processed or made with immediate effect. Further, all cases approved for such appointments since 1st July 2020 may be reviewed and position advised to Board. This may be complied with strictly in all Railway establishments,” the order said.Also read: Railways to create over 1.1mn man-days work for migrants in 6 statesA TADK is treated as a temporary employee of Indian Railways in the Group D category after the initial 120 days of service. The posting becomes a permanent one after a screening test on completion of three years of service.“Indian Railways is on a fast transformational path of all-round progress. Many practices and management tools are being reviewed in view of changes in technology and working conditions. The measures taken are to be seen in such a context,” a spokesperson for the ministry of railways said.Indian Railways last month issued an order to end the British-era practice of using Dak Messengers, or personal messengers, for official communications and move towards video conferencing in a bid to save costs.Bungalow peons have been posted at the residences of railway officers to perform duties such as attending to telephone calls and carrying files from their offices to homes. Over the years, concerns have been raised that TADKs were being used by officers to perform their household chores.“There is little sense in continuing with the practice in this era of mobile phones given what their initial primary tasks were. Most of the times they end up getting deployed for domestic work by the officers,” a railway official explained, requesting anonymity. In a 2018 verdict on a case filed by a former TADK, Anup Kumar, in the Central Administrative Tribunal that he had been discharged from services by an officer of North Central Railwayi in an arbitrary and illegal manner, the tribunal ruled in favour of the officer. Also read: Vital railway infrastructure projects to continue amid Covid-19 pandemic“According to the applicant, there is rampant misuse of the services of Bungalow Khalasis by many of the Railway Officers. Even though they are engaged mainly to perform the duties such as attending telephone calls at the residence of the officer concerned, carrying files from office to the residence of the concerned officer and back etc., in actual practice, they are treated as domestic servants to do the work of cleaning, washing, cooking etc. and they are thrown out even for the slightest mistake on their part,” the order said, quoting the applicant. Railway minister Piyush Goyal, after taking charge of the ministry of railways in 2017, urged senior officials to discontinue the colonial- era practice of having railway employees work at their homes. Around 10,000 railway employees were then relieved of their duties as TADKs until 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-ends-bungalow-peon-practice/story-0YdXlX1uFIy2bCsttkmmVL.html
07-08-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown helped us scale up health infra, says Health minister||The Covid-19 lockdown helped India enhance its healthcare infrastructure to test and treat more people as hospitals increased their daily capacity of dealing with infection cases at least 35 times during this period, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday.“Despite India’s high population density and less support in terms of GDP expenditure on healthcare, India managed to build health infrastructure during lockdown to effectively manage the Covid-19 outbreak. On evaluation we have found that country’s daily handling capacity of Covid-19 cases in hospitals has increased to almost 35 times since pre-lockdown time,” he said at a meeting with Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia. “Our isolation beds have increased by more than 34 times and intensive care unit (ICU) beds have gone up by more than 20 times. The period was utilized to quickly augment the country’s healthcare infrastructure.”Vardhan said their focus has equally been on ensuring that non-Covid services are not affected. “The health secretary has been regularly conducting review meetings with states, and the situation was being monitored at the highest levels. Adequate instructions were being given to states also for managing non-Covid health conditions.”He said out of 36 Indian states and Union territories, 33 were performing over 140 Covid-19 tests per million population daily as per WHO’s guidelines. “Only three states are lagging behind as per the latest data available, and we are hopeful that those remaining states will also soon catch up. Our percentage of serious patients needing ventilator, oxygen support or ICU support is also low. It has been much below 5% so our health infrastructure has not been overwhelmed. Our patients are recovering faster, which is a result of concerted efforts and effective clinical management skills of our healthcare staff.”He said they started with one lab--Pune’s National Institute of Virology in January and now India has 1,366 labs spread across the country that conduct Covid-19 related tests for diagnosis and surveillance purposes. “From having the capacity of performing about 6,000 tests a day in March, the laboratories approved for Covid-19 testing are now performing about 650,000 daily. The way our laboratory network has spread a patient will not take more than three hours to reach a lab for testing from anywhere in the country. That has been our achievement in all these months.”India has tested at least 20 million samples for Covid-19 since January 22. They include about 2.5 million antigen-based tests.WHO urged its member countries in the region to maintain and accelerate the resumption of disrupted health-care services, hit by the pandemic.“The pandemic has put immense strain on health systems across the South-East Asia Region. The previous disease outbreaks have shown that disruption to essential services caused by an outbreak can be more deadly than the outbreak itself. We must fast track efforts and do all we can to avoid that happening while continuing efforts to break Covid-19 transmission chains,” said Singh.Lalit Kant, a former head of Indian Council of Medical Research’s epidemiology and communicable diseases department, said the lockdown was essentially a strategy to buy time. “By restricting the movement of infected individuals who may or may not be symptomatic, we curtailed the chances of an infected person spreading the infection in the community. In various countries lockdown has been credited for flattening the peak of the epidemic.”On Thursday, there were 5,95,501 active Covid-19 cases in India and 13,28,336 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-helped-us-scale-up-health-infra-says-harsh-vardhan/story-ir9mCSDLUMA9jgaXi4C2mK.html
07-08-2020||India||India’s coronavirus case trajectory worse than United States, Brazil||India’s trajectory of cases at two million cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is more dangerous than what it was in the United States and Brazil when these countries hit the same grim landmark, shows an analysis by HT. This suggests that India’s caseload could surpass the tallies in these two countries unless the trend reverses or a vaccine is developed. Though India has performed better than the two nations on several parameters such as case fatality rate (CFR) and recoveries, its steady rate of increase of cases raises serious concerns about a potential surge, keeping in mind the country’s population. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todaySimilarities in geography and demography have caused a prolonged outbreak of Covid-19 in these countries, which is largely responsible for these three nations to be the ones hit worst in the world. The US is the world’s third largest country by geographical area, Brazil fifth, and India seventh. As the infection wanes in one part of the country, it waxes in another. In terms of population, India is the second most populous country in the world, the US third, and Brazil sixth. Expectedly, per capita infection and death numbers are low for all three countries compared to smaller and less populous nations. DOUBLING RATE The doubling rate refers to the number of days it will take for any region to double its caseload. So if there were 1,000 cases in a region on a particular day and the doubling rate at the time was five days, it would mean that the cases would touch 2,000 five days later. When Covid-19 cases in the United States touched two million on June 7, the country had a doubling rate of 60.2 days, and when Brazil hit the same caseload, its doubling rate was 35.7 days. As India touched two million cases on Thursday, it has a significantly worse doubling rate – 22.7 days. Brazil crossed the two million-mark on July 16, incidentally the same day India crossed the million-mark. In the three weeks since, Brazil (which had twice India’s caseload to begin with), added a little over 850,000 cases while India added a million cases in the same time. Also read| Covid-19: India posts its second million in just 21 daysIn fact, if cases in India continue to grow at the same rate they have till now, the doubling rate suggests that the next million cases may take just a little over two weeks. DEATHS, ACTIVE CASES & RECOVERIES Active cases — those that are currently infected — form a crucial statistic as they directly influence the load on a region’s health care system. Of the two million cases in the US (when the US crossed that mark on June 7), 1,110,225, or 55.2% of the total caseload was active – the highest among the three counties.  India has the second-highest number with 605300 active cases, or 29.9% of the total caseload. In Brazil, 571,141 (28.34% of total cases) were active when the country reached two million cases. The current proportion of active cases in the US is 45.7% and Brazil 26.1%. The US has thus far seen a total of 4.97 million cases and Brazil, 2.86 million.Deaths is one category where India has performed significantly better than the other two countries. With 41,633 deaths till Thursday, India’s case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.1% is among the better in the world, and is lower than the global average of 3.75%. It is also significantly better than the CFR of Brazil (3.81% with 76822 deaths) and the US (5.72% with 115050 fatalities), when both countries hit the two-million-case mark. In terms of recoveries, the US fares the worst among the three countries with only 39.2% (785,657) of its two million cases recovered. Brazil and India with 67.8% and 68.1% of cases having recovered, have done much better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-case-trajectory-worse-than-us-brazil/story-W7uh2EGuA4nXKwBaKSgz5O.html

The order became public on Thursday when the state government confirmed it had received it. “We have received the directives from NHRC. The state government is taking appropriate action,” said Chhattisgarh’s chief secretary R P Mandal.“As regards to the registration of FIR [First Information Report] against Professor Nandini Sundar and others, the DGP [director general of police DM Awasthi] has submitted that during the investigation, no evidence was found against her, Archana Prasad, Vineet Tiwari, Sanjay Parate, Manju, and Mangla Ram Karma. Hence, their names have been removed from the FIR,” the NHRC said in the order, a copy of which HT has seen.Awasthi said the other seven accused CH Prabhakar, B Durga Prasad, B Rabindranath, D Prabhakar, R Lakshimaiya, Mohammad Nazir and K Rajendra Prasad were acquitted of all the charges by Sukma’s chief judicial magistrate in 2018.Sundar reacted to NHRC’s directive and said they were yet to receive any compensation. “But, as and when I receive it, I plan to share the sum to support the legal aid for innocent tribals, who are falsely implicated...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-asks-chhattisgarh-to-compensate-activists/story-w6h09mnvFzBHA9zNdCjgTO.html
07-08-2020||India||BJP village head in Kulgam shot dead; second in 3 days||A 48-year-old village council head was on Thursday shot dead near his home at Vessu in South Kashmir’s Kulgam district in the second such attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers in the Kashmir Valley in three days.Inspector general of police (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said unidentified terrorists killed Sajjad Ahmad Khanday, who was Vessu’s sarpanch, 20 metres from his home. Kumar added he was staying at a high-security residential complex along with several other sarpanchs and had left it on Thursday morning to visit his family. “He later succumbed to his injuries,” said Kumar.Dozens of local bodies members, especially those affiliated with the BJP, were shifted to safer locations following intelligence inputs that they may be targeted on the eve of the first anniversary of the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370 that stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its special status in August last year, officers aware of the matter said. They added security forces have launched an operation to track down Khanday’s attackers.Khanday was killed two days after another sarpanch, Arif Ahmad Shah, was shot in his neck in Akhran village of Kulgam’s Devsar area. Police said he was fighting for his life in a critical condition at Srinagar’s Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences.The attack on Shah triggered panic and prompted three BJP functionaries from Kulgam, Nisar Ahmad Wani, Sabzar Ahmad Paddar and Ashiq Hussain Palla, to announce their disassociation from the party.BJP’s youth wing leader, Marouf Bhat, was among two activists to resign from the party in July after its former Bandipora district president, Sheikh Waseem Bari, was killed along with his father and brother. Jammu & Kashmir police have said Lashkar-e-Taiba members were involved in the killing of Bari and his kin. Ajay Pandita, another sarpanch, was also killed in South Kashmir’s Larkipora in June.BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur condemned Khanday’s killing and sought security cover for sarpanchs and panchs (village council members) under threat. “Killing of Sajad is very unfortunate. He was our constituency president for Vessu. Attack on him is the second incident in the same area in the past three days,” Thakur said.He appealed the administration to look into the issue and work out a security cover model for the vulnerable sarpanchs and panchs, especially those affiliated with the BJP. “The list of sarpanchs, panchs, and other activists who are vulnerable to militant attacks has already been submitted to the police,” he said.Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party chief Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari condemned the killing. “Today’s cowardly attack on a grassroots level representative has added to the fear psychosis among the Panchayat representatives and other political activists who witnessed three such attacks in the last 10 days,” said Bukhari. He urged the government to take cognizance of this incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-village-head-in-kulgam-shot-dead-second-in-3-days/story-ORfn65M3fqGkqieno2mY3M.html
07-08-2020||India||Rajasthan HC refuses a stay on BSP MLAs’ merger with Cong||A Rajasthan high court division bench on Thursday disposed of a petition seeking an immediate stay on the merger of six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lawmakers with the ruling Congress in 2019, saying a single judge hearing a similar plea will decide the matter.“We remain confident that the Hon’ble Single Judge will hear and dispose of the stay applications filed by the appellants on the same day in accordance with law and without, in any manner, being prejudiced by any directions/observations issued by us hereinabove,” said the division bench of chief justice Indrajit Mahanty and justice Prakash Gupta.Rajasthan assembly speaker C P Joshi approved the merger a day after the six joined the Congress in September 2019 and prompted opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek their disqualification in February. Joshi on July 30 rejected the BJP’s disqualification petition.The single-judge bench sought replies of Joshi and the six lawmakers by August 11 after BSP and BJP lawmaker Madan Dilawar moved the court against the speaker’s order. On Tuesday, BSP and Dilawar filed a review petition seeking a stay on the merger.The six lawmakers are crucial to chief minister Ashok Gehlot as he faces a revolt by his former deputy, Sachin Pilot, and 18 Congress lawmakers supporting him. The Gehlot camp has claimed support of 101 legislators in the 200-member assembly. The BJP has 72 members in the House.The division bench said the notices issued to the six should be served on or before August 8. “The District Judge, Jaisalmer, is directed to provide all necessary assistance to the special messenger to effect service of such notices, and if required, the District Judge may seek necessary assistance of the Superintendent of Police, Jaisalmer, for effecting service on the private respondents who are said to be residing at Jaisalmer,” the court said. “We further direct the appellants and petitioners to publish a notice in daily newspaper ‘Rajasthan Patrika’, Barmer-Jaisalmer edition.”The single judge will hear the case next on August 11.Joshi’s lawyer, Prateek Kasliwal, said the division bench found Dilawar and BSP’s plea unmaintainable.BSP’s lawyer, Dinesh Kumar Garg, said the directions on Thursday were in their favour. “Our biggest concern was the serving of notice and the division bench has heard our plea. Previously, we were not sure that whether the notices issued in would be served but today’s directions of will ensure that notices are served. We have full justice in the court and today’s direction will go in favour of the party.”Dilawar’s lawyer, Ashish Sharma, said their biggest concern was the six are staying at a Jaisalmer hotel, where they have been put up until the assembly session begins on August 14, and the notices would not be served on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-hc-refuses-a-stay-on-bsp-mlas-merger-with-cong/story-cMfQ3kaY1r8eVUw6mNWaOL.html
07-08-2020||India||Astute political skills may be key for new J&K L-G Manoj Sinha||Non-controversial, meticulous and amiable are among the descriptors that people who know him use to characterize Manoj Sinha, who made his debut in campus politics in 1982 in Banaras Hindu University and went on to become a quietly forceful presence in the rough and tumble of Uttar Pradesh politics. It is those qualities that weighed in favour of the 61-year-old politician when decision makers at the Centre sat down to pick a successor to bureaucrat GC Murmu as lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Murmu stepped down from the post on Wednesday evening after more than nine months in the hot seat.Also read: Former JK lieutenant governor GC Murmu appointed India’s new CAGA three-time member of Parliament and a minister in the Narendra Modi government’s first term at the Centre, Sinha’s appointment as lieutenant governor of a newly formed Union territory comes at a time when the region is grappling with multiple issues, from security concerns to a tumultuous social and political landscape .Sinha was first elected to the Lok Sabha from Ghazipur in 1996, and retained his seat in 1999 and 2014. He held the portfolio of minister of state for railways between May 2014 and July 2016 and was later given independent charge of the ministry of telecommunications as well.His skills as an administrator, his ability as an astute politician and the perception that he is a man of consensus are being seen as key attributes for a position where he will have to oversee restoration of the political process, reconstitution of the assembly, a possible reversal to statehood and the most challenging task of it all -- winning the trust of the people.Choosing a politician instead of a bureaucrat or a retired army man is also being read as a signal of New Delhi’s intent to foster friendly ties with the state’s bureaucracy and its people and bank on Sinha’s ability to juggle statecraft with legislative limitations.The state is looking for a person who can amalgamate the political savviness of Satya Pal Malik with the administrative rigor of Murmu, said a person familiar with the thinking behind the appointment.To be sure, Malik’s tenure, which came to an end after the August 5, 2019 reorganisation of the state into two Union territories, was marked by controversies. The garrulous governor, who left the administration and political bosses in New Delhi red-faced sometimes with his utterances, was otherwise known to be accessible to the man on the street, the media and the political class--barring that one instance when Raj Bhavan’s Fax machine failed to work as various politicians factions tried to reach him to stake their claim to forming the government after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government fell in June 2018.In contrast, Murmu, who has worked closely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi was conspicuous by his silence and absence from the Raj Bhavan nestled in the Shankaracharya foothills in Srinagar. People close to him say that Murmu preferred the guarded, by-the-book approach; keeping his interactions to a minimal and preferring to stay away from political commentary. The departure from his safe posturing came only when his suggestions to allow 4G telecom services in the Valley and his free-wheeling comments about the timing of elections in the Union territory earned him the Centre’s disapproval and a terse note from the Election Commission reminding him to respect the poll body’s remit.The appointment of Sinha, who will have to walk the tight rope of balancing New Delhi’s concerns with conflicting demands in the two diverse regions of Jammu and Kashmir, is also being compared to Arjun Singh’s appointment to the gubernatorial post in Punjab in 1985. Then PM Rajiv Gandhi chose to appoint Singh as the governor to start the political process and elections were soon held in the state after President’s rule ended. Sinha’s appointment is being seen as an indication of the Centre’s will to initiate the political process in J&K, said a second person aware of the details.An alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi, formerly known as Banaras Engineering College, Sinha overcame the caste faultiness in his constituency of Ghazipur, which was also once a left bastion. He is not unfamiliar with tricky political turf. It was for this reason that Sinha, wedded to the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological mentor, was considered a front-runner for the chief minister’s post after the BJP’s stunning victory in the assembly elections in UP in 2017. He was pipped to the post at the last minute by Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindutva leader and five-time Lok Sabha MP.If he was disappointed at losing the job, he did not show it, said a party colleague. According to this colleague, Sinha proceeded to push ahead development schemes in Varanasi, the PM’s Lok Sabha constituency, drafted key rail projects and executed the ambitious India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) project to provide banking and financial services to people in rural areas through the postal network.On Thursday morning while leaving home for his new address in J&K, Sinha’s only comment to the waiting media retinue was “accha hai” (it is good). His associates said he knew of the appointment that President Ram Nath Kovind put his signature on before 7 a.m. only a few days ago and met PM Modi late on Wednesday following the latter’s return from Ayodhya.While a section of politicians in the UT have extended a welcome to Sinha with the footnote of hope that he would be their emissary in Delhi, many in the Valley said they prefer to wait and watch. “Jammu and Kashmir is not left to the will and wisdom of governors,” said a former legislator on condition of anonymity. To the sceptics who have already pronounced an unfavourable outcome for Sinha, an outsider from the Hindi belt who prefers long walks, books and the familiarity of his Ghazipur constituency, a long-time associate, who didn’t want to be named, has a story to tell.Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the party president gave Sinha the freedom to pick any seat of his liking to contest. The caste arithmetic in his existing Ghazipur seat, having been disturbed by a coalition of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, made it untenable for the upper caste leader to retain Ghazipur, but the tenacious Sinha refused to abandon his seat, said the associate. He eventually lost the seat in 2019. It is this persistence that the associate is confident will help Sinha navigate the matrix of political instability, the games of smoke and mirrors and fragile security in Jammu and Kashmir to perform the job he has been entrusted with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/astute-political-skills-may-be-key-for-new-j-k-l-g-sinha/story-YCJnrwdIVaOJqHdGSbgrYP.html
07-08-2020||India||On China’s outburst over Confucius centres’ review, India pulls out 2009 rulebook||India on Thursday rebutted Beijing’s attempt to attribute motives to New Delhi’s review of the Confucius Institutes, citing a 2009 rule that mandates cultural centres sponsored or supported by foreign organisations to seek the foreign ministry’s approval.Hindustan Times had first reported the government’s move to initiate the review of Confucius institutes and 54 agreements signed by Indian institutions with Chinese universities.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the detailed guidelines issued in 2009 applied to Confucius centres also.“Naturally, if any Indian institution were to enter into or has entered into an arrangement which would come under the purview of these guidelines, then it would require the approval of the Government. And as a corollary if the approval was not taken when establishing such centers, then it was not in conformity with the guidelines,” Srivastava said, without directly referring to the review of agreements signed by central universities and institutions with their Chinese counterparts.Also Read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomSrivastava’s curt statement was a response to Chinese embassy in Delhi that this week attempted to pressurise New Delhi from going slow on action against Confucius centres opened without fulfilling mandatory requirements.In a statement 24 hours before India’s higher education regulator and top education ministry officials were to initiate the review exercise, the Chinese embassy on Tuesday asked India to handle collaboration in education in an objective and fair manner and “avoid politicising normal cooperation”.The Chinese statement didn’t have the desired impact. A government official involved in the process told Hindustan Times that they had gone right ahead to initiate the review at a two-hour-long meeting on Wednesday. “It is still work in progress and some more details have been sought,” the official said.The education ministry review would, besides taking a close and hard look at the setting up of Confucius Institutes and Confucius Classrooms in seven colleges and universities, would also review 54 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) signed between Chinese institutions and prestigious Indian institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, and Jawaharlal Nehru University.The review came against the backdrop of the three-month long border standoff between the two sides, which currently shows little signs of abating. India has already banned over 100 Chinese mobile apps and its clones and barred Chinese companies from getting any government contract without a special permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-china-s-outburst-over-confucius-centres-review-india-pulls-out-2009-rulebook/story-PDrSjgX4m0eNA8EMW6lLlK.html
07-08-2020||India||2 Chinese generals dissect Xi Jinping’s US policy, push for a relook||Dai Xu, a top general of the People’s Liberation Army has advocated that China should take stock of its relative weaknesses compared to the US and behave accordingly, according to a report in Nikkei Asian Review that cited a recent article authored by the officer who has been described as one of China’s most prominent hawks.In his article, Dai underscored how no country had come forward to establish an alliance against the United States through the ongoing China vs US episode that has been playing out. “China has provided assistance to so many countries, benefiting them in so many ways, but at this critical moment, none of them has taken any unified action with China,” Dai wrote.The top general, the analysis in Nikkei Asian Review said, appeared to suggest that China had gotten ahead of itself.. He warned that China should never “knock on (America’s) door and make a loud announcement that ‘I shall surpass you, replace you and be the world’s number one’.”The Nikkei Asian Review analysis authored by a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Richard McGregor, interpreted multiple voices from China to signal the view that Beijing’s interests would have been far better served by sticking with the low-profile policy counseled by Deng Xiaoping. The reference the doctrine of a revered political leader like Deng, was seen as an effort to criticise Xi Jinping without mentioning him by name.In the article  (Here is the link to the article published in a mainstream Chinese publication), General Dai said that traditionally, China and the US had a very close trade relationship, but the Trump administration has now branded the country a trade terrorist and a global economic aggressor.He also listed 10 understanding about the Sino-US relationship. Among them is the United States’ ruthless push towards portraying China in a negative light which is beyond the expectations of most Chinese officials. He also said that China has not received support from any country.General Dai then went on to say that the US has been united at the domestic front. He also said that China needs to understand that China is not a paper tiger, but a real tiger that kills people.Suggesting the way forward, the military general said that China doesn’t need to make a loud announcement to be number 1. General Dai said that even if China knows it can beat the US, it needs to keep a low profile.He also said that China should consider the US as world’s number 1.Another retired army officer, Major General Qiao Liang had told South China Morning Post in May this year that Beijing “should not consider the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to take back Taiwan by force”.The military strategist said Taiwan can be used by the US and its western allies to impose sanctions on China that would stop Beijing from importing resources needed for its industry.“China’s ultimate goal is not the reunification of Taiwan, but to achieve the dream of national rejuvenation – so that all 1.4 billion Chinese can have a good life,” Qiao, a professor at the PLA National Defence University in Beijing, had said in an interview to SCMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-chinese-generals-dissect-china-s-us-policy-ask-for-relook/story-QAsG2EsUQN7FENMj4kCqJM.html

It was broadcast by television stations in UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal and several other countries.The main signal was generated by public broadcaster Doordarshan which placed multiple cameras, Outside Broadcasting (OB) and Digital Satellite News Gathering (DSNG) vans for elaborate production and live telecast.People also watched the event on YouTube streams.

Doordarshan’s news arm DD News separately shared visuals with Asia Pacific countries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the ‘bhoomi poojan’ in Ayodhya for the Ram temple, bringing to fruition the BJP’s ‘mandir’ movement that defined its politics for three decades.Amid the chanting of shlokas, PM Modi consecrated the very first bricks for the temple at the spot where devotees believe Lord Ram was born.“The wait of centuries has ended,” he said after performing the groundbreaking ceremony made possible by a Supreme Court verdict last year that allowed the construction of the temple at the site where the Babri mosque was demolished by kar sevaks in 1992.President Ram Nath Kovind said the event defines India’s spirit of social harmony and people’s zeal, while Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said the construction of the Ram temple is much more than a religious affair and the structure will stand as a tribute to the best of timeless human values.The groundbreaking ceremony was held in the Uttar Pradesh city on Wednesday morning. The road leading from Hanuman Garhi temple to the ceremony site (Ram Janmabhoomi) wore an illuminated look in the evening, with several earthen lamps lit outside shops, houses and guest houses.Some people also celebrated by bursting firecrakers in the temple town.It was in 1990 that then BJP president Lal Krishna Advani embarked on the Ram Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya to galvanise support for the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-ayodhya-ceremony-widely-watched-across-the-world-highest-viewership-from-us-uk/story-uVxfs7k478buwPF0NwBZPN.html
07-08-2020||India||Turkey’s tentacles in India go deeper than thought, says new intel warning||The Turkish foreign ministry on Wednesday criticised India’s decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year, asserting that it did not contribute to peace and stability in the region. India had, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government in Ankara said, “further complicated the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and not served peace and stability in the region”. It also called for dialogue between India and Pakistan.The Turkish statement has been seen to have been issued in coordination with Imran Khan’s government in Pakistan, the only country other than Xi Jinping’s China to have put out a statement on the first anniversary of Jammu and Kashmir’s new status in the Indian constitution. Erdoğan’s government did not make any reference to Pakistan’s new map that had been issued just hours earlier that counts Indian territories as its own.Also Read: In Imran Khan’s 18-point Kashmir plan for Aug 5, outreach to Turkey, Malaysia and ChinaNew Delhi isn’t surprised. In the past, Erdoğan has gone out of his way to echo Imran Khan on Kashmir. Like in February this year, Erdoğan’s speech in the Pakistan National Assembly during his visit to Islamabad compared the “struggle of Kashmiris” with the Ottoman Empire’s fight during World War I.But this isn’t all that Ankara has been doing. An intelligence report on the role played by fronts for the Turkish government last month accused Ankara of efforts to radicalise Indian Muslims and recruit fundamentalists. Turkey had emerged as the “the hub of anti-India activities” next only to Pakistan.A second report handed over to national security planners over the past week said fronts for the Turkish government or the outfits it supports - some of them directly linked to Erdogan and his family - appeared to have made deeper inroads in India than assessed earlier. Much of this effort is directed via three sectors: Turkish state media, educational institutes and the nonprofit sector, or NGOs.Also Read: Imran Khan’s Pakistan might end up regretting its new ‘political map’. Here is whyThe intelligence assessment identified individuals and groups, some of them also suspected to be in touch with Pakistan’s ISI, who had been lured to work with entities in Turkey that had strong links with the Erdogan regime.In particular, the report listed organisations that had started accelerating what it described as “lucrative scholarships” to Indians to study in Turkey.“Turkey has been providing lucrative scholarships and running exchange programmes for Indian Kashmiri and Muslim students to study in Turkey through state-sponsored NGOs. Once the students land in Turkey, they are approached and taken over by the Pakistan proxies operating there,” the report said.The list of outfits that sponsor the scholarships is long, the report said. It includes Turkey Youth Foundation (TUGVA), Presidency of Turks Abroad and Related Communities (YTB), Turkish Airlines, Yunnus Emre Institute (YEI), Turkey’s Diyanet Foundation (TDF) and Turkist Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA).“Most of these organisations have direct connections with the Turkish government, President Erdogan or his family,” a counter-terror official said.Also Read: Red flags in Delhi over Erdogan’s Turkey funding anti-India activities: OfficialThe TUGVA, which functions under Erdogan’s son Bilal’s patronage, has developed strong links within India by establishing connections with Islamic outfits in India including Jamaat-e-Islamic Organisation’s student wing, Student Islamic Organisation (SIO), the report said. SIO’s Fawaz Shaheen, however, denied that the students’ body had anything to do with any Turkish group or entity related to Erdogan or his family. “We have nothing to do with either Turkish or other groups involved in anti-India activities,” Fawaz Shaheen said.The intel report also accused the Turkish Embassy in Delhi of forging alliances with Indian NGOs, pointing that Indian activists who serve Ankara’s agenda are increasingly being sent to Turkey on exposure trips and encouraged to speak against India. Some of the Turkish organisations that have been used to launch coordinated attacks on India are its International Humanitarian Relief Foundation, the TDF (which also funds scholarships) and Pak-Turkey Cultural Association.The TDF is part of the religious directorate of Turkey, now deployed with Erdogan supporters, and tasked to build Erdogan’s image as the tallest leader of the Muslim community by championing the Islamic cause where it suits Erdogan’’s ambitions.And Turkey’s authoritarian leader for 18 years has many.The most prominent has been to lead the Muslim world, building on Turkey’s imperial Ottoman past. The Ottoman sultans doubled as the caliphs of the Muslim world. Erdogan and his supporters believe they can revive the Ottoman Empire’s former glory that collapsed nearly a century back, and its peak in the 1500s ruled over much of Southeastern Europe, west Asia, and North Africa’s coastal strip.Erdogan’s effort to expand its influence among South Asian Muslims comes against the backdrop of his pitch to challenge Saudi Arabia’s dominance in the Islamic world and offering a conservative Turkey with Ottoman traditions as a model for Islamic nations to follow.It is a narrative that works well for Imran Khan in the Indian subcontinent, particularly given India’s recent success in deepening its ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In April, Pakistan’s public broadcaster started airing Turkey’s television series, Ertugrul Gazi, which is loosely based on the story of the 13th century Muslim Oghuz Turk leader Ertugrul, whose son Osman Ghazi is considered to be the founder of the Ottoman Empire.The series dubbed in Urdu, promoted by Imran Khan in Pakistan just as it was supported by Erdogan in Turkey, depicts the bravery of Muslim Oghuz Turks fighting the Mongol, Christians and Byzantines, glorifies the Ottoman Empire and is seen as a key part of Turkey’s “soft power” influence in the Muslim world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/erdogan-s-turkey-working-on-imran-khan-s-script-funds-fronts-to-hurt-india-intel/story-2n8taLmj0IO2pG3M5K2ALJ.html

The company will now start a mid-stage trial of the vaccine candidate, ZyCoV-D, in over 1,000 healthy adult volunteers from Thursday to test its effectiveness, it said in a regulatory filing. Zydus plans to complete late-stage trials for ZyCoV-D by February or March and could produce up to 100 million doses a year initially, the company’s chairman told Reuters last month. The safety of the vaccine candidate in volunteers enrolled in the early-stage trial, who were administered doses since July 15, was endorsed by an independent data safety monitoring board. Zydus is also among the several Indian generic drugmakers that have licensing agreements with US-based Gilead Sciences to produce remdesivir, the antiviral that has been approved in the country as an emergency treatment to fight the coronavirus outbreak. India reported a daily jump of more than 50,000 coronavirus infections for the seventh straight day on Wednesday. Total cases now stand at 1.91 million, the third biggest, after the United States and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-found-safe-in-early-stage-human-trial/story-gMWYyy6mehIuzHZaGS2aKM.html

The nuclear non-proliferation regime that exists today is a product of the Cold War — and those circumstances exist only in skeletal form today. India, a secondary victim of the earlier non-proliferation regime, should ensure that this time it has a seat at the high table when the rules of any new nuclear order are being shaped.There are a number of reasons why the present non-proliferation order is struggling. The most important is that the original order was constructed around Washington and Moscow. These two capitals still control some 90% of the world’s nuclear armaments. But Russia’s nuclear future is limited by its small economic base. China’s arsenal, unfettered by any nuclear arms control agreement, grew 21% between 2012 and 2019 and its nuclear weapons budget is now the second-largest in the world. More worryingly, most estimates say Pakistan has the world’s fastest-growing nuclear warhead count. India’s is also growing, though New Delhi’s investments have been more directed at survivability and deployment than sheer numbers. Throw in North Korea’s continuing nuclear progress, Israel’s covert atomic arsenal, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, Japan’s potential and it becomes evident the future of nuclear weapons lies in Asia. But Asia has no arms control treaties, poorly articulated doctrines, no nuclear hotlines or monitoring agreements — and two of the nuclear arsenals are managed by rogue states.The Donald Trump administration, in its own disjointed way, recognises that the United States (US) is held back in the Indo-Pacific by commitments it made to the Soviet Union. It sensibly scrapped the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. It has a case for arguing that a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreement should cover not only the US and Russia but also China, but lacks the diplomatic coherence to ever accomplish this. Any new US government will continue the re-evaluation of the present nuclear proliferation regime. India should be prepared to play a constructive role in the new evolutionary process. Resuscitating the fissile materials cutoff treaty should be on the table for everyone. The comprehensive test ban treaty should not be seen as taboo, if the US and China ratify the treaty. Nuclear weapons have been associated with the Cold War. But their spread and development today is firmly embedded in the evolving Indo-Pacific strategic space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/75-years-after-the-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-bombing-the-world-is-more-unsafe/story-6rMOkYEyhNpiejnAXY7q5O.html
07-08-2020||Editorials||A political hand in Kashmir||In a surprise move — exactly a year after Parliament effected constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and just a little over nine months after he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) of India’s mostsensitive Union Territory — GC Murmu has resigned as L-G. The Centre has appointed Manoj Sinha as the new constitutional head of the UT.Mr Sinha is a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politician, a former minister, a leader rooted in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, and is understood to enjoy Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s confidence. The fact that a political figure has been sent to J&K is a positive sign, for the impasse in Kashmir is fundamentally political. Politicians often have deftness, agility, interpersonal skills, the ability to reconcile contradictions, and look for out-of-the-box solutions that bureaucrats lack, mired as they are in a lifetime’s training of following processes and rules.But being a politician alone is not enough. Mr Sinha will have to understand the nuances of Kashmiri politics and society, the security scenario, and establish a cordial relationship with all stakeholders immediately. He must also reach out to mainstream political leaders, some of whom remain in detention, and bring them back into the political process; create a more democratic environment for civil society to function; and then, create conditions for elections. Mr Sinha will be judged on whether he can hold free and fair elections in J&K, ensure a return to normalcy with democratic rights, and maintain peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-political-hand-in-kashmir/story-al3TRK2IAFuHXpA02KHNbP.html
07-08-2020||Editorials||The Mandal moment||Thirty years ago, on August 7, Indian politics and society changed. In a historic move, the VP Singh government decided to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, and open up reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs. This came in the wake of the gradual political rise of the backward communities, which was due to a set of complex factors. The first was the demographic weight of the backward communities. The second was the fact that OBCs were not a natural constituency of the Congress and preferred peasant-based formations, socialist parties and regional parties — all of which were on the ascendant then. And the third was the impact of the Green Revolution which led to their economic empowerment and desire for upward professional mobility. The immediate political trigger for Mr Singh’s decision was an effort to counter the Mandir politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sought to prioritise religion over caste, but its impact went way beyond that.The Mandal moment saw ferocious backlash by sections of upper castes. This opposition was articulated on two axes — the fact that reservations compromised merit, and if at all reservations should open up beyond what was offered to Scheduled Castes and Tribes, it should be on economic lines. These arguments hid beneath it a real fear of losing power and opportunities. And it launched an era of open hostility between upper castes and backward communities, particularly in the Hindi heartland. OBCs became a force to contend with, and it is no surprise that no government in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar can now be formed without their active support.But it also opened up a Pandora’s Box. For one, the resentment of those communities which did not have a share in the reservation pie increased. And political parties, in order to appease them, continued to expand reservation — to the extent that now economically weaker sections of dominant communities avail quotas, and in many states, there is over 70% reservation in key spheres. This has undermined the entire purpose of reservation, envisaged as a tool to address historic injustice, and made it an exercise in power distribution and employment generation. Second, within OBCs, some communities benefited more than others, which led to a political divide and demands for sub-categorisation, a process currently underway. Mandal empowered communities. But the entire architecture of reservations needs a review, with the aim of creating a just, inclusive and equal society, without pandering to populist movements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-mandal-moment/story-O52OimsoY0VVzYtJxLtz9K.html
