31-08-2020||News||How to secure India against Covid-19||How can India vaccinate a billion-plus people? How would the system work?First, the government will maintain a list of approved vaccines. This list will change, as some get dropped, and others get approved. Second, the government will set a rate per vaccination for each vaccine. Finally, after due diligence, it will create a list of Authorised Vaccinators. These could be government hospitals, reputed private hospitals, diagnostic chains, even pharmacies. Another ecosystem will have to be nurtured to train and certify a few hundred thousand people on how to administer vaccines. Specifications and templates will be distributed for vaccination stations which can be permanent, pop-up, or mobile for making it available anywhere. The government will distribute a standard vaccination software on smartphones and laptops, for the data of every vaccination to be captured in real-time and sent to a central database with proper security, privacy and encryption. With this approach, at least 100,000 vaccination stations can be set up across the country over a year, while vaccine production is simultaneously scaled up.A critical requirement will be the supply chain, including cold chain infrastructure. Vaccine sales will be between approved vaccine vendors and the Authorised Vaccinators; they will have to figure out the cold chain. An entire economy could spring up — new mobile cold chains with refrigerated trucks, or repurposed existing cold chains. People should be able to go to any vaccination station in the country anytime to get a shot. They can also book a slot online. People entering a station and then first authenticate themselves using Aadhaar, phone number, any other digitally authenticable ID. A certified vaccinator will vaccinate them. The data from the vaccination will be uploaded. This data will includes the name and ID of the vaccinator and the recipient, details of the vaccine, and the pre-paid voucher (more on this shortly). The money (for administering the shot) will be credited immediately to the Authorised Vaccinator, and the central database will issue an instant digital certificate. The certificate can be downloaded to the person’s smartphone, printed or stored in a digital locker. The whole process should take about 10 minutes. At 50 vaccinations per day per station, India could do five million vaccinations per day.The digital certificate will be globally portable and verifiable. While the idea of an immunity passport has been questioned, a certificate of immunisation is part of the International Health Regulations for diseases such as yellow fever, there is a precedent for such documentation. With this, the vaccinated person would be able to travel anywhere. If we find that vaccines induce limited immunity, then there will be an expiry date on the certificate, and the person will have to get revaccinated. If it is a dual dose vaccine, then only a provisional certificate will be issued, with the date for the second dose mentioned. The system can enable people to get vaccinated at a date, time, and location of their choice. All payments by the people getting vaccinated will be through pre-paid vouchers, and rates could drop over time with volumes. People who can afford it should and will pay for their vaccines. The government will pay to vaccinate all health workers, its employees and their families, and the poor and vulnerable. Payments can be enabled by giving a DBT voucher, which is only accepted for vaccination. Companies could provide vouchers for all their employees and their families. Philanthropies and corporate foundations could also distribute these vaccination vouchers. These vouchers could be digital or printed for those without phones. The government can issue guidelines to streamline procurement from vaccine manufacturers by Authorised Vaccinators.Since monitoring is part of the life cycle of any vaccine, a digital record of vaccination and a link to self-reported side effects could strengthen India’s vaccine safety surveillance. A sophisticated system could be built on top of this vaccination infrastructure using anonymised aggregate data. For example, if there is a rise in cases of Covid-19 in spite of vaccination in some areas, it would indicate that the efficacy of one of the vaccines used is lower than anticipated. A rise in some symptoms would mean there are unexpected side effects. Artificial Intelligence could be used for predictive analysis.Initially, when vaccines are scarce, this system will be rolled out in a small scale and only through Authorised Vaccinators from the government. The initial vaccines will be directed strategically at health care and other essential workers, and the vulnerable.The task ahead is fraught with risks from new vaccines, privacy issues, and objections from those reluctant to get vaccinated. There will be important decisions on equity, inclusion, priority, privacy, and choice. Yet, we have no choice but to go ahead.This system may look daunting, but we are fortunate that India has many digital building blocks which can be used. Apart from the JAM trinity, the payment system UPI can be used to create the infrastructure for pre-paid vouchers. This vaccination system is fully aligned with and will accelerate, the National Digital Health Mission announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15. Everyone can choose to opt for a health ID and an Electronic Health Record along with their vaccination details. The digital vaccination certificate, as well as the electronic health record, can be stored in MEITY’s DigiLocker. The training modules for vaccinators can be set up on IGOT, the online learning portal, launched by the department of personnel and training and hosted on the ministry of education’s Diksha platform. If advanced training is required, the ECHO platform being used by the ministry of health can be leveraged. Best practices can be learnt from the way in which the Election Commission conducts general elections. Call centres and other digital infrastructure created by the National Health Authority can be used to identify and inform those who should get government-funded vaccination based on Ayushman Bharat. The Government e-Marketplace (GEM), set up by the ministry of commerce and industry, can list approved vaccines and prices for Authorised Vaccinators to order their supplies. The ministry of finance has experience in large scale DBT. Importantly, building a new delivery system for public health strengthens the ability of the ministry of health and other ministries such as women and child development to deliver other interventions at scale. Many fine bureaucrats who worked on the Aadhaar project are at senior levels in the government or have just retired and will be happy to come forward to contribute their expertise. And any number of ace technologists will volunteer to make this happen as it is truly an emergency.Vaccinating the whole country as soon and as safely as possible to get things back to some normalcy post-pandemic is the need of the hour. This needs to be accomplished by a national mission, not a departmental or ministry project. All arms of the government and public sector, private sector and civil society need to participate as partners. If we can take this approach, we will set a global benchmark on how to get past the pandemic. A combined response, leveraging each other’s strengths, is self-reliance (atmanirbhar) at its best.(This is the final part of a two-part opinion piece on a possible framework for vaccine delivery in India) Nandan Nilekani, chairman and co-founder of Infosys, was the first chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, which set up Aadhaar The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-to-secure-india-against-covid-19/story-0HGNCAvDfFHtG9O8CBmDqL.html
31-08-2020||News||Social media: The new theatre of India’s culture wars||The phenomenal rise of social media (SM) platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and others is proving to be a double-edged sword in the functioning of democracies. On the one hand, it has democratised access to information. On the other hand, it has concentrated power over that information with a handful of private companies, their billionaire owners, and certain ideologically committed activist groups.Billions of netizens around the world now feel empowered to bypass traditional curators of information, such as journalists and editors, in searching for their choice of content. They have also become creators and disseminators of content, not just consumers of it. This is further accentuated by tech platforms directing more content at people similar to what they have already seen, thus creating echo chambers of like-minded groups.This is already known. What is happening now, however, is the next stage of that transformation in how information is generated, disseminated, and consumed, and it is directly impacting how democracies function. There is a global war underway, involving the role of SM and freedom of expression, which is an extension of the culture wars between the Left and Right.India is seeing the early skirmishes of the online version of this war, which has already progressed to a much higher intensity elsewhere, most notably the United States (US). In America’s bitterly polarised polity, the frontline of this war is a battle between Twitter and President Donald Trump. The former’s flagging of a presidential tweet as fake news, and the latter’s executive order altering the liability of SM platforms who edit content, is worth understanding better.One of the most stark aspects of the West’s culture wars has been its erosion of the right to freedom of expression, which had been a hallmark of its modern democracies. Especially since the early 20th century, US Supreme Court rulings by the legendary Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, interpreting its Constitution’s first amendment, had established what many considered a gold standard of free speech.While those struggles for free speech had pushed for more freedom, even to say and write very unpleasant things, the intensification of the West’s culture wars in this century has seen a reversal of that trend. Curbs on hate speech became widely accepted and implemented. But, thereafter, there has been a relentless push by so-called woke activists for ever more curbs on speech, often implemented forcefully and without consensus, based solely on political correctness.A key aspect of this has been the shift from earlier activism against governments clamping down on speech to a focus instead on pushing media, and especially SM, to impose curbs on politically incorrect speech.The irony in this new activism for speech curbs is that it is being championed by those who call themselves liberals. Of course, this does not represent classical liberal philosophy, and is instead a reflection of the far-Left takeover of present-day liberalism. This is visible around the world, whether in the forced withdrawal of a US academic’s paper contradicting the zeitgeist about race relations, or in the unsavoury departures of senior staff at the once venerable New York Times, after they had dared to publish op-eds reflecting Centre-Right views. In India, this bullying has manifested itself in the ganging up by self-avowed “liberal” authors to stop the publication of a book contradicting their narrative on this year’s Delhi riots.Such far-Left canons have now invaded the realm of big tech firms. That should hardly be a surprise, considering Silicon Valley’s preference for recruiting “liberal” and “woke” employees. Books and articles by conservative authors such as Douglas Murray and business journalists such as George Anders have documented explicit hiring policies, practices and statistics to confirm Left-wing dominance among SM employees. It was, therefore, inevitable that employee activism would push these platforms into adopting leftist, illiberal policies.The inconsistencies in those policies show up when SM platforms apply selective standards, such as when Twitter was accused of hypocrisy for not flagging or proscribing the aggressive, warlike tweet of a West Asian leader. President Trump’s executive order directly impacts this. In US law, SM had been protected against the kind of liabilities — such as defamation — that traditional news media are subject to, on the grounds that SM are simply platforms for others’ opinions and did not edit or otherwise shape that information. But now that they are, by flagging, shadow banning, or deleting posts and accounts, the Trump order echoes many voices that had been asking for SM to be treated on par with media outlets.A similar battle is raging about SM giants’ abuse of their massive power by sourcing news from media companies without paying for it, and then disseminating and profiting from it. Despite a bitter legal struggle, Australia is likely to become the first nation to require Google to pay for such content.These battles are relevant to India, which is both the largest democracy as well as one of the largest user bases for SM platforms. Some of these battles have already begun here, such as the recent Indian version of the West’s leftist pressure on Facebook to put curbs on Right-wing posts. It is time to broaden the dialogue here about how India ought to respond.Baijayant ‘Jay’ Panda is vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and a former Member of Parliament.The views expressed personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/social-media-the-new-theatre-of-india-s-culture-wars/story-ybjwIGxW1kNZ3TTJFN5uUM.html
31-08-2020||News||How to vaccinate a billion people||The inventor of the polio vaccine Jonas Salk said: “Our biggest responsibility is to be good ancestors”. India is approaching a big decision; whether we will take one to two years or three to five years to vaccinate 1.3 billion people. History will judge whether we were good ancestors by this decision. The difference could be thousands of lives, millions of livelihoods, hundreds of bankruptcies, unsustainable public finances, and ₹2-3 lakh crore in bad loans. In recent times, the one government initiative that has physically reached a billion people is Aadhaar enrolment. In 2009, some of us were grappling with how to enrol at speed, scale and quality. We realised that the traditional model, where the government procured thousands of enrolment kits would not cut it. We came up with a different model. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) appointed registrars such as state governments, private and public banks, and the post office, to carry out enrolment. In turn, these registrars hired enrolment agencies from a UIDAI-approved list.  The agencies bought UIDAI-approved enrolment kits directly from vendors of biometric devices. The operators of the enrolment kits were certified through another ecosystem. Enrolment operations were quickly set up nationwide. At its peak, there were some 35,000 stations that could enrol up to 1.5 million residents a day. The reimbursement was ₹50 per successful Aadhaar generated. This public-private partnership is how we managed comprehensive coverage — and fast. The result: 600 million residents got their Aadhaar in four years, and a billion in 5.5 years. The response to the pandemic needs to be even faster.India is uniquely placed to offer vaccination for the entire population at speed and scale. The experience of Aadhaar enrolment is helpful, as is the infrastructure provided by Aadhaar. Now that everyone can be authenticated online, either using Aadhaar or using mobile phones, be it by biometrics or OTP, it creates a new paradigm. For example, we can allow anytime-anywhere vaccination, where a person can walk into a vaccination station nearby, have a choice to get authenticated with Aadhaar or phone number and get a shot — all in minutes. India is the vaccine capital of the world. Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, with a capacity to manufacture 1.2 billion vaccine doses a year. It has partnerships with vaccine makers Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and Codagenix. Zydus Cadila has started Phase 2 clinical trials of its vaccine ZYCoV-D. If successful, it says it can manufacture 100 million vaccines a year. Bharat Biotech has begun Phase 2 trials of its indigenous vaccine developed with Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology. It says it will have a capacity of 200 million doses per year. Biological E has tied up with Johnson&Johnson. With the acquisition of Akorn India Pvt Ltd, it expects to have a capacity of one billion doses per year. There are other firms, and other vaccines too.Sure, things remain uncertain. Some vaccines may be unsuccessful; some may require two doses or may need to be repeated after a few months. The capacities may be overstated, and some of that capacity will be exported. Even after that, it is still reasonable to assume that India will have adequate vaccine supplies at some stage. If any of the vaccines fail, the capacity earmarked for the failed vaccine can be used to manufacture a successful vaccine of the same type.Given what we know of India’s capacity for vaccine manufacture, it is important that the system design for vaccination roll-out is based not on vaccine scarcity, but vaccine adequacy. Even if we don’t start that way, India should reach adequacy by the end of 2021. We are not distributing a precious resource, we are trying to deliver fast and far, a vaccine that everyone needs. India has a long and accomplished history of immunisation. But that infrastructure can’t be used because the immunisation that is now required — over one billion, possibly two billion, vaccinations in less than two years — is very different in speed and scale to the current system, which is limited to 25 million infants born each year, and pregnant women. The Covid-19 vaccine will have to be universal. And finally, if we load Covid-19 vaccination on the current vaccination infrastructure, it will be overwhelmed. It is possible that for three to five years, the regular workload of all childhood vaccinations for infants will be disrupted, endangering over 100 million babies. Our success in polio is commendable, but it is vital to remember polio is an oral vaccine that an untrained care worker can administer at the recipient’s home.The current vaccine infrastructure requires the government buying the vaccines and then distributing them. Government procurement works well when we have stable and proven vaccines. However, in the Covid-19 scenario, which is exceptionally dynamic and varied, there will be a large number of vaccines available with varying safety, efficacy, length of immunity, dosage, etc. As soon as the first vaccines becomes available, there will be pressure on the government to purchase large quantities and start distributing immediately. However, in this approach, the government, and ultimately the people of India, take on many risks. If, after a few months, there are unacceptable side effects, or the vaccine does not work as well as expected, or fortuitously a better, cheaper vaccine comes along, then the procured stocks will become worthless. At this time, the issue is likely to be politicised and the usual finger-pointing, CAG audit will start and cripple further efforts.There is a better way.(This is the first part of a two-part opinion piece on a possible framework for vaccine delivery in India.

31-08-2020||City||Greater Noida: Local leader’s house broken into, car damaged||The house of a local political leader was allegedly broken into by unidentified persons in Badalpur early Monday . The family car was damaged by the assailants, police said.Mahendra Singh, the district representative of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), lives with his family in Noida while his 76-year-old mother lives in the Badalpur house with his nephews.“I had been in Badalpur till around 10pm as I had several meetings in the area. My mother is hard of hearing but around 3am, she woke up one of my nephews as she heard a sound. She thought something had fallen,” said Singh.However, the family soon realised there were people who were shouting and knocking on the door of the house.“When my nephew went outside, he saw that the windows of our car had been broken and there was a brick lying nearby. He just about saw someone jump over the boundary of the house. They cannot be sure as to how many people were there or what the intruders looked like,” he alleged.The family has denied any specific enmity with anyone. “The incident could be political in nature. But I cannot think of anyone in particular who could wish to cause me harm. There is a chance that they assumed that I was still at home and wanted to scare me for some reason,” Singh said.Following the incident, Singh filed a complaint at the Badalpur police station and a case was registered against unidentified persons under Section 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code.“A probe in the matter is underway. The family does not suspect anyone. We will nab the culprits soon,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-local-leader-s-house-broken-into-car-damaged/story-V5X4zcYxtKREZFtnuAyBZK.html
31-08-2020||Chandigarh||UT rejects schools’ proposal on fee payment||The Chandigarh administration on Monday told the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) that it had decided to reject the proposal made by private schools involving fee payment. The schools wanted the administration’s order stalling fee hikes during the Covid-19 oubreak and not allowing striking off names of students unable to pay the fees.The schools also wanted the administration to roll back its decision to take action under the Disaster Management Act and other laws against schools violating its instructions. The administration’s senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain told the HC bench of justice GS Sandhawalia that the schools’ proposal of August 7, 2020, was unacceptable and that the administration would stand by its orders.On August 7, the Independent Schools Association (ISA) had proposed that schools be allowed to strike off the names of students not clearing their dues by mid-month. The institutes, however, had also agreed that they would charge the same fee collected in the 2019-20 session. They had also given the assurance that applications filed by parents in distress would be dealt with sympatheticallyJain apprised the court of the decision at the resumed hearing of a plea in which schools challenged the UT’s order disallowing a fee hike in the academic session 2020-2021, among other measures. The UT had on August 7 sought time from HC to take a decision on the schools’ proposal and its rejection would mean the court would have to decide the case on merit after hearing both sides.Arguments on the issue will start on September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-rejects-schools-proposal-on-fee-payment/story-NVHu8b6KtJoLdc40Nt9sBO.html
31-08-2020||City||How DU modified admission process to make it Covid-proof||New Delhi: The Delhi University had shifted the admission process online in 2016. This year, the varsity introduced several other measures in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that the students don’t have to visit at all even for trials and document verification. The students applying under the extra-curricular activities (ECA) quota were asked to upload videos on YouTube, trials for aspirants under sports quota were cancelled and they asked to provide only certificates and the annual open-day counselling sessions were held on the web to conform to the restrictions imposed by the government to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). DU officials said that it was for the first time that all aspects of the admission process were done completely online in a “contactless manner”. This year, the university had also done away with the physical verification of the documents for which students had to visit colleges. This year, the initial verification will be done online and the final verification would be done by the colleges whenever the situation “normalises” and campuses reopen.The university also allowed students to apply for all courses instead of a select few. “The university decided to allow students to apply for all the courses this year since results of many state boards and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), were pending at the time when the registration process had begun,” said Suman Kumar, a member of the admission branch.“It helped students since they did not have to think about the courses they could be eligible for. Besides, the university’s decision to switching completely to an online admission process ensured that no applicant had to travel to Delhi amid the pandemic,” added Kumar.Besides, the University also allowed students with disabilities to apply using disability certificates from any hospital instead of only government hospitals since the majority of government health facilities were treating only Covid-19 patients. Last year, only 27 government hospitals across Delhi were designated to issue disability certificates under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, for 21 conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/how-du-modified-admission-process-to-make-it-covid-proof/story-eTgLXhd8fJL6AukBFvD4RJ.html
31-08-2020||City||DU gets highest-ever applications for undergraduate courses||New Delhi: The registration process for admissions to various undergraduate, postgraduate, M Phil/PhD courses at Delhi University ended on Monday with 353,153 applications -- the highest ever --for around 70,000 undergraduate seats, the incharge of DU’s admission data said.Sanjeev Singh, head of DU’s Computer Centre, said this is the highest-ever applications received by the university. In 2019, 258,388 students had applied while 278, 544 applications were received in 2018. According to data provided by the university, for postgraduate courses, over 146,996 applications were received while for MPhil/PhD courses, 21,699 applications had been submitted till Monday evening. The highest number of applicants are from Delhi (142,526), followed by Uttar Pradesh (66,657), Haryana (50,701), Bihar (21,151), and Rajasthan (14,485). Of the 353,153 applicants, as many as 285,128 are from CBSE affiliated schools. Gender-wise, 181,484 males applied this year compared to 171,681 females. Six candidates are for the ‘Other category’. Under sports category, maximum number of applicants selected football (1,627), athletics (1,621), basketball (1,420), and cricket (1,092). For extra-curricular activities (ECA) category, NCC (3,876) and NSS (1,796) topped the list.Though registrations have now been closed, students will be allowed to upload their documents such as marksheets and certificates on the DU portal in the second or third week of September. As per the university’s admission branch, the cut-offs might be declared by the first week of October. The registration portal was open between June 20 and July 31 for all courses. While registrations for entrance-based courses had closed on July 31, DU had extended the deadline for admissions to merit-based courses till August 31. Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai said a number of factors could have led to a sharp increase in the number of applications this year. “This time the registration portal was open for ten weeks instead of the usual three weeks. Additionally, the process was initiated before several other universities and students must have applied to ensure their academic year,” she said. Bagai also said that lack of clarity over entrance exams such as Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), or Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) could have also prompted students to apply at DU to “keep their options open”. “Due to the uncertainty in the wake of the pandemic, more students must have applied, leading to an increase in the number of applications. Besides, many students who had planned to go outside India might have changed their mind and applied at DU. But these are speculative reasons and a proper analysis needs to be done to explain the increase in the number of applications,” she said. Vivek Shukla, 18, a JEE aspirant said, “I am appearing for JEE but I have also applied at DU to have a second option. There is so much uncertainty around everything this year. If I could not clear JEE, I will take admission in any good honours course.”N Sriya, 18, a NEET aspirant, said there was uncertainty if NEET would be held or not this year. “Though if I don’t clear NEET, I might consider dropping a year. But applying to DU gives me a scope to apply for other courses if I change my mind. Several other friends who are appearing for JEE have done the same.”Manika Sharma, director of The Shri Ram Schools, said some students had been going to other countries for pursuing higher education, but in the wake of the pandemic many have also applied to at DU as a backup. “Since there is a lot of uncertainty, students would want a backup option. Safety protocols will also be important in the coming year and many families would like that children remain closer home [instead of being in a different country] which could explain the surge in applications,” she said. Also, in the wake of postponement of CBSE board exams and the subsequent delay in results, DU extended the admission process for over two months this year. Former academic council member Pankaj Garg said the number of applications could have also increased because of students filing multiple registration forms. “Repeated counselling by the university during the open-day sessions discouraged students from filling up multiple registration forms. This did not happen this year as the counselling events were done over the web and university officials did not focus much on this aspect,” said Garg. “Another reason could be the timing of the admission process. Students from other states could apply more easily since their results were declared while registrations were open,” he said. Manoj Sinha, secretary, DU Principal’s Association, said, “Increase in the number of applications has a direct link to cut-offs and chances of cut-off percentage going up is high.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-gets-highest-ever-applications-for-undergraduate-courses/story-UcTlJLDFwVUlzH584LLYUK.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 in Maharashtra: State inches towards 800K cases||Maharashtra on Monday inched closer to the grim mark of 800,000 Covid-19 cases as it added 11,852 new infections, taking the state’s tally to 792,541. Maharashtra also reported 184 deaths due to Covid-19, taking the state’s toll to 24,583. Maharashtra now has 194,056 active cases with 11,158 people discharged, taking the tally of recovered to 573,559.The recovery rate in the state stood at 72.37%.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 1179 new infections taking the city’s tally to 145,805. the city also saw 32 new Covid-19 related fatalities, taking the city’s toll to 7,658. Of the total Covid-19 cases recorded in the city so far, 20,551 are active cases. The case fatality ratio (CFR) of the city is 5.2%, and the recovery rate stands at 80%. As per Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s data, out of the 32 deaths, one death was of a patient below 60 years of age, seven deaths were between 40 to 60 years and 24 deaths were above 60 years of age.August turned out to be bad in terms of the absolute number of Covid-19 infections and deaths reported. However, state officials said the rate of infection compared to July has been marginally lower in August. In August alone, Maharashtra saw 370,423 Covid-19 cases and 9,589 fatalities. July saw a lower number of cases and deaths reported with 247,357 cases and 7,139 deaths in the month. The cases reported in July constituted 58% of the state’s total cases, while August contributed 46% of the total cases, displaying a gradual slowdown in the rate of infection.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said, “August is showing good signs, though the absolute numbers were high. The [weekly] growth rate is around 2.15%, the doubling rate has improved to 37 days. If we look at the case fatality rate (CFR) of August, it is 2.6%; lower than the state’s overall average at 3.10%. The growth rate in Mumbai and Thane region is under 1%.”Maharashtra carried out over two million tests in the month of August. According to the state health department data, it tested 20,08,831 samples in August. The positivity rate in the month was 18.34%The spread of Covid-19 in rural parts has seen a significant rise as five districts in the state have recorded over 400% rise in coronavirus disease cases in the past month. Data shows that Chandrapur, Beed, Nagpur, Sangli and Osmanabad districts have seen a spike in last one month, suggesting a shift in hotspots from Pune district, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Mumbai to these semi-urban and rural areas of the state.While Pune district and Mumbai have seen 96.23% and 27.58% jump in cases, respectively, Chandrapur has seen a jump of cases by 451% escalation in cases, while Beed has recorded a jump of 535% in cases. Nagpur, during the same period, has seen a jump of 479%, and Sangli has recorded a jump if 465% in cases. Osmanabad, on the other hand, has recorded 508% jump in cases in August. Looking at the spike in cases, Chandrapur district collector has ordered a complete lockdown for a week starting from September 3. Only medical shops and emergency services will be allowed to operate during the week-long lockdown.Awate added, “A large chunk of the people these [five] districts in Marathwada and Vidarbha migrate to other regions of the state. With relaxations provided, these people travel have back to their districts. However, these regions are less populated and areas are not densely populated. Therefore, there is an inherent limitation for transmission of Covid.” He added that the district administration has geared up to tackle the rise in cases. He acknowledged that the region does not have adequate health infrastructure and the presence of the private sector is also less which adds to the burden.The senior state government official added that the situation in Kolhapur district, which has 22,479 Covid cases, is “worrisome”. In the last month, it has recorded a 344% rise in cases. Authorities said that the region is densely populated and therefore the spread has been rapid over since mid-July. “The situation in Kolhapur, which is a major hub in western Maharashtra, is definitely worrisome as it is densely populated. But the administration has taken the necessary steps to contain the situation. With an aggressive containment strategy, we expect a decline in cases in a week or so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-in-maharashtra-state-inches-towards-800k-cases/story-6b9dOAvUcdTgCeQ4BovFoJ.html

31-08-2020||City||Noida: Elevated stretch over DSC road likely to be ready by March 2022||NOIDA The 5.5km elevated road project, which is being built over Dadri-Surajpur-Chhalera (DSC) road to facilitate commuting between Noida and Greater Noida, will be completed in scheduled time, officials of the Noida authority said on Monday.The authority has completed more than 250 piles of the elevated road and started work on pillar cap to finish the Rs 467 crore project by March 2022, which is the actual deadline. In June, the authority had said that the project would be delayed by four months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The construction of the elevated road is progressing as per schedule. So far, 256 piles have been completed and work on casting of pillar cap has been started,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.The proposed elevated road will start from Sector 39/43 crossing and end at Sector 82 T-point. Once developed, the stretch will decongest major traffic in Noida’s Barola, Bhangel, and sectors 49, 45, 47 and 46, among other areas.The authority had on March 3 this year roped in the Uttar Pradesh Bridge Corporation for construction of the stretch that will provide seamless connectivity to thousands of motorists who daily face congestion on the DSC road. The authority had started the piling work on June 30. It now needs to build 143 pillars on which the elevated section will rest.“The work on this project is put on fast-track. We want to build it at the earliest so that commuters do not face issues due to the construction activity for longer,” said an authority official, requesting anonymity.The work could not be started in March this year due to the pandemic. In October last year, the authority had started the tendering process to select an agency for construction of the project.In 2012, the authority had for the first time conceived the idea of constructing an elevated stretch over DSC road. In May 2016, it prepared a detailed project report of the project. But work could not start due to fund crunch. The DSC road, earlier known as the Dadri Link Road, passes from Noida’s Gole Chakkar to Greater Noida’s Dadri town.The proposed elevated road will have exit and entry at Sector 100 so that new group housing societies located in sectors 107, 47 and 104, among others, can benefit from the project, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-elevated-stretch-over-dsc-road-likely-to-be-ready-by-march-2022/story-l9nBFbvb5aGLoSaeSYvrjN.html

31-08-2020||Noida||Discom gives last chance to over 130 high rises to have a say in multi-point connections||The Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) has issued notices to over 130 high-rise societies in Noida for their consent for installing multi-point connections at their premises. Officials, however, said that if these societies do not submit rejections by at least 51% of their residents within 21 days, the discom will not wait for their consent letters to install the multi-point connections and convert them automatically.In the suo-motu order issued on August 5 by the Uttar Pradesh electricity regulatory commission (UPREC), in connection with non-compliance of its earlier order of May 17 this year, it has been categorically said, “in case of conversion of single point connections to multi-point connections, the consumers shall pay only the prepaid meter cost and the connection charges as per the data cost book.“In case of dual source dual register prepaid metering system, where prepaid functionality is achieved through backend-headend system, the consumer shall pay the cost of dual source-dual register meter along with associated infrastructure and connection charges. The rates for dual source dual register meter along with associated infrastructure shall not exceed Rs 15,000 in any case,” the UPERC order says.Mentioning categorically that “no other charges besides prepaid meter cost and connection charges, shall be charged from the consumers,” the order stated that a migration period of 60 days will be allowed to concurrently run single point and multi-point systems to avoid inconvenience to consumers during conversion.“It is pertinent to mention that if the licensee does not get consent of 51% consumers of multi-storey building to retain single point connection, conversion from single point to multi-point system shall be taken up immediately. For the rest of the consumers not opting for multi-point connection, licensees shall take proactive measures to convince all the customers to convert to multi-point connection during the migration period of 60 days,” the order states.As per the submissions given by six different power distribution companies in the state which appeared before the UPREC hearing, there are 3,847 multi-storied buildings in their license areas, of which 1,573 having single point connections. While 576 of them have opted to retain single point connections, 603 others have opted for conversion into multi-point connections.PVVNL managing director Arvind Mallapa Bangari said that in PVVNL’s license area, there are 658 multi-storied buildings, of which 364 have single point connections. “While 278 of them have so far opted to retain single point connections, 24 others have opted for conversion into multi-point connections. Eight high-rises in PVVNL’s license areas have already been converted into multi-point connections,” he said. PVVNL (Noida division) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that presently, housing societies having multi-storeyed buildings/plotted areas develop their internal electrical infrastructure in such a way that a high voltage meter is installed at the incoming supply point to measure the consumption of electricity of the whole society. “To implement the order by the UPERC, we have issued notices to over 130 high-rises in Noida to immediately provide the rejection of at least 51% of their residents for not opting multi-point connection within 21 days. If they fail to give it, it will be deemed opting for conversion into multi-point. Operation and maintenance of the transformer and associated distribution network as well as ‘metering, billing and collection’ of end consumers are done by the societies, which in turn deposit electricity bills with their discoms concerned. But, now in the multipoint connection, each owner/allottee will get direct connection from us and the payment of electricity consumption charges to be deposited directly to PVVNL, and we will send ‘bill-cum- payment recharge statement’ electronically on their registered email ID and mobile number,” he said. On the other hand, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai), has criticised the government’s decision of converting high rises to multi-point power connections. Subodh Goel, secretary, Credai (western UP), said that over 50,000 home-buyers in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts are still waiting to shift into their ready-to-move flats as the projects have not been able to install multipoint meters. “The projects were completed two years ago when the Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board changed the policy of meters from single point to multipoint. These high-rises were already complete and electric lines were laid with single-point meters, but we are not able to install multi-point devices. One side possession and occupancy of flats has not been issued in the absence of electricity. The electricity department, on the other hand, is unable to provide dual registered meter as per the multi-point requirement. The issue was also brought before the UPRERA, but UPERC has yet not addressed this issue,” he said. Goyal further said that the Credai has not yet found a way out since the power department refused to allow them to go ahead with single-point meters. He added that the buildings are already wired in a certain way.“We have no option left other than to procure meters which can censor readings from both PVVNL and power backup separately. Once we will get these meters, the apartments will be eligible for completion certificates,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/discom-gives-last-chance-to-over-130-high-rises-to-have-a-say-in-multi-point-connections/story-lPSaXOfkZn6Px2VnbFq9UK.html
31-08-2020||Noida||Stench from Kondli drain making life difficult, say residents||The Kondli drain, a storm water drain that carries sewage in an unauthorised manner from several small drains, is emanating a stench, residents in the area complained, with fumes rising from it, which is affecting their health and lives. The drain passes through several residential areas of the city including Sector 92, where residents complained that the untreated sewage from the neighbouring high rises falls directly into the drain and pollutes it. Earlier on Sunday, a team of Noida authority’s health department had inspected the drain and ensured remedies, even as residents said they do not foresee the years-old issue getting resolved any time soon.“The authority should get the sewage treated because it’s becoming unbearable to live amid such intense stench and fumes. The entire 500 metres stretch along the drain and all the houses in its vicinity are affected due to this. Almost every household experiences regular failure in their household electronics such as air conditioners and refrigerators due to the fumes of the drain,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president of the Sector 92 residents’ welfare association (RWA).The residents demand that either the drain be treated or the sewage from neighbouring high rises be tapped, and the drain covered. “The authority officials have said that they cannot get the drains covered as it would be against the order of the national green tribunal, but we have given an example of how Shahdara drain had been covered. Why can’t they cover Kondli on the same lines,” Jain added. Residents said the Noida authority should get these fixed soon. “We shifted here from Delhi some seven years ago as this area looked beautiful and green but soon after, we realised its practical issues. The stink is unbearable and our air conditioners, refrigerators, etc., develop faults every month and we have to get the gas refilled. We also have health issues. It’s not just me but every house in this neighbourhood has this complaint. The authority should get its priorities straight and instead of building more golf courses, they should fix such issues,” said Talvinder Ahluvalia, another resident of Sector 92. “There are neighbouring group housing societies which are not treating their sewerage and are letting it directly into this large drain. The drain stinks all day and it is causing issues. We even did plantation along the drain but it didn’t work. The authority must get it covered,” said Yash Bisht, another resident of Sector 92. The 20-kilometre long Kondli drain, which has been there since about 40 years, originates from Kondli village, Delhi and enters Noida (via Ghaziabad) at near Hari Darshan police post in Sector 11. After travelling for about 17km in the Noida in Sector 11, Sector 12, Sector 22, Sector 50, Sector 92 and Sector 168 it submerges into the Yamuna near Chak Mangrola, Sector 168. The drain is also known as Irrigation Drain.The matter of Kondli drain is also pending in the NGT, where the Noida authority had submitted a proposal to construct wetlands along the drain to clean it. However, tapping the undertreated sewage from several high rises continues to pollute it, officials said. “This is one of the major issues of the city that a number of high rises don’t have a functional sewage treatment plant or they don’t run it properly. I inspected the Sector 92 area yesterday (Sunday) and it seemed that untreated sewage from some of the neighbouring high rises is being discharged in the stormwater drain, leading to the stench. A separate team was sent today (Monday) to collect samples from the high rises. We have initiated action to check the STPs of those high rises. Soon the issue would be resolved,” said SC Mishra, Project Engineer (Health), Noida Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/stench-from-kondli-drain-making-life-difficult-say-residents/story-DKkSa5jc2KQwfywzlZn7KJ.html
31-08-2020||City||Delhi-Meerut Expressway gets new deadline: December 2020||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is now treating December 2020 as the extended deadline of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) project after Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted that the DME will be completed by December 2020. The DME comprises four phases of which phase 1 (Akshardham to UP Gate) and phase 3 ( Dasna to Hapur) are operational. Phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) and phase 4 (Dasna to Meerut ) are under construction. The NHAI officials said the previous deadline was May 2020 which is now been extended to December 2020. “Delhi-Meerut Expressway will be completed by December 2020. It will further ease traffic and reduce pollution in Delhi/NCR. The aerial video gives us the glimpse of its ongoing and completed work. #PragatiKaHighway,” Gadkari had tweeted on Sunday. The phase 2 is about 19.2km while phase 4 is about 32km and stretches from Dasna in Ghaziabad to Meerut and is being built as a six-lane access-controlled highway. “Since the minister has announced the deadline of December 2020, it will now be the our official completion time. We are also planning that the six lanes of the expressway from Delhi to Meerut gets complete before December,” said Mudit Garg, project director NHAI. “We will now be holding meetings at our headquarters and also at local level to expedite work as per the revised deadline,” he said. The 14 lanes of the DME comprise six lanes of expressway (towards the centre) while the four outer lanes on each side will be dedicated highway lanes. The expressway lanes run from Akshardham to Meerut over a distance of 60km and is likely to be converted into a cashless stretch with the installation of automatic registration plate readers. These readers help calculate the distance covered by a vehicle, going by its entry and exit points, and automatically deduct from the toll from the e-wallet of the traveller. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 31, 2015, had laid the foundation stone for the DME project. In November 2019, the deadline of DME was revised to May 2020, which has now been extended. However, there are more challenges ahead with the new deadline. The phase 2 is about 84% complete while phase 4 is 74% complete. But officials are now carrying out construction with a 40-50% lesser workforce as most migrant workers left for their villages in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown on March 25. “We have some issues with farmers and about 10% of the compensation promised to them is still pending. Some farmers have not taken the compensation while others have moved the court demanding more money. We have paid the highest possible compensation to farmers for the DME project,” Garg said. According to officials, they have paid bout ₹60 crore per kilometre as compensation to farmers as against ₹40 crore per kilometre given for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. “We are also trying to manage the ongoing work with fewer workers. Overall, for phase 2, we require about 1,500 workers and for phase 2, we require 1,300 workers. Also, we still need clearance for one span of the Chipiyana rail over bridge under phase 2,” he said. The phase 1 of the project caters to about 1.2 lakh passenger car units (PCUs) per day while the phase 2 is estimated to cater to about 60000 PCUs per day. The estimated PCU for the phase 4 is about 48000 per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-meerut-expressway-gets-new-deadline-december-2020/story-f8KkCtIfDsHpHmzrcQXaOJ.html

The caller claimed that her SIM is old and will be discontinued soon. To avoid this, the company is issuing an e-SIM.“To gain her trust, the accused read out her email ID. She also cross-checked the caller ID and it flashed as customer service. She then agreed for the e-SIM activation,” said an officer from Kharghar police station.She later received a message from a three-digit helpline number which said that the verification had started. The caller told her that her number would be off for the next 24 hours. When her number was not activated after 24 hours, she called the customer care helpline from another number to inquire about her connection’s status.The executives informed her she has fallen for online financial fraud and asked her to check her bank balance. When Vyankat tried to log in to her bank account, she realized her password had been changed. She checked her email only to realise ₹1.46 lakh had been siphoned off from her account using her credit card.Vyankat approached the Kharghar police on Saturday and registered a case against an unknown person.Meanwhile, Between March and July this year, 58 cases of online cheating and OTP related frauds were registered in Navi Mumbai.Over 48 cases of online frauds including vishing and phishing attacks were registered between March and July this year in which victims lost ₹60.60 lakh. 10 cases of OTP related frauds were registered where victims lost ₹8.22 lakh, as per the cyber cell’s data.The state’s advisory also urged people to not reveal personal or financial details in an email or open any attachments and links sent by unknown persons. The Maharashtra cyber cell recently issued an advisory that phishing kits are being sold on online hacker forums on the dark web. These easy to use kits are designed for people with little to no technical knowledge of the scams but help them quickly learn how to run the scam.The advisory issued by the special inspector general of police, Maharashtra cyber, states, “Online hacker forums have a huge collection of more than 1,300 phishing kits on sale that cover top-rated websites, banks and financial organisations. The low average price of these phishing kits is to attract more cyber-criminals into buying them to commit different sorts of phishing scams.”“The phishing kits are virtual packages with fake domain page, fake numbers to use for fraudsters. Since everything is virtual, the fraudsters easily set up a virtual WhatsApp and Telegram account using the fake number. These packages also allow spoofing, wherein the fraudster calls the target victim from a fake number, but they would receive the call displaying it as an authentic number, for example, a bank’s helpline number,” said Vicky Shah, cyber expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-duped-of-1-46-lakh-in-cyber-fraud-in-navi-mumbai/story-Vhtje5XX1H5J4ucqHdXwyK.html

Also, August 12 was the wettest day in the past 11 years with 133.5mm. In fact, after 80mm rain in wee hours of August 23, even the floodgates of Sukhna Lake had to be opened as it reached the danger mark.“Monsoon has been more than active this year due to many reasons,” said Chandigarh IMD director Surender Paul. “Formation of low pressure and high pressure areas in the world and even locally have facilitated monsoon here. Differences in sea temperatures have also been favourable for the city. Since Chandigarh falls on the foothills of Himalayas, it has received more rainfall than other cities around it.”To date, 914mm rain has been recorded this monsoon, against the normal of 701mm, which means 30% surplus. This is already more than 697mm rain recorded last year throughout the entire season (from June to September). “As per the long range forecast of the IMD, La Nina current would be favourable and will provide a good amount of rainfall in the earlier half of September. Heavy spells of rain can also be expected till September 10,” said Paul.Meanwhile, only light spells can be expected up to Thursday, after which intensity will pick up, stated the weather bulletin. In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 31 and 33 degrees and minimum between 26 and 27 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-441mm-rain-august-was-wettest-since-2004-in-chandigarh/story-PmVNuBP0i5x2kjyIa5SXgM.html
31-08-2020||City||Amid apprehensions, JEE kicks off from Tuesday||New Delhi: Despite protests, the National Testing Agency (NTA is all set to conduct the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), which will be taken by around 858,000 students in 660 centres across the country between Tuesday and Sunday.Thousands of engineering and medical aspirants have been protesting on social media against the decision to hold entrance exams amid the Covid pandemic. However, the NTA announced on August 25 that it would conduct both the JEE (Main) and NEET as per schedule. The JEE (Main) is for admission to engineering colleges such as NITs, IIITs and other centrally funded technical institutes while the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) is held for entry to medical colleges.A day ahead of the JEE (Main) exams, students said they were anxious about their safety. Avya Sharma, 18, a resident of east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar said his examination centre is 31 km from his home in Rohini. “I have my B Arch (architecture) on Tuesday. My father will pick and drop me to the centre since it’s unsafe to take cabs. I will wear a mask and hand gloves, and carrying a hand sanitiser. I am really scared about my safety. My parents are asking me to maintain social distance. It’s just we cannot miss the exam. It’s a matter of our future,” he said.Naman Maheshwari, 18, another JEE (main) aspirant from Mayur Vihar Phase-1. who exam is scheduled on Saturday, said his parents are worried. “My exam centre is at GT Karnal road and I am yet to decide if I should take a cab or go with my father. I am thinking of isolating myself in my room for some days after the exams since I am really scared about my parents’ safety,” Maheshwari said.Many students said their exam centres are far from their homes. Jigyasa Pandey, 17, a resident of Rohini, said her exam centre in Ghazipur and she doesn’t have any private vehicle. “We cannot afford cabs since we are going through a tough financial time. My parents have asked me to skip the exams since it’s not safe for us to travel in buses and the metros is not still working. I’m just trying to convince my parents to let me go on a bus,” she said.The exam has been a major subject of contention with the opposition parties questioning the move to conduct it amid a pandemic. The Centre says not holding could throw an entire academic year into jeopardy. When contacted, an education ministry official said all preparations had been made to ensure that the JEE (Main) exam and then the NEET exam take place smoothly. Union Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has spoken to several state chief ministers to ensure that candidates are provided assistance, the official said.The NTA has prepared a detailed protocol to ensure social distancing. Masks and sanitisers would be allowed while the entire process would be kept “touchless” as far as possible, another government official said. In addition to making masks, gloves, thermo guns, and sanitisation mandatory, NTA has increased the number of centres to meet social distancing requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-apprehensions-jee-kicks-off-from-tuesday/story-sSUDZfO5vccpPJMaP2WxRM.html

Singh’s condition remained serious through Monday as well.Singh’s cousin, Jaswant, said the victim ran towards the Timarpur police station -- a walking distance from the crime scene -- and shouted to the police for help, forcing the suspects to escape.Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north), said one of the suspects had been nabbed while a search was on for the others.Singh lives with his family in Timarpur and is a cab driver. His cousin, Jaswant, who witnessed the alleged knife attack, said the injured man is the sole earning member of his family that includes his wife, two children, mother and three sisters.A senior police officer said that a few months ago, Singh had taken his friend’s laptop to lend to a local man named Suresh Malhotra. “Malhotra wasn’t returning the laptop and this led to a dispute,” the officer said.Late Friday night, Singh and Malhotra had a quarrel over the issue but people in the neighbourhood intervened to separate them.The two men, however, met again around 1 am on Saturday when a local offered to sort out the matter. “Singh and I arrived in our car and Malhotra arrived by another car with some of his friends,” said Jaswant, adding the crime spot was barely 50 metres from the police station.Jaswant said the mediation turned into a quarrel during which Malhotra opened fire but missed. “Several men began stabbing my cousin while I ran to the police station to seek help,” Jaswant said.The policemen rushed an injured Singh to Sushruta Trauma Centre where he remains critical. A case of attempt to murder and under the Arms Act has been registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-stabbed-multiple-times-outside-police-station-during-dispute-over-not-returning-borrowed-laptop/story-PUCaBWjf5utJFsCTmFEFgL.html

31-08-2020||Chandigarh||Bar on bars lifted in Chandigarh||While lifting the night curfew with immediate effect under the Centre’s Unlock 4 plan, the Chandigarh administration on Monday also allowed serving of liquor in restaurants, clubs and hotels and opening of bars after nearly six months.In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, serving of liquor was banned on March 24. Even night curfew had been imposed, which at present was from 10pm to 5am in the city.The decision was taken in line with the central government order that prohibits lockdowns outside containment zones without its permission as part of Unlock 4 guidelines. It comes at a time when the city has seen a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases. With 191 fresh cases reported on Monday, the total has reached 4,346, which includes 1,857 active cases.Meanwhile, the administration will take a call on the odd-even system imposed in 12 congested markets and weekend closure of the city’s prime tourist spot Sukhna Lake in the Wednesday’s war room meeting. Till then, the previous orders will continue to remain operational.MAJOR RELIEF FOR HOSPITALITY INDUSTRYFor the city’s hospitality industry that is reeling under the six-month lockdown and pandemic blues, the opening of bars will bring a major relief, said industry representatives.Though hotels, clubs and restaurants were opened as part of Unlock 1 on June 8, liquor was not allowed to be served. Similarly, the night curfew restricted the working of restaurants. Consequently, many restaurants have remained closed.Manmohan Kohli, chairman, Hotels and Restaurants Association, Chandigarh, said: “It is a positive step. It is more symbolic in nature than economic, indicating that things are moving toward normalcy.”However, due to the pandemic, the number of main clientele of bars — professionals from outside and tourists — is still very low, he said.Welcoming the decision, Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association, said: “Hospitality industry has been one of the worst-hit sectors due to the lockdown. The decision will help in its revival. However, nearly 60% of the beer season, which is the main liquor consumed in the city, is gone. It will affect the earnings.”The UT excise and taxation department will also start issuing liquor licences to restaurants and hotels for the current financial year from Tuesday. Reacting to hospitality industry’s demand for some relief, UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “We are examining the matter, and subject to the UT’s financial condition, a reasonable decision will be taken.”TO FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMSThe Centre has not issued any specific guidelines for serving of liquor, though industry insiders said the June guidelines on social distancing and other precautions will be followed. “Guidelines like wearing of masks, proper social distancing, using only 50% of seating capacity and sanitisation will be followed. We are awaiting to get more clarity on the issue,” said Ankit Gupta.Meanwhiile, even clubs will be able to serve liquor again. Sandeep Singh Sandhu, president, Chandigarh Golf Club, said: “We are yet to start the club restaurant. As now liquor has been allowed, we plan to open it in the next three to four days. Initially, people might hesitate in eating out, but gradually the pace will pick up and liquor will help us meet the expenses of running the club restaurant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bar-on-bars-lifted-in-chandigarh/story-DIXcA45qVTWtgrc0l7YHlJ.html

31-08-2020||City||Karnal extortion case: Police get 1-day remand of woman who accused school owner of rape||The woman, who was arrested for allegedly extorting money to withdraw the rape complaint she had filed against the owner of a local school and a senior government official, has been sent in one-day police remand. She, along with her husband, was arrested on August 21 from outside the Karnal district court while allegedly taking Rs 7.25 lakh from the school owner’s men. The police had claimed to have recovered the money from her possession. The next day, the police produced her in court and sought her two-day remand for the recovery of Rs 6 lakh, which they claimed the woman had already taken from the school owner.However, the police failed to convince the court at that time as the investigating officer could not establish whether the woman was caught red-handed or not. The court had then sent the couple to judicial custody.As per the police officials privy to the case, the remand was granted to take the woman to her residence in Kurukshetra for the recovery of money. The police said they will also take her voice samples to match them with some telephonic conversations and also question her in connection with other evidence the school owner provided to the police against her.On the appeal of the woman’s advocate, the court has allowed him to accompany her. “We requested the court that the interrogation should be done in a dignified manner and the court allowed an advocate to remain present during the interrogation,” her advocate Rahul Bali said. Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Surender Singh Bhoria said, “She is well within her rights to have an advocate with her, but at a certain distance. He cannot interfere in the investigation though.”However, in a brief interaction with mediapersons at the court, the woman refuted the allegations and claimed that she was implicated. She also accused the police of torturing her, a claim rejected by the latter. SP Bhoria said she is an accused and she could level any allegation. “She was in the judicial custody and the police cannot torture her. Also, soon after her arrest, she was produced in a court after medical examination. She did not make any such allegation in the court,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/karnal-extortion-case-police-get-1-day-remand-of-woman-who-accused-school-owner-of-rape/story-UYjGJjwW5LQdLcALuSFBhJ.html

The leaders of these parties can seek votes from farmers, but won’t take stand for their rights,” he added.He said he would take part in farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture-related ordinances promulgated by the Centre on September 10 at Pipli in Kurukshetra.‘Hooda working like BJP ally’Making a direct attack on Hooda, Kundu said , “The leader of opposition is working like a BJP’s ally and doing politics as per the directions issued by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “We have been raising the issue that the funds meant for the SC students are being misused and embezzled and the report submitted by the additional chief secretary has blown the lid off the same. The SC community comprises around 32% of the state’s population and Dharamsot has embezzled around Rs 64 crore which were meant for the SC community students.

The industry has also filed an application seeking extension in the period of moratorium. One of the petitions has been filed by five knitwear industry associations, the second has been filed by seven associations under the umbrella of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) and the third has been filed by Northern India Textiles and Mills Association. The petitions have been collaborated with similar petitions filed from different parts of the country and were heard on August 26. The SC has directed the union government to file an affidavit on the stand of the government and the next hearing of the case has been scheduled for September 1. As per information, the loans availed by members of the above said associations amounts to around Rs 21,000 crore and around Rs 160 crore is being paid by them as monthly interest. Bajwa Nagar knitwear club president Darshan Dawar said, “Small and micro enterprises have been hit badly due to the lockdown and we have suffered loss of crores due to the ongoing pandemic. The sector has also not been able to revive itself after the unlocking started as the demand has dipped and further there is a shortage of labour. No relief has been provided to the sector in terms of bank interest waiver and many units are on the brink of a shutdown. Due to this, we were forced to move the Supreme court.” FICO president Gurmeet Kular said, “The industry was forced to shut down due to lockdown imposed by the government. Why are we being asked to pay the bank interest for the period when all units were closed? The government should provide a bank interest waiver for at least six months and a moratorium should be announced.” Advocates Ashish Virmani and Himanshu Dhuper said, “Firstly the Supreme Court has slammed the union government for failing to file an affidavit regarding its stand. The government was directed to file an affidavit before the next hearing of the case which is scheduled for September 1. The moratorium period for payment of bank loan installments is ending on August 31.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industrial-bodies-in-ludhiana-move-sc-seeking-loan-interest-waiver/story-itMdykUbyopcaVjhLagReK.html

The councillor said that the project to cover the seasonal drain from Transport Nagar to Dharampura has been hanging fire for a long time, but the municipal corporation (MC) has even failed to repair the boundary wall of the drain despite several complaints. Aggarwal said that the boundary wall has completely collapsed at some points and the civic body is waiting for a mishap to take place. “The boundary wall has collapsed from different points and many accidents have also taken place in the past. The MC’s lackadaisical approach towards the project is putting many lives at risk,” he said. Taking a dig at the tall claims made by area MLA Surinder Dawar and the mayor, Agarwal said that an announcement regarding the commencement of work to cover the nullah was made before the MC elections in 2018. Then the same announcement was made before the MP elections in 2019, but the work has not yet commenced at ground level.Aggarwal said, “Whenever the matter is taken up with the MC officials, they claim that tenders for the project have been floated and work would be commenced after an order would be issued. If the MC is facing trouble in taking up the project then it should at least repair the boundary wall to avoid accidents.”MLA Surinder Dawar said, “The project got delayed due to imposition of the lockdown.

31-08-2020||City||Anganwadi workers oppose pre-primary classes in government schools||Over 100 Anganwadi workers submitted a memorandum to the district programme officer under the department of women and child development at the Shimapuri office demanding that children between 3-6 years should be sent to Anganwadi centres.Anganwadi workers staged an agitation outside the office of district programme officer and said that the government can start pre-primary classes in anganwadis as there is already an existing setup there.The workers gathered outside the Shimlapuri office and discussed the problems faced by them during the Covid-19 pandemic.Under Bachpan Bachao and integrated child development services (ICDS), Anganwadi workers all over the country submitted a memorandum to programme officers of the women and child department and also sent an email to Union minister Smriti Irani requesting her to ask the state government to stop enrolling children between 3 to 6 years in government schools so that they can be sent to Anganwadi centres.The workers allege that in the last two years, the state education department has come up with pre-primary classes in government schools and enrolling children between the age group of 3 to 6 years due to which the student strength at Anganwadi centres has been decreasing.Punjab Anganwadi Mulazam Union general secretary, Subhash Rani, said, “We have written to the Union minister to intervene in the matter. Children below 6 years must be enrolled in Anganwadi centers instead of government schools. For the last many years, Anganwadi workers and helpers have been taking care of their nutrition and daycare and now we want the state government should stop enrolling children in this age group in government schools.”Under the new education policy, the universalisation of early childhood care and education is a great step, but the government should not privatise it. The aim should be at the holistic development of a child’s social, emotional, cognitive and physical needs in order to build a solid and broad foundation for lifelong learning and well-being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anganwadi-workers-oppose-pre-primary-classes-in-government-schools/story-YfhfBErhXDMcrcjZ5Pk60L.html

Moreover, no relief is being provided by the government or administration.”Following Monday night’s orders, general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra, and district president Arvinder Singh Makkar said that the government should also abolish the weekend lockdown and give some relief in night curfew restrictions to bring relief to the traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghumar-mandi-shopkeepers-up-in-arms-against-odd-even-system/story-4FAzSmVByz4RWM1KnpoizN.html

Dropping clear hints, Srivastava said, “Anything is possible in politics. Nitishji has been our leader and we have worked together.”Yadav formed LJD after he was expelled from JD (U) for anti-party activities in August 2017. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Madhepura as a Grand Alliance candidate but lost the elections.During the course of his illness, several JD(U) leaders contacted him and enquired about his health. “If he joins us, it will definitely be a good move,” said JD(U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan. “He is a tall leader. It will strengthen the NDA,” said BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav. The main opposition party in Bihar, the RJD, which leads the Grand Alliance, reacted on expected lines. “JD(U) has become desperate. They are moving from the doors of one leader to another and extending them invites to join their party,” said RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary.JD (U) had removed Yadav as the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha in 2017 after he publicly disapproved of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s decision to rejoin the NDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nitish-s-call-to-sharad-sets-off-talks-of-his-return-to-jd-u/story-zS2J7H9VQ5TaDiXPRuXytO.html

There have been major goof ups being reported from the facility, including critical Covid-19 patients being denied ventilators and inadequate food, resulting in patients seeking discharge. Taking into account the complaints, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued a diktat on Monday stating that critical patients should be admitted to the facility only after they contact the PMC helpline. The order stated, “The civic body requests citizens that they must contact the civic body helpline number, 020-25502110 or 020-25502115, before going to the COEP jumbo facility. The citizens must not directly go to the centre and those who directly go to the centre will not be given admission.” Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We have instructed the facility managers to admit critical patients who have used the helpline or come through the official channel. If private hospitals or other hospitals start sending critical patients to the facility without information, then, it will be difficult to manage here, hence the decision was taken.”Shivajinagar MLA, Siddharth Shirole said, “There have been multiple complaints coming in about the facility. Citizens are sending me messages through social media platforms that there is no working oxygen supply, no food and also not many expert doctors working at the site. I even heard that people are seeking discharge voluntarily as they are not satisfied with the services being provided there. The dedicated Covid-19 health centre (DCHC) which is for critical patients is also on its way to be turned into a Covid care centre for asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms.”A relative of a patient admitted at the centre, said, “On Sunday I was not allowed to enter the centre, when my father asked for food to be brought from home because he did not like the food being provided there. However, when I went back again on Monday, the guard allowed me to go in. When I asked him about the same he said that since the food got over, they were now allowing and asking relatives to get food from home. I am planning to get my father admitted to another private hospital because he is not feeling safe here.” On Monday evening, the COEP jumbo facility was missing from the civic administration’s dashboard. The Shiv Sena in its letter to the municipal commissioner on Monday slammed the civic body for running the facility in such a haphazard way. The letter states, “Yesterday, a patient with an oxygen saturation level of 74% was denied admission because he did not have the Covid-19 test report. Many such complaints have already started coming like unhygienic conditions, inadequate food, crowd management by relatives of the patients.” About the facilityThe 800-bed dedicated Covid-19 DCHC was inaugurated by CM Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy CM, Ajit Pawar on August 23. This was the first Covid-19 jumbo facility, after which two more have been inaugurated - one at PCMC and another at Baner. After much delay due to various reasons including rains, the facility could finally be operational and was handed over to a private agency, Lifeline. The agency runs the facility and provides manpower, including doctors and nurses. The facility has 600 oxygenated beds and 200 ICU beds||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-issues-diktat-for-jumbo-covid-facility-call-helpline-then-get-admission/story-Szly8O69rUQVAAnomxwuIJ.html

We demand revocation of his suspension order with immediate effect,” wrote advocate Praveen Choudhary on Facebook.“Shame on the administration for this is the reward of honesty and hard work. I stand with Jammu tehsildar Ravi Shankar. Revoke this order,” posted Dr Gemini Sharma, another Facebook user.Netizen Dr Surjeet Singh Shan wrote, “Indeed a dedicated, hardworking and honest officer,” posted.“This is sheer nonsense on the part of administration.....The reward of hard work and dedication is humiliation and transfers,” posted Divya Sharma, while another user Rajinder Singh Manhas said, “We condemn this draconian order...I wonder if he was just made a scapegoat...Administration should rethink this.”When contacted, revenue secretary Kotwal cited pendency of 73,000 domicile certificate applications with the civil servant.“Pendency of domicile certificates here was far more than in other tehsils. I am not raising any query on the integrity of the official and he will be given full opportunity to explain his position, but his performance was being watched for the past six to seven months,” said Kotwal.“The Lt governor had taken a strong exception to the massive pendency of applications in Jammu Khas tehsil during a review meeting and sought reasons from the district commissioner. All that the official had to do was to see the documents and issue domicile certificates,” added Kotwal.“If he answers satisfactorily, he will be restored,” said the principal secretary, adding that he was not prejudiced against any officer.It may be stated here that Ravi Shankar had been performing other duties of reportage and rescue during the recent floods, supervising Covid-targeted testing and routine tehsildar work before sitting in office till late hours every night to issue domicile certificates.“On average, he was issuing around 400 to 450 domicile certificates every day and in the past 45 days, he cleared around 14,000 certificates. Jammu Khas is the most populated tehsils of the district and number of applicants here are far more than other tehsils,” said official sources.They added, “The online method to apply for domicile certificates is quite cumbersome and poor net connectivity compounds to the problems of applicants. Take any tehsil, and one would find that only a handful of certificates have been issued online.”A tehsildar, who has a lot of duties to perform, should have been spared from issuing domicile certificates, especially in populated cities, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/netizens-cry-foul-as-admn-suspends-jammu-tehsildar-over-massive-domicile-certificate-pendency/story-FNPXowa0kLUGzOlGvcxbfJ.html

The Chenab is in full spate and nothing has been found so far.” “Nine people were on board, out of which police constable Mehraj Din jumped out of the vehicle,” he added.“He is undergoing treatment at district hospital in Ramban.

31-08-2020||Delhi||Unlock 4.0: Metro journeys to be back, with #socialdistancing||‘Kripya darwazo se hatt kar khade ho. Please stand away from the doors.’ This announcement is one that almost every Delhiite has come to love over the years, while rushing about the city from one place to another in the city’s lifeline. Commonly referred to, by the millennials, as the voice of the Metro aunty / uncle, it has certainly been missed in all these five months when the Delhi Metro was made non-operational to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. Now, however, the wait of denizens seems to finally come to an end. As per the recent guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs under Unlock 4.0, Delhi Metro is expected to resume its services for public from September 7, in a ‘phased manner’. Further details on the functioning and usage of the Metro by the public will be shared soon in detail. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), says, “All necessary guidelines in place to combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus shall be implemented.”Talking about some of the new rules that will have to be followed in Delhi Metro, Dayal adds, “Alternate seating will be allowed and stickers will be pasted on the prohibited seats. For standing passengers, one meter distance must be kept, all passengers will be checked with thermal scanners and their hands will be sanitised. Lifts will accommodate about two-three passengers only. Trains will halt a little longer at stations to allow social distancing while boarding and de-boarding.”No hour is rush hour? So what can one expect in their ‘Unlock metro’ experience? City-based entrepreneur, Akash Gupta says, “I feel, there will be lesser people riding the Metro as many individuals will stick to #WorkFromHome in the new normal. Travel will be lot more need based, and hence this will lead to lesser pushing and shoving. However I just hope this trend continues for long and people use Metro facilities judiciously and with sanity.” Gupta jokes, “What I’ll miss is standing at Rajiv Chowk metro station boarding for Gurugram and just standing in the queue, waiting for the crowd to do the rest in terms of taking you in inside the metro.”  Coming to stations near you on 7th September. #MetroBackOnTrackA post shared by  Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (@officialdmrc) on Aug 30, 2020 at 1:02am PDTRiding the metro without getting pushed around by the crowd? That’s a feat that Delhiites haven’t been able to witness often! “When I used to travel via metro to my college, I used to travel at 8 am rush hour. I remember that usually at Rajiv Chowk there was so much rush in the women’s section that the co-passengers often grabbed each other’s bags and even hair to enter the train. When the metro reopens now, the experience will be entirely different and surreal since metro is synonymous with dhakka mukki! Metro bin dhakka mukki is like chai without pappe,” laughs Jacqueline Joseph, a graduate from Jesus and Mary College, Delhi University.Kripya doori banaye rakhein/ Please maintain distance Will metro have some social distancing audio messages for riding passengers? “I’m hoping that the metro aunty (female voice of announcer) has a lot of fun one liners like ‘Darwazo se hi nahi, kripya ek doosre se bhi doori banaye rakhe #janhitmainjari (Not just from the door, maintain distance from fellow passengers, too. Issued in public interest). It will be so much fun travelling via the metro with lesser passengers, poori foreign wali feel aayegi, like the London tube that I’ve travelled in,” says Jaskaran Singh, a photographer.  Delhi Metro will be resuming its services for public from 7 September 2020 onwards in a caliberated manner. #MetroBackOnTrack #DelhiMetro #Delhi #Metro #LetsMetro #DMRC #SociallyFlippedA post shared by  Socially Flipped Media (@sociallyflipped) on Aug 30, 2020 at 4:52am PDTIs it a metro station or FBI office? Thermal scanning being made mandatory before getting permission to ride the metro has made city residents wonder how will it feel like being at gunpoint. Tanishka Kapoor, an IT professional, says, “I’m happy that stringent measures to protect our health will be made by the DMRC. But I can’t stop thinking how it will feel to be stopped at a (thermal) gun point from entering the metro. I’ve kept my jokes prepared for the guards scanning every passenger. One of my jokes will be saying loud – Yeh metro station hai ya FBI ka office?”   Meme compilation on becoming a star with Delhi Metro. I know, it's been a long time. But Delhi Metro has been shut since late March and I'm still sad that I don't know when I'll ride the metro next. 😭 Anyway, here's an investment tip - real estate located close to an efficient and cheap public transport is always more valuable than real estate that isn't. If you're looking to invest, maybe you should scroll down to my first post and look where Delhi Metro is about to come up. ;) #DelhiMetroA post shared by  Delhi Metro Memes (@ilove_dmrc) on Jul 30, 2020 at 8:06am PDTSanitiser puffs to replace perfume puffs“Wearing a good perfume was common courtesy while riding the crowded metro trains in the pre-Covid era. But now I feel that with a cap on the number of passengers, a sanitiser’s puff will go a longer way! Seems like the rules have changed,” says a gleeful Shweta Gupta, a merchandise designer from Delhi who is happy that travellers will finally give hygiene a priority when commuting via Delhi Metro. “I’m a hygiene freak! I’m so excited to ride the spic and span Delhi metro that won’t be messed up by people,” she adds.  #NewsAlert #DelhiMetro will be resuming it's services for public from 7th Sept onwards in a calibrated manner🚇 as per new MHA guidelines for Unlock 4.

He says, “Since there are reports that metro will be keeping only a few gates open, it’ll be important that social distancing is followed. The community could really benefit from understanding and respecting the concept of personal space, which often does not happen in public transport. I’d miss the funny conversations though. You tend to hear other people talking loudly on the phone. And if you’re really bored, or your signal drops, and OTT isn’t working, it can be amusing to listen to people talk so loudly, and the whole compartment ends up staring at that person.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddha and @NainaArora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-4-0-metro-journeys-to-be-back-with-socialdistancing/story-BZQvvFa4zMmD39JVUlgbTK.html
31-08-2020||City||Jalandhar not meeting covid-19 testing target||Jalandhar Even as the state government has directed districts to ramp up testing for covid-19, the Jalandhar health department has been unable to meet its allocated target of 3,000 tests for a day. The district has 6,623 cases and seen 165 deaths till August 31 evening.Over the past two months, the district’s average has been 800 tests per day. The district has just one testing lab that has a capacity of 100-150 tests a day. This has led to a delay in tracing and shifting positive cases and increases the risk of virus spread.On most days over the last fortnight, the sample collection was about 400. For only five days, the figure went above 1,000 samples. The department collected 433 and 428 samples on Sunday and Saturday, respectively. Only 89 samples were collected on Monday. Jalandhar is lagging behind Ludhiana, the worst-hit district in sample collection, as its per day positive ratio is higher, said a senior health official. At 1.37 lakh samples collected, Ludhiana has 407.4 cases for every 1 lakh population, while Jalandhar at 74,405 samples, has 977 cases per lakh. The data are from Punjab Covid-19 Status Report till August 26. There is a backlog of around 1,000 samples as authorities have to send most samples to Faridkot medical college for testing, which generally takes two days in generating result. “There are 13 micro-containment zones in the district, but all houses have not been examined. There will be a spike in covid cases and it is possible that the district will surpass Ludhiana, if authorities intensify the contact-tracing on a daily basis,” said a senior administration official.Jalandhar civil surgeon Dr Gurinder Kaur Chawla said they were collaborating with the health department and 15 more teams will be assigned to the job.

These cases are being investigated by a special investigation team (SIT) of the HP police.MBU, owned by Manav Bharti Charitable Trust, was established in 2009. Its chairman is Raj Kumar Rana and trustees are his wife Ashoni Kanwar and daughter Aina Rana. Madhav University, Rajasthan, was also established under the aegis of the same trust in 2013.During the investigation, the police had found that Rana acquired huge movable and immovable property in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and other places with the funds generated by the sale of fake degrees. Rana was arrested in June this year.“Apart from the fake degrees, it is necessary to investigate the financial aspects of the crime, for which evaluation of properties and tracking of financial transactions and money trail relating to the crime needs to be undertaken by the income tax department,” said director general of police Sanjay Kundu.Solan-based MBU had come under the scanner after University Grants Commission (UGC) had written to authorities concerned in the state in August 2019 to conduct a thorough inquiry into the allegations of sale of fake degrees by APG University in Shimla and MBU, but the government remained silent for six months. It was after repeated reminders from UGC that the Himachal government initiated a probe against the two private universities.The UGC had informed that MBU had sold over four-five lakh degrees during the past seven years with the help of agents in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, West Bengal and South India, under the nose of HP Private Universities Regulatory Authority.As MBU is under investigation, passed out students from the university, who are employed now, have expressed worry about their future. They have formed a group and are demanding justice from the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-degree-scam-failing-to-make-headway-police-want-i-t-dept-to-handle-case/story-rg1MJCEKESRL60TjuGUliK.html

31-08-2020||Pune||‘We are preparing for worst... but on most parameters situation in Pune under control: state health min Tope||After six months since Pune reported the first Covid-19 case in Maharashtra, the city’s Covid tally on Sunday crossed 1 lakh mark while Pune district has already surpassed Mumbai in the number of total Covid cases. Yogesh Joshi of Hindustan Times spoke to Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on the situation in Pune, Mumbai and rest of Maharashtra. Following are the excerpts: Pune cases have reached the 1 lakh mark. How do you see the situation here? Pune has almost reached its peak as it touched the 1 lakh mark. Now the city’s tally of fresh cases must come down from here on and I am very optimistic about the situation in Pune. Having seen the graph of various cities across the world, I can tell you that every city reaches the peak at some point and then gets plateaued before the tally comes down. This has been a global trend in the Covid situation and Pune will be no exception. While cases are rising, the bed situation in Pune city and the rest of district has somewhat eased. As a government, it is duty bound to be prepared for the worst. Now we have been preparing for the worst in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. As part of our efforts, we have set up jumbo facilities in both cities with each having 800 beds. Both have been made operational now. There is no bed shortage now and we are further ramping up our bed capacity. Besides Pune and PCMC, rural parts are also reporting cases in higher numbers. This is because the virus is spreading in nearby areas and we cannot control it. Covid-19 is a highly contagious disease. Can we stop people from stepping out of home? No. In Maharashtra, we started lockdown earlier than the Centre while extending it till June. Now we are into unlocking mode. Are you satisfied with the case fatality ratio (CFR) of Pune? This is a contagious disease and it will spread. While the spread is not a big concern even as it creates a fearful situation, what we have to pay more attention to is the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR). In Pune, the CFR is below normal and it currently stands at 2.4 per cent. Considering that Pune has reported 1 lakh cases, CFR of 2.4 per cent is not bad. The death rate for Covid has always been around 3 per cent. The doubling rate has also increased and is almost 30 while recovery rate is almost 80 per cent. So on most parameters, the situation in Pune is under control. For administration, whatever guidelines, notifications have been issued; will have to be enforced in letter and spirit. Be it 80 per cent beds being taken by government, the order has to be implemented properly. At the same time, we have prescribed rates– be it for treatment or RT-PCR tests. These things are to be properly monitored by administration. On the availability of drugs also, there is no issue at all as Remdesivire and Tociluzumab are in ample quantity. From government side, we have to see preparedness and we are prepared for the worst even as numbers are increasing. In Pune, the number of people succumbing to the virus is growing along with the number of positive cases. People are dying because of two major reasons - co-morbidities and late detection or lack of knowledge. Many people are reporting late because of stigma. If we analyse the situation in any district of Maharashtra, most people are dying within 48 hours of reporting because they reported late. Many people are not coming out on their own even if the health department is trying best to aggressively carry out contact tracing and identifying affected patients. The three things I believe that are most important are information, education and communication and we should be insisting on this always. On unlocking- we are still to relax curbs on many things including temples, gyms or e-passes for travelling. We have adopted a staggered opening approach. The chief minister, Uddhavji Thackeray is conservative in opening up things. There is a demand, and political parties have staged an agitation. Is there a chance that gymnasiums, temples and other such sites will open in September? We have to do it at some point. We have to take a call on this as many things have already opened. But the chief minister is very much conservative on this. NCP chief Sharad Pawar backs opening up, but the CM has a different stand. Well, we have to achieve the via-median between what Sharad Pawarji is saying and what CM thinks. We can’t open everything 100 per cent, which will allow virus to spread even rapidly and create a burden on the health infrastructure. We will only earn a bad name if people find no beds in hospitals. We have to do it slowly. Without opening also, we are having 14,000-15,000 cases daily in Maharashtra. On Saturday, state reported 16,867 cases in one day. In Mumbai, the daily cases are once again rising. In a big city like Mumbai, having population of around 1.5 crore, if 100-200 add more or less to the tally, it is not a point of worry at all although it is showing a trend that cases are increasing. However, I do not believe that it is an indication of second wave. There are couple of other places which can act as an example. Dharavi in Mumbai and Malegaon in North Maharashtra have shown the way cases can be brought under control. In Malegaon, which has population of 3 lakh who live in congested place – Its population density is 19,000 persons per square kilometre and is highest in Maharashtra – we have been able to control it. I believe we are heading towards herd immunity in these places. Are we reaching herd immunity in other places too? Ultimately, all these places where the tally subsides, we will reach herd immunity. We are approaching 25-30 per cent of the people getting infected. This is in the direction of achieving herd immunity. Once most people are immune to virus, I don’t think there fresh positive cases will come this way. Sero surveys showed 51.50 per cent and 57 per cent individuals in Pune and Mumbai were exposed to Sars-Cov-2 and recovered owing to the antibodies produced. How do you look at the scenario? Even if the sample size of these two Sero surveys were relatively small, they collected samples from various areas. In Pune, the survey covered people from slum and non-slums. It definitely has some significance. It gives an indication. In rural and semi-rural parts of Maharashtra, more and more cases are coming up. The cases are definitely growing in rural parts of Maharashtra. However, I can say with all certainty that the picture is not scary as over 80 per cent people are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. The number of critical or serious patients is around 2 per cent. If we take precaution, each one of us can defeat Covid-19. On the broader side, how optimistic you are about Maharashtra? I am 100 per cent optimistic and at the same time, I and my department are cautious and alert to deal with any eventuality. Now that we are past six months, most of the frontline staff is working relentlessly. There have been complaints about hospitals overcharging or doctors not opening clinics Doctors should have empathy and sympathy while treating patients. Most of 5.5 lakh recovered patients who have returned home are because of doctors’ treatment. However, there are some who require working on mission mode. They should not just treat patients for the sake of treatment. It should come from the heart. We are witnessing that at some places, doctors are not treating patients properly may be because they are scared. There is human touch required while treating patients. I am constantly telling them it all depends on you as we as lay person can’t treat anyone. Doctors should have humanitarian and sympathetic approach. The entire society is dependent on the doctors’ fraternity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/we-are-preparing-for-worst-but-on-most-parameters-situation-in-pune-under-control-state-health-min-tope/story-VFJLLP51uUG7jM1RVc3YgN.html

31-08-2020||Chandigarh||Running toy business in Punjab’s Dhanaula no child’s play after Covid-19||Their business was impacted first when imported toys hit the market, but Covid-19 has been the biggest challenge for Punjab’s toy town Dhanaula in Barnala district. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat on Sunday, laying emphasis on getting vocal for local toys, however, has given them a glimmer of hope.Located on the Bathinda-Chandigarh National Highway around 12 km from Barnala, Dhanaula has for decade been an important market for wooden toys. For starters, toy makers feel, they should get some relief from goods and services tax (GST) and the government promote their products through exhibitions.“Our business was making profits before the pandemic. We used to supply toys to Haryana, Rajasthan and Abohar. However, the coronavirus ruined it. We use rubber tyres for toys but during the lockdown the supply of tyres stopped. The factories concerned increased their prices,” said Gurdeep Singh (37),whose family has been running a toy business for the last 35 years.He also suggested that the government should exempt wholesalers from GST as they could not afford to get a GST number or hire accountants. “The government should also organise exhibitions in cities and install signboards of toy shops on national highways,” he added.Though children liked wooden toys, they could not buy them as markets were closed because of the lockdown, said Gurpreet Singh, a shopkeeper. “When we are allowed to open, however, parents don’t bring the children to the markets.” People heading to Bathinda, Moga or Chandigarh used to stop at these shops earlier. Now they drive past, say locals.“We have not incurred losses in the last 19 years in this business. People including NRIs buy our products, which they say represent Punjab and its agricultural legacy. However, Covid-19 has affected our business,” said Harwinder Singh Sohal, a wholesaler.The pieces are also not very expensive, with a tralla (truck) costing Rs 400, a small size truck Rs 90 and a tractor-trailer Rs140. Dharampal Bhagat, general manager, District Industry Chamber, said the government was focusing on small industries by making clusters of such entrepreneurs.“I have organised a meeting on Wednesday and we discuss formation of clusters of these manufactures. The government will provide machinery and other required assistance to promote wooden toys,” added Bhagat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/running-toy-business-in-punjab-s-dhanaula-no-child-s-play-after-covid-19/story-wAqnXDBNUYDXULaCdD7NTM.html

31-08-2020||City||Apples, kiwis from Iran, Turkey have Himachal’s fruit growers worried||Grappling with labour shortage and transportation challenges in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, fruit growers of Himachal Pradesh have now urged the central government to take steps to check the sale of apples and kiwi fruit from Iran and Turkey that are finding their way into fruit markets across the country. This year has been tough for apple growers. Himachal’s Rs 4,500-crore apple economy sustains the livelihood of 1.65 lakh families. Of the 12 districts, apple is grown in seven with Shimla, Kullu and Kinnaur being top apple-producing districts. The primary concern of fruit growers was the labour shortage with skilled Nepalese labourers unable to return in time due to the sealed borders. The apple orchardists managed with local labour and worked overtime as harvest got off to a slow start in mid-July. Since the crop was lean, the growers got a good price for premium apples being sold for Rs 1,400 to Rs 2,500 per box of 20 kg. But the growers now fear that unregulated and uncontrolled imports from Iran and Turkey could have an impact on the apple prices. “Uncontrolled and unregulated cheap imports of kiwis and apples from these countries is affecting our realisation from the market,” said Lokinder Singh Bisht, the president of the Progressive Growers Association. Bisht has written to Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal to draw his attention towards the issue. “Most of the imports with sanctions are routed through hawala transactions, undervaluing the fruit to ride over the 33% tax barrier of import duty. Besides the quarantine inspections are overlooked and the fruit is being dumped in third grade plastic, becoming an environmental hazard,” he said in the letter. “If this goes on unchecked, it will not only lead to insects being imported with the fruit but will also make the cash crop unviable in our region,” he said. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority data shows that Turkey dumped 7,500 metric tonnes of apples in 2017-18 which grew to 32,289 metric tonnes in 2019-20. While the apple import from Iran was 7,020 MT in 2018-19, it grew to 21,521 MT in 2019-20. Three years ago, the Centre allowed the import of kiwis and since then the volume has grown to 30,000 metric tonnes in 2019-20. “Fruit imports should complement our consumption and not replace our domestic crop. There are more apples from Iran this time. The only way to differentiate the apple from Iran is from its packing,” says Abhinav Jaggi, a Delhi-based apple importer. Apples from Iran change the port of origin in Dubai. There are reports that the apples are also smuggled from Afghanistan and later sold under different trademarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/apples-kiwis-from-iran-turkey-have-himachal-s-fruit-growers-worried/story-ryYpD1P0058AdyAUfQv2tN.html

31-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab hikes health charges in govt hospitals, draws flak from Opposition||Chandigarh: The Punjab government has revised the fee for several medical services in government hospitals in the state with effect from September 1, drawing sharp reaction from the Opposition. Among the services, the charge for an ambulance has been raised from Rs 5 per km to Rs 15 per km, while the fee for an ECG has been increased from Rs 60 to Rs 75. The OPD registration charge has been increased from Rs 5 to Rs 10 and the admission charge for general ward has been hiked from Rs 25 to Rs 40. The operation charges for minor surgery have been revised upward to Rs 250 from Rs 100 earlier and for major surgery, the fee has been increased from Rs 750 to Rs 1,200, as per the order. The fee for private AC room has been increased from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per day and bed charges in general ward has been increased from Rs 30 to Rs 40. However, the state health officials said these charges are meant for the maintenance of hospital buildings and other infrastructure. They clarified that coronavirus patients will continue to get free treatment at all government hospitals in the state. Opposition parties, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party, have slammed the Congress-led dispensation in the state for raising the charges for medical services. The SAD accused the state government of “profiteering” during a time when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak. SAD leader and former minister Daljit Singh Cheema described the move as an “unfortunate development” and said that instead of making health services more affordable and ensuring free treatment to the poor, the government had raised rates of all services. “It seems that the Congress government wants to profiteer from the plight of the people,” Cheema said in a statement here. The rates of services, including stay in private ward which had been doubled from Rs 500 per night to Rs 1,000 to a 15 to 20% increase in X-ray, ultrasound, ECG and operation charges, would make treatment in government hospitals out of the reach of the poor and needy, said Cheema. “This hike in charges should be withdrawn immediately. The government should subsidise these services on humanitarian grounds instead of seeking to profit from them,” said the Akali leader.

31-08-2020||Chandigarh||A fine is a fine but don’t take away right to criticise: Lawyers of Punjab, Haryana on Prashant Bhushan’s sentencing||Chandigarh: The fine of Re 1 on activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan for criminal contempt of court for his tweets against the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde evoked a mixed response from lawyer bodies in Chandigarh on Monday. A three-judge bench of the apex court said if Bhushan fails to deposit the amount by September 15, he will have to undergo simple imprisonment of three months and will be barred from practising for three years. Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association secretary Rohit Sud hoped this would put an end to the saga. The apex court had on August 14 held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt of court and stated that the allegations levelled in the tweets against the court and the CJI are malicious and have the tendency to scandalise the court. “It is harsh. The Bar and bench should try to maintain cordial relations. There should not be a hitch in dialogue between the two. The court should have referred the matter to the Bar Council (of India) so that relations between the two remain cordial,” said association president DPS Randhawa. Based in Chandigarh, the high court Bar has 4,000 registered members, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Mandeep Bedi, the president of the Senior Advocates’ Association of Punjab and Haryana High Court, termed the judgment wrong. “He should not have been fined. A fine, whether of Re 1 or Rs 10,000, is a fine. He should have been let off with a warning because it was just a tweet,” he said. Earlier, not many lawyers had come out in protest against the Supreme Court initiating contempt proceedings against Bhushan. Only one protest was reported outside the high court premises last week. Former chairman and member of Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana Lekh Raj Sharma termed the decision a balanced one. “The rule of law should prevail and I think it has been upheld in this case to save the institution. In the name of fair criticism and freedom of expression, no one should be allowed to scandalise the courts,” he said. The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana has more than 1 lakh members from the two states and Chandigarh. District Bar Association, Chandigarh, president NK Nanda said this verdict can’t be criticised. “Then we will be held guilty for contempt. All we can say is that whatever decision the SC has taken, it must have taken after going through all facts. It is a balanced judgment,” he added. District Bar Association, Mohali, president Manpreet Singh Chahal said the decision curbs the right to speak of an individual. “Imposing a fine of Re 1 or Rs 1 lakh is a punishment. It is clear now that the apex court is under some political pressure in giving the judgment. Every advocate has the right to speak, otherwise these institutions will finish one day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-fine-is-a-fine-but-don-t-take-away-right-to-criticise-lawyers-of-punjab-haryana-on-prashant-bhushan-s-sentencing/story-MoBkjtV63759WEfwLnKbaM.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||DGCA extends suspension of international flight operations till September 30||Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday announced its decision to extend the suspension of international flight operations till September 30. The circular, dated August 31, stated that travel and visa restrictions have been further extended. The circular read, “...scheduled international commercial passenger services to/ from India till 2359hrs of 30th September. This shall not apply to international all- cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA.” The regulator, however, stated that it may allow international scheduled flights on selected routes on case-to case-basis. DGCA had first issued a circular suspending both international and domestic flights on March 26 when the nationwide lockdown was announced in order to curtail the spread of Covid-19. After two months of a complete ban on flights, India resumed its flight operations on May 25. While domestic travel has been allowed, international flights are operational only under Vande Bharat Mission to bring back Indians stranded overseas. As part of easing lockdown restrictions, the government also set up air bubble arrangements with select countries to provide regulated, safe and restricted international travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dgca-extends-suspension-of-international-flight-operations-till-september-30/story-gomxB8Sj8qIavWw4XuRkuO.html
31-08-2020||City||Govt sacks 3 Palghar cops who didn’t stop mob from killing 2 seers, driver||Three policemen who were suspended for not taking adequate steps to save three men lynched by a mob in Maharashtra’s Palghar on April 16 have been sacked, a police spokesperson said on Monday. Sachin Navadkar, Palghar police spokesperson, said the three policemen were assistant police inspector Anandrao Kale, assistant sub inspector Ravi Salunkhe and constable Naresh Dhodi. Salunkhe, 57, and Dhodi, 45, have been compulsorily retired while Kale, 43, has been dismissed with immediate effect, said Navadkar.The killing of the two saffron-robed men and their driver in April this year had sparked off national outrage after video clips showed policemen heading to safety inside the police station and leaving the three men at the mercy of hundreds of people who suspected the three were thieves.Kalpvrush Giri, 70, Sushil Giri, 35, and driver Nilesh Telgade, 30, were dragged out of their vehicle and thrashed by the mob in Gadhchinchale village, about 110 km from Palghar. The seers belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri in Surat.The three sacked policemen are among the five suspended after the Uddhav Thackeray-led government came under sharp attack from the opposition over the conduct of the police personnel. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to advise him to order a probe.The Maharashtra government transferred all personnel posted at Kasa police station soon after and overnight, brought in 47 personnel from other parts of the district. When Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh came a month later on a visit in May, he removed district police chief Gaurav Singh. An IPS officer, Singh was placed on compulsory wait and hasn’t been given a new assignment yet.The investigation into the lynching of the three victims was handed over to Maharashtra’s Criminal Investigation Department. Home Minister Deshmukh had then released a list of 101 people arrested for the violence, setting off a second round of back-and-forth with the opposition after the Congress claimed that those arrested included local BJP functionaries.The CID, which initially looked at the role of 824 people for the violence, had arrested 165 tribals including 11 minors for the three deaths. Of them, 10 men and 9 minors have been released on bail since the CID did not charge them within the stipulated 90 days.Two charge sheets running into 11,000 pages have been filed by the police in early July. On 6 August, the CID filed their third charge-sheet against 47 people arrested for attacking a police team that had gone to investigate the crime on 13 May. This time, the police had opened fire at the protesters to force them to retreat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-palghar-cops-who-watched-mob-kill-3-men-including-70-yr-old-seer-sacked/story-oTlQ2oxJmHqiSuylMPUZcI.html

31-08-2020||Mumbai||As Maha govt is set to roll out more relaxations, August saw almost half of its total cases||The Maharashtra government is all set to roll out more relaxations from the first week of September after the maximum number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and fatalities were reported in August.In August, Maharashtra reported 3,58,571, or 45.93%, Covid-19 cases, and 9,405, or 38.55%, fatalities related to the viral outbreak.The state had reported its first Covid-19 case on March 9.Also Read: Maharashtra reports 16,408 new Covid-19 cases, 296 deathsThe state government is likely to issue a notification on Monday announcing more relaxations under its Mission Begin Again campaign. State government officials said the decision on interdistrict, interstate travel, reopening of gymnasiums, allowing more employees in private and government-run officials would be taken on Monday. “The relaxations will be rolled out in a phased manner in a bid to avoid a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases. Though the Centre has mandated lockdown only in containment zones, the state is unlikely to lift it entirely from the red zones that are spread across its 19 civic body areas, where there are still a high number of active Covid-19 cases,” said a state government official.Maharashtra is inching towards the mark of 800,000 Covid-19 cases. The state has reported 780, 689 Covid-19 cases and 24,399 deaths until Sunday. The highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state was reported over the past four weeks.Newer hotspots in rural and suburban areas were added to the growing list. Cities such as Pune, Solapur, Nagpur, and Malegaon have reported a spike in viral outbreak cases.The state health authorities expect the surge to hold the line until the first two weeks of September.In July and June, the state had reported 247,357 and 107,106 Covid-19 cases, respectively. The two months had accounted for 31.68% and 13.71%, respectively, of the total number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra to date. In July, 7,139 people had died of the viral infection, while the corresponding figure for June was 5,569. These months had contributed to 29.25 and 22.82% of deaths, respectively, due to the contagion. Maharashtra’s case fatality rate (CFR) is still high at 3.13%, as compared to the national figure of 1.81%. However, the state has reported a steady drop in its CFR. In August, the CFR is 2.62% , as compared to 2.89%, 5.20% and 4.40% in July, June and April, respectively.The steady rise in Covid-19 cases in August has pushed the state’s projection of the flattening of the viral curve by a few more weeks. “We didn’t experience the plateauing of the infection curve in August because of a spike in Covid-19 cases. It’s difficult to give a realistic timeline. The state is likely to achieve a peak by mid-September and by Diwali, which is to be observed in the second week of November, the curve is likely to move faster towards the baseline,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, surveillance officer, Maharashtra.The spread of the contagion in the rural areas has penetrated faster over the last few weeks. The percentage of Covid-19 cases in rural areas has increased by 34% -- 7,175 out of 16, 408 --- until Sunday from 21% --1,024 out of 4,878 --- on June 30. “The penetration in the rural areas, where the health infrastructure is comparatively weaker, is a cause for concern, as the containment of its spread is a challenging task,” said an official. The state authorities are planning to tackle the spread by launching Chase the Virus initiative in rural areas from the second week of September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-maha-govt-is-set-to-roll-out-more-relaxations-august-saw-almost-half-of-its-total-cases/story-cWM2WvAkAjMV0vFmV3XrHO.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Two arrested for duping investors in Delhi||Two persons, including a woman (32), have been arrested for allegedly duping investors in the name of lucrative insurance bonus or installation of mobile towers, Delhi Police said.Also read: Man arrested for duping Delhi Speaker on pretext of donating plasmaThe two also impersonated insurance and telecom officials, as many forged documents and identity cards (IDs) of such officials were recovered from them along with four mobile phones, a laptop, fake voter IDs, and permanent account number (PAN) cards issued against forged documents, said Delhi Police’s crime branch officials, who are conducting the probe.The arrested accused were identified as Brij Bhushan Sharma alias Vishal Sharma (34), the kingpin of the racket, and his aide, Neetu Pathak (32).The duo belong to Modi Nagar in Uttar Pradesh (UP). They were caught on Saturday following investigation into a four-year-old cheating case registered at Uttam Nagar police station in west Delhi following a complaint of an Indian Army personnel. The case was transferred to the crime branch in March 2019, said BK Singh, additional commissioner of police (CP) (crime), Delhi Police.The complainant, additional CP Singh said, in his complaint had alleged that in February 2016, he had received a call regarding investments in various insurance schemes for lucrative returns. The Army official was convinced that the schemes were genuine and he was tricked into transferring over Rs 25 lakh in various bank accounts, purportedly belonging to two companies, said Singh.“The culprits vanished after the funds were transferred. Soon, the Army personnel filed a cheating and forgery case,” Singh added. The case was transferred to Delhi Police’s crime branch at the behest of the Delhi high court (HC) after local police authorities failed to make any breakthrough.During the probe, an investigating officer (IO), who did not want to be named, said, the probe team examined details of the mobile numbers and bank accounts that were used in the crime. “The call details did not reveal much. The bank accounts were opened following the submission of fake IDs. While the cheated sum had been withdrawn through cheques and ATMs (automated teller machines),” the IO said. However, the probe team stumbled upon a vital clue: one of the e-mail IDs mentioned in the account opening form was still operational. The details of the e-mail account were obtained from the service provider and the investigators found a mobile number that was still in use, said the additional CP.“We caught Pathak, who was using the mobile phone through which she had been accessing the e-mail ID. Her interrogation led to the arrest of Sharma and the recovery of several incriminating documents,” he added.During the interrogation, Pathak disclosed that she was part of the cheating syndicate and her job was to prepare forged documents such as voter IDs through which she applied for PAN cards. She also operated the fake e-mail IDs created in the name of the two fictitious companies. Sharma’s role was to call the potential investors and lure them into their web, said the additional CP.The police said that Sharma used to work as a tele-caller in a call centre and Pathak worked in another office close to him. In 2013-14, the two along with their other associates -- Dushyant Bhardwaj, Krishan Sharma and Saurabh -- had started a fake call centre from a rented space in Ghaziabad in the national capital region (NCR).“They cheated many people on the pretext of insurance bonus, tower installation and other lucrative offers. The gang was disbanded in 2016 after the police went after them. However, Sharma and Pathak stuck together and kept on cheating people,” said Singh.Now, a hunt is on for the other members of the cheating syndicate, the police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-arrested-for-duping-investors-in-delhi/story-OvevWZ5pudc5pS6DRA5uKM.html

31-08-2020||Mumbai||‘Dirty toilets, insects in food’: Patients on Covid centres in Navi Mumbai||Patients admitted to several Covid care centres in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) have complained about dirty washrooms, bug infected beds and substandard food quality. The patients have also alleged that complaints to the concerned authorities have fallen on deaf ears and there is no improvement in the situation. Civic chief Abhijit Bangar agreed that there are issues in some of the centres and action is being taken to resolve them. The NMMC has set up 12 Covid care centres in Navi Mumbai, including one in Panvel, to quarantine Covid positive patients and also their close contacts. The patients said they have complained against the amenities in these centers. Few have got themselves shifted to private facilities, like hotels, to quarantine themselves. A woman quarantined at ETC School Centre Covid facility in Vashi said, “I was not allowed to be quarantined at home and was admitted here last Saturday. On reaching the facility I found that the toilets were dirty, they were neither flushed nor cleaned. The food that was served was cold. In the night, I was attacked by a locust and there were insects all over. I actually puked seeing the situation.” She added that she complained to those in charge and also a senior NMMC official. “No action was taken and I continued to stay here for a few days, however when things did not seem to resolve, I got myself shifted to a hotel in Mahape.” A man quarantined at the Panvel-based NMMC’s Covid care centre had a similar experience. “There are around 400-500 patients at the facility and I was quarantined on the 9th floor. The washroom was in a pathetic condition and seemed not to have been cleaned since the last person had used it. There was not a single slot of a light bulb in it. The flush tank was not in working condition,” he said. The man added, “I was told that the housekeeping staff comes just once a day and later when they did come the next day, they just mopped the floor. They refused to clean the washroom and I was forced to do it myself.” There was no mosquito repellant, the food served was cold, he complained, adding he even found an insect in it. There were no pillows, only one blanket was provided, he said. “Doctors who came to check my temperature did so in a rush and I was asked to go to the doctors on the ground floor for any medicine or treatment as they do not visit the patients. Finally, I got myself shifted to a private quarantine facility,” he said further.Former corporator Divya Gaikwad claimed that she was approached with several such complaints from many patients. Gaikwad said, “There have been several complaints about these facilities as the those in-charge at the local level are not doing their job well. The patients are going through a trauma and these additional issues make it worse. There is utter lack of hygiene and adequate care.” The civic commissioner claimed that the complaints are being looked into. Bangar added, “I have received complaints about some Covid centre at Panvel and have verified through independent sources as well. Necessary action is being taken in terms of housekeeping, food and medical checkup. We will also check into complaints of ETC and other facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dirty-toilets-insects-in-food-patients-on-covid-centres-in-navi-mumbai/story-5VWjkF2aIZJxqS9G1fxKHK.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Very light rainfall likely in next 2 days, says IMD||The national capital’s weather would remain pleasant on Monday because of very light rain, or drizzle, with gusty winds blowing at a speed of up to 25 kilometres per hour (kmph), said India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials. The winds and overnight light rain also helped clear Delhi’s air. The air quality index (AQI) recorded at 6am on Monday was 42, which fell in the “good” category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data. The average AQI on Sunday was 70 that belonged to the “satisfactory” category. If the average AQI for Monday remains under 50, then it will be the fourth “good” air day in August. August may emerge as the cleanest month in a year since 2015 because of monsoon rains. August 13, 20 and 24 had also recorded “good” air days. HT had reported that since May 2015, when air quality monitoring records are being kept, no month in a year had reported as many “good” air days as this year’s August.IMD officials said gusty winds and light rainfall in parts of the city are likely to keep the mercury down. “The winds were mainly because of a cyclonic circulation in north-west Madhya Pradesh and north-east Rajasthan. The winds are expected to blow on Monday as well. However, the wind speed is likely to slow down between 20 and 25 kmph,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. Delhi is expected to receive very light rainfall, or drizzle over the next two days, he added. However, a good spell of rainfall is expected to hit the national capital around September 3 (Thursday), when the trough will be close to the northern region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-very-light-rainfall-likely-in-next-2-days-says-imd/story-sOqT1QiQxUzCR41aaKKBDJ.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Monsoon’s pilgrimage||On one recent evening, after a heavy downpour, one of the Lodhi Garden lawns filled up with water like a reservoir. To stand by it was like being in that fabled Lake District of England, mostly identified with poet William Wordsworth. By the next day the water had drained off. The lake seemed to be but a mocking dream.But there’s a place in the heart of the city that is a lake all year long. It is an experience to walk around the lake—or Hauz—in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas Village, and something has to be said about going there at this time of the year, when the monsoon is still lingering on, and the clouds play hide and seek with the sun throughout the day. In the evening, this playfulness is made sublime by the many shades of light produced by the marriage of the setting sun with the wide array of irregularly shaped clouds—the borders of those clouds then glow with fire, the gaps between them permeated with smouldering shades of pinks and blues. These intense colours fall on the surface of the lake, making it a kind of impressionist painting that no painter could have rustled out in real life.This evening the lane circling around the lake is teeming with joggers from Green Park and Safdarjung Enclave, along with many monkeys, boldly sitting on the park benches and fences, watching the equally fearless humans go by. There are also ladies with dogs—one woman is met walking with her little dog, Barfi, under the arm.But a mere fleeting glance towards the water transports you far from all this crowd. All you can see is the sprawling lake, lit up with the lights of the dying day, with its glassy surface reflecting the clouds, the setting sun, and the birds flying overhead. Sometimes there is sudden trail of milky froth forming up on the water by a travelling duck—the lake is home to a cluster of these waterfowls. In one corner of the lake, curious walkers throw bread pieces into the water to see the surface suddenly getting dark with scores of tiny fish rushing on to claim their bites.Hauz Khas is situated firmly inside Delhi but its lake looks remote. Maybe because it is surrounded by trees to great distances, with no sign of any tall building pricking the horizon. You feel like you’re standing in one of those pristine watery places in summer-time Canada, whose photographs often pop up in the old issues of the National Geographic magazine.Don’t leave the lake until it gets dark. As the sun is about to quit, station yourself on the side of the lake that is closest to the walls of the Hauz Khas Village. From there, you get a straight view of the dipping sun, with the water aglow. You wish the scene could last forever. But suddenly it’s dark and you are left discontented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-monsoon-s-pilgrimage/story-bO2GkQX3hj84zchDye3moL.html

The then CM was assassinated by terrorists on August 31, 1995, by Dilawar Singh, a Punjab Police constable who acted as a suicide bomber. In a tweet on the eve of 25th death anniversary of his grandfather, Bittu, said, “August 31 will be a decisive day this year. This is the day when Beant Singh Ji sacrificed his life for Punjab and the nation. If Jathedar Sahib, under the direction of SJF (Sikhs for Justice) & Pannu (its convener) holds an ardaas for Dilawar Singh at Akal Takht Sahib, who was a prominent Khalistani and an assassin, it will provide evidential proof that the Jathedar stands for Khalistan & is working to fulfill SFJ’s paid agenda to disturb harmony and peace in Punjab (sic).”NO SARV DHARAM SAMMELAN AT BEANT MEMORIAL DUE TO COVID Khanna MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli, also a grandson of Beant Singh, said the ‘sarv dharam sammelan’ (a congregation of all religions) to mark the death anniversary of the former chief minister will not be held at his Chandigarh memorial due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

31-08-2020||City||Pall of gloom at fallen soldier’s native village at Khadoor Sahib||A pall of gloom descended on the native village of Naib Subedar Rajwinder Singh of Sikh Light Infantry regiment, who was killed in a ceasefire violation by the Pakistan Army on the Line of Control (LoC), soon after the news about his death reached on Sunday afternoon. Rajwinder (40), who hailed from Goindwal Sahib in Khadoor Sahib sub-division and died in the Nowshehra sector of Jammu & Kashmir’s Rajauri district on Sunday morning, wanted to make his son an army officer. He was the sole breadwinner of the family. Rajwinder is survived by his mother Balwinder Kaur (70), wife Manpreet Kaur (38), daughters Pawanpdeep Kaur (14) and Akshjot Kaur (10), and son Jobanjit Singh (16). His father Jagir Singh, who died around 2 years ago, was a retired army jawan. His younger brother Sukhwinder Singh, who was also serving in the Indian army, died in a road accident in 2009. Balwinder Kaur said, “Rajwinder had come on leave in January. He talked to his wife on phone for last time on Saturday evening. He was enthusiastic since his childhood to join Indian Army. My husband and younger son also served in the army.

31-08-2020||City||3 Canadian cities dedicate Sept 6 to slain rights activist Jaswant Khalra||The councils of three key Canadian cities — Burnaby, New Westminster and Brampton — have proclaimed September 6 as ‘Jaswant Singh Khalra Day’ to mark the 25th death anniversary of the slain Amritsar-based human rights activist. The proclamations signed by the respective mayors pay tribute to the rights campaigner who originally belonged to Tarn Taran district’s Khalra village. “Jaswant Singh Khalra was a strong advocate of democratic and civil rights and a highly respected leader of the Sikh community. He died fighting for human rights and dignity of the Sikhs and others. September 6 is a historically important day recognised by the Sikhs and South Asians all across Canada each year in commemoration of his death in 1995,” reads the proclamation. It further reads, “The city honours the Sikh history and culture, Jaswant Singh Khalra’s place in South Asian history, and our valued relationship with the Sikh community and its strong commitment to social justice,” it further reads. Hailing the move of the Canadian cities, his wife Parmjit Kaur Khalra, who contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Khadoor Sahib segment unsuccessfully, said, “It is matter of great pride for me that other countries are recognising the contribution of my husband to human rights. More Canadian cities are likely to make such proclamations.”“But in our country, we had to wait for several years to get justice for him. And the work done by him has not been recognised so far in India,” she added. The Punjab-origin representatives in these municipalities and other councillors reportedly pushed these proclamations, it is learnt. These cities have a considerable population of Punjabis who play a key role in the electoral politics there.In 2017, the city council of Fresno in California, US, named one of its important parks after Khalra. This park was earlier known as Victoria Park.Khalra was investigating the extrajudicial killings in Punjab during the militancy period and raised his voice against the same at international level. Some police personnel kidnapped him on September 6, 1995. Earlier that year, he had visited Canada to educate the Punjabi diaspora and Canadian politicians about the human rights situation in Punjab. As per the verdict of a Patiala court, he was abducted and murdered by the police in cold blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-canadian-cities-dedicate-sept-6-to-slain-rights-activist-jaswant-khalra/story-8IXCzP2zmWcC4GkNZp60BO.html

The police said that the incident came to light after the minor’s father, who is an advocate, filed the complaint against the accused on Saturday. According to the complainant, the boy was sexually assaulted for the first time in February. When the accused committed the crime again this month, the child told his father about it, following which the latter decided to file a case. A first information report (FIR) registered under section 377 (unnatural offences) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) and 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act has been registered against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/66-year-old-booked-for-sodomising-4-year-old-grandchild-in-mumbai/story-K9Wq5H7Bojiyf1RMJSj8UI.html

The fire brigade recovered their bodies by Sunday afternoon.The two deceased, Shahbaj Ansari, 24 and Shahaalam Ansari, 22, were residents of Mittal Nagar in Bhiwandi. Shahbaj worked at his uncle’s shop while Shahaalam was unemployed. On Sunday, they decided to go fishing at the river with their mother.“While they were on the banks of the river a5.30pm, Shahaalam fell into the water and started drowning, as he did not know to swim. Shahbaj jumped into the river to save him, but due to the strong water currents, he too started struggling. Their mother ran towards the road asking villagers for help, however, by the time locals reached the spot, the two had drowned,” said an officer from Bhiwandi taluka police station. Fire brigade officers reached the spot, and around 11pm, they found the body of Shahaalam with the help of local fishermen. The operation resumed on Sunday morning for the second body. “The water currents were strong in the river while the continuous downpour was making it difficult to search for the second body. With such strong currents, we suspected that the body might have flown towards Thane creek. Some fishermen went towards the creek in their boats and found the body of Shahbaj stuck on a tree 20km away from the spot where the two had drowned,” said the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-brothers-drown-in-kamvari-river-near-mumbai/story-ksfsWq3274dMcdVa4NG6WO.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||Digitalisation of lower courts in Mumbai a distant dream; lockdown adds to existing woes||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-enforced lockdown, in place for over five months now, has brought to the fore the digitalisation, or lack of it, woes of an overburdened and slow judicial system, exemplified by the close to 570,000 cases pending before Mumbai’s magistrate and sessions courts. There are 73 magistrate courts spread across 14 centres in the city and 80 sessions courts, the functioning of which have been thrown into a tizzy by the lockdown owing to little or no infrastructure. According to the national judicial data grid, there are 459,671 pending cases before the city’s magistrate courts (which conduct trials for cases where the punishment is less than 10 years) and 108,978 such cases before the sessions courts. The state of affairs is despite the numerous efforts made by the Bombay high court (HC) and the Bar Council of Maharashtra (BCM), including moving towards e-filing of applications. However, the project could not succeed for various reasons, one of them being the want of proper infrastructure. In its advisory issued on March 14, before the national lockdown was announced, the HC insisted that the court can record evidence of witnesses through video-conferencing and emphasised on the use of the digital platform. However, hearing through video-conferencing could hardly work in practice for trials. “Of the 80 sessions courts in the city, hardly 10 are functional at a time, that too in restricted hours. And these courts are again required to take up cases of remand under special acts, anticipatory and regular bail applications. Trials in such circumstances become tough to conduct,” said a senior lawyer, requesting anonymity. The few courts, which have video-conferencing facilities, face different challenges. “How can I confront the witness with a document? How can I get a signature identified? What if the witness doesn’t have a proper phone or a facility to come on video-conferencing? How will the witness produce original records before the court? These are practical difficulties,” said a prosecutor, on the condition of anonymity. In one such case where a special court under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was recording a deposition of a school principal to establish the age of a survivor, who was sexually assaulted by her cousins, the principal could not produce the original record as the school was not open, which affected the prosecution’s case, said the prosecutor. While there was inconsistency in the statement of the survivor, the accused were acquitted by the court last month. “Our law requires the prosecution to follow several mandatory procedures, which lawyers claimed are not practically possible for conducting trials through video conferencing. Due to practical difficulties, the trials in all pending cases are stopped till the court resumes physical hearing of cases. The courts are presently hearing only urgent applications,” said the prosecutor. Further, to limit the footfall in the courts and to facilitate lawyers, the courts began to encourage lawyers to submit their application through the web portal of e-courts. In order to file a copy through web portal, the lawyer first has to register himself and fill a form on the portal. Later, he needs to upload the scanned copy of the application on the portal. After uploading the documents, the system would notify him about the next hearing date in 48 hours. Sources in the HC, who are looking after the functioning of the web portal, claimed that the department has held several seminars and webinars to guide lawyers and encourage them for maximum use of e-portal during the lockdown. But lawyers, however, cite several difficulties. “I tried to file a bail application through the e-portal. It didn’t work. The portal requires me to first register and fill up all my details. Even after several efforts I could not even register on the portal. I sought help from the expert in the IT department of the court, but they, too, could not help,” said Pradeep Shetty, a a lawyer practicing criminal law in magistrate courts at Andheri, Bandra, Borivli. Lawyers are in a state of confusion over the system. Dilip Gondecha, president of Bar Association of Esplanade court, said, “The option of e-filing or hearing through digital platform is not possible in lower court as there is no infrastructure. Even after filing applications on web portal, a lawyer is required to submit physical copies in the court. In such a situation, what is the use of submitting copies through a web portal.” Jaiprakash Bagoria, president of Bar Association of Bandra centre, said, “Not all lawyers have proper offices or facilities to file applications through an e-portal. There were several seminars and webinars arranged by the bar council and high court to guide lawyers about the use of e-portals. But it cannot work for the lower court in such a short span. There is a need to set up a centre or a booth to help lawyers resolve their issues, while trying to submit documents on web portals.” The lawyers have raised several grievances about the present operating system of the court. “We lack infrastructure to implement something like this on a larger level,” Bagoria said. “A change cannot come over night. This will happen in future, but it will take at least five to ten years. No one as far as I know could use e-portals from our centre. There are several technical glitches, while operating through web portals and it will take time to develop,” said Brijesh Avichal, president, Bar Association of Girgon centre. Avichal said that for proper functioning of courts, physical hearing has to resume. “We don’t have a system for every procedure and court work to be done through digital platforms,” Avichal added. Even as the lawyers face such practical difficulties, the BCM is now making efforts to take the concept of digitalisation ahead. “The present situation has opened our eyes. We are now preparing for the future. We are looking forward in setting up centres in bar rooms across the state to facilitate e-filing. But this could happen only once things become normal. We are also looking forward to collaborate with companies to provide laptops to lawyers at concession rate so that we can focus more on digitalisation in coming future,” said Subhash Gatge, president, Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa. Both the registrar-general of the HC and principal secretary (law and judiciary) were unavailable for comment.

31-08-2020||Mumbai||First merit list for admissions to Mumbai’s junior colleges out, rise in cut-offs across streams seen||With an increase in the overall pass percentage and a substantial rise in the number of top scorers from the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations this year, the cut-offs for admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in the first merit list – declared on Sunday evening – have skyrocketed across streams. The highest jump is in the cut-offs for science stream, with prominent colleges witnessing a rise of 6-8 percentage points compared to 2019. Of the total applicants in MMR this year, 19,437 FYJC aspirants have scored 90% and above – an increase of about 20% from 2019. The number of aspirants who have scored 95% and above is 3,802, which is a jump of about 28% from last year. Principals said that as there are more number of high scorers from SSC board this year, students from the board stand at an advantage over those from the other boards.“This trend was expected as students, especially those from the state board, have scored so well in the board exams this year and this is indicated by the high cut-offs across streams,” said Vidyadhar Joshi, vice principal, VG Vaze College, Mulund. Churchgate’s Jai Hind College saw a jump of 6 percentage points in science cut-offs, from last year. Principal Ashok Wadia said that although the cut-off percentage for the stream has risen from 2019, it is still lower compared to this year’s commerce and arts cut-offs. “Students and parents have realised that technology has a huge role to play amid the Covid-19 situation and there are a lot of opportunities opening up in the science and technology sector. This might have encouraged high scorers to take up science,” he added.In the arts stream, St Xavier’s College at Dhobi Talao saw a rise in the cut-offs by 0.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The college closed its first list at 94.6%, while Matunga’s Ramnarain Ruia College recorded a jump of about 2% points from 2019, closing the first merit list for arts at 94.2%. A similar surge in the cut-offs was also seen at Jai Hind College, which closed its list for arts at 92.6%. In the commerce stream, all prominent institutes such as Vile Parle’s NM College, Matunga’s RA Podar, Mulund College of Commerce, Churchgate’s HR College and Vaze Kelkar in Mulund closed their first lists above 90%. Around 2.12 lakh students had applied to colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) this year, of which 1.17 lakh students have been allotted colleges in the first merit list. More than 40,000 students have been allotted the college of their first preference and will have to take admission in that institute. If they fail to do so, they will be able to apply only after regular admission rounds are over. As the entire admission process has been ‘zero contact’ owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, students can confirm their admissions online by September 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-merit-list-for-admissions-to-mumbai-s-junior-colleges-rise-in-cut-offs-across-streams/story-6pCJi0NUzjSnJa5vKkdH3K.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Congress, BJP continue to trade barbs over filmmaker Sandeep Ssingh||The Maharashtra unit of Congress on Sunday continued its attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), questioning its links with film producer Sandeep Ssingh, even as the latter party refuted all allegations as “fake” and a bid to divert the narrative in the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Ssingh’s name has surfaced in the Rajput death investigation.When HT called Ssingh for a comment, his phone was switched off, and he had not responded to messages till the time of going to press.State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant raised the issue of a ₹177-crore memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between Ssingh, producer of the biopic on PM Narendra Modi, and the Gujarat government for the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in 2019. In a series of tweets, Sawant had also alleged on Saturday that Ssingh had called the office of BJP’s Maharashtra unit 53 times between September 1 and December 23 last year.“Every day there are revelations linking the BJP with the Sushant Singh Rajput case, specifically the party’s connection with Ssingh, who had made a biopic on PM Modi. Days after the making of this biopic, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani had signed a ₹177-crore MoU with Ssingh in 2019. Ssingh’s company was the only one called for the MOU. As per financial statements filed by Ssingh’s company, it had made a loss worth ₹4 lakh in 2019,” said Sawant on Sunday, tweeting that “BJP’s blue eyed boy” Ssingh’s company’s financials reflect a “sorry story”.He questioned how a loss making company was going to raise ₹177 crore and whether this MOU was a quid pro quo in return for making of the biopic. “The truth behind this must come out, BJP must clarify. Further, days after Rajput’s death, Ssingh met a state BJP leader. The party must clarify who was the leader who met Ssingh and what was discussed at this meeting,” said Sawant, who had earlier written to state home minister Anil Deshmukh asking for Ssingh’s drug links to be probed. Deshmukh on Saturday had said the government will ask the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct the probe.In Delhi, Congress national spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi, too, raised the issue of the 53 calls made by Ssingh to the BJP’s Maharashtra unit office. “So, the question we ask is, who is the special person, the special protector, the special link, the special surkhsha chakra, as I said in Hindi, the special ‘Aaka’ who is taking responsibility for this person?” said Singhvi. The BJP has refuted the allegations as “fake”. BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar slammed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “Why is he [Sawant] making the allegations now. For more than two months the probe was with Mumbai Police. This is just a diversionary tactic. We have no issues if they want to probe anyone even now,” said Bhatkhalkar.In a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, Bhatkhalkar claimed that someone from within the state home department and one minister had exerted pressure to hide the political-Bollywood-drug nexus in the Rajput case. “Who in the state home department was acting to hide this nexus in the Rajput case and which minister exerted pressure on Mumbai Police to not call some actors for interrogation or demanded that they be asked only certain things? We have this information. I have written to the Union home minister Amit Shah to probe this,” said Bhatkhalkar. Bhatkhalkar, however, did not name either the minister or the actors who the alleged person tried to shield. He also alleged that Deshmukh’s tweets and initial declaration within three hours of his death that the case was one of suicide “coloured the Mumbai police investigation”.(With inputs from New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-congress-bjp-continue-to-trade-barbs-over-filmmaker-sandeep-ssingh/story-lP1mQJ5tgv1CF0itPLPLAM.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Sewri mudflats see fewer birds; can’t blame trans-harbour link work yet, say experts||The number of birds at the city’s Sewri mudflats witnessed a significant decline between October 2019 and February 2020, compared to the corresponding period last year, according to a report by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The area is witnessing construction of the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) – a 21.8-km bridge connecting Sewri in Mumbai to Nhava-Sheva in Uran – since April 2018. While researchers said it may have kept birds away from the site, the report does not conclude so, stating “the impact of the construction on birds, whether temporary or permanent, can be inferred only after five years of post-construction monitoring.” The report, ‘Monitoring and Mitigating impacts of the MTHL on flamingos and other avifauna’, was submitted to the Mangrove Foundation of Maharashtra last week. BNHS said the fluctuations were attributed to several factors that influence migration such as breeding success, weather, and habitat degradation along the flyway as well as alternate foraging and roosting habitats. The research began under its 10-year bird monitoring programme across select wetlands in October 2018. Deepak Apte, principal investigator of the project and director, BNHS, said, “The present report is purely an annual update and does not reflect conclusive findings yet.” Flamingo numbers at the 500-hectare Sewri mudflat were 13,813 in January 2019 and 60,733 in March 2019, which fell to 4,395 in January 2020 and 4,106 in March 2020. This year’s data included only 287 greater flamingos during March and none in January. It was 1,497 in March 2019. Similarly, for all other water birds at Sewri, the number dropped from a maximum of 17,331 birds during November 2018 and 15,365 in February 2019 to 1,053 in November 2019 and 8,305 during February 2020. Nhava-Sheva, on the other end of the eastern seafront, saw a maximum of 4,500 water birds and 1,500 flamingos during February and March this year. Data from last year was available only from May 2019 onwards when 986 birds were recorded. “By contrast to other wetlands in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), results showed that Sewri and Nhava-Sheva supported lower species richness and abundance of migratory and resident birds throughout the survey period,” read the report. With movement of people and machinery, there will be disturbance due to noise till construction takes place, said Apte, adding, “These annual updates are helping us develop a conservation and systematic blueprint for the seascape.” BNHS also published results of bird behavioural studies for 10 species across roosting, feeding and construction sites in MMR from October 2019 to March 2020. A decline in wader (migratory shorebirds like little stint, Black-tailed Godwit, curlew sandpiper, and common greenshank) numbers was observed at Sewri and Nhava-Sheva mudflats, while there were minimal or no observations of Pied avocet and Whimbrels. Birds most observed were lesser flamingos, common redshanks and lesser sand plovers. “During the early migratory season, birds prefer the northern part of the Thane Creek, and later move south towards Vashi and Sewri, which is why birds were seen during February and March in Sewri last season,” said Rahul Khot, assistant director, BNHS. According to mangrove cell researchers, post-monsoon rain and impact of Arabian Sea tropical cyclones during October-November 2019 disturbed the natural migratory pattern to MMR wetlands. “The numbers drastically increased from last week of March till the rains began. For Sewri, some adverse effects of construction cannot be ruled out, but reduction in numbers cannot just be associated with that,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) joint metropolitan commissioner BG Pawar said, “Efforts were taken to ensure bird population was not disturbed right from day one of the project. We have been extra cautious. We have not seen the report, but will consult our engineers about it.” MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sewri-mudflats-see-fewer-birds-can-t-blame-trans-harbour-link-work-yet-say-experts/story-2l3Crjwt2VEFLydwuNxeTP.html

31-08-2020||City||Road cave-in, wall collapse disrupts life in Kalyan, Ulhasnagar||Several incidents of collapsed and road cave-in were reported from Kalyan and Ulhasnagar areas after a heavy downpour on Sunday. A portion of the Shiv Mandir road, Kurla Camp in Ulhasnagar caved in on Sunday. Due to this, one side of the road has been barricaded and is closed for traffic. An incident of slab collapse of a vacant building and a wall collapse of a bus depot in Kalyan were reported, however, no one was injured in any of these incidents. Mahesh Sitlani, City engineer of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), said, “We have barricaded the area. We will soon take up the repair work in three-four days after we appoint a contractor. The continuous downpour might have led to the cave in of the road.”Another incident of slab collapse in Ulhasnagar’s Lal Chakki locality was also reported on Sunday. This is the second time when a slab of this building has collapsed. No one was injured in the incident, as the residents had vacated the building last year. Ganesh Shimpi, assistant commissioner, UMC, “The slab of this building fell last year, after which it was vacated. We have not taken any decision yet as there is a stay order on demolition work. The Bombay high court had asked not to vacate and demolish buildings during the pandemic. In June, we initiated the demolition of extremely dangerous buildings, however, residents approached the court and got a stay order on all 30 extremely dangerous buildings.” In Kalyan, the continuous downpour led to the collapse of portions of the wall of the Ganesh Ghat, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Transport (KDMT) depot on Sunday. The wall that is located on the banks of the Waldhuni river fell off on the road that leads to the depot. No injuries were reported in the incident. “The city has been receiving rainfall since last three days. Earlier also the wall had collapsed followed by which the portion was repaired,” said a worker at the depot. As per the tehsil wise rainfall recording and analysis data, Kalyan recorded 33.7mm of rainfall, and Ulhasnagar received 63.0mm rainfall on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/road-cave-in-wall-collapse-disrupts-life-in-kalyan-ulhasnagar/story-8CireCBC9QQsHyMfajZtbI.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||TB testing machines record 20% Covid-19 positivity rate in Maharashtra||TrueNat, a portable medical device that was originally designed to detect tuberculosis (TB), was recently used to test 26,000 people across Maharashtra for Covid-19. Of this number, almost 20% tested positive for the novel coronavirus. This has prompted the state health department to run TrueNat tests for Covid-19 on individuals in need of emergency surgeries since it gives results within 20 minutes. TrueNat is a chip-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kit that was used as a screening mechanism for potential TB patients. As per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the diagnostic tool involves two steps — E gene screening assay for suspected Covid-19 samples, and a follow-up confirmatory assay of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme found in the virus’ RNA (ribonucleic acid). RNA is essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. Since May, 26,215 people in the state have undergone TrueNat tests, of which lab technicians found 7,693 samples had the presence of the E gene. This accounts for 29% positivity rate in the first stage of TrueNat tests. Though actual data is not shared, as per an official from the state health department, more than 90% of samples were found Covid-19 positive in TrueNat RDPR. After completing both steps, the cumulative positivity rate of TrueNat in identifying the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, stands at 20%. “As per ICMR guidelines released in May, if the E-gene screening is negative, the sample will be considered a true negative. But if the sample is positive, the RdRp assay will be done as a confirmatory test. If the sample tests positive, it will be considered a true positive, and no further test will be required,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. “So far, we are conducting a limited number of TrueNat tests in comparison to RT-PCR and antigen tests. But we have plans to extend the TrueNat tests,” he said. TrueNat is an indigenously developed, portable version of cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CB-NAAT), also known as the GeneXpert test. Medical experts said the advantage of the test is that it is quick and portable – allowing teams to set up mobile testing centres or kiosks in containment zones instead of having to transport samples to laboratories. Since the swab samples are collected in a viral lysis buffer (solution), biosafety and biosecurity requirements to use TrueNat machines are minimal. TrueNat machines were previously used to detect the Nipah virus during the 2018 outbreak in Kerala. “Both the tests [CB-NAAT and TrueNat] are cheaper than the traditional RT-PCR tests. Unlike CB-NAAT, TrueNat runs on a battery and doesn’t need an uninterrupted power supply and air conditioning. So, it can be carried to containment zones and slums for testing,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). With the goal of speedy detection of Covid-19 cases, the state government is planning to conduct TrueNat tests in medical emergencies like accidents or pregnancies. “We have instructed hospitals with the machines to run diagnosis in emergency cases along with the general screening of suspected Covid-19 patients,” said a senior official from the health department. As per sources, hospitals have also been instructed to conduct TrueNat tests on dead bodies in case doctors suspect Covid-19 infection. In the absence of a vaccine or drugs to treat Covid-19, faster diagnosis and early medical intervention are essential. “Under the present testing procedure, diagnosis takes almost eight hours. This test [TrueNat] can provide faster results [20 minutes], saving more time and lives. However, we need more studies to understand its accuracy in the diagnosis of Covid-19,” said Dr Ramraje Nagsen, pulmonologist at JJ Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tb-testing-machines-record-20-covid-19-positivity-rate-in-maharashtra/story-d9B29zKLxccUMmjBlpN4NN.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams: Maharashtra government may publish decision on schedule today||The state government is expected to publish its decision regarding the schedule and method of conducting the end-of-term final-year exams, by Monday. In a meeting held on Sunday, between the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant and the vice-chancellors (VC) of all 13 state universities, suggestions by a specially-formed committee were discussed and deliberated to find how exams could be held, keeping in mind the health and safety of all stakeholders.“The virtual meeting was attended by VCs of all state universities as well as former VCs of University of Mumbai, Rajan Welukar and Vijay Khole for their expertise on our request. A report based on the compilation of our discussion and decisions will be released by noon on Monday,” tweeted Samant on Sunday. A source from MU said majority members of the exam committee have suggested that examination be held in a combination of online and offline mode. “Exams could be held in multiple-choice question (MCQ) mode,” said the source.On Friday, the Apex court upheld a decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC) that called for completion of the evaluation process cross-country by September. The Supreme Court (SC) clarified that colleges and universities cannot award degrees to students without conducting final-year or final-term examinations. The court also mentioned that states were empowered to take decisions under the Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005, to postpone final-year or final-semester exams beyond the September-end deadline. It allowed states to approach UGC for new dates that have to be communicated to them “at the earliest”.“The University Grants Commission (UGC) has given a deadline of September 30 to complete exams but in Maharashtra, schools and colleges are going to remain shut till September 30 due to the Covid-19 situation, so how do we conduct exams? These details are being thought over and we assure students that the decision will be taken ensuring safety of all,” added Samant, via Twitter.Samant has already clarified that examinations will be held in the simplest way and without summoning students to the exam halls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-maharashtra-government-may-publish-decision-on-schedule-today/story-DwbxExQ8Z1ifeEUJzj4eJP.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||After battling Covid-19, Mumbai’s slum area of Dharavi faces next challenge of economic revival||After its success in flattening the Covid-19 curve, Dharavi, a densely populated in south-central Mumbai, is now staring at the next set of challenges – a collapsed economy and loss of livelihood for lakhs of its residents. Dharavi, India’s largest slum area, has been a self-sufficient economic ecosystem thriving with the help of unorganised micro and small enterprises of leather, pottery, textile and artificial jewellery until the Covid-19 outbreak and country-wide lock down crippled the supply chains and took away the demand for such non-essential goods. Dharavi residents are largely daily wage earners and several live hand-to-mouth, with no savings to fall back on if they lose employment. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Dharavi is home to 5,000 goods and services tax (GST) registered businesses, and over 15,000 un-registered businesses. It is considered a hub for international exports, with an estimated turnover of US$1 billion annually. Dharavi has a population of 6.53 lakh, which is estimated to be over 8.5 lakh due to unaccounted for migration. Organisations working to revive Dharavi’s economy post-lockdown estimate that over 60% of the businesses fail to restart post lockdown. Many government and semi-government organisations are now working to restore Dharavi’s economy and revive business supply chains, explore alternate business options and learn new vocational skills. Rajendra Korde, a resident of Dharavi, managing trustee of Dharavi Foundation and secretary of the Peasants and Workers Party of India, said, “The employment situation is Dharavi is dire at present. At least one lakh people are out of jobs, and many businesses have been unable to get back on their feet post lockdown. We are introducing interventions that will help as many residents as possible to earn at least two meals a day.” Korde, along with some non-government organisations (NGO), are helping residents learn vocational skills and find some temporary employment, until businesses in Dharavi get back on their feet. Brinelle D’Souza, co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, who is also working in Dharavi, said, “Unemployment is a major issue. We have formed a committee to see what can be done in this regard, such as re-skilling the youth, to look at new opportunities in this Covid economy. They need to have niche skills to find employment in this economy. The group of activists working with residents are looking to tie up with the National Skill Development Corporation.” Most residents of Dharavi do odd jobs such as working as house helps, accessorising clothing with buttons or embroidery, catering at parties, selling flowers, vegetables and fish and meat as hawkers, if they are not employed with a business. During lockdown, labourers, who did not go back home, took to other jobs to earn an income, such as housekeeping staff or security personnel in Covid hospitals, making masks, cleaning and sanitising toilets. Avirath Shinde, a resident of Dharavi and a government contractor, said, “I employed the 20-odd labourers, who work with me to clean and sanitise community toilets in Dharavi and man the queues. That way I could keep paying them their salaries.” Many labourers who returned home are now coming back to the city. Janardhan Pujari, who worked as a Dharavi tour guide for foreign tourists left for his family home in Mangaluru in May. He said, “My company was paying me half the salary, but only until September, so I decided to return home. Tourism will not start in Dharavi for another six to eight months.” Many residents here continue to live on hand outs and food packets distributed by BMC and NGOs. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi, said, “The government officially stopped distributing food packets and grocery packets, as per directives from the state government. But most residents of Dharavi do not have money to buy their own groceries. Many NGOs periodically step forward. We recently distributed 500 grocery packets with grains and cooking oil donated by an organisation. This keeps them going for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-battling-covid-19-dharavi-faces-next-challenge-of-economic-revival/story-SzjIblwmh8ADj52trgKmTI.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: India first to hit 80,000 cases in a day; 16,000 in Maharashtra||India on Sunday became the first country in the world to report more than 80,000 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a single day, as the outbreak continued to grow and set new records.A total of 80,097 new infections were reported across India on Sunday, taking the nationwide tally to 3,616,747, according to HT’s dashboard. To contextualise the size of the daily tally, China, where the virus originated in December 2019, has 85,031 infections to date.After Sunday’s spike, the seven-day average of daily cases in the country stands at 73,318, also a new global record, and taking it higher than the seven-day daily case peak recorded in the United States .Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 16,408 Covid-19 cases, second in excess of 16,000 and also the second-highest one-day spike, as the tally rose to 780,689. This has pushed the active cases closer to 200,000 at 193,548 cases — 24.79% of the total cases reported so far.The toll reached 24,399 after 296 deaths were reported, of which, 220 were in the past 48 hours, another 43 deaths were from last week, while the remaining 33 deaths were from the period before that, health officials said. The surge in cases is likely to continue for weeks as some more fresh relaxations are expected to come into force from September first week in the state. Experts are of the view that it may take months for the state to bring down cases. Moreover, the state has found that some patients have been reinfected few weeks after fully recovering. It has also reported patients who, even after recovering, are facing respiratory issues.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said the state has got a few cases of Covid-19 reinfection and relapse. “There are a few cases of reinfection and relapse in Covid-19 patients. Thankfully, this is rare, but it is happening, Dr Salunkhe said.“In some of the cases, we have also found that the patients who were recovered from Covid-19 have again facing respiratory problems. It happens because a vital organ especially lungs of the patients get damaged by the virus. For this, we need to set up post-Covid treatment facilities at hospitals,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, had said that the state has found some cases where patients have started experiencing respiratory problems after recovering. “In some hospitals, there are a few patients who have started facing difficulty in respiration. It shows different forms of Covid-19. The task force will study such cases,” Tope told reporters recently.“More movement will expose more and more people to the virus and will eventually lead to more infections,” said a senior official from the health department.The surge in cases can be seen with the rise in daily infections, which on an average has come close to 12,000 per day. It wasn’t even 8,000 a day during last month.In the last 30 days of this month, the state has reported 359,368 cases, which accounts for 11,979 per day, on an average. With a day left, it is likely to go up even further.In July, the number of average cases was 7,980 cases per day as the state has recorded 247,392 cases in that month, while in June it was 3,405 cases a day as cases recorded were 102,172.Dr Salunkhe said the state may take months to reduce daily infections. “Going by the current scenario, it may take months to bring down daily cases until a vaccine arrives in the market soon. See, people are not ready to protect themselves. In that case, the state will have to make its surveillance more aggressive. This can be achieved by making Covid testing accessible to all. Like Mumbai, the mandatory condition of having prescription from a doctor for testing need to be removed from across the state,” he said.Mumbai recorded 1,237 cases, taking its tally to 144,626. Of them, active cases are 20,321.On June 27, Mumbai has reported highest single-day spike with 2,077 cases. The city has been maintaining a sort of stability in fresh cases in the last month.Meanwhile, the city toll stands at 7,626 after 30 deaths were reported on Sunday.Pune city continue to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,663 cases on Sunday and has also crossed the grim milestone of over 1 lakh cases. Its tally stands at 100,236 cases. Pimpri-Chinchwad, satellite city in Pune Metropolitan Region, recorded 1,072 cases, becoming the third-highest contributor, pushing its tally up to 47,217.Apart from them, Nashik city has also recorded over 1,000 cases with 1,049 cases and its tally stood at 26,914.Besides, Pune district, Nagpur city, Kolhapur district, Jalgaon district and Satara district have recorded 991, 836, 669, 625 and 616 cases respectively.Along with fresh infections, number of casualties continues to be highest across state in the country.In the past 30 days (of this month), the state has reported 9,405 deaths, which is the highest in a month so far. In July, a total of 6,988 deaths were reported, while in June, May, April and March, total number of deaths recorded were 5,638, 2,286, 449 and 10 deaths respectively.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded at 3.13% on Sunday. It is slightly less than Gujarat, having the highest CFR in the country as present. On Saturday, Gujarat’s CFR was 3.19% with 2,989 deaths (93,734 cases), according to statistics shared by the state medical education department.On Sunday, it has conducted 74,554 tests and total number of tests conducted till date are 4,084,754As many as 562,401 infected patients have been recovered and discharged from various hospitals across the state till date. On Sunday alone, 7,690 recoveries were reported, taking the recovery rate of the state to 72.04%, against the national average of 76.60%.Currently, 35,373 people have been kept at institutional quarantine facilities and 1,309,676 people are home quarantined across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-india-first-to-hit-80-000-cases-in-a-day-16-000-in-maharashtra/story-rkbHJ6PdO9GdEnC993wrVK.html
31-08-2020||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay’s portal to help find transport for NEET, JEE candidates to test centres||Five students of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have designed a web portal to help candidates appearing for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) find transport to their test centres.EduRide is a web portal that connects candidates across the country with volunteers willing to drive or arrange a vehicle to their respective test centres. Any NEET or JEE candidate can log in on the website, enter details of the location of residence and test centres. These details are then matched against volunteers, who are from a network of students and alumni of various IITs.“We take preferences from a volunteer and he/she could either drive the student or arrange a vehicle for the student. Our portal tries to map a suitable student from a particular area to a volunteer from the same area,” said Kriti Kamna, who handles publicity of the website. The portal is also raising funds to facilitate transport for candidates.Since its launch, on Saturday, the portal has been receiving almost 200 entries a day for transport. The web portal was designed keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown in various parts of the country.However, IIT-B has clarified that it is merely facilitating the process of connecting a candidate with a volunteer, and does not authenticate the genuineness of either the candidate or the volunteer.Scheduled to be held in September, NEET and JEE exams have been in the centre of a national controversy after the Supreme Court allowed the central government to conduct physical examinations, amid calls from distressed students to postpone or cancelling the exams. One of the problems cited by candidates is the lack of public transport facilities in the lockdown that can deter the candidates’ ability to reach their centres on time.The EduRide portal has come forward to help students overcome the transport problem. Taking to social media, IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “To help the JEE (Main) and NEET candidates in various locations across the country, several students and alumni of IITs, including those of IIT-B, have come forward to connect needy candidates with the volunteers willing to help in transport or monetarily through an online portal http://eduride.in. I request volunteers to help in providing transport to the needy candidates in their neighbourhood. Let us all help the future engineers, doctors and scientists of India.”Kamna said that while the portal will do its best in finding transport for such distressed candidates, they should also have a backup option ready.“Since we have a shortage of time, we can’t process every request with a guarantee but we are striving towards it,” said Kamna, a final year electrical engineering student at IIT-B.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-s-portal-to-help-find-transport-for-neet-jee-candidates-to-test-centres/story-i3NWfNuKIODlqVyqSStqpI.html
31-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Four more private hospitals get nod to conduct test for Covid-19||Gurugram: Almost a week after the Haryana government permitted accredited private hospitals and diagnostic labs to conduct antigen and antibody testing for Covid-19, four private hospitals and one private lab in Gurugram have been given approvals to do so. The four hospitals are Metro Hospital & Heart Institute in Palam Vihar, Mayom Hospital in sector 41, W Pratiksha Hospital at Sushant Lok-2 and Paras Hospital in Sushant Lok-1, while Core Diagnostics is the private laboratory.Till date, only three other private institutes -- Medanta- The Medicity in sector 38, Artemis Hospital in sector 51 and Max Hospital in Sushant Lok-1 -- had permission to do so. They had taken permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for it. However, recently the ICMR had changed its guidleines, requiring the state government’s permission.Health officials said that the facilities were given permission based on the credentials submitted and the eligibility criteria as per the government guidelines.Prices of the test will be capped at ₹ 650 for the antigen tests and ₹250 for the antibody test. “Only private hospitals approved by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare (NABH) and private labs approved by National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (NABL) and approved by the ICMR as Covid-19 testing lab are allowed to conduct antigen and antibody test for coronavirus,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer.Dr P Venkata Krishnan, internal medicine, Paras Hospital, said, “The hospital is currently doing antibody test of patients who are suspected of being exposed to the virus, while we have tied-up with the private labs for the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). We are yet to start the antigen tests.” In hospitals, as per the guidelines issued by the ICMR, antigen test has to be conducted in all symptomatic Influenza Like Illness (ILI) patients present in the hospital, who are suspected of having Covid-19 infection. High-risk asymptomatic patients who are hospitalised or seeking hospitalisation for chemotherapy, patients who are immunosuppressed due to HIV infection, transplant patients or those diagnosed with the malignant disease will be tested for Covid-19 through antigen detection kits. Even those undergoing surgical procedures or non-surgical interventions like bronchoscopy, GI endoscopy, dialysis among others will also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 before the procedure.For the antigen test that delivers results in 15-30 minutes, a testing kit is used that looks for specific protein associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus — the pathogen that causes Covid-19. For the antibody test, blood samples are collected to check for antibodies which appear after the person is infected with Covid-19 and stays in the body for months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-four-more-private-hospitals-get-nod-to-conduct-test-for-covid-19/story-KP5XTWIr2cbaU2oOLRPPXM.html
31-08-2020||City||Large-capacity diesel gensets in Gurugram yet to be fitted with emission control equipment||Close to a month after the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) instructed its regional office in Gurugram to ensure retrofitting of emission control equipment in all diesel generator sets that are above 500 kilovolt-amperes (kVA), no compliance reports have been submitted in the matter by licenced DG set operators, said HSPCB officials on Monday.Earlier on July 23, HSPCB chairman Ashok Kheterpal sent official instructions to regional offices in five NCR districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat, Panipat and Bahadurgarh, asking them to ensure retrofitting of emission control equipment in diesel generator sets. Kheterpal’s instructions stated, “It is hereby ordered that all DG sets in operation with capacity of 500kVa and above are required either to retrofit the emission control equipment... or shift to new gas-based generators... within three months.”The process involves upgrading existing DG sets with a CPCB-approved carbon capture device that can mitigate as much as 70% of the particulate matter emissions from the combustion of diesel fuel or, alternatively, switching to less harmful gas-based generators. This move was first proposed as part of the Centre’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which was rolled out early last year in over 100 ‘non-attainment cities’. Gurugram and Faridabad were added to the NCAP’s list of non-attainment cities in July 2019, on World Environment Day. A ‘non-attainment city’ is a polluted city in which the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards are violated.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Gurugram, said, “As per the NCAP, we have to aim for a 30% reduction in particulate matter levels by 2024. DG sets are assumed to contribute around 18% of all particulate matter pollution in cities. In preparation for the winter, and in compliance with a National Green Tribunal’s order from December last year, we have been instructed to take these steps and ensure compliance of large capacity DG sets by October 23 this year.”When asked how the HSPCB plans to implement these directives in the district before the October 23 deadline, Singh said, “We have issued a public notice on our website. It is the responsibility of the operators to apprise themselves of it, do the needful, and send us a compliance report.”So far, however, Singh said that no compliance reports in the matter have been received from licenced DG set operators in Gurugram. “We will send individual notices to all residential complexes, hospitals, malls, office buildings and other commercial establishments in our jurisdiction, cautioning that action can be taken under the Air Act and Environment Protection Act if they fail to comply with the directive,” he said.Experts, on the other hand, expressed doubts over the feasibility of this plan. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said, “There are at least 10,500 diesel generators in Gurugram city alone, as per a recent study by the Centre for Science and Energy. Many of them are extremely old, highly polluting, and do not possess the required NOCs. It is an almost insurmountable task, considering that there is no official record of many of them. As such it is difficult to say exactly how many operators are there in the ciy. Even initiating action against the operators of such generators will be hard for this reason.”Guneet Singh, who runs a city-based non-profit organisation in the field of air-quality research, said, “The task is challenging. But, there are some ways to go about it efficiently. Firstly, it will be easier to identify large-scale diesel generators in commercial or residential establishments because they are all annually maintained by a small group of contractors. Out of 10,500 diesel generator sets, the directive would apply to a smaller number of 500kVA sets, which are better regulated than smaller portable sets. So there’s one big starting advantage.”Experts, including Guneet and Pawar, also said that providing incentives to operators (for example, in the form of reduced electricity bills) or subsidising the cost of new equipment, may ensure compliance with the HSPCB’s directive. However, they also pointed out that the proposal does not address the larger issue of informal DG sets used in Gurugram.“Larger diesel generators, for example in RWAs, are designed to release emissions at greater ‘stack heights’, and not at a breathable proximity to residents. Portable generators, in the 200 to 300KVA range, that are used in small shops and individual homes are the real issue. They cause a bulk of street-side pollution and are also poorly regulated,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/large-capacity-diesel-gensets-in-gurugram-yet-to-be-fitted-with-emission-control-equipment/story-J5aXAxDh3M6lFiJOgXuI1L.html
31-08-2020||City||Gurugram: 12 mobile phones, 5 chargers found in Bhondsi Jail||Gurugram: Authorities of Bhondsi Jail on Saturday recovered 12 mobile phones, five chargers and several batteries from the barracks inside the jail complex. They also recovered a 4G SIM card and two headsets concealed in four packets, the police said. The jail authorities have filed a complaint in the matter at Bhondsi police station. According to the complaint, an inspection of all the barracks was conducted by a quick response team at 11am. During the inspection, four packets were found on the roof of and behind barrack number 7. Preliminary probe suggested that the packets, containing the phones and other items, had been thrown from outside and flung across the boundary wall of the jail complex, the police said. “The packets contained 12 mobile phones, including smartphones, several batteries, five chargers, a 4G SIM card and two headsets. We are questioning inmates to ascertain if they had any knowledge of the incident,” said a police official privy to the investigation. Several instances of mobile phones and drugs being flung across the boundary wall of the jail complex have been reported in the past. The police said mobile phones are used by some inmates to make extortion calls and contact their henchmen and aides to run their operations. Neeraj, station house officer, Bhondsi police station, said, “An FIR has been registered in the case. Efforts are on to locate the shops from where the mobile phones and other items had been purchased.” The easy access of mobile phones and narcotics among jail inmates had come under the scanner after the police had arrested Dharambeer Chautala, who was posted as deputy jail superintendent of Bhondsi Jail, on July 23. Chautala, along with his associate Ravi, was caught supplying mobile phones and narcotics to some inmates. The police had recovered at least 11 4G SIM cards and 230 grams of hashish from their possession. A probe had found that one 4G SIM card was sold for over Rs 20,000 to the inmates, who were using phones to run their networks outside the prison. A special investigation team (SIT) was formed to probe the matter, following which two more aides of Chautala were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-12-mobile-phones-5-chargers-found-in-bhondsi-jail/story-9bkWce4SCiequMz1fr0NdI.html
31-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Five days after going missing, tractor driver found dead in Sector 66||Five days after a 35-year-old tractor-trolley driver went missing, his body was found in the basement of a private company in Sector 66 area on Saturday. The police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC). Police said the victim, identified as Pankaj Kumar, a native of Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh, went to the house of his employer, Jagbir, at 9am on August 24 to pick up the trolley. He drove to a private company in Sector 66 for some work and parked it there around 11.30am, following which he went missing. Jagbir said that he had been trying to reach Pankaj but his phone was found switched off. He said, “I tried looking for him but could not locate him. On August 26, I filed a missing persons’ complaint with the police.” The police said an FIR was registered under Section 346 (wrongful confinement in secret) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) on August 26 at Sector 65 police station. “On Saturday, someone in one of the basement floors of the company noticed a dead body as some foul smell was emanating from a spot. The matter was then reported to the police. The body was partially decomposed. The cause of death would be known after the post-mortem report comes out. We are trying to ascertain the circumstances leading to his death. Prima facie, it appears that he died due to drowning as some water had collected in the basement. We have initiated inquest proceedings,” said a police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity. The police said the victim’s body was handed over to his family after the post-mortem examination on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-five-days-after-going-missing-tractor-driver-found-dead-in-sector-66/story-lvYM6oim476UqkmuiQHOCK.html
31-08-2020||City||Gurugram: 4 nabbed with cannabis worth ₹5 lakh meant to be sold in NCR||Gurugram: Faridabad police arrested four men in the wee hours of Sunday from Sector 62 for allegedly possessing contraband items worth at least ₹5 lakh, said the police. Police said they recovered 64 kg of cannabis from the suspects which they allegedly smuggled into the city from Orissa to sell it in NCR. According to the police, the four, who were travelling in a Maruti Eeco, were apprehended following a tip-off. The suspects were identified as Keshav, Muhammad Ansaar, Abdul Sabir and Muhammad Sanazir of Delhi.Dharna Yadav (ACP, crime against women), said Ansaar is allegedly the kingpin of the gang and was involved in many cases under the NDPS Act in the national capital region. He allegedly used to travel in an Eeco car to get the supply of drugs from Orissa and to mislead the police he used to have passengers in the vehicle so as to avoid checking,” she said. Police said checking was going on in the area when crime teams received a tip off and started checking all vehicles.“The Sector 30 crime team had received information that the suspects were carrying a huge quantity of cannabis and were coming from Orissa. Accordingly, a check point was set up near the Sector 62 crossing. They came in from the direction of Palwal and were arrested in the wee hours,” said Yadav. She added that the suspects had allegedly hidden the drugs in the boot of their car and below the seats in plastic bags covered with clothes and other household stuff. Police said after the drugs were recovered, they questioned the suspects and got to know crucial details of the organised crime and how they allegedly used to run their business. According to OP Singh, commissioner of police, the police have also seized the car they were travelling in as it was allegedly used to smuggle the drugs from other states. “During interrogation, the suspects revealed that they used to deliver the consignment in different areas and had been doing this since past many years. They used to pack the drugs in small packets of 10-100 grams and we have also received information of their suppliers in areas but the end users are yet to be identified” said Singh. Police said they suspect that more persons may be involved in this racket and they are on the lookout for the others. A case was registered against the suspects under sections of the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act 1985 at Adarsh Nagar police station in Faridabad. “We are working to identify more cases against them. Though they claim this was their first offence, we have reason to believe they have been smuggling drugs for many years,” said commissioner Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-4-nabbed-with-cannabis-worth-5-lakh-meant-to-be-sold-in-ncr/story-b8jteOlTsw6Bd22lyPQszO.html
31-08-2020||City||Faridabad man kills self, leaves note alleging blackmail by two||GurugramFaridabad police nabbed two people on Sunday for allegedly blackmailing a 50-year-old businessman, who later killed himself by jumping into a river and left behind a note.Police said the suspects had recorded a video of the businessman in an objectionable position, which they later used to blackmail him.The victim, a 50-year-old printing press owner was found dead in a river flowing to Gurugram on Friday and his car was recovered from the bridge of the river. Dharna Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said that they received a complaint from the deceased’s son that his father had gone missing from home on August 24 and they had recovered a suicide note alleging three people for forcing him to take his life. “The man used to run a printing press and was financially sound. A woman who was working in his office honey trapped him, along with her friend who worked at the same press,” she said. The woman, along with her aide — identified as Vinod Kumar — recorded an objectionable video of the victim in a compromising position in a hotel. Yadav said the woman was aware that a video was being shot, but the victim didn’t. Later, the man and the woman recruited a third person — identified as Swami alias Kripal Singh of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh — and started living in a rented accommodation in Palwal. “Vinod and Swami blackmailed the businessman for over a year and extorted Rs 15 lakh. Recently, they had again started pressurizing him to cough up more money, following which the man wrote a suicide note as he feared facing his family and took his life,” she said. A case under section 346 (Wrongful confinement in secret) ,384 (extortion) ,506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Ballabhgarh police station against three people, including the woman. OP Singh, commissioner of police, Faridabad, said while teams were investigating the case, they recovered the car of Kaushik from a bridge near a cremation ground in Sector 8. “Before the police could investigate the case, Ballabhgarh police received a complaint from the woman alleging rape by the victim on Friday. A day later his body was recovered from the river. As soon as we received the complaint we found it suspicious and started investigating the whereabouts of the woman,” he said. The police teams recovered some crucial evidence, such as the video recording, and three suspects were identified as blackmailing the businessman. The woman and her close aide were arrested and during questioning they revealed that they had laid the trap as they thought that the businessman was rich and will easily fall prey, said police. Singh said the third suspect is still absconding and police teams are conducting raids to arrest him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridabad-man-kills-self-leaves-note-alleging-blackmail-by-two/story-r2kd6HcCTbPX0FHPHFzmbJ.html
31-08-2020||Gurugram||MCG House meeting to take place at a new venue each time||After realising the gravity of civic ailments in sector 27 and areas surrounding it, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to conduct House meetings at a new venue each time in the future.On Friday, the MCG’s house meeting took place at a community centre in sector 27, the first time it was held at a venue other than the John Hall in Civil Lines or the MCG’s main office in sector 34. House meetings are held between top MCG officials and city councillors.Prior to the house meeting on Friday, MCG officials inspected the drainage facility in sectors 27, 28, and Golf Course Road (GCR), a matter which came into focus during last week’s rain when the area for flooded.The inspection also helped officials understand the topography of the area, which is located in close proximity to the Aravallis and hence, remains vulnerable to waterlogging.During the meeting, MCG formed a 10-member committee for reviewing the existing drainage system of the three areas and compile a report on the matter, suggesting the best possible ways to address water-logging issues in these areas. In addition, they also announced that a private agency has been hired for preparing a detailed drainage plan for the two sectors.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said that holding house meetings at a new venue each time will give an opportunity for officials and councillors to closely examine and understand the local civic issues and subsequently undertake necessary steps to expedite improvement in infrastructure.He added it would also ensure that various civic buildings such as community centres are regularly maintained.“A lot of new issues pertaining to civic ailments came to surface during our recent house meeting, most of which only came into the spotlight as we had held a house meeting in a residential sector for the first time. Hence, we felt that from future onwards, conducting a house meeting at a new venue each time will not only help us with an in-depth understanding of civic issues at a particular sector but also expedite starting of new projects or repairing of existing ones,” said Singh.He further said that MCG has properties spread across the city and that almost all residential sectors have a community centre managed by the MCG or the local RWA.“Hence, conducting a meeting at a new venue each time would not be that difficult for us,” said Singh.There are 60 community centres in the city, of which 38 are managed by the MCG and 22 by RWAs.For a better understanding of localised issues, MCG has conducted operations in each of its 35 wards in the past. In December last year, under the “nagar nigam aapke dwar” initiative, MCG officials will hold camps in a particular ward where localised issues of residents would be addressed by a team of MCG officials, which often included the area joint commissioner and executive engineers among other officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-house-meeting-to-take-place-at-a-new-venue-each-time/story-vmzHvwZZJrCQTJ4bNenCzH.html
31-08-2020||Gurugram||South City 2 residents forced to buy water for daily consumption||Residents of South City 2, who have been severely hit by a persistent water shortage in the area since the imposition of the nationwide lockdown in March, are being forced to buy water for their daily needs. The residents of Block D said that they are suffering due to an acute shortage of water and despite six months having passed, nothing has changed for them. These residents, who are presently in a containment zone, are spending out of their pockets to get water.Around 5,000 residents in the area have been dependent on water tankers since March 22 due to water shortage. As per the residents, the water flow in the area is less than normal. Further some residents are using boosting pumps, while some have constructed underground tanks, due to which the water pressure is often low and fails to reach all the houses. Bhupinder Singh, one of the residents, said there is no water supply for the past one week. “The situation has particularly worsened in the past week. There are three Covid-19 patients in the block and a portion of block is under containment. Yet, the authorities are not paying any heed to our problems. There is no operator in the pump house and the operator’s number is switched off. We have complained to both the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the developer. However, no action has been taken so far,” he said. Some residents have taken to social media, highlighting their plight and tagging the deputy commissioner and the commissioner of the MCG. They have even approached the chief minister regarding the persistent water shortage. Another resident, Jasbir Singh, said, “It is becoming very difficult to manage without water everyday and spending ₹1,000 on tanker is again not feasible. Senior citizens are the worst-hit” he said. Residents alleged that there is no one to hold either the developer and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) accountable. Although the MCG has taken over the area, services are still with the developer. They continue to blame each other while the residents are forced to bear the brunt.Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, said that the water is supplied by Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to the developer and is routed through them. “The pipelines were being shifted. However, the work is almost over now.The water supply will resume by Sunday night.” he said. A senior GMDA official, requesting anonymity, said they are looking into the problem. A GMDA team will inspect the area on Monday and will try to resolve the issue at the earliest.Despite repeated attempts, the developer of South City 2 could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/south-city-2-residents-forced-to-buy-water-for-daily-consumption/story-RTnAAjVZvwMllJeVi10rpN.html
31-08-2020||Gurugram||Haryana govt revokes weekday restrictions on markets, malls||Following the Unlock 4 guidelines from the Union government, Haryana on Sunday withdrew its August 28 order disallowing markets and shops in urban areas on Mondays and Tuesdays.According to the guidelines, state governments should not impose any lockdown outside containment zones without permission from the central government. Haryana home minister Anil Vij tweeted the government’s decision on Sunday. Earlier, the restrictions were on markets and malls in urban areas on weekends, Saturday and Sunday, but later on shifted to the weekdays Monday and Tuesday following protests from traders who said they had already suffered high losses on account of the lockdown.A state government spokesperson in the evening said that the government will allow all activities permitted outside containment zones, except for schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutions that will continue to remain closed up to September 30, 2020, as per the central government guidelines.The government’s latest decision added to the relief of market associations in the city and traders who were suffering business losses since the imposition of the Covid-19 induced lockdown on March 22.“The withdrawal is a positive decision and it will help traders but the manner in which lockdown was imposed for two days created confusion for the customers and traders. These decisions should be taken after taking the trade and business associations in confidence,” said Mandeep Goyal, a jeweler based in Sadar Bazaar.Mall operators and shopkeepers there also said that this decision was necessary as otherwise they would suffer more losses. “People are slowly returning to malls and started shopping and this has given some hope that business and trade will revive. Closing business for two days would have badly hit all stakeholders,” said Vijay Aima, vice president, Ambience Mall, who added that all safeguards for preventing the spread of Covid-19 were being followed in their, as well as other, malls.A government spokesperson further elaborated that as per the Unlock 4 guidelines, social, academics, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious functions and other congregations with a ceiling of 100 persons will be permitted with effect from September 21, 2020, with mandatory wearing of face masks, social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and hand wash or sanitizer.However, marriage related gatherings with number of guests not exceeding 50 and funeral/ last rites related gatherings with number of persons not exceeding 20 will continue to be allowed up to September 20, 2020, after which the ceiling of 100 persons will apply.Cinema halls, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres and similar places will remain closed. However, open air theatres will be permitted to open with effect from September 21, 2020, he addedHe further said that Lockdown shall remain in force in the containment zones till September 30, 2020. Strict containment measures will be enforced in these containment zones and only essential activities will be allowed.The spokesman said that in the containment zones, there shall be intensive contact tracing, house-to-house surveillance, and other clinical interventions, as required. These containment zones will be notified on the websites by the respective district collectors and by the states/UTs and information will be shared with the ministry of health and family affairs.He further added that there shall be no restriction or inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods including those for cross land-border trade under the neighbouring countries.

31-08-2020||City||Noida may witness moderate rainfall on Sept 2||Noida: The city and adjoining region, which witnessed drizzling on Sunday, is likely to receive moderate rainfall on September 2 and 3, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, the light rain will continue in some parts of the region for the next two days, the weather department predicted. Noida and Ghaziabad had received heavy rainfall on August 28. “The light rain and drizzling would continue on Monday and Tuesday as well. There is moisture in the region which could lead to good thunder activities. The showers are likely to be light to very light. The next good weather activity leading to rainfall is likely to be around September 2 and 3,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The rainfall below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate and above 64.5mm is heavy. Since June 1, Noida has seen a rainfall of 66.3mm till Sunday against expected 440mm, which is about 85% deficit. The neighbouring Ghaziabad has received 185.1mm rainfall which is 58% deficit, as per the IMD data. According to weather analysts, the low pressure monsoon line of trough – that oscillates around the region and causes rains as it passes over the region – has currently shifted south of Delhi-NCR and is likely to shift northwards in the next 24 hours. “The monsoon line of trough is hovering over western Madhya Pradesh adjoining Rajasthan. But by next 24 hours this will move northwards towards Delhi and this will lead to good rainfall in the region within next few days. We can predict moderate rainfall on September 2 and 3. However, the current weather pattern doesn’t suggest heavy rainfall this week,” said Mahesh Palawat, director at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. On Sunday, the maximum temperature in Noida was recorded at 31.4 degrees Celsius, a drop of about four degrees due to patchy rains as compared to 35 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The humidity level oscillated between 82% and 77%. According to IMD, the day temperature is likely to hover around 35 degrees over the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-may-witness-moderate-rainfall-on-sept-2/story-vMkko7IsYoQsfPDzAg61IK.html
31-08-2020||City||Unlock 4: Weekend restrictions to continue in UP, says state govt||Ghaziabad: A day after the Union home ministry issued guidelines for Unlock 4, the Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday said that the present weekend restrictions will continue in the state.Issuing a set of fresh guidelines on Sunday night, UP chief secretary RK Tiwari also said that the lockdown will continue in containment zones till September 30. Tiwari in his order has categorically stated that the district magistrates will not impose lockdown at local level outside the containment zones under any circumstance. This indicates that the lockdown activities will continue only in containment zones. “In the wake of the Covid-19 infection, people aged over 65 years, pregnant women, children below 10 years and those having co-morbid conditions will stay at home and should move out only in cases when there is some medical emergency. The weekend restrictions which are put in place from 10pm on every Friday up to 5am on Monday will continue till further order,” Tiwari said in his order. Adding further, the chief secretary stated that all schools, colleges, educational institutions and coaching institutes shall remain closed till September 30. He, however, added that online classes/distance education will continue. Tiwari also said that the Metro services will be allowed to operate in a phased manner and standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be issued in a separate order. The Union home ministry on Saturday had announced the guidelines for the fourth phase of relaxations in the coronavirus-induced lockdown. In the latest round of relaxation, called Unlock 4, Metro train services have been allowed to resume from September 7, but in a graded manner. Schools and colleges will, however, remain closed and the government will hold separate discussion before opening up these educational institutions. The Centre’s guidelines also say that from September 21, states and Union territories may permit up to 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff to be called to the schools at a time for online teaching/tele-counselling and related work. The SOPs will be issued by the Union health ministry separately, the guideline says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-4-weekend-restrictions-to-continue-in-up-says-state-govt/story-AaTw7cchQy8Zx5SLkFrMfL.html

31-08-2020||Noida||Noida: Man kills 8-year-old boy in revenge, arrested||A 24-year-old man was arrested by Noida police on Sunday for allegedly killing an eight-year-old boy. The boy was found dead on Thursday a day after we went missing from his house in Chhalera village.The police said it appears that the suspect, Babu (identified by a single name in police records), killed the boy in an act of revenge after the boy’s family rejected his proposal to marry the victim’s 14-year-old older sister.The suspect, who is from West Bengal and worked in Noida as a gardener, lived in the same neighbourhood as the victim’s family.“The last I had seen my son was with Babu on August 26 evening around 6 pm. When he didn’t come home in the evening, we started searching for him. Even Babu was not at his home. When we exhausted all our options, we reported our son missing to the police around 2am early August 27 morning, ,” said the boy’s mother in her complaint to the police.The family said that later in the afternoon on August 27, a child’s dead body had been found in a ditch on the Mahamaya flyover-Sector 37 route. After the mother went to identify the body, it turned out to be her missing son.Based on the mother’s complaint, a case was registered against the suspect at the Sector 39 police station under sections 302 (murder) and 201 (whoever knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed, intentionally omits to give any information respecting that offence which he is legally bound to give) of the Indian Penal Code.“Babu had been harassing my 14-year-old daughter for a long time. He wanted to get married to her and we had objected to her proposal. He would also try to intervene in our family matters and when we objected, he threatened to kill our son,” said the mother. The victim’s family is also from West Bengal and the boy was the youngest of five siblings, said the police.The police officers said the motive behind the murder was the family rejecting the marriage proposal.“The suspect would take the boy for fishing often, refer to the boy’s mother as mother-in-law. He had been harassing the family for a while, and the family members were so troubled that they had started entertaining the idea of sending their daughter to an acquaintance’s place in Ghaziabad. It was the rejection of the marriage proposal that led the suspect to kill the boy,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.“The pit where the boy’s body was found was barely a foot deep. It seemed that the boy had been hit on the head and his head was pushed into the ditch and kept in that position by force. The autopsy also said that the boy died of drowning,” said the DCP.The suspect, who had been on the run since the incident, was arrested near Sector 44 based on a tip-off. He was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-man-kills-8-year-old-boy-in-revenge-arrested/story-SvHjLDU226qWJM5BioTA1M.html
31-08-2020||Noida||Greater Noida appoints NGO for sterilising, vaccinating stray dogs||The Greater Noida authority on Sunday appointed an NGO (non-government organisation) for sterilising and vaccinating street dogs across the city.The NGO hired for the task, Friendicoes SECA, has been asked to sterilise and vaccinate at least of 10 stray dogs everyday . The authority has also appealed to the residents’ welfare associations(RWAs) and apartment owners welfare associations(AOA’s) to come forward to help the NGO in addressing the stray dog menace. The authority has also set up a dog shelter at Parshvnath Panorama society in Swarn Jayanti.“We have appealed to the RWAs and AOAs to rope in volunteers who can get the stray dogs sterilised and vaccinated by the NGO in their presence for maintaining transparency and accountability. If the volunteers RWA or AOA office bearers will be present at the spot, then we can verify if the work is being done properly or not,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Residents said in the past the agencies that had been hired by the authority did not carry out the vaccinations and sterilisation properly. To address this issue, the authority wants to involve RWAs and AOAs in the initiative.“The NGO will charge ₹950 for each sterilisation and vaccination. We request that RWA, AOA to pay ₹250 for each dog and the rest of the amount will be borne by the authority. Once the AOA, RWA or other resident groups will send a picture of the dogs vaccinated or sterilised, the authority will release the payment to the NGO,” said Chandar.“Friendicoes will pick up and release the street dogs, and will also take care of the sterilisation and vaccination process. Greater Noida authority plans to share the payment with the RWA or the housing groups, but at the moment that plan remains a little hazy and the program will take a while to run smoothly. There are more dogs outside housing complexes than inside and they definitely need to be sterilised if this program is to show significant results. However, who will bear the costs of the stray dogs outside a residential society hasn’t been made clear. But we hope that the program does well,as the area needs a good animal birth control program,” aid Geeta Sheshamani, vice president, Friendicoes SECA (Noida chapter).Many residents had been complaining about the stray dog menace in the city.“The stray dog menace is a long-standing issue that needs to be addressed. In the past, the authority’s health department failed to tackle this. As a result, residents almost in all societies, especially children and the elderly, face troubles. Now we hope, the authority will be able to address the problem. However, asking RWAs or AOAs to pay is not justified,” said Davendra Tiger, president of federation of Greater Noida RWAs, an umbrella body of city’s RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-appoints-ngo-for-sterilising-vaccinating-stray-dogs/story-0c349bB4FE6AwY79eckOQJ.html

The police had arrested the landlord’s son-in-law after the incident that took place on August 3. According to the police, an FIR was lodged at Vijay Nagar police station against three suspects -- Ishwar Singh, his wife Rajni and son-in-law Akash Singh -- under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. During the incident, victim Budh Pal, a daily wager, was at home with his two minor sons aged eight and six years while his wife had gone to meet their relatives in Loni, the police said. “The man sustained internal injuries which caused his death.

Though we paid ₹3,500, some part of the pending rent was still due. The suspects started demanding the balance amount, but my husband requested for more time in the wake of lockdown. Upon this, they got furious and started beating my husband. He sustained injuries and died on the spot,” Reena said in her complaint. “The next day Ishwar Singh informed me at 6am that my husband was lying dead. When I reached my house from Loni, I saw my husband lying dead. My eight years old son then told me that the suspects had beaten up my husband and narrated the entire sequence which took place a day earlier. Thereafter I gave a police complaint,” she said. The victim and his family stayed at a house in Siddharth Vihar which is owned by the prime suspect. According to the police, the victim had rented the room for ₹2,000 per month and failed to pay rent for the past four months due to lockdown.

31-08-2020||City||Noida: Over 60 Covid-19 patients deliver healthy babies since outbreak||NOIDA As many as 63 Covid-19 positive women have delivered healthy babies so far at different hospitals in the Gautam Budh Nagar district since the outbreak began in March this year. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that after the outbreak, it was found that no hospital was willing to admit Covid-19 positive pregnant women. “Then we set up an exclusive ward at our Greater Noida hospital for pregnant women. After that decision, some hospitals started taking Covid-positive women who are either close to their delivery date or have some complications,” he said. Suhas further said that the district administration had also tied up with some maternity homes as step-down facilities so that we had beds available for the urgent cases. In the district, currently three hospitals -- Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Sharda hospital and Fortis hospital -- are admitting Covid-19 positive pregnant women.Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS, said that the hospital started a 20-bed exclusive ward for such pregnant patients in the first week of April. “So far, 41 Covid-19 patients have delivered babies here, and over 10 women who are about to deliver are admitted in the gynaecology ward. Our obstetricians, led by Dr Shikha Seth, have done exemplary job in not only ensuring the safe delivery of babies, but also in fast recovery of Covid-19 positive mothers. we also arranged additional beds in the paediatric ward to accommodate the influx of such patients,” Gupta said. Till date, GIMS has performed a total of 266 deliveries, the hospital authorities said.Dr Nimmi Chutani, head of gynaecology department in Sharda hospital, said that after the Covid-19 outbreak, the hospital has developed a protocol for deliveries, handling of newborns and their discharge. “The newborns are not separated from their Covid-positive mothers after delivery. Mothers are allowed to breastfeed, as that helps boost babies’ immunity. The hospital administers the BCG vaccine, also an immunity booster, to every baby. Barring complicated cases, the babies are discharged along with their mothers,” she said. Chtani said that so far 21 Covid-19 patients have successfully delivered babies here. “Of the 21 deliveries, 15 were performed through C-section and six were normal deliveries. A few babies have tested positive about five to six days after delivery. But we have observed that it was more due to the handling of those babies by multiple relatives than any particular setting of the mother. However, these babies too have recovered. Finally, all babies born here have been Covid-19 negative at birth and at discharge,” Chutani said. At Fortis hospital in Noida, only one Covid-19 positive pregnant patient has been admitted so far and she gave birth to a coronavirus negative baby. Dr Monika Wadhawan, senior consultant (obstetrician and gynaecology) at Fortis, said that the patient had tested positive for Covid-19 the same day her delivery was planned. “She was in active labour and we performed the delivery normally in our dedicated Covid-19 building. All staff members, including the gynaecologists and paediatricians, were in Level-3 PPE kits. The baby tested negative and is absolutely fine,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-over-60-covid-19-patients-deliver-healthy-babies-since-outbreak/story-PGMT5vJoc6TAlpuhQvO0RJ.html

State officials stated that the decision was taken as several government hospitals across districts in the state are facing a shortage of beds while beds in private facilities are lying vacant. Covid hospitals in UP were divided into three categories – L1, L2 and L3 – as part of the state government’s three-tier structure coronavirus. While L1 hospitals are meant for asymptomatic patients, L2 hospitals treat patients having moderate symptoms and L3 category hospitals are for Covid patients with severe symptoms.Confirming the order, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said he will hold a meeting with private hospitals to apprise them of the development.“The state government order means that the district will now have more L2 and L3 category beds available for patients. The rates will be charged as per the prescribed rates under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna and will be paid to the hospitals by the government. Patients who get referred to these reserved beds from government facilities will not be charged,” said Pandey. In Ghaziabad, there are 598 beds across 10 private hospitals that offer paid Covid-19 treatment on the basis of rates fixed by the state government on July 10. The government had capped the prices for Covid-19 beds between ₹8,000 to ₹15,000 per day. Under the Ayushman scheme, the cost of a general-ward bed is ₹1,800 per day, that for a high dependency unit is ₹2,700 per day. The cost of beds without ventilators has been fixed at ₹3,600 per day while those with ventilators are fixed at ₹4,500 per day. Till August 29, a total of 2,463 patients were admitted in paid private hospitals in Uttar Pradesh. At present, the district has 376 L2 category beds and another 200 L3 category beds available in government or government-acquired facilities. Of the 598 beds available in private Covid hospitals, 278 were occupied by paying Covid patients till August 29.“Till now, we have reserved only 19 ICU beds, out of the 598. As per the new order we can now reserve up to 50% in case we face shortage of L2 or L3 beds in our facilities. This will help our patients who are in government facilities. The patients referred from our hospitals will get treatment free of cost and the government rates will be paid from government funds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.“Since a majority of asymptomatic patients are now in home isolation, our L1 hospitals have almost shut down with only one being operational at present. The 50% reservation of beds in private hospitals would mean that we have about 300 more L2 or L3 beds available for our patients in case of need,” Dr Gupta, added. Dr Ashok Rai, president of the Indian Medical Association (Uttar Pradesh) said that they have not received the order as of now and will be able to comment once it is received. Meanwhile, private hospitals raised concerns about operational costs and availability of beds to handover to the admin.“It is not the case that beds remain vacant in private hospitals. The administration has already reserved some beds in the ICU ward and we have treated patients free of cost. If the administration asks for more beds we will allow in present circumstances due to pandemic. We have about 70-80% occupancy,” said Dr Mahesh Chaudhary, director (operations), Navin Hospital at Vaishali. “We have a limited number of ICU beds and if we part with 50% of them, how will we take out our operational cost. We have limited infrastructure and staff. There are issues in getting staff also. We are already working on rates given to us for paid Covid treatment. If they want more beds they must allow some concessions. Otherwise, giving away beds will not be feasible. Out of 100, we have 30 beds operational and the present occupancy is about 50% at present,” said Dr Manoj Singh, director of Flores Hospital at Pratap Vihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-admin-can-reserve-up-to-50-beds-in-private-covid-hospitals-says-state-govt/story-PSscdQS3HpkWyScgXEhN1N.html
31-08-2020||City||Greater Noida: 11 foreign nationals arrested for organising party||Greater Noida: Police on early Sunday arrested 11 foreign nationals, including four women, for organising an in-house party allegedly in violation of Covid-19 norms. According to the police, a group of African nationals gathered at a house in Greater Noida on Saturday night and started drinking and making noise which is also a violation of Section 144 CrPC enforced in the district. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that local people informed the police that around 40 to 50 foreigners were having a late night party in a single storey house in UPSIDC Colony. “When a police team from Surajpur reached the spot, some of the suspects started to escape by jumping the boundary wall. The police managed to arrest seven men and four women,” he said. The police have also seized seven cars and about 300 liquor bottles from the spot. The suspects are from Nigeria, Cameroon, Zambia and Uganda, the police said. Some of these suspects are students and others are involved in business, the police said, adding that they are residents of different residential societies in Greater Noida, and had gathered at the house to join the party. Chander said that the suspects were flouting weekend lockdown norms by organising the party. The police also got medical examination of the suspects conducted and the reports are awaited. A case has been registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code, along with Section 60 of the Excise Act.“The arrested persons were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-11-foreign-nationals-arrested-for-organising-party/story-dPYv0aIcKmDpTxw9T1mnrJ.html
31-08-2020||City||Dhanauri wetlands robbery: Three nabbed, camera recovered; police post to come up in area||Greater Noida: A week after two wildlife photographers were robbed of their professional camera in Dhanauri wetlands, the Greater Noida police, on Sunday, arrested three suspects and recovered the camera, along with the lens, from their possession. Police said the suspects – Deepak Pawar, Pramod Kumar, and Dipendra alias Deepanshu – are intermediate-level students and residents of Bulandshahr. They were returning from a friend’s birthday party when they allegedly robbed the photographers at gunpoint. Dinesh, a fourth accomplice, is absconding, officers said.Greater Noida police have decided to set up a police check post in Dhanauri wetlands and patrol the area to improve safety and securityOn August 22, photographer Narinder Kohli and his uncle Shyam Bhagra had gone to Dhanauri wetlands in their Maruti Ciaz. Bhagra was in the driver’s seat while Kohli was sitting next to him. They were shooting photos and videos from their parked car for a documentary on Sarus cranes when three masked men had approached them on a black TVS Apache motorcycle around 3pm. Two of them got down from the motorcycle and struck up a conversation with Bhagra. Kohli said the suspects asked them about the camera, which is worth Rs 5 lakh, and photography and soon pulled out a gunpoint. “They first tried to snatch Bhagra’s camera but failed since it weighed 8-10 kg. The suspects then grabbed my camera and fled on the motorcycle,” he said.Kohli, 42, is a resident of Paras Tierea Society in Sector 137, and his uncle Bhagra, 52, is a resident of Eldeco Utopia in Sector 93A. The complainant in the case, filed at the Dankaur police station, is Kohli.According to Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner Greater Noida, “Kohli told the police the motorcycle’s headlight bore a sticker bearing the name of a community. This was a significant clue which we started following,” he said.The police formed three teams and launched a search in the area. “We scanned CCTV footage from several cameras in nearby areas and also questioned some suspects. We also scanned around 100 motorcycles registered in Gautam Budh Nagar and Bulandshahr in the process. A team was also scanning social media in the meantime, wherein a motorcycle bearing that particular type of sticker was spotted,” he said.Officers further investigated the matter and found that the motorcycle was registered in the name of Surendra Kumar Pawar, a resident of Chiyasi Bada village in Bulandshahr. Upon questioning Surendra, officers found that it is his son Deepak who uses the motorcycle. The police then picked up Deepak, who allegedly admitted to the crime with two accomplices Pramod and Dipendra, from whom the camera’s lens was recovered. The police arrested the three and recovered the stolen camera, the lens, the motorcycle, a country made gun and one live cartridge.The ADCP said a case had been registered under IPC Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) on a police complaint filed by Kohli. “They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody. Dinesh, a local accomplice, who was allegedly involved in plotting, is absconding. Dinesh had allegedly given them the idea that Dhanauri attracts photographers and they can be easily robbed,” he said.The ADCP said that the police have written a letter to the Yamuna Authority for them to develop a police check post in the Dhanauri wetlands to improve safety and security.Kohli said he is very satisfied by the prompt action by the Greater Noida police. “The police had swiftly registered my case and launched a search. They kept me updated daily about the investigation. On Sunday, I again visited Dhanauri and a police team accompanied me. The police check post will immensely improve safety of birders in Dhanauri. I and a group of birders have decided to felicitate the Greater Noida police team next Saturday which solved our case,” he said.Yamuna Authority chief executive officer Arunvir Singh’s phone was unavailable, while officer on special duty Shailendra Bhatia did not receive the call for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dhanauri-wetlands-robbery-three-nabbed-camera-recovered-police-post-to-come-up-in-area/story-nOxpsxIMi9hqAIDCwbBz1J.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi prisons most packed in country, shows data||Delhi’s prisons are the most crowded and violent in the country, according to data for the financial year 2019-20 released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which also shows the authorities here spent more on food, clothing and medical care of inmates than any other jail in India.According to the NCRB data, Delhi was on top of the chart with the highest prisoner occupancy in the country at 174.9% -- housing 7,508 more prisoners than its given capacity of 10,026. The total number of prisoners in Delhi’s jails on December 31, 2019 was 17,534.The data shows while Rajasthan has seven prisons for women, highest in the country, Delhi, with just two, has the highest number of women inmates at 629. The occupancy rate of Delhi’s women prisons was 97.07% as on December 31, 2019, the report says.Fifty-seven clashes between inmates were reported in Delhi jails last year in 2019, making it the country’s most violent prison. 92 prisoners were injured in these incidents, the highest in the country, the NCRB data shows.Sandeep Goel, director-general, Delhi prisons, said the number of clashes was high because each and every incident is reported. “One reason is also that the jails are overcrowded. Recently, we had taken measures to decongest our jails. While 1,150 convicts were released temporarily to decongest jails in the wake of the pandemic, 2,900 undertrials were released on interim bail. A police housing complex with a capacity of 2,000 inmates was also converted into a temporary jail near Mandoli,” he said.Sunil Gupta, who was the prison’s only law officer for 35 years until his retirement in 2016, said the reason behind fights among the prisoners is that criminals in Delhi are divided into separate gangs and groups. “At the time of their admission and jail allotment, it should be seen that an inmate is not put in the same jail where the members of his rival gangs are housed,” he said.There are 14 central jails in Delhi and two for women.According to the data, of the total expenditure incurred on inmates, Delhi prisons spent the highest on food and medical care -- Rs 18,620 was spent per prisoner on food and Rs 9,684 on medical care of each prisoner in the financial year 2019-20, the data shows.It shows Delhi prisons spent an average of Rs 5.70 on education and vocational training of each of its prisoners in the financial year 2019-2020 and Rs 62.73 on their clothing the whole year.Delhi prisons stood second when it came to the total expenditure of Rs 310.02 crore incurred on its inmates in the financial year 2019-2020. Uttar Pradesh was on top with a total expenditure of Rs 349.55 crore and Haryana was in third place with Rs 272.62 crore.The data shows Delhi prison’s expenditure break-up was Rs 32.65 crore spent on food, Rs 11 lakh spent on prisoner’s clothing, 1 lakh on their education and Rs 16.98 crore on their health care.Director general Goel said the expenses on education was low because the expenses of those inmates who express interest in studying further are taken care of by the National Institute of Open Schooling and Indira Gandhi National Open University. “They bear all the expenses related to education,” he said.Goel said they have computers in every jail. “NGOs visit our jails and help inmates learn. In Jail number 5, for inmates in the age group of 18-21 years, we have a school to engage them in activities that focus in transforming them,” Goel said.Goel said medical expenses are high as they have an advanced medical facility available in jail for every prisoner. “We have in every jail a dispensary with doctors round the clock. We have two hospitals in the Tihar complex and one in Mandoli. Apart from this, we have a pathology lab for basic diagnosis. If required, patients are referred to other hospitals,” Goel said.Gupta said more than 80% of jails’ population comes from the lower economic strata, whose monthly income is less than Rs 8,000. “About 40% of them are illiterate. Because IGNOU and NIOS take care of major expenses, the jail administration only teaches the illiterate prisoners who express interest in learning. Therefore the expenses incurred are minimal like those on basic stationery,” he said.Another reason why the medical expenses are high was that most of the inmates from the lower economic backgrounds suffer from ailments such as tuberculosis, cancer and even AIDS, Gupta said .“Delhi prisons has more than 100 doctors and para-medical staff. Their salaries and allowances form a major part of expenditure,” Gupta said.Apart from these expenses, a sum of Rs 17 lakh was spent on welfare activities and Rs 260.12 crore on other services. These other expenses may include money spent on sanitation, hygiene, on transport facilities for the movement of prisoners during remand, trials, transfers and to hospital etc., the data says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-prisons-are-most-crowded-spend-more-on-food-clothing-ncrb-data/story-PqLYipaF0BWk7kRz4QsBIL.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Back in action, Metro Police ask for reinforcements||For the first time in its history, the Delhi Metro police have asked the headquarters for additional forces to enforce Covid-19 rules with the Centre allowing Metro train operations in a graded manner from September 7.While the Central Industrial Security Force ensures security from the checking point onwards, the Delhi Police is responsible for security from the entrance to the checking point. So, the Metro Police can also impose fines in their jurisdiction.Further, the Delhi Police is also responsible for investigating crimes that take place inside the Metro station premises or trains.“We have written to the police headquarters to request eight companies of police,” said Jitendra Mani Tripathi, deputy commissioner of police (Metro).Tripathi said additional forces were necessitated after repeated meetings with other Metro stakeholders — the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the police forces of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.“It was decided that only about 200 metro station gates will be opened, out of around 900. We will have to deploy two to four police personnel at each of these stations to control the crowd,” said the officer.An increased number of police personnel will also be deployed at 30 busy stations and interchanges, apart from the 23 Metro police booths, which are expected to receive a large number of complaints against passengers not wearing masks or flouting social distancing norms.“We have also written to the district police to help with deployment outside Metro stations if the situation turns unruly,” said Tripathi.From March 22 till mid-August, the Metro police have registered just 1,200 cases compared to about 3,000 in the corresponding period last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-five-months-with-little-to-guard-metro-police-looks-for-reinforcements/story-jcTEV45Gw2JIYQOw0ZQaWO.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Metro stations in red zones not likely to open on Day 1||Metro stations in containment zones and a few other places may not immediately open when the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) restarts train operations from September 7, according to Unlock 4.0 guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Sunday. The minister said tokens might not be issued initially, and only those with smart cards could be allowed. He also said that to manage footfall and enforce social distancing and other measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi government will deploy home guards outside the stations. “We have discussed the opening of Delhi Metro and based on that, it has been decided that no tokens will be issued in Delhi Metro from September 7 until further orders. Also, not all Metro stations will open at once. Those in containment zones and a few others will not be opened immediately from the first day. The DMRC is currently preparing a list of stations, which will be opened based on footfall and other parameters. A list of stations where travel services are being restored will be made public soon,” Gahlot said.After five months with little to guard, Metro Police looks for reinforcementsWhile DMRC and CISF have prepared draft standard operating procedures, a final list of protocols for Metro travel will be issued by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (Mohua). Soon after the Centre announced that Metro operations will be allowed in a graded manner under Unlock 4.0, the ministry said a meeting of all metro rail bodies in the country will be held on September 1. WATCH: ‘Will live up to the challenge’: Delhi transport minister on metro resumption“All MDs have been asked to look into SOPs prepared by Mohua earlier in view of the current realities. All suggestions will be considered in the meeting and accordingly, SOPs will be finalised,” Mohua spokesperson Rajiv Jain said on Saturday.Gahlot said based on the SOPs issued by the ministry, the Delhi government will issue a formal order after careful consultations with Metro officials and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).He explained that other than containment zones, “only a few other metro stations will not operate”. “In our discussions with DMRC, it was found that ensuring social distancing and managing crowd will need a lot of manpower, which is not possible if each and every station is opened at once,” he said. As Metro reopens in a week, rickshaw-pullers feel their lives will get back on trackWhen asked about the deliberations with the Delhi government, the DMRC did not offer a comment.There are 264 Metro stations in Delhi and as on Sunday, there were 820 containment zones. The relaxations being announced by the Centre under unlock guidelines to gradually ease restrictions do not apply in containment zones. “Inside the Metro stations, CISF and Metro security staff will ensure social distancing and face masks. Outside the stations, the Delhi government will deploy civil defence volunteers. Anyone found without a mask will be fined. Inside the Metro, a distance of 1 metre will have to be maintained between people and seats will be marked accordingly,” the minister said.DMRC officials said the focus of the SOPs will be to effectively regulate crowd so as to ensure that only 50% of a station’s commuter footfall capacity is allowed at a given time.To be sure, before the Covid-19 lockdown, Rajiv Chowk Metro station witnessed a daily footfall of nearly 5 lakh passengers, which means that at any given hour around 20,000 to 21,000 passengers were on the station premises. Now, to provide ample space for passengers to maintain social distancing, only 8,000 to 10,000 passengers will be allowed inside the station at any given hour. For enforcing the rule, DMRC will assign supervisors who will keep a tab on the footfall and help regulate entry. Anuj Dayal, executive director, DMRC, said, “In the coming days, we shall focus on the preparations for the eventual resumption of services. Aspects such as the implementation of hygiene-related protocols, sensitisation of staff and other functional requirements, etc., will be looked into as per the detailed SOPs that will be issued in consultation with the ministry. We shall try to provide the best possible services to our valued commuters.”A Metro official said regulation of crowd will be imperative, especially on the first 10 stations from the train’s point of origin. This is primarily because passengers usually do not alight immediately after boarding from a terminal, and it is only after the first 10 stations that the entry-exit balance is attained, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-metro-stations-may-not-open-says-delhi-minister-sops-yet-to-be-finalised/story-747aa7O4rO435fEI2XA2oK.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Daily ridership in Delhi’s buses down 59% since March||The daily ridership in state-run buses in the national Capital has declined by nearly 59% since March this year and the ticket earnings of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) have dropped by 73%, data shared by the city administration showed.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said there has been “a massive decline” in ridership in the government’s DTC and cluster buses despite there being a “huge demand” due to the Delhi Metro being shut for over five months.“Not just that, our transport utilities continue to face losses despite Delhi now having the biggest fleet of buses in 10 years. This is because of the existing cap of 20 passengers per bus as advised by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for maintaining social distance inside buses,” Gahlot said.Data showed that in March this year, DTC and cluster buses together carried over 3.2 million passengers every day, which went down to 1.3 million in August, largely due to the 20-passenger limit.Similarly, the earnings through tickets for the DTC dropped by almost Rs 167 crore during the months of March, April, May and June when compared to the same period in the year 2019. The loss was highest in May when DTC’s ticket revenue dropped to just Rs 1.91 crore from Rs 56.92 crore earned in the same month last year.The combined DTC and cluster bus fleet in Delhi currently stands at over 6,100 - the highest in nearly a decade. It was during the 2010 Commonwealth Games that Delhi had last operated around 6,000 buses.The transport minister, however, said the situation is likely to improve once the Delhi Metro opens from September 7 based on the Unlock 4 guidelines issued by the Central government on Saturday.“We hope the problem of crowding at bus stops will be resolved to some extent with the opening of the Delhi Metro. Tomorrow (Monday), there is a high-level meeting to discuss how the Unlock 4 guidelines will be enforced in Delhi. It is likely that all Metro stations will not be opened to manage the crowds and ensure proper social distancing and sanitisation,” Gahlot said.After being shut for 55 days since March due to the nation-wide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), DTC and cluster buses resumed services from May 19. But with the Delhi Metro still being shut, buses have been the lone mass transit option available for a city of nearly 20 million people. The consequence has been long waiting times at bus stops, where people are hardly able to keep the suggested six feet distance from one another. Gahlot said that a proposal to run DTC and cluster buses to full capacity was placed before the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on August 19, but it was rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/daily-ridership-down-59-ticket-sales-73-in-delhi-s-buses-shows-govt-data/story-xL7a30Xe8YSIZ2iQPc3mPL.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Last-mile lifeline for rickshaws with Delhi Metro set to resume||Umesh Chand was on his way home on Saturday when, at about 9 pm, he got a call from a relative, informing him that Metro trains would restart soon. He immediately confirmed the news on his mobile phone. For the past few days, Chand, a rickshaw-puller, had been thinking of returning to his village as his income had dipped drastically. “I used to make Rs 600 every day; these days I am lucky if I make Rs 150. Getting passengers has been a struggle after the Metro closed. Now that the Metro is reopening, I will stay back in Delhi,” says Chand, sitting in his rickshaw at the Moolchand Metro Station, right next to a signboard that marks the area as a ‘halt-and-go’ parking space for cycle and auto-rickshaws. He was the only rickshaw-puller in the parking, which had been overtaken by cars belonging to customers of a popular paratha joint at the station, which is doing brisk business. “Before Metro stopped its services, this parking used to have more than 100 rickshaws, all parked in a queue, waiting for passengers, and they never had to wait for more than a few minutes. Rickshaw-pullers in Delhi cannot survive without the Metro,” says Chand, who is from Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh and has been pulling a rickshaw in the city for almost 12 years. Also Read: Metro stations in red zones not likely to open on Day 1Talk to any rickshaw-puller in the city – there are about 600,000 of them, most of them seasonal migrants from UP and Bihar — and they will tell you how their lives came to a halt and their income fell by nearly 80% after the Metro suspended its services in March due to the coronavirus crisis. The rickshaw-pullers who earlier used to make anything between 500 and 700 per day, now barely made Rs 100-150, with the wait for passengers stretching for hours. Gone were the long queues of rickshaw-pullers at Metro stations, which ensured a steady flow of passengers throughout the day. The fate of the humble rickshaw in the Capital has been closely tied to the Delhi Metro ever since it came to the city. No wonder then, with the Metro announcing on Saturday that it would restart its operations from September 7, rickshaw-pullers feel their lives too would be back on track soon. Sujit Kumar,28, another rickshaw puller at the Moolchand Metro station, says the Metro ensured he never had to bother about where to find passengers. Every morning at 8, he would come to the station and for the next three hours, he would be busy taking commuters to and fro without a break. “ But today, I keep moving from Defence Colony to Andrews Ganj to the Amar Colony market in search of passengers, and consider myself lucky if I find one,” says Kumar. When the lockdown happened in March, Kumar, who is from a village in Bihar’s Katihar, pedalled to his home town, covering over 1,500km, in his rickshaw. He came back in the last week of July and rented a rickshaw. “ I had heard the news that the Metro was reopening, but unfortunately, it did not,” says Kumar, who returned by train, leaving his own rickshaw behind. In his village, many others who pulled rickshaws in Delhi stayed back, saying they would come back when the Metro starts. “Today, I called them to say the Metro is starting. But they were doubtful and said they would come only after it actually restarts. Metro ensures a steady income to us.” Also Read: Back in action, Metro Police ask for reinforcementsA 2012 study tilled ‘Urban Transportation Infrastructure and Poverty Reduction: Delhi Metro’s Impact on the Cycle Rickshaw Rental Market’ by Kurosaki Takashi, a professor at the Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, Japan, said the Delhi Metro increased the demand for traditional transport services such as cycle rickshaws, resulting in the higher total number of rickshaw-pullers and higher income at lower working hours per day. More than 70% of rickshaw pullers — in a sample of 1320 — said they prefer to work near a Metro station because either there are more customers or each customer pays a higher amount for the ride. Mukesh Singh, a rickshaw-puller in Patel Nagar, testifies to it. “ When the Metro was running, most of my passengers were office-goers. Now only locals take my rickshaw to visit markets. I get Rs 15 for a ride that earlier got me Rs 30. And I have no option but to accept it,” Singh says. In fact, one can see only a few rickshaws at the Patel Nagar Metro Station, which used to witness fights over parking space between rickshaw-pullers and e- rickshaw drivers. “ While my income has gone down four times, I continue to pay the same rent, Rs 50 a day, for my rickshaw,” says Singh, adding that the Patel Nagar Metro station was like his ‘workplace’, where he would come by 9 am and leave by 12 midnight when the doors of the Metro closed. “Now I leave the house at 11 am and generally wait for passengers in the nearby markets and return home by 6 pm, my earning barely crossing Rs 150,” says Singh, who is from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh. Introduced in Delhi in the 1940s, cycle rickshaws were seen as a major technological advancement over the hand-pulled rickshaws. Vighnesh Jha, founder of FORPA (Federation of Rickshaw pullers Association), an umbrella body of rickshaw-puller associations, says there were about 800,000 rickshaws in Delhi until 2012, but their numbers almost reduced by half over the past few years because of the growing popularity of e-rickshaws. Jha credits the Metro with driving the income of rickshaw-pullers by creating the need for last-mile connectivity in Delhi. “ When there was no Metro, hardly anyone talked about last-mile connectivity. Those who used DTC buses generally walked to their bus stand because unlike a Metro station, which could be 1 to 3km from their house, bus stands were always a couple of hundred metres,” says Jha. “Over the years, Metro stations became rickshaw hubs where rickshaw-pullers parked their rickshaws, important in a city that has no parking stands for cycle rickshaw and no minimum fares.” Rajendra Ravi, founder, Institute For Democracy And Sustainability, a Delhi-based non-government organisation, which fights for the cause of green transport, says rickshaws in Delhi are also a source of what he calls ‘invisible mobility’ during the hard lockdown. “When no transport was available, many families and senior citizens used rickshaw- pullers, who fetched grocery and medicines for them. Most rickshaw-pullers work in a particular area, and so many locals know them personally. Many people used them to distribute essentials to the needy,” says Ravi, adding that there has been a symbiotic relationship between the cycle rickshaw and the Metro. “ Cycle rickshaws helped the world-class transport such as Metro by being an important feeder service and the Metro helped them get passengers,” says Ravi, a social urban planner. Also Read: Will ensure people maintain social distance on Delhi Metro: Transport minister Kailash GahlotIn the last 15 years, he says, cycle rickshaws have figured in all urban transport policy and plans, all of which have recognised their role in employment generation and sustainable transport. The Delhi Master plan 2021 and the National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP 2006) emphasised the promotion of non-motorised modes (cycles and cycle rickshaws) of transportation in cities, acknowledging that the rickshaws provided employment to a large number of unskilled workers in the city. “The time has come to modernise cycle rickshaws and formally integrate them into our urban transport system,” says Ravi. Prof Avilash Roul, principal scientist at Indo-German Center for Sustainability, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, feels the pandemic has provided an opportunity for planned integration of rickshaws into public transport in Delhi. “ Like the bike-sharing system, cycle rickshaws should be integrated into the city’s public transport system. It is a good idea to introduce dial-a-cycle-rickshaw service, ” says Roul. “ I feel cycle rickshaws can also be part of a planned post- pandemic poverty alleviation and livelihood programme.” In the meanwhile, Radhey Shayam Verma, 29, a rickshaw-puller near the Mayur Vihar Metro station, calls up a few people who used to regularly take his rickshaw. “ Metro stations allowed me to make personal connections with many people in the area. But some of my regular customers have started using their own cars. They said they would use my services when the Metro restarts. Since it is starting now, I wanted to ask if they are coming,” says Verma, wearing a mask. Verma, who hails from Kanpur and has studied up to the 11th standard, keeps a small bottle of sanitiser in his pocket. “I have a small child at home and cannot afford to fall sick. These days, I do not allow more than one person in my rickshaw. One of my passengers told me that rickshaws, which are mostly open, are safer than closed auto and taxis.

31-08-2020||Delhi||School vs Covid-19: Voluntary class option divides parents, teachers||Principals, teachers and parents in Delhi have expressed mixed views over the central government’s ‘unlock 4’ guidelines that allow students of classes 9 to 12 to visit schools on a voluntary basis from September 21 to seek academic guidance. Many school authorities said the move, if implemented taking all precautions, will help students, specifically those who do not access to online education. But parents are still apprehensive about the safety of their children.Schools across the country have been physically shut since March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Classes are conducted online, and links to online study material are sent via WhatsApp, emails and SMS. The Unlock 4 guidelines issued by the union ministry of home affairs on Saturday said schools will continue to remain closed till September 30. At the same time, it stated, “Students of class 9 to 12 may be permitted to visit their schools, in areas outside the containment zones only, on a voluntary basis, for taking guidance from their teachers. This will be subject to written consent from their parents/guardians and will be permitted with effect from September 21, 2020, for which SoPs will be issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.”Govt schools step up efforts to bring kids back to classThe guidelines said the states and union territories may permit up to 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff to be called to the schools at a time after September 21.WATCH | Unlock 4: States’ lockdown power curbed; 1st step to school reopeningOfficials at government schools said students will benefit. Dr Devindar, principal of Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya (SBV) in Rouse Avenue, said, “It will be really helpful if teachers can hold sessions for students to clear doubts. It’ll be more significant for Board students since teachers have to brief them about the pattern of the exams. It is still unsafe to allow students of primary and upper primary classes to schools,” he said.Government teachers said students who were not being able to attend online classes due to the lack of devices or internet facilities would get better guidance if allowed to visit schools. Manish Bhatia, who teaches mathematics at a government school in Subhash Nagar, said, “For subjects such as mathematics, face-to-face teaching is vital in case of many students. I teach class 10 students and many of my students need extra attention since they do not have anyone at home who can help them in studies. It’s a welcome step to call students for guidance at schools with proper precautions. We are yet to hear anything from the Delhi government on this.”US coronavirus cases approach 6 million as Midwest, schools face outbreaksA senior official at the Delhi government’s education department said a decision may be taken on Monday. “A meeting will be held on Monday to discuss the unlock 4 guidelines. The guidelines regarding schools will be discussed at length with all stakeholders. We will have to analyse how many schools are in containment zones,” the official said.Authorities at private schools said majority of their students are already attending online classes. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “Our students are very well-connected with their teachers remotely. We are conducting online sessions regularly just to clear doubts. But if the government directs us, then we will allow students to visit schools with all precautions. It’s anyway voluntary.”Some private schools, however, raised concerns over the safety of students. Himachal schools told to submit report on Covid prevention arrangementsAmita Wattal, principal of Springdales Schools in Pusa Road, said, “The school can keep their premises open, safe and secure. But the decision of sending students to schools totally depends on their parents. The schools won’t ask anyone to come because we cannot take guarantee of the safety of students amid the pandemic.”Parents of both private and government school students expressed different opinions. Jai Prakash, a carpenter and father of a class 10 student at a government school in Vishwas Nagar, said, “I think it’s a good option for students if they want to go and clear some doubts. We had to arrange tuition for him since schools have been shut.”Aparajitha Gautam, president of Delhi Parents Association and mother of a class 12 student at a private school, said she won’t send her daughter to school amid the pandemic. Unlock 4: Some educational institutes allowed to open, states can call 50% of staff“She is attending online classes and accessing online material. The guidelines can be significant for the students of government schools where majority of the students do not have access to digital education. But the question is how well the government schools are prepared. Also, the government should make sure that the private schools should not interpret this option as a reopening of campuses and charge extra fees from the students,” she said.A few students HT spoke to had mixed feelings about the order. Darshan Ram, a class 12 student at Bluebells School International in Kailash Colony, said his parents will not be comfortable in sending him to the school amid a pandemic. “Visiting teachers and the school on a voluntary basis comes with its own risks too. I don’t think students themselves would want to take risks,” he said.Vaishnavi, a class 11 student at a government girls senior secondary school in Yamuna Vihar, however, said it will be helpful for her if she gets a chance to visit school even once a week. “It’s become very challenging to study some subjects like Mathematics and Physics with the help of online study material the school sends us on WhatsApp. I’ll definitely visit the school and get all my doubts clear if I get a chance,” she said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-4-principals-teachers-parents-divided-over-allowing-students-of-classes-9-to-12-to-visit-schools-for-guidance/story-ZpAsGnqUjdor7PUaHQRQnK.html
31-08-2020||Pune||Pandharpur police barricade roads leading to the temple||The local administration at Pandharpur has put up checkpoints at entry and exit points to the temple town while barricading the roads leading to Vitthal temple in view of Monday’s agitation by Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). The Vanchit Bahijan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar has threatened to enter into famous temple along with other devotees. Several warkari organisations (pilgrims) have extended their support to VBA agitation that demands the opening of religious places across Maharashtra. According to Solapur superintendent of police Manoj Patil, notices have been issued to VBA workers. “We have served them notices under section 149 of CrPC. We have also barricaded streets leading to temple in order to prevent anyone visiting the religious place,” Patil said. The notices asked protestors not to break the law. To prevent anyone entering into the temple town, state transport bus service has been suspended in Pandharpur for a day. Since March 25, all the places of worship across the state have been closed for devotees in view of Covid pandemic. However, there is a growing chorus from various sectors for the opening of temples and other religious places. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday staged ghatna-nad (bell ringing) agitation across the state pressing the demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pandharpur-police-barricade-roads-leading-to-the-temple/story-noS9TY3pHJVolxtY90VZiN.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Legendary cardio specialist Dr Sivaramakrishna Iyer Padmavati dies of Covid-19 at 103||Pioneering cardiologist Dr Sivaramakrishna Iyer Padmavati, who had established the country’s first cardiac care unit at Delhi’s Govind Ballabh Pant hospital, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) late Saturday night. She was 103. Born in Myanmar, she fled to India after the Japanese invasion during World War II and became the country’s first woman cardiologist. She was diagnosed with Covid-19 11 days ago and was admitted to the National Heart Institute (NHI), which she had founded in 1981. “Although on oxygen, she was fairly stable till Saturday morning when there was an acute drop in the oxygen saturation. She had to be put on a ventilator and passed away at night. Even though her body had given up on her – she was wheelchair bound for the last five years – she was mentally very sharp and put us to shame. She remembered who had inaugurated our centre and other information,” said Dr OP Yadav, chief cardiac surgeon and CEO of NHI. Popularly referred to as the ‘Godmother of cardiology’, she is known for her extensive research on rheumatic heart disease, a condition that permanently damages the heart valves when infections such as strep throat or scarlet fever are left untreated or undertreated. Those who have interacted with her talk of her mental acuity. “I met her four years ago, when our department completed 50 years of establishment. We decided to honour her. At the time, she said she just wants a boy – she meant a young cardiologist – who could help her out for a couple of hours each afternoon. When we asked, she said she needed to do more research work. At the time, she was just shy of a 100 years,” said Dr Vijay Trehan, professor of cardiology at GB Pant hospital, where she established India’s first speciality course in cardiology. Padmavati did her MBBS from Rangoon Medical College and trained at Sodersjukhuset hospital in Stockholm, John Hopkins and Harvard Medical School in USA. She was a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London and has received the India’s civilian awards Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/legendary-cardio-specialist-dr-sivaramakrishna-iyer-padmavati-dies-of-covid-at-103/story-XYGFBcz9oGq8Qj9j0o0xzL.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Bureau of Civil Aviation Security flags fake boarding pass risk||Soon, any boarding pass printed or downloaded more than once will have “duplicate” mentioned on it — a step aviation security authorities said was essential to avoid misuse of such passes. Bar code scanners used at the airports to check boarding passes will also be upgraded to be able to catch any modifications made in the travel document to prevent forgery, officials aware of the development, said.The measures have been taken by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) in the wake of airlines and airport operators promoting self check-ins and use of e-boarding passes for passengers, after the Covid-19 lockdown, in order to ensure contactless travel.In one of its recent circulars, BCAS has warned airlines, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and airport operators about the possibilities of boarding pass forgery. The bureau has directed agencies concerned to come up with solutions and establish a “fail-proof passenger movement system”.In its circular, accessed by Hindustan Times, BCAS has said, “Passengers with ill intentions may falsify their bar coded boarding passes by changing the flight number or class of service. They may also print two copies of the bar coded boarding pass and pass one to a friend or even create a counterfeit bar coded boarding pass”.It further said that technical solutions shall be incorporated in the process by concerned aircraft operators.A senior CISF officer from the Delhi airport said barcode scanners currently used are basic ones. “Because of e-boarding passes the risk of forgery is higher now. BCAS has suggested upgrade of scanners to the ones that will also catch any modifications and will be able to identify if the print out or the e-copy of boarding pass has been doctored. It has also asked airlines to write ‘duplicate’ on any boarding pass that is printed more than once . This will help us identify people travelling on duplicate boarding passes and we can re-verify their credentials to make sure the traveller is genuine,” the officer said, wishing not to be named.While Air India said it will comply with all the protocols and norms specified by BCAS, IndiGo said all their boarding passes are in synchronization with the airline’s Reservation and Passenger Servicing System.“These boarding passes have International Air Transport Association recommended barcode. All such boarding passes are reconciled electronically against Passenger Servicing System. This process takes care of potential risk that it may cause due to forged barcode, forged boarding pass or due to multiple copies of boarding passes,” an airline spokesperson said.IndiGo, however, said it is in process of upgrading their system to print “duplicate” on the boarding passes.BCAS, in its circular, has also said that the airport operator shall work in coordination with aircraft operators and CISF/police so that a synchronized system is established for movement of passengers right from the entry gate to kiosks generating boarding passes to security checkpoints and to the boarding gate or ladder point.Delhi International Airport Ltd (Dial), that operates Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, did not respond to requests for a comment on the issue. Former CISF director general, Arvind Ranjan said as banks continuously keep improving their software for enhanced security, a similar system can be introduced. “So every time a passenger prints the boarding pass, the information is shared with agencies concerned. The airlines and airport operators will need to upgrade their system and engage experts to build devices that are fail proof,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bcas-wants-fail-proof-passenger-movement-system-at-igi/story-91DLArxE2aAzV7uJK8g4DK.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Strong winds provide respite from humidity||Hot and sweltry conditions of Saturday made way for gusty winds a day later, which helped pull the temperature down and keep the weather pleasant on Sunday.While light rainfall was observed in some parts of the city, gusty winds brought down the day temperature by at least three notches.On Sunday, the day (maximum) temperature was recorded at 31.4 degrees Celsius, which is three notches below the season’s average, the night (minimum) temperature settled at 26.7 degrees Celsius. A day earlier on Saturday, the day temperature had settled at 35 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal. The night temperature was 24.8 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that on Saturday, the heat and a sense of discomfort was felt mainly because of high humidity levels and the bright sun due to the absence of a cloud cover. According to IMD officials, the winds were recorded at a speed of 30-40kmph, which were mainly responsible for bringing the mercury down. “The winds were mainly because of cyclonic circulation in northwest Madhya Pradesh and northeast Rajasthan. The winds are likely to blow on Monday as well, however, the speed will slow down to 20-25 kmph,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. Safdarjung Observatory, which is considered the representative of Delhi’s weather, recorded only ‘traces’ of rainfall, Aya Nagar weather station received 1.6 mm rainfall, Lodhi Road also recorded traces, while Palam received 0.9 mm rain. Delhi Ridge did not record any rainfall at all. “The monsoon trough is southwards near South Rajasthan. Very light rain or drizzle is expected over the next two days. However, a good spell of rainfall is expected to hit Delhi between September 2 and 3 when the trough will be close to the northern region,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-strong-winds-provide-respite-from-humidity/story-XQSHkLRhSqoaEMnsRODISI.html
31-08-2020||Delhi||Immunisation outreach to resume in September||To increase routine immunisation that had taken a hit due to Covid-19, the Delhi government has decided to restart the outreach campaigns and camps with the help of Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) and Anganwadi workers September onwards. The activities had been halted when the nationwide lockdown had been announced in March-end. As compared to July last year, only 70% of vaccines were administered under the routine immunisation programme last month. “Our data shows in July we saw 70% vaccination as compared to the same month last year. With the lockdown being eased and travel becoming easier, the number of vaccines administered had started picking up over the last couple of months,” , according to senior officials from the health department. “The immunisation programme had taken a severe hit in April right after the lockdown. In fact, as per the health ministry advisory we should not have immunised children anywhere in Delhi as the entire city had been categorised as red zone. But, we continued immunising those who came to the dispensaries outside of the containment zones. We had stopped actively motivating people to come to the centres to get vaccinated or holding camps in the Anganwadi centres,” the official said. Delhi women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Singh Gautam said that the each of the 10,000 Anganwadi centres in Delhi will start conducting one camp each month to ensure every child in the area gets vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-immunisation-outreach-to-resume-in-september-after-dipping-to-70-in-july/story-xBwP53T3gpoIdaRG5kgd1I.html
31-08-2020||Pune||City Covid-related death toll at 2,532||The progressive positive count of the city breached the one lakh mark on Sunday after the state health department reported 1,663 fresh cases. The total progressive positives stand at 1,00,236. The city is now only 44,390 cases short of reporting as many cases as in Mumbai, which had been one of the worst affected cities by the Covid-19 pandemic. Pune’s case fatality rate stands at 2.34% and while Mumbai seems to be stabilising in the number of cases being reported, Pune is staring at increasing numbers daily. Pune district has reported the maximum active cases in the country and is now also reporting the highest single-day deaths. In addition, Pune city is now on the radar of health experts as it has crossed the one lakh grim and despite several measures by the administration to curb the spread of the virus, which included declaring the entire city as a containment zone, the cases are increasing. The district health office reported that 76,686 people have recovered till date and there are 15,544 active cases in Pune Municipal Corporation of which 7,835 are in hospital isolation and 7,709 are in home isolation. Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 in the district said that if the existing conditions are followed religiously, then, it would be possible to control the spread of the virus, however, the careless attitude of citizens is leading to the rise in cases. He added, “It is true that people are not serious enough when it comes to Covid-19 now. The fear which was earlier there during the start of the pandemic does not exist now. We often see people roaming about without masks and violating social distancing norms. The district collector has now passed new orders which empowers the police to penalise such people.”Dr Bharat Purandare, infectious disease expert from Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “This is the natural curve of the virus in any pandemic. We are following the same trend that Mumbai or Delhi followed earlier which Pune is now following. The other metro cities will follow the lead. Only the vaccine can help us come out of the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-city-breaches-one-lakh-covid-19-case-mark/story-5B52UphymEdTJBXZg6NgKL.html

31-08-2020||Pune||10 per cent of BDP zone’s hill land encroached upon, says Pune civic body||It has been two years since the state government had decided to preserve the biodiversity park (BDP) zone or hills in Pune. However, as Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) failed to acquire any land, there is rampant illegal construction underway in the zone.To prevent construction activity on hills falling under the BDP zone in 23 merged villages adjoining the municipal limits, the state government on August 18, 2018, decided to protect them by giving eight per cent transfer of development rights (TDR) as compensation to landowners for acquiring 773 hectares of land falling under the biodiversity park area.TDR allows the original owner of the land to use the rights at another designated location.As per the civic estimates, at least 10 per cent of the total land has been illegally encroached through unauthorised constructions, said PMC corporator Sachin Dodke, who represents Warje area.“There is around 10 per cent encroachment on hills. If the civic body offers better compensation to landowners, it can acquire the land and in turn, save hills. Currently, as per the norms, the compensation is offered for only eight per cent of total land,” said Dodke.Another senior officer from PMC requesting anonymity accepted that huge encroachment is going on the lands reserved for BDP. “Slums are coming up on the hills while some owners divided plots into 1,000 square feet and sold out illegally,” he said.When asked, city engineer Prashant Waghmare said, the PMC will act against illegal construction on BDP zone.Unauthorised construction is not the only issue. Officials and elected representatives alleged that BDP has created many issues in the city as PMC’s development works have been affected. Many roads passing through BDP areas have been affected as the owners are not ready to hand over their land as per the compensation decided by the government.The proposed multi-storey flyover project located at Chandani chowk has become the latest victim as the land required for the project also falls in BDP and therefore the process had delayed.According to Waghmare, the civic body has submitted a proposal to state government for getting the government land though there has been no progress over it.“We have submitted a proposal to various government departments including forest and revenue to first handover land in their possession. There has been no progress in the land acquisition process which is owned by private owners,” said Waghmare.Vikas Dangat, NCP leader and former councillor in PMC, said, “I own 20 acres of land which is falling in the BDP. As my area is big, I did not sell it and I would not hand it over to the PMC as the compensation is very less. No other landowner would give their land to the civic body. Instead of that they would sell the small plots and allow encroachment on their land.”The concept of the biodiversity park is unique to India and was introduced in the Pune city under which PMC had made the reservation on the hills in surrounding areas and not allowed construction on it. Most of the lands on the hills are owned by private people and they are demanding the civic body to allow construction on it.“It is a wrong policy to not allowing the construction on hills. Either the government should give handsome compensation or if the present policy continues Pune will one day have big slums everywhere like Dharavi,” said former mayor Datta Dhankawade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-per-cent-of-bdp-zone-s-hill-land-encroached-upon-pmc/story-h1PfvdWySViaPLEBsPro7J.html
31-08-2020||Pune||Ganeshotsav 2020 less noisy than last year: MPCB||The city has seen a less noisy Ganeshotsav this year as compared to 2019 because of the Covid lockdown restrictions. The Maharastra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) officials have, however, recorded high ambient noise levels at some areas this year also. MPCB, every year, records noise levels of city areas during the 10-day Ganpati celebrations. “The noise levels at some areas this year were still high despite the lockdown restrictions even as DJ music or dhol-tasha celebrations were absent during the immersion processions,” said Pratap Jagtap, sub-regional officer, MPCB. According to an MPCB officer, the readings at some areas were high this year as ambient noise also includes traffic density. “We have been measuring noise decibels at 18 spots across the city and the average reading is between minimum 50 dB (A) above ambient noise and maximum 79.7 dB (A),” he said. MPCB recorded noise levels on August 22 , August 23 , August 26 and August 28. The next recording will be on the last day of immersions (September 1). The reading are taken between 6pm and 12 midnight. The Maharashtra police have issued guidelines that noise levels at a public place shall not “exceed 10 decibels dB(A) above the ambient noise standard for the area or 75dB(A) whichever is lower.” As per the noise pollution rules, the permissible levels in silence zones, during the day is 50dB, while in residential areas it is 55dB. For high traffic areas and industrial areas, the levels can go as high as 65dB. According to the MPCB findings, the maximum noise level was recorded in Yerawada (bear Gunjan theatre) with ambient sound average recorded at 79.7 dB(A) while the lowest noise level was recorded in Kothrud at 55.9 dB(A). “The officials take reading every ten minutes and an average is derived after compiling it,” said Jagtap. Mangesh Dighe, environment officer, PMC said, “Although the festival was celebrated with simplicity, one cannot remove the ambient noise of traffic while recording noise levels. One can say that noise pollution was less this year with no loud noise of DJ music and high-powered speaker walls due to the Covid-19 situation.” The 18 designated spots that MPCB monitors are Shivajinagar near Sakhar Sankul (75.7 dB); Karve road, Nal Stop (76.2 dB); Swargate, Tilak road (76.1 dB); Satara road, Balajinagar (73.3 dB); Shaniwar peth, near Shaniwarwada (73.2 dB); Shagun chowk on Laxmi road (74.1 dB); Mahatma Phule mandai (69.2 dB); Vegetable mandai in Hadapsar (73.1 dB); Parvati (68.0 dB); Koregaon Park (62.7 dB); Khadki bazar (73.8 dB); MG Road at Babajan chowk (65.8 dB); SPPU road chowk (69 dB); Aundh Parihar chowk (57.3 dB); Vishrantwadi (69.4 dB) and Sarasbaug near Mitra Mandal chowk (68.6 dB). In 2019, the MPCB readings at Mandai near Shanipar area was 88 dB, Laxmi road (92 dB); Karve road (96.6 dB), Kothrud (92.8 dB). The lowest noise level was recorded at Shivajinagar at 73.4 dB. According to MPCB, in 2016, the highest noise level of 109.3 dB(A) was recorded at Mahatma Phule mandai on September 5. The noise levels were high because idols were taken to mandaps and traffic congestion. The September 15 (last day of immersion) readings at Shivajinagar area was 86.0 dB(A), Karve road 94.5 dB(A), Swargate 90.0 dB(A), Satara road 90.8 dB(A), Shaniwar peth 91.9 dB(A), Yerawada 87.1 dB(A), Laxmi road 98.6 dB(A), Kothrud 94.1 dB(A) and Mahatma Phule mandai 109.3 dB(A). In 2017, out of the twenty locations monitored in Pune region, the highest noise level was observed at Koregaon Park with 90.9 dB(A). The increase in noise level was due to traffic and crowd. Shivajinagar recorded 79.1 dB(A), and Karve road 84.7 dB(A), Swargate 76.6 dB(A), Satara road 77.1 dB(A), Shaniwar peth 80.5 dB(A), Yerawada 81.1 dB(A), Laxmi road 82.9 dB(A) and Mahatma Phule mandai 85.8 dB(A). Eighteen locations were monitored during the Ganesh festival 2018. On September 13, Shivajinagar recorded highest level of noise with 91.1 dB(A). On September 14, Mahatma Phule mandai had the highest level of noise with 83.6 dB(A). On September 17, Vishrantwadi with 89 dB(A) had the highest noise level. On September 19 and September 23, Kothrud (near Shivaji putala) had the highest noise level with 89 dB(A) and 95.9 dB(A) respectively.

31-08-2020||Delhi||Govt schools step up efforts to bring kids back to class||Armed with a microphone and a loudspeaker, Ajay Arya, a Delhi government school teacher has been visiting colonies and slum clusters in parts of north east Delhi since last week, looking for students who are not in touch with their schools ever since the physical classes suspended in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In seven days, Arya, a 47-year-old physical education teacher at Rajkiya Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Kiran Vihar, traced around 100 such students who do not have smartphones or Internet facility at home and could not be reached out by any means.“Are there any students enrolled in government schools who neither attend online classes nor collect assignment sheets from schools that live here? I have a list of students who are not reachable on phone. Please help me locate them,” announces Arya on the microphone. After locating the address of a student, he counsels him/her and his/her parents about ongoing virtual learning in schools.Schools across Delhi have resorted to conducting online classes, sending links to study material via WhatsApp and emails and SMS after the Covid-19 pandemic, and an ensuing lockdown, forced them to physically shut down.The links are sent by the schools to the mobile phones of the parents of the students.Due to the existing digital divide, government and civic bodies run schools have also started giving hard copies of assignment sheets to students, who do not have digital devices.However, despite all efforts, many schools said that some students could not be reached out via phone calls, SMS and WhatsApp messages.From making door-to-door visits to find such students, to sending letters and assignments to their postal addresses, government schools in the national capital are making extra efforts to reach out to such students . For instance, Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in Tilak Nagar said that her school had formed area-wise teams of support staff and School Management Committee (SMC) members to search for students missing online classes.“Within a week of starting the drive (started last week) we managed to trace 50% of the 112 students who were completely out of contact. Our teachers took extra efforts and joined WhatApp groups of the feeder MCD schools of Class 6 students to connect with them,” she said.AK Jha, head of school at Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said his school has sent out letters to the postal address of students, who remained incommunicado. “We have managed to get in contact with 94% of our students ever since the online learning resumed after the summer break in July. We made several efforts such as sending staff members to their postal addresses and also sent letters to their permanent addresses in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as well. Despite all efforts, around 100 class 6 students are still out of contact,” he said.According to the principals, a majority of students who cannot be reached out are those who have shifted from MCD schools to Delhi government schools in class 6. “Either their phone numbers were not working or had changed. Around 30% of such students are yet to be traced ” said principal of government senior secondary school in Patel Nagar.Every year, around 1,00,000 students move from civic bodies run schools to Delhi government schools in class 6. MCD schools in Delhi offer education till class 5. Due to the prevailing pandemic this year, the induction of such students (around one lakh) happened online on the basis of names sent by municipal schools. The students and their parents could not visit the schools personally for the admission process unlike previous years.A senior official in Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia’s office, who wished not to be named, said, “Our teachers are making extra efforts to trace students. Overall 20-30% Class 6 students who have been shifted from MCD schools are still out of contact. Overall hardly 5-10% students will be there who are still not in touch.”Among those students who could not get in touch with their schools were the twins of a daily wage labourer Sukhdev Singh from north east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar. Singh said that he had lost his phone in February and could not afford to buy a new one after that. “I have been out of work since March and that’s why I could not buy a phone. We had left for our village in Bihar when the lockdown was announced in March. We returned earlier this month. I only got to know that my sons were transferred to Delhi government school after completing Class 5 from an MCD school after some teachers of their new school visited our home last week. We have now collected their books from the school,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/door-to-door-visits-public-announcements-delhi-govt-schools-making-extra-efforts-to-reach-out-to-students/story-yZ2U3fD2fUMhGtYQ5xWYfJ.html

All the vehicles were headed towards Mumbai, according to the highway control room official. Police inspector Sujata Tanaawade of Rasayani police station was among the officials who visited the spot. The injured were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. “There were two men in the Army gypsy. One of them has minor injuries, but the second one has some injuries on his head and was rushed to MGM hospital. The officials had taken the injured away and started the process of decongesting,” said assistant sub-inspector Namdev Doke of Rasayani police station. “In the Bhatan tunnel, the Gypsy was hit from the right rear side by a Maruti Swift car which led to the Gypsy drifting from lane 1 to lane 3. On lane 3, there was a Mahindra car which then rammed into the drifting Gypsy. The Mahindra car was followed by a truck which was followed by a small milk tempo that rammed into the truck. However, nobody else was injured besides the two in the Gypsy,” said ASI Doke.The damage to the vehicles is being recorded in an accident report at Rasayani police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-injured-as-four-vehicles-ram-into-each-other-on-pune-mumbai-expressway/story-dXTmWDN6bW3SO8nIpR1BVM.html
31-08-2020||World||US to provide military assistance if China attacks in South China Sea: Philippines||In a strong message to China, the Philippines have made it clear that it would turn to the US for military help during ongoing flare-ups between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea.Philippines Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said Manila would invoke its defence agreement with the US if China attacks its naval vessels in the disputed waters. “If something happens that is beyond incursion but is, in fact, an attack on say a Filipino naval vessel.....means then I call up Washington DC,” he added.Since 1951, the US and the Philippines have had a Mutual Defence Treaty that commits them to support each other in the event if either is attacked.The comments by the Philippines Foreign Secretary marks the first time President Rodrigo Duterte administration openly declaring its intention to side with the US against Chinese expansionist agenda.The Foreign Secretary said Manila would continue air patrols over the South China Sea despite Beijing calling it an illegal provocation.“They can call it an illegal provocation, you cannot change their minds. They already lost the arbitral award,” he said referring to the 2016 decision by an international tribunal that ruled against China’s expansive claims to the South China Sea.Locsin also said the US’ military presence in Asia is needed as the rivalry between Washington and Beijing has intensified. He added it would be in Philippine’s interest for the US to maintain its military presence in the region and he reiterated the country “never stopped cooperation” with its long-time security ally. “We have a balance of power situation, we need the US presence in Asia,” he stated.The two powers are arguing over issues from trade to what the US sees as aggressive moves by China’s armed forces, especially in the disputed South China Sea and around Chinese-claimed Taiwan.The US has long opposed China’s territorial claims on the South China Sea, regularly sending warships to demonstrate freedom of navigation there. It hardened its position last month by rejecting Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, a move which Beijing condemned.On August 24, Philippines Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana accused China of illegally occupying Filipino maritime territory and said, “China’s nine-dash line used to claim most of the South China Sea is a fabrication.” The remarks came amid a fresh row between both countries over the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which has been a flashpoint since long.The Philippines Foreign Ministry lodged a diplomatic protest last week over what it said was the illegal confiscation by China’s coastguard of fishing equipment near the shoal.China condemned patrols in the South China Sea and declared it’s beyond reproach and air patrols by the Philippines infringe on its sovereignty. Beijing defended the coast guard’s activities and urged Manila to immediately stop what it described as illegal provocations.Lorenzana made it clear that the area was within the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). “Their (China’s) so-called historical rights over an area enclosed by their nine-line does not exist except in their imagination,” he said.“Our fishermen are within our EEZ and likewise our ships and planes conduct patrol sorties within our area. They (China) are the ones who have been doing provocations by illegally occupying some features within our EEZ. Hence, they have no right to claim they are enforcing their laws,” he further added.In 2012, China had seized Scarborough from the Philippines following a tense stand-off. The shoal, one of the region’s richest fishing grounds, is located 240 kilometres west of Philippines’ main island of Luzon and 650 kilometres from the nearest major Chinese landmass, the southern island province of Hainan, is one of the region’s richest fishing grounds.China claims most of the sea, often invoking its so-called nine-dash line to justify its alleged historic rights to the key waterway that is also contested by the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Brunei. It rejected a 2016 UN-backed tribunal’s ruling that its claims were without legal basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-provide-military-assistance-if-china-attacks-in-south-china-sea-philippines/story-AfXrnunmq2Rgi1k1LxfS6H.html
31-08-2020||World||China blames India for tension in eastern Ladakh, demands withdrawal of Indian army||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Monday blamed the Indian army for the latest flare-up in tension at Pangong Tso near the line of actual control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and demanded that India withdraw its troops from the area.In a statement issued late on Monday evening, the PLA’s western theatre command (WTC) alleged Indian soldiers violated the LAC and crossed over in the south bank of Pangong Tso and the Reqin pass.It also warned that the PLA were taking “countermeasures”.The Chinese military statement did not refer to any ongoing meeting at the ground to douse the new flare-up.ALSO READ | Forget disengagement, China opens new front along LACOfficial news agency, Xinhua quoted WTC spokesperson Senior Colonel Zhang Shuili as saying “…on August 31, the Indian army broke the consensus reached at the previous multi-level talks between the two sides and illegally crossed the line again near the south bank of Pangong Lake and the Reqin pass, making a blatant provocation and causing tension at the border”.“China is strongly opposed to the Indian move, which grossly violates China’s territorial sovereignty, seriously undermines peace and stability in the China-India border areas, reneges on its commitments and betrays its loyalty,” Zhang said in the strongly-worded statement.Zhang said India should restrain its frontline troops and withdraw from the region.“We solemnly request the Indian side to immediately withdraw its illegal occupation and control forces, strictly control and restrain its frontline troops, earnestly abide by its commitments and avoid further escalation of the situation,” Zhang said.ALSO READ | Satellite imagery shows PLA building heliport at tri-junction of India, Bhutan and ChinaThe spokesperson further added: “The Chinese military is taking necessary countermeasures and will closely follow the developments to resolutely safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and peace and stability in border areas.”The tone of the military statement was similar to the statement that the WTC had issued on June 16, a day after the deadly clash at Galwan Valley near the LAC.The PLA statement from the military was issued hours after the Chinese foreign ministry said Chinese troops troops “strictly’’ abide by the LAC with India, refuting the Indian army’s statement that said the Chinese armed forces had carried out provocative military actions on the southern banks of the Pangong Tso.Responding to a question on the Indian army statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said the troops of the PLA never cross the line.“Chinese border troops always strictly abide by the LAC. They never cross the line. Border troops on the two sides have been in close communication regarding the issues on the ground,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.Asked about any ongoing meetings to resolve this new development, he said: “What I said is that the two sides through diplomatic and military channels maintain close communication. As to specific meetings and talks, if there is anything, we will release it in a timely manner”.Earlier in the day, the Indian army accused Chinese soldiers of trying to alter the status quo.The statement said Indian troops had been able to pre-empt the PLA from trying to change the facts on the ground.A Brigade Commander-level flag meeting is said to be in progress at Chushul to resolve the issues on the ground.There have been several meetings between the two sides to disengage after border troops clashed in Galwan Valley on June 15, which led to casualties on both sides.Chinese troops have been slow to pull back, particularly around Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km.The Chinese effort to enlarge the border row came just two days after the defence ministry in Beijing told India that it should look at the “big picture of bilateral ties” and work with it and take concrete steps to bring the relationship back on the “right track of normal development.”India has made it clear that China should work on complete disengagement, and then de-escalation of troops in eastern Ladakh, underlining that this can be achieved only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. The message from New Delhi has been that the Indian army will stay firm on Chinese efforts to alter the status quo and has stressed that the PLA will have to return to their April 20 position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-india-for-tension-in-eastern-ladakh-demands-withdrawal-of-indian-army/story-KHT5vAnPw2871sAbEMUKbK.html
31-08-2020||World||Newly designated Lebanese PM urges immediate reforms, IMF deal||Lebanon’s prime minister-designate Mustapha Adib called on Monday for the formation of a new government in record time and urged immediate reforms as a step towards securing an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.He spoke after being designated premier and hours before the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron, whose pressure on Lebanon’s fractious leaders was crucial to forging an agreement on Adib, Beirut’s ambassador to Berlin.“The opportunity for our country is small and the mission I have accepted is based on all the political forces acknowledging that,” Adib said after being designated by President Michel Aoun.Donor states wants Lebanon to carry out long-delayed reforms to stamp out state corruption and waste in order to release financial support. The previous government launched talks with the IMF in May but these stalled amid divisions on the Lebanese side over the scale of losses in the financial system.Adib said a new government must be formed in record time and reforms must be implemented immediately as “an entry point to an agreement with the IMF”.Forming governments in the past has often taken months of political horse trading.The previous government led by Hassan Diab quit on Aug. 10 in the aftermath of a catastrophic explosion at Beirut port that killed some 190 people.Macron, who arrives late on Monday for his second visit in less than a month, has led international efforts to push Lebanon to enact sweeping changes to address the economic crisis.With the economy on its knees, a swathe of Beirut in tatters and sectarian tensions rising, the former French protectorate faces the biggest threat to stability since a 1975-90 civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/newly-designated-lebanese-pm-urges-immediate-reforms-imf-deal/story-cUlxbmi4IZ4e5U7dZK84VJ.html
31-08-2020||World||Three killed, several hurt in two UAE restaurant blasts||Three people were killed and several others were injured on Monday in two separate explosions in the United Arab Emirates’ capital Abu Dhabi and its tourism hub Dubai, the police and local media said.The Abu Dhabi government media office said two people were killed in the blast in the capital, which the National daily reported had hit the KFC and Hardees restaurants on the city’s Rashid bin Saeed Street.The street is also known as a main road to the airport, where top aides to US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to land later on Monday, in a historic trip between Israel and another Arab country.The police said the Abu Dhabi incident also caused several minor and moderate injuries, and residents of the building and surrounding areas were evacuated. The Abu Dhabi government media office said the blast was caused by a “misalignment in the gas container fittings following refuelling”.Photos published on social and local media showed extensive damage to the two restaurants with a white plume of smoke rising from the ground floor of the building.In Dubai, one person was killed when a gas cylinder exploded in a restaurant early on Monday, local media reported. Abu Dhabi-owned The National newspaper, quoting a Dubai Civil Defence spokesperson, said the blast in Dubai had caused a blaze that damaged the ground floor of the building. The fire was controlled within 33 minutes, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-killed-several-hurt-in-two-uae-restaurant-blasts/story-mu36QNjTqe94fxO6xVFwfO.html
31-08-2020||World||PLA building heliport at tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China, shows satellite imagery||Open source satellite imagery has captured what appears to be a heliport China is building in close proximity to two new air defence positions that cover sensitive stretches of the disputed border in Doklam and Sikkim sectors. The imagery, shared by the open source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter, shows the suspected heliport under construction at the tri-junction of the borders of India, Bhutan and China, and at a distance of about 100 km from Doka La (Doka pass) and Naku La (Naku pass). “Suspected PLA heliport infrastructure spotted [as] part of an ongoing investigation near the #Doklam region of the #India #China #Bhutan tri junction, this support unit could sustain all weather & rapid troop deployments in the sector along with improving surveillance operations,” the analyst tweeted. The suspected heliport is located almost equidistant from the two sites at which the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing surface-to-air missile facilities, according to imagery tweeted earlier by @detresfa. Both the missile facilities are near what have been described as “suspected early warning radar sites” opposite Sikkim state. In a graphic posted on Twitter, @detresfa said the “steady build-up of support infrastructure by the People’s Liberation Army of China [near] areas with a history of clashes [and] disputed territorial claims demonstrates the long-term Chinese ambitions in these sectors”. “With the addition of a heliport along with area denial systems within 100 km from Doka La [and] Naku La, China would be able to sustain all weather operations in the disputed areas regardless of the harsh terrain [and] conditions,” according to the graphic. The new missile facilities are located roughly 50 km from Naku La (Naku pass), where troops from the two countries had clashed on May 9, and Doka La (Doka pass), close to the Doklam plateau that was the scene of a 73-day military standoff between India and China in 2017. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured in the clash at Naku La, the second such reported incident since the current standoff began in early May. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the reported development of the heliport and the missile sites by the Chinese. After the end of the Doklam standoff in 2017 following several rounds of negotiations, there were reports the Chinese side hadn’t fully pulled back its troops from the area. There were also reports that Chinese troops had built trenches, fortified positions and infrastructure to support operations by helicopters and aircraft in the area. Last month, Hindustan Times had first reported that China had officially stated for the first time that it has a boundary dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, a development with significant implications for India as the region borders Arunachal Pradesh state, which is also claimed by Beijing. Earlier this month, @detresfa had used open source satellite imagery to report that China had stepped up work on military infrastructure opposite Lipulekh region in Uttarakhand. The infrastructure included a surface-to-air missile site on the banks of Mansarovar Lake in Tibet. The imagery showed what appeared to be two sites at which PLA is creating new infrastructure and accommodation. Both are not far from the Kalapani-Lipulekh region that is at the heart of a new border row between India and Nepal. These developments come against the backdrop of the Indian Army’s acknowledgement on Monday that its troops had pre-empted efforts by PLA to unilaterally change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of Pangong lake in the Ladakh sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-building-heliport-at-tri-junction-of-india-bhutan-and-china-shows-satellite-imagery/story-WxPoYWRN1KgDuFZCoxJeMN.html
31-08-2020||World||China throws a wrench into Donald Trump’s plan to force TikTok sale||Zhang Yiming’s plan to sell the US operations of his short-video app TikTok to avoid a shutdown was thrown into jeopardy after China asserted authority over a deal already under scrutiny by the Trump administration.Beijing on Friday added uncertainty to already thorny negotiations over the sale of ByteDance Ltd.’s prized asset, claiming the ability to block a sale to foreign suitors Microsoft Corp. or Oracle Corp. with tighter restrictions on artificial intelligence exports. The commerce ministry added speech and text recognition and personalized recommendations to a list of products that require approval before they’re sold abroad.These new areas cover the very technologies ByteDance employed to make TikTok a viral teen sensation from America to India. The company is now required to seek the government’s sign-off on any deal, though it doesn’t mean an outright ban, according to a person familiar with the matter. TikTok is dissecting the new regulations and thinks they will make securing a deal more difficult, a second person familiar with the matter said.For China, the move helps gain leverage to prevent what state-run media called the “theft” of technology while underscoring to the US it has intellectual property worth protecting. It also increases the likelihood a deal could get held up and Trump will then move ahead with a TikTok ban ahead of November’s election, depriving millions of teenagers of any updates to the app though they may still be able to use the current version.“AI is a foundational technology and is one of the key sectors that China aims to lead, competing with the U.S.,” said Rebecca Fannin, founder of Silicon Dragon Ventures. “This pushback by Beijing could be seen as part of the growing U.S.-China tensions and tech cold war.”China’s opaque regulations introduce more unknowns into an already delicate process involving multiple corporations, agencies and federal court, all converging days before Donald Trump’s executive order banning TikTok takes effect ahead of November elections. It could take up to 30 days for ByteDance to get the greenlight to export AI, said Zhaokang Jiang, a trade attorney and managing partner of GSC Potomac.The involvement of Beijing, which has denounced Trump administration bans on TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat, muddies the waters as American corporations and investors vie to hammer out a deal by the Trump administration’s deadline. Microsoft and Oracle have submitted rival bids to acquire TikTok’s US business, while Centricus Asset Management Ltd. and Triller Inc. made a last-minute pitch on Friday to buy TikTok’s operations in several countries for $20 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.“We’ve been seeing U.S. restrictions on China on a daily basis. We can’t expect China to have no response at all,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization.China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the American government’s moves again on Monday.“We are opposed to the U.S. abusing the national security concept and state power to suppress specific businesses of other countries,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing. “The U.S.’s attempt to take economic bullying and political manipulation against non-American companies, whether it is politically coerced transaction or government enforced transaction, is no different from plundering.”Beijing’s new curbs on technology mirrors American sanctions against the sale of US software or circuitry to a plethora of Chinese firms. Apart from giving it a say in any imminent deal, the seemingly innocuous changes provide another bargaining chip in the US-China tech cold war.“Beijing’s responses to Washington over the past five months have largely been designed to appear retaliatory, but are in fact carefully calibrated to place Beijing on equal footing with the US while not escalating tensions — yet,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of digital research at consultancy Trivium in Beijing. “This move is no exception: it may give Beijing more equal footing so that decisions can’t be made by the US unilaterally, but doesn’t necessarily indicate Beijing will move to nix the deal.”ByteDance has become one of several Chinese companies at the heart of Washington-Beijing tensions. Trump accuses the company’s app of being a threat to national security, echoing charges against telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. The White House has now ordered Zhang’s company to sell the app’s operations in the U.S. and several other countries, with a valuation estimated at $20 billion to $50 billion.It’s unclear how the bidding process will now play out. Zhang has said the company, whose TikTok is also banned in India, is working rapidly to resolve its geopolitical headaches. But Beijing’s insertion into the process raises the chances that it may just decide to veto or at least delay a deal, with unknown ramifications.Those outcomes may appeal to Zhang, the 37-year-old founder who built ByteDance into the most valuable startup in the world with a $140 billion valuation, according to CB Insights. He had long resisted giving up control of TikTok because he thinks the service is evolving into one of a handful of major online advertising businesses, alongside Facebook Inc. and Google.His instincts may be to fight: He has scrapped with authorities in Beijing over politically sensitive content and with Chinese publishers over allegations of copyright infringement.TikTok has asked a federal judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the fast-growing social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a US courtroom.Even before the latest regulations, Microsoft or any other American owner faced the difficult task of hiving off TikTok US from ByteDance’s much larger Chinese business.ByteDance runs TikTok in various regions, often employing code from Musical.ly, the progenitor to the app that ByteDance acquired in 2017. With ByteDance engineers in China still working on TikTok, it’s unclear how Microsoft could split the code and the underlying technology to ensure it’s free from Chinese interference -- or determine the value of a standalone operation that may not have access to ByteDance’s technical wizardry.The rule revised Friday would cover cross-border transfers of restricted technologies even within the same company, while the impact and consequences of failing to make appropriate applications would be very different if an international business is spun off, said Cui Fan, a trade expert who’s a professor at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics.“We are studying the new regulations that were released Friday. As with any cross-border transaction, we will follow the applicable laws, which in this case include those of the U.S. and China,” ByteDance General Counsel Erich Andersen said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-throws-a-wrench-into-donald-trump-s-plan-to-force-tiktok-sale/story-gWVzQmatxaI7vUFUdfkKjJ.html
31-08-2020||World||Israeli, US delegations depart to UAE in 1st direct flight||A Star of David-adorned El Al plane took off Monday from Israel’s Ben-Gurion Airport, carrying a high-ranking American and Israeli delegation to Abu Dhabi in the first-ever direct commercial passenger flight to the United Arab Emirates.The Israeli flag carrier’s flight marks the implementation of the historic US-brokered deal to normalize relations between the two nations and solidifies the long-clandestine ties between them that have evolved over years of shared enmity toward Iran.With the US as matchmaker, Israel and the UAE agreed earlier this month to work toward normalization, which would make the UAE the third Arab nation to have full relations with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan. But unlike those two nations, Israel has never fought a war against the UAE and hopes to have much-warmer relations.The American delegation includes President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as national security adviser Robert O’Brien, Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and envoy for Iran Brian Hook. Israel will be represented by national security adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat and the director generals of several ministries, who will meet with their Emirati counterparts.“While this is a historic flight, we hope that this will start an even more historic journey for the Middle East and beyond,” Kushner told reporters before boarding the plane.Meir Ben-Shabbat, Israel’s national security adviser and head of the Israeli delegation, said he was excited about the trip and that the aim was to lay the groundwork for cooperation in areas like tourism, medicine, technology and trade.“This morning the traditional greeting of ‘go in peace’ takes on a special significance for us,” he said.The El Al flight, numbered LY971 as a gesture to the UAE’s international calling code number, flew into Saudi Arabian airspace shortly after takeoff. That marked another historic first for Israel and at least an acquiescence by the kingdom for the UAE’s move.Saudi King Salman, along with other Gulf Arab leaders to varying degrees, maintain their boycotts of Israel in support of Palestinians obtaining an independent state. Any long-term flights between Israel and the UAE would require Saudi clearance to be profitable. Otherwise the three hour, 20 minute flight would take more than seven hours.El Al spokesman Stanley Morais said the 737-900 is equipped with a missile-defense system, a standard feature on these types of planes and a requirement for this flight. After grounding its fleet due to the coronavirus, it is the airline’s first flight since July 1.The plane was decorated with the the words for peace in Arabic, Hebrew and English above the pilot’s window. Journalists were handed special face masks decorated with the Israeli and Emirati flags. The seat protectors said “Making History” in all three languages, and Israeli folk music played in the background.The plane’s captain, Tal Becker, said he has not worked for several months and received a call out of the blue asking him to prepare for the flight. He said it took about a week to get up to speed.The 45-year veteran, who is the senior captain in El Al’s 737 fleet, said he never dreamed of flying to Abu Dhabi, calling it a “very special feeling.”The Israeli delegation will stay in the capital, Abu Dhabi, for one night before returning home on El Al flight LY972, a nod to Israel’s international calling code.Private jets have earlier flown between the two nations as part of covert talks, and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways flew cargo freighters to Israel before to deliver coronavirus aid to the Palestinians. But the high-profile flight Monday, eagerly promoted by US officials, looks to place a solid stamp on the surprise Aug. 13 White House announcement of Israel and the UAE establishing ties.Since then, telephone calls were connected, and the UAE’s ruler issued a decree formally ending the country’s decades-long boycott of Israel. Some Israeli firms have already signed deals with Emirati counterparts, but Monday’s visit is expected to usher in a slew of further business cooperation. The official repeal of the boycott looks to open the door to more joint ventures, such as in aviation, banking and finance.The UAE has touted the deal as a tool to force Israel into halting its contentious plan to annex parts of the West Bank sought by the Palestinians for their future state. It also may help the Emirates acquire advanced US weapons systems that have been previously unattainable, such as the F-35 fighter jet. Currently, Israel is the only country in the region with the stealth warplanes.The Palestinians, however, have fiercely opposed the normalization as peeling away one of their few advantages in moribund peace talks with Israel. Palestinians have held public protests and burned the UAE flag in anger.Israelis eagerly anticipate the prospect of mutual embassies, expanding tourism to the Gulf and solidifying business opportunities with another country that shares its penchant for technology and innovation.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has touted the deal as validation of his vision that regional peace doesn’t have to go through Palestinian acquiescence and come at the cost of ceding land. But he has come under fire from supporters at home for seemingly giving up on dreams of annexation and tacitly agreeing to a questionable arms sale that could undermine Israel’s regional superiority. Netanyahu denies such a deal exists.For Trump, the accord delivers a key foreign policy victory as he faces a tough reelection campaign.On Sunday, Kushner said “the stage is now set” for other Arab countries to follow the UAE. However, he gave no indication that any other deals are imminent, despite a swing through the region last week by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-us-delegations-depart-to-uae-in-1st-direct-flight/story-qo17COPOg7NaFcVxPXxENJ.html
31-08-2020||World||Forget disengagement, China opens new front along LAC||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has opened a new front along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC), with its “provocative military movements” on the southern bank of Pangong Tso lake in Ladakh in the intervening night of August 29 and 30 aimed at altering the status quo in the area, people familiar with the developments said on Monday. So far, Chinese aggression in this sector was confined to the lake’s northern bank, the Finger Area that has emerged as the toughest part of the disengagement process. Also Read: India pre-empts China’s aggressive move near Pangong Lake“The PLA’s intentions stand exposed. Instead of carrying out disengagement and restoring the status quo ante in the existing friction areas, China is bent upon changing the status quo in new areas,” the officials said. In a statement on the latest Chinese provocation, army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said on Monday that the PLA has violated the consensus reached during military and diplomatic engagements to reduce tension in eastern Ladakh, where the two armies have been locked in a tense confrontation since early May. Also Watch | Indian Army thwarts fresh Chinese attempt to change status quo in Ladakh Also Read: Chinese troops ‘strictly’ abide by the LAC, never cross the line: BeijingHe said the army took measures to strengthen its positions and thwart the PLA’s intention to unilaterally change facts on the ground on the lake’s southern bank. Experts concurred that the PLA was attempting to change the status quo in new areas. “While there are areas on the northern bank, where the Indian Army only carries out patrolling, the southern bank is strongly held by us. The PLA is fully conscious of it. Any transgression by the PLA in this area is a clear indication that the PLA is trying to change the status quo and open a new front,” said Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), former Northern Army commander. The northern bank of the lake has been at the centre of the current round of border tension, as the PLA has refused to withdraw from the Finger Area, which refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range overlooking the lake. Before the PLA grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, the army would patrol up to Finger 8 that New Delhi considers as an integral part of its territory. The new positions held by the PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers 4 and 8 are eight kilometres (km) apart. “The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquility through dialogue, but is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity,” said the army statement. A brigade commander-level flag meeting is in progress at Chushul to resolve the situation on the southern bank. LAC tension has escalated at a time, when talks with China to reduce border tension in eastern Ladakh are stuck in a stalemate and the two sides have failed to bridge their differences on the disengagement and de-escalation process. The military dialogue between senior commanders from the two sides has hit a roadblock due to Chinese reluctance to restore status quo ante in some key friction areas along the LAC. The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, is a cause for concern for the Indian Army. Disengagement has progressed smoothly at friction points in Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, but its pace is sluggish in the Gogra area. De-escalation along the disputed border can only begin after disengagement between the two armies on the LAC. The ground situation remains unchanged in Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. In a recent interview to HT, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat had explicitly stated that a military option to deal with transgressions by the PLA is on the table, but would be exercised only if talks between the two armies and the diplomatic option turned out to be unproductive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forget-disengagement-china-opens-new-front-along-lac/story-cu2n1gHjqDR97Nh733UGsN.html
31-08-2020||World||Experts say fresh face-off reflects grim reality of LAC situation||India’s acknowledgement of a fresh face-off with Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) reflects the grim reality of the situation along the disputed border after several rounds of talks couldn’t take forward the disengagement process, experts said on Monday. A statement from the Indian Army said soldiers had pre-empted “provocative military movements” by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to change the status quo in the intervening night of August 29 and 30. It added that these actions “violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements” during the standoff in eastern Ladakh that had started in early May. Over the past few weeks, after several rounds of talks between corps commanders on the ground and the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, the differences between the two sides on the disengagement and de-escalation process have emerged in the open. Also Read: Chinese troops ‘strictly’ abide by the LAC, never cross the line: BeijingThe Chinese side has even referred to both sides having “positively evaluated the progress” in disengagement, but the Indian side has insisted that the process is a work in progress and more needs to be done to take it forward. At the last weekly news briefing of the ministry of external affairs (MEA), spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said “complete disengagement requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”, which can be done only through “mutually agreed reciprocal actions” by both sides. Former navy chief Admiral (retired) Arun Prakash said the time had come for the Indian side to do a “reality check and prepare for the worst”. He added, “It’s a grim situation.” The Indian side, Prakash believes, has misread the situation especially since the actions of the Chinese side have often differed from it said. “They seem to have decided to restore their boundary to whatever it was according to their historical interpretation,” he said. Significantly, the latest clash occurred on the southern bank of Pangong lake, where most of the friction in this area has been on the northern bank. The Chinese actions also run counter to Chinese envoy to India Sun Weidong’s assertion last week that the “existing situation on the ground is under control on the whole and there is no fresh standoff between the two forces”. The envoy has even described the June 15 clash – which resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties – as “a brief moment from the perspective of history”. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, a think tank, said the latest clash reflected the “obdurate attitude of the Chinese in resolving the standoff” along the LAC. “The incident goes against what their diplomats have been saying. The Chinese are suing the diplomatic track to create a smokescreen while the Central Military Commission headed by President Xi Jinping is pushing the case on the ground,” he said. Patil also believes the latest Chinese action could be part of efforts to shift the domestic narrative after several photos shared widely on China’s social media platforms purported to show the graves of Chinese troops killed in the June 15 clash. “There have been at least four such images of tombstones and maybe the Chinese want to stonewall the domestic narrative and shift it to one of protecting national interests,” he said. Prakash said India would need to “keep its feet firmly on the ground and look for alliances and partnerships” to tackle the challenges facing it. “If things take a military or kinetic turn, escalation won’t be in our hands,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-says-fresh-clash-reflects-grim-reality-of-lac-situation/story-ss7umiCBMpgZaYvaohX4HI.html
31-08-2020||World||Chinese troops ‘strictly’ abide by the LAC, never cross the line: Beijing||China on Monday said its troops “strictly’’ abide by the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India, refuting the Indian army’s statement that said the Chinese armed forces had carried out provocative military actions on the southern banks of the Pangong Tso.Responding to a question on the Indian army statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said the troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) never cross the line.“Chinese border troops always strictly abide by the LAC. They never cross the line. Border troops on the two sides have been in close communication regarding the issues on the ground,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.Asked about any ongoing meetings to resolve this new development, he said: “What I said is that the two sides through diplomatic and military channels maintain close communication. As to specific meetings and talks, if there is anything, we will release it in a timely manner”.Earlier in the day, the Indian army accused Chinese soldiers of trying to alter the status quo.The statement said Indian troops had been able to pre-empt the PLA from trying to change the facts on the ground.A Brigade Commander-level flag meeting is said to be in progress at Chushul to resolve the issues on the ground.There have been several meetings between the two sides to disengage after border troops clashed in Galwan Valley on June 15, which led to casualties on both sides.Chinese troops have been slow to pull back, particularly around Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km.The Chinese effort to enlarge the border row came just two days after the defence ministry in Beijing told India that it should look at the “big picture of bilateral ties” and work with it and take concrete steps to bring the relationship back on the “right track of normal development.”India has made it clear that China should work on complete disengagement, and then de-escalation of troops in eastern Ladakh, underlining that this can be achieved only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. The message from New Delhi has been that the Indian army will stay firm on Chinese efforts to alter the status quo and has stressed that the PLA will have to return to their April 20 position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-troops-strictly-abide-by-the-lac-never-cross-the-line-beijing/story-Uk5a3HS7mUA7iydZANc78J.html

31-08-2020||World||Donald Trump hails Shinzo Abe as Japan’s best-ever PM||US President Donald Trump has praised outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as Japan’s best head of government ever.In a late night tweet, Trump said he had just spoken with Abe, who is resigning for health reasons.“Shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan, whose relationship with the USA is the best it has ever been. Special man,” Trump tweeted.“The two leaders remarked that their relationship is extraordinary; the President called Prime Minister Abe the greatest prime minister in Japan’s history,” the White House said in a readout of the call.“The President said that Prime Minister Abe has done a fantastic job and that the relationship between the United States and Japan is better today than it has ever been,” the White House said.Abe announced last week he was ending his record-breaking tenure, kicking off a leadership race in the world’s third-largest economy.He said he was suffering a recurrence of the ulcerative colitis that forced him to cut short a first term in office, and that he no longer felt able to continue as prime minister.He and Trump have met several times during the US president’s term, and staffers have hailed the “unprecedented” relationship between Trump and his “golf buddy.”Trump announced in September last year that the two allies had taken a major step towards sealing a new trade deal, after a year of negotiations between the global economic powers.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-hails-shinzo-abe-as-japan-s-best-ever-pm/story-MHC4NpXJf86RJN7qMxBCCN.html
31-08-2020||World||US nears 6 million cases of coronavirus||The United States neared six million coronavirus cases on Sunday, nearly a quarter of the planet’s total, as nations around the world battle to contain the raging pandemic.Global coronavirus infections soared past 25 million, as countries tightened restrictions to halt the health crisis that has upended life for most of humanity.A million additional cases have been detected globally roughly every four days since mid-July, according to an AFP tally, with India on Sunday setting the record for the highest single-day rise in cases with 78,761.The world’s hardest hit country, the United States, had recorded 5.99 million cases of infection as of 0030 GMT Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker. And the death toll is just over 183,000.The US hit five million cases three weeks ago, just 17 days after reaching four million, the tracker said.The virus has hobbled the US economy, the world’s largest, and cast a shadow over President Donald Trump’s once-promising re-election prospects.As Trump faces enormous pressure to curb the contagion, the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, raised the possibility that a still-elusive vaccine might be given emergency approval before the end of trials designed to ensure its safety and effectiveness.The virus has proven a tenacious foe even in nations such as New Zealand and South Korea, which had previously brought their outbreaks largely under control but are now battling new clusters of infections.On the other side of the world, Latin America -- the worst-hit region -- is still struggling with its first wave, with Covid-19 deaths in Brazil crossing 120,000, second only to the United States.Nearly 855,000 people have died of Covid-19 globally, and with no vaccine or effective treatment available yet, governments have been forced to resort to some form of social distancing and lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus.Masks will become mandatory from Monday on public transport and flights in New Zealand, which went more than 100 days without local transmission before the current cluster emerged.And tightened virus curbs kicked in on Sunday in South Korea, which is also battling fresh clusters -- including in the greater Seoul region, home to half the country’s population.In Iraq, thousands of Shiite pilgrims wearing gloves and masks flooded the holy city of Karbala to mark Ashura, in one of the largest Muslim gatherings since the pandemic began.Typically, millions of Shiites from around the world flock to the shrine, but this year’s commemoration was subdued with employees spraying disinfectant mist, checking temperatures and enforcing social distancing.“It stands out because there are so few people,” said Fadel Hakim, a blue medical mask cupping his chin.- ‘Anti-corona’ rallies in Europe -Despite all the grim numbers, there has been steady opposition to lockdowns and social distancing measures in many parts of the world, often because of their crushing economic cost.But resistance has also come from the extreme right and left of the political spectrum, as well as conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccine campaigners.In Berlin on Saturday, thousands gathered to march against coronavirus restrictions -- but police later stopped the rally because many participants were not respecting social distancing measures.Protesters waved German flags and shouted slogans against Chancellor Angela Merkel often used by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.Similar protests were held in London and Zurich, where some carried signs supporting the far-right QAnon movement, which promotes bizarre theories about Satan-worshipping cabals and “deep state” plots -- without any credible evidence.The pandemic has upended economies and societies around the world, and halted most large gatherings -- from sport and music to religion and politics.In Spain, football superstar Lionel Messi missed a virus test at Barcelona’s training ground, club sources confirmed, raising the possibility he will boycott pre-season to force a transfer from the Spanish club.Without a coronavirus test, Messi will be unable to join team-mates for new coach Ronald Koeman’s first training session on Monday.The world’s top sport, culture and music events are struggling with the challenge of hosting spectators while reducing the risk of virus transmission.The US Open Tennis tournament was also hit, announcing an unidentified player had been withdrawn after testing positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nears-6-million-cases-of-coronavirus/story-sL04fDkRu8dyqSlQ1WsXDP.html
31-08-2020||World||Violence in Portland: 1 killed as protesters, Trump backers clash||One person was shot dead late on Saturday in Portland, Oregon, as a large caravan of US President Donald Trump’s supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the streets.It wasn’t clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as the caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by protesters in the city’s downtown. “Portland police officers heard sounds of gunfire from the area of Southeast 3rd Avenue and Southwest Alder Street. They responded and located a victim with a gunshot wound to the chest,” the Portland police bureau said.The chaotic scenes came two days after Trump invoked Portland as a liberal city overrun with violence in a speech at the Republican National Convention as part of his “law and order” re-election campaign theme. The caravan marked the third Saturday in a row that Trump supporters have rallied in the city. Videos from the scene showed sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counter-protesters threw things at the Trump caravan. “All options on the table” to resolve violent protests in Portland, including sending in federal law enforcement assistance, the acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said. The Black Lives Matter demonstrations usually target police buildings and federal offices. With chants of “One person, one vote” and “No justice, no peace”, a crowd of about 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside a Wisconsin courthouse on Saturday to denounce police violence, a week after a cop shot Jacob Blake in the back and left the Black man paralysed. Protesters chanted “Seven bullets, seven days” - a reference to the number of times Blake was shot last Sunday. Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr, called for end to police brutality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-in-portland-1-killed-as-protesters-trump-backers-clash/story-7ucRA5aSXZ5uuHQP9vfYVO.html
31-08-2020||World||Donald Trump seeks ‘law and order’ in tweetstorm on Portland death||President Donald Trump unleashed a tweetstorm early Sunday about Portland, Oregon, hours after a man was killed there during clashes between a large group of Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter demonstrators.The string of messages enlivened criticism from Democrats, including presidential candidate Joe Biden, that Trump is looking to inflame unrest in US cities because he believes it will help his re-election campaign.The president retweeted a post that had used a profanity to describe Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler -- commenting only to “Tone down the language, but TRUE!” -- and others in which the original tweeters accused the mayor, a Democrat, of “war crimes” and of having blood on his hands.Portland has been the site of protests, often violent, for months, following the killing of a Black man, George Floyd, by police in Minnesota in late May.While labeling Black Lives Matter protesters in Washington as “agitators and thugs,” Trump praised as “GREAT PATRIOTS” the hundreds of his supporters who rolled into the city in a convoy of cars and trucks on Saturday. He concluded a string of dozens of tweets with the slogan “LAW AND ORDER!!!”Video posted on Twitter from Portland showed some of the caravan participants driving pickup trucks into protesters and shooting what appeared to be tear gas and paint balls.The man shot to death on Saturday night was a supporter of a right-wing group that’s frequently clashed with other demonstrators there. He was identified by the group Patriot Prayer as Aaron “Jay” Danielson, who also went by Jay Bishop. Trump tweeted “Rest in Peace Jay!”In a lengthy statement, Biden said “it isn’t a peaceful protest when you go out spoiling for a fight.”“I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same,” Biden said in a statement Sunday.Biden said “the job of a president is to lower the temperature” and Trump’s “failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is.”Wheeler, the Portland mayor, hit back at Trump during a press conference. “It’s you who have created the hate and the division,” Wheeler said of the president. “You’ve tried to divide us more than any other figure in modern history. And now you want me to stop the violence that you helped create.”Earlier, Chad Wolf, Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, blamed local officials in Portland and other cities for an “environment of lawlessness and chaos” that’s led to fatal shootings as America’s ideological divide clashes in an interview Sunday on CBS.Another string of posts from Trump late Saturday night included one in which he shared a message from the conservative broadcaster One America News (OAN) that called ongoing protests against racism in the U.S. an attempted coup aimed to “take down the president.”And Trump addressed a Twitter message Sunday at Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington, saying the Democrat should “Clean up D.C. or the Federal Government will do it for you. Enough!!!”A White House spokesman said late Saturday that Trump will travel to Kenosha on Tuesday, days after the Wisconsin city was rocked by protests after police were filmed shooting a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back multiple times at close range.Since then, two people involved in a protest over Blake’s shooting were killed and a third was seriously wounded. A 17-year-old Trump supporter from Illinois, Kyle Rittenhouse, has been charged as an adult with two counts of homicide.Trump hasn’t directly addressed the Rittenhouse incident. Talking to reporters in Texas on Saturday, Trump, he said the matter was “under investigation right now and they’ll be reporting back to me over the next 24 hours.”The president may meet with Blake’s family while in Kenosha, campaign aide Lara Trump said on “Fox News Sunday.”Representative Karen Bass, a California Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said on CNN that Trump was traveling to Kenosha with “one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to agitate things and to make things worse.”“He will stoke it through his social media where he can, because he believes the violence helps him,” said Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “That is the sad and tragic truth about this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-seeks-law-and-order-in-tweetstorm-on-portland-death/story-Os6rvWG2OWTwM6llRL1QgM.html
31-08-2020||World||US floats idea of early approval for eventual vaccine||The head of the US Food and Drug Administration raised the possibility in an interview published Sunday that a future vaccine against the coronavirus might be given emergency approval before the end of trials designed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. A request for such extraordinary approval would have to come from the vaccine developer, Stephen Hahn told the Financial Times. “If they do that before the end of Phase Three,” which involves large-scale human testing, “we may find that appropriate. We may find that inappropriate, we will make a determination.”But Hahn insisted he was not acting under pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been pushing hard for a vaccine, saying one might be ready before US elections November 3.“This is going to be a science, medicine, data decision,” Hahn said. “This is not going to be a political decision.”Three Western drugs makers are well along with their Phase 3 clinical trials, involving tens of thousands of participants.The three are AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford University in England; Moderna, collaborating with the US National Institutes of Health, and the Pfizer/BioNTech alliance.By the nature of the trials it is difficult to predict when reliable results will emerge.Half of the participants in such trials receive an experimental vaccine, while the other half are given a placebo. Under normal procedures, test administrators must wait -- probably for months -- to see whether there is a statistically significant difference in the infection rate of the two groups.As the world desperately awaits an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, China and Russia have already approved vaccines without waiting for the conclusion of trials -- drawing criticism from public health officials in other countries, including the US.Hahn also said that an emergency authorization would not necessarily cover everyone -- it might be granted for specific, high-risk groups.“Our emergency use authorization is not the same as a full approval,” he said.Hahn has faced mounting criticism from the medical community that he has given in to political pressure from the Trump administration, largely involving two incidents.In March, the FDA gave emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 after Trump repeatedly praised its use; the authorization had to be withdrawn in June after serious side effects emerged.More recently, Hahn delivered a far too optimistic appraisal, during a news conference with Trump, of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma against the virus. He said it could save 35 out of 100 patients; the more likely number, experts said, is five in 100.“It is f-ing outrageous to expedite *any* approval of a #SARSCoV2 vaccine, irrespective of @SteveFDA’s subservience to Trump,” Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said on Twitter.“We will not know about safety for many months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-floats-idea-of-early-approval-for-eventual-vaccine/story-UFp9BRwetOSpvEVmorIdIL.html

31-08-2020||World||Joe Biden says Donald Trump fanning ‘unacceptable’ Portland violence||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said violence in Portland, Oregon, that left a supporter of Donald Trump dead is “unacceptable” and urged the president to stop “fanning the flames of hate and division in our society.”“I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same,” Biden said in a statement. “We must not become a country at war with ourselves.”A man linked to a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer that supports Trump was shot and killed in Portland Saturday night after hundreds of Trump supporters who arrived in the city by convoy clashed with those protesting the shootings of Black men and women by police.The statement is the strongest language yet by Biden, with about two months left to the November general election. The nation has been wracked by sporadic racial justice protests since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while in custody of the Minneapolis police.Most of the protests have been peaceful, but there have been instances of property damage and clashes with law enforcement.Chad Wolf, Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security, on Sunday blamed local officials in Portland and other cities for fostering an “environment of lawlessness and chaos” and wouldn’t rule out sending in federal troops, even if local officials don’t want them.‘Recklessly Encouraging’While critical of Black Lives Matters protests that have become violent, Biden said the president is “recklessly encouraging violence” by armed men who have shown up at some of the protests around the country as counter-protesters.The death in Portland followed the killing of two BLM protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last week. A 17-year-old who posted support for police has been charged with homicide in that shooting.“As a country, we must condemn the incitement of hate and resentment that led to this deadly clash,” Biden said of the Portland shooting.“It is not a peaceful protest when you go out spoiling for a fight. What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters?”Trump taunted Biden on Sunday for staying home as a precaution against the coronavirus, saying the Democrat has failed to respond to the violence from the left.“The people of Portland, like all other cities & parts of our great Country, want Law & Order,” Trump wrote in a tweet. “The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it!”Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said earlier on “Fox News Sunday” that Biden will be speaking out in battleground states to discuss the violence.She didn’t say where Biden plans to make campaign stops this week, though the nominee said last week that he plans to begin traveling to critical election states including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Arizona after Labor Day.The Biden campaign said Sunday that the candidate would travel to southwestern Pennsylvania to deliver remarks on Monday, focused on “a different vision for a better future.”Bedingfield didn’t rule out a visit to Kenosha. Trump will visit the city on Tuesday.The Wisconsin city was rocked by violent protests after police were filmed shooting a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back multiple times at close range a week ago.Bedingfield’s sentiment was echoed by other Democrats on Sunday, including Representative Karen Bass of California, who said Trump is stoking violence in cities because he believes it benefits his re-election prospects.Bass said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Trump’s upcoming trip to Kenosha has “one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to agitate things and to make things worse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-donald-trump-fanning-unacceptable-portland-violence/story-4xy7dbeIkRVi6lNz7zqQDM.html

Others such as Bihar and Odisha will deploy additional security forces outside examination centres to enforce social distancing norms.JEE (Main), for admission to engineering colleges including the elite Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), is to be held over September 1-6. It’s the first major nationwide entrance test being held since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) started spreading wider in early March. Although several opposition-ruled states have opposed the conduct of the exam at a time when the pandemic is still raging, all have made elaborate arrangements for the test.Around a million students have enrolled for appearing in the exam across the country. The National Testing Agency (NTA), overseeing the test, has issued detailed guidelines for conducting the exam including sanitization of examination rooms, maintaining a minimum distance of two metres between two tables and mandatory temperature checks on each student.Students, who for the first time they will give an examination with gloves on, should not panic; they need to be careful and read the guidelines in detail, said Ashish Arora, head of academics at Jaipur-based Allen Career Institute. All students have been asked to come to the examination centre at least an hour before scheduled start of the exam. “The children need to be calm at the centres as the movement inside the centres would be slow,” Arora said.Ajay Singh, manager of the Uniconcept examination centre in Patna, said the students should take care to maintain social distancing.A Patna official said an adequate number of district magistrates and police personnel would be deployed to prevent gatherings outside exam halls. In Odisha, too, police reinforcements have been deployed at examination centres to help students and to prevent overcrowding.“Traffic police personnel would be posted at crucial places for smooth flow of traffic so that students reach on time,” said Bhubaneswar municipal commissioner PC Chaudhry, adding that there would be no restrictions on inter-state traffic to help students reach their examination centres.The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation released a list of hotels and lodges in the city to help students and their parents to find accommodation; in Ganjam district, buses have been provided to carry students to their examination centres. On Saturday, the state government announced a relaxation of weekend lockdowns until September 13.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday said the state government has arranged free transport for students taking JEE (Main) and the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical and dental courses, due on September 13 .“The arrangement has been made to ensure that the students don’t face any problem due to Covid situation. However, for this, they will have to contact the authorities on phone number 181 or get themselves registered on mapit.gov.in/covid-19,” Chouhan said.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday directed district collectors to ensure arrangements related to health protocols are in place at the examination centres; he also asked them to arrange transport and accommodation for students and their parents. The governments of West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab, which had opposed holding the JEE and other Central entrance examinations, directed their transport departments to arrange buses for students to reach examination centres.“Private bus operators and taxi associations have been asked to operate all vehicles. State government buses will also be on the streets,” a senior state West Bengal government official said on condition of anonymity.He said at least 3,000 buses will run in and around Kolkata and auto-rickshaw unions have been asked to operate on routes on which examination centres are located.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-prepare-for-the-jee-main-exam-today/story-x7FUOvltV4TWZD293xEmGM.html
31-08-2020||India||Important to find some equilibrium: Jaishankar||New Delhi Against the backdrop of fresh tensions between India and China following a face-off between border troops over the weekend, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Monday it is important for the two sides to reach “some kind of equilibrium”. “Like every other country in the world, we are very cognisant of the rise of China. We are an immediate neighbour of China...so obviously...you are very directly impacted by the rise of China,” he said during an online interaction at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum’s (USISPF) annual leadership summit. Given the long history and culture of the two countries and their population of more than a billion people each, he said: “It’s very important that they reach some kind of understanding or equilibrium between them.” The “modus vivendi between India and China” is consequential for both countries and the world, he added, while responding to a question on China’s aggressive actions around the world and its ties with Pakistan. The Pakistan-China ties go back to the early 1960s and “aspects of it have been of concern to India”, Jaishankar said. “Obviously, that is something which we factor in in our relationship with both countries,” he said. Jaishankar participated in the online event hours after the Indian Army said it had pre-empted China’s “provocative military movements” to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of Pangong Lake. However, he didn’t directly refer to the fresh tensions. During the event, Jaishankar also said India’s growth “has to be a lifting tide for the entire region”, and there is a need to invest in the country’s neighbourhood and build more connectivity projects. India is making a lot of regional investment for a “better integrated and connected region”, he said. India also has an ambitious policy for Africa, where it is opening more missions, expanding projects and doing more business, he said. “We need not just a diplomatic footprint, but an economic, technology and security footprint [in Africa],” he added. With the US, India sees a “much stronger convergence of interests” and much greater ability to work together in the realm of defence, Jaishankar said. This has progressed from joint military exercises to defence trade and procuring US military hardware for India’s armed forces, he said. This cooperation is “not tailored to a particular situation” or “focused on some country”, and is more about the two countries working together to secure the world, he added. India also sees the path to economic recovery in the post-Covid-19 era “as very much focused on ease of doing business”, Jaishankar said. The pandemic has also “made everyone more digital and brought out importance of resilient and trusted supply chains”, he added. “We need in the world today partners who can be depended on even in difficulties. Those are very important drivers of future business between us,” he said. The goal of India’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” programme is to increase national capacities, including in manufacturing, and this will lead to new business opportunities for the US as global value chains can use the country’s trusted and resilient production capacities, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/important-to-find-some-equilibrium-jaishankar/story-RVsPDpRirSIX0LfNBgPzFI.html
31-08-2020||India||China building airbases near LAC: Experts||Open source satellite imagery and intelligence suggest that China is upgrading or developing at least 10 airbases, about a dozen air defence facilities and associated radar sites along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), according to experts in the field. On Monday, the open source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter shared an image of a heliport China is building in proximity to two new air defence positions that can cover sensitive stretches of the disputed border in Doklam and Sikkim sectors. The imagery shows the suspected heliport under construction at the tri-junction of the borders of India, Bhutan and China, and at a distance of about 100 km from Doka La (Doka pass) and Naku La (Naku pass). Earlier this month, @detresfa used open source satellite imagery to report that China had stepped up work on military infrastructure opposite Lipulekh region in Uttarakhand, including a surface-to-air missile site on the banks of the Mansarovar Lake in Tibet. “The big thing that stands out [in the open source satellite imagery] is how vast and widespread this is. In the past, the Chinese side would add additional runways or aircraft shelters to some airbases,” said Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security and military analyst with Stratfor, which calls itself a geopolitical intelligence platform.“Now, China is upgrading or rebuilding facilities or creating new facilities, including 10 airbases, a dozen air defence facilities and other associated radar sites,” said Tack, who works with @detresfa. “The efforts appear to be significant and very directed,” Tack said, adding that one recent image had captured hundreds of trucks carrying concrete for upgrading the tarmac at just one site. Much of the work, he said, had begun either late last year or early this year, well before the India-China border standoff emerged in the open in May after two clashes, one at Pangong lake in the Ladakh sector and another at Naku La in the Sikkim sector. “In the context of how this sort of development work usually takes places, the pace has been rapid,” Tack said, with much of the activity focused on building or upgrading facilities that will allow the Chinese side to control the airspace and provide additional mobility and support to ground forces. Besides the heliport in the Doklam sector, the Chinese side is also working on two more heliports in the Ladakh sector, one in Rutog county near the northern bank of Pangong Lake and another at Tianshuihai near Galwan Valley and Aksai Chin, according to the experts. The open source intelligence and satellite imagery, the experts said, pointed to long-term planning for the positioning of forces and assets. The suspected heliport near Doklam “could sustain all weather & rapid troop deployments in the sector along with improving surveillance operations”, @detresfa tweeted. The heliport is located almost equidistant from two sites at which the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing surface-to-air missile facilities, according to imagery tweeted earlier by @detresfa. Both missile facilities are near what have been described as “suspected early warning radar sites” opposite Sikkim state. In a graphic posted on Twitter, @detresfa said the “steady build-up of support infrastructure” by PLA near “areas with a history of clashes [and] disputed territorial claims demonstrates the long-term Chinese ambitions in these sectors”. “With the addition of a heliport along with area denial systems within 100 km from Doka La [and] Naku La, China would be able to sustain all weather operations in the disputed areas regardless of the harsh terrain [and] conditions,” according to the graphic. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the reported development of the heliport and the missile sites by the Chinese.These developments come against the backdrop of the Indian Army’s acknowledgement on Monday that its troops had pre-empted efforts by the PLA to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC on the southern bank of Pangong lake....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-building-airbases-near-lac-experts/story-7kHcQYG60gRk1gLHgX2AUO.html
31-08-2020||India||Images show heliport infra near Doklam||New Delhi Open source satellite imagery has captured what appears to be a heliport China is building in close proximity to two new air defence positions that cover sensitive stretches of the disputed border in Doklam and Sikkim sectors. The imagery, shared by the open source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter, shows the suspected heliport under construction at the tri-junction of the borders of India, Bhutan and China, and at a distance of about 100km from Doka La (Doka pass) and Naku La (Naku pass). “Suspected PLA heliport infrastructure spotted [as] part of an ongoing investigation near the #Doklam region of the #India #China #Bhutan tri junction, this support unit could sustain all weather & rapid troop deployments in the sector along with improving surveillance operations,” the analyst tweeted. The suspected heliport is located almost equidistant from the two sites at which the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing surface-to-air missile facilities, according to imagery tweeted earlier by @detresfa. Both the missile facilities are near what have been described as “suspected early warning radar sites” opposite Sikkim state. In a graphic posted on Twitter, @detresfa said the “steady build-up of support infrastructure by the People’s Liberation Army of China [near] areas with a history of clashes [and] disputed territorial claims demonstrates the long-term Chinese ambitions in these sectors”. “With the addition of a heliport along with area denial systems within 100km from Doka La [and] Naku La, China would be able to sustain all weather operations in the disputed areas regardless of the harsh terrain [and] conditions,” according to the graphic. The new missile facilities are located roughly 50km from Naku La (Naku pass), where troops from the two countries had clashed on May 9, and Doka La (Doka pass), close to the Doklam plateau that was the scene of a 73-day military standoff between India and China in 2017. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured in the clash at Naku La, the second such reported incident since the current standoff began in early May. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the reported development of the heliport and the missile sites by the Chinese. After the end of the Doklam standoff in 2017 following several rounds of negotiations, there were reports the Chinese side hadn’t fully pulled back its troops from the area. There were also reports that Chinese troops had built trenches, fortified positions and infrastructure to support operations by helicopters and aircraft in the area. Last month, Hindustan Times had first reported that China had officially stated for the first time that it has a boundary dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, a development with significant implications for India as the region borders Arunachal Pradesh state, which is also claimed by Beijing. Earlier this month, @detresfa had used open source satellite imagery to report that China had stepped up work on military infrastructure opposite Lipulekh region in Uttarakhand. The infrastructure included a surface-to-air missile site on the banks of Mansarovar Lake in Tibet. The imagery showed what appeared to be two sites at which PLA is creating new infrastructure and accommodation. Both are not far from the Kalapani-Lipulekh region that is at the heart of a new border row between India and Nepal. These developments come against the backdrop of the Indian Army’s acknowledgement on Monday that its troops had pre-empted efforts by PLA to unilaterally change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of Pangong lake in the Ladakh sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/images-show-heliport-infra-near-doklam/story-9pp63I3n7VPCrwH2bX8MaI.html

31-08-2020||India||Japan announces emergency loan for India to fight Covid-19 pandemic||Japan announced on Monday it will extend a emergency support loan of up to 50 billion yen (almost Rs 3,500 crore) to back India’s response to the Covid-19 crisis, including implementation of health and medical policies and development of hospitals equipped with ICUs. Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki, and CS Mohapatra, additional secretary in India’s department of economic affairs exchanged notes regarding the provision of the yen loan for the response to the Covid-19 emergency. A statement issued by the Japanese embassy noted that the Indian government has taken several measures, including health sector reforms, in response to the spread of Covid-19. “This loan provides the necessary funds for emergency response in the fight against Covid-19 in India,” it said. This is the largest amount of financial assistance announced by any country so far to support India’s response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has had widespread impacts on the economy and health sector. The “Covid-19 crisis response emergency support loan” will back the “implementation of health and medical policy by the government of India, and will lead to the development of hospitals equipped with ICUs and infection prevention and management facilities, which are undersupplied in India”, the statement said. “It is also expected to lead to the enhancement of telemedicine using digital technology in numerous villages across India. It is expected that these measures, in addition to controlling the spread of infection in the country, will also contribute to the recovery and stability of the country’s society and economy, as well as to sustainable development,” the statement added. The terms and conditions of the loan include an interest rate of 0.01% per annum and a redemption period of 15 years, including a four-year grace period. Suzuki and Mohapatra also exchanged notes for the provision of grant aid worth 1 billion yen under Japan’s Official Development Assistance scheme for India’s Economic and Social Development Programme, which is being implemented by the health ministry. “This programme will provide oxygen generators to government of India. Oxygen generators can be employed for the treatment of Covid-19 patients under critical conditions. This programme will lead to the strengthening of India’s infectious disease countermeasures, as well as her health and medical systems,” the Japanese embassy said. In a separate development, the Japanese embassy and consulates and Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) updated the list of Japanese businesses in India with the cooperation of Japanese chambers of commerce and industries in India. As of October 2019, the total number of Japanese companies registered in India is 1,454. The number has increased by 13 (0.9% growth), compared to 1,441 in 2018. The total number of Japanese business establishments in India, as of October 2019, is 5,022, a decrease by 80 (1.6% decline) as compared to 5,102 in 2018. West Bengal and Haryana showed the largest increase in the number of Japanese companies. There was a significant increase in the number of companies in such sectors as information and communications as well as services. The manufacturing sector accounted for half of the total Japanese companies and more than a third of Japanese business establishments in India. “The total number of establishments decreased while the number of companies increased, because some companies became non-Japanese due to the closure of office, corporate restructuring, change of ownership etc,” said a statement from the Japanese embassy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/japan-announces-emergency-loan-for-india-to-fight-covid-19-pandemic/story-EU1w4uYbMMipMFPdS2KaQP.html
31-08-2020||India||SC fines Bhushan ₹1 for contempt of court||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday ordered advocate Prashant Bhushan to pay a fine of one rupee for criminal contempt of court, observing that his refusal to express remorse reflected his ego and obstinacy, and his offensive tweets should not go unpunished because that would send a wrong message to lawyers and litigants. Bhushan agreed to pay the fine.While the Bhushan camp considered the nominal fine a victory in the perception battle, the order passed by the three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra reflected a different tenor as it reiterated its judgment of August 14 by which it had found Bhushan guilty.“We are not afraid of sentencing the contemnor (Bhushan) either with imprisonment or from debarring him from practice. His conduct reflects adamance and ego, which has no place to exist in the system of administration of justice and in a noble profession, and no remorse is shown for the harm done to the institution to which he belongs. At the same time, we cannot retaliate merely because the contemnor has made a statement that he is neither invoking the magnanimity or the mercy of this Court,” the court said.It ordered Bhushan to deposit the fine of Re. 1 with the registry of the court before September 15. In the event of his failure to comply with the order, Bhushan will have to undergo imprisonment of three months and will also be debarred from practising before the Supreme Court for three years.In a statement issued to the press at 4pm on Monday, Bhushan said that while he will pay the fine imposed by the court, he will explore other legal remedies available to him.“While I reserve the right to seek a review of the conviction and sentencing by way of an appropriate legal remedy, I propose to submit myself to this order and will respectfully pay the fine, just as I would have submitted to any other lawful punishment,” the statement read.Bhushan said it was heartening for him that the case became a watershed moment for freedom of speech and encouraged many people to stand up and speak out against the injustices in our society, and maintained that his tweets were not intended in any way to disrespect the Supreme Court or the judiciary.“Every Indian wants a strong and independent judiciary. Obviously if the courts get weakened, it weakens the republic and harms every citizen. I am more confident now than ever before that truth shall prevail,” he said.The bench, however, said that, in it its view, “the act committed by the contemnor is a very serious one.”“He has attempted to denigrate the reputation of the institution of administration of justice of which he himself is a part. At the cost of repetition, we have to state that the faith of the citizens of the country in the institution of justice is the foundation for rule of law which is an essential factor in the democratic set up,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, said. Bhushan’s two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and other against Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on June 29, had led to suo motu (on its own motion) contempt of court action against him. The court found Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt on August 14 and held a separate hearing on August 20 and 25 to determine the sentence to be awarded to him. It then reserved its verdict on sentencing. The court maintained in the verdict that while free speech under Article 19 of the Constitution allows fair criticism of courts and judges, it cannot be stretched beyond a limit to allow malicious and scandalous statements.“The allegations made are scandalous and are capable of shaking the very edifice of the judicial administration and also shaking the faith of common man in the administration of justice. Though a fair criticism of judgment is permissible in law, a person cannot exceed the right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution to scandalize the institution,” the court said.According to the Contempt of Courts Act, the offence of criminal contempt carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to Rs 2,000 or both.Interestingly, Attorney General KK Venugopal, who appeared in the case in his personal capacity at the court’s request, had asked the court on August 20 not to punish Bhushan and instead let him off with a reprimand.The court afforded Bhushan the opportunity to apologise to the court on at least three occasions but he turned it down saying his tweets reflected his bona fide beliefs and any apology for expressing views which he considered to be correct will not be sincere.“The punishment of Rs.1 could have been imposed at the sentencing hearing itself. The long argument, the filing of statements, oral admonitions and insistence on an apology which never came, do not make for a convincing case of magnanimity on the part of the court. It now looks like much ado about nothing,” senior counsel Sanjay Hegde told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-fines-bhushan-1-for-contempt-of-court/story-LeidGz1XeRkiBMHmz4yFNP.html

31-08-2020||India||SC issues rules on physical hearings||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Monday notified a standard operating procedure (SOP) to govern physical court hearings, which are expected to commence in the top court soon. As a pilot scheme, physical hearings of matters will initially commence only in three courtrooms, the SOP said.Wearing of masks, frequent use of hand sanitizers, and maintaining physical distancing norms will be mandatory for all entrants into the Supreme Court premises. The court will take a call on how many lawyers and litigants will be permitted inside the courtroom depending on its capacity and physical distancing norms. If there are multiple parties in a case, then only one advocate-on-record (filing counsel) and one arguing counsel per party will be allowed entry. Besides, one registered clerk per party will also be allowed to carry paperbooks, journals, etc, of lawyers into courtrooms.Entry into the high-security zone of the Supreme Court will be through daily “special hearing passes” that will be issued by the registry.

31-08-2020||India||Fresh row as BJP attacks Cong over RGF donations||New Delhi The BJP on Monday launched a fresh attack on the Congress alleging that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust received donations from organisations linked to Mehul Choksi, Rana Kapoor, Jignesh Shah and Zakir Naik, all of whom are being probed under various charges.Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said all these donations were part of a “conspiracy”, and alleged that trails of all “scams” lead to the Gandhi family.Hitting back at the BJP, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted that a “scared” central government will not answer questions about China’s transgressions into Indian territory, “sinking” GDP numbers and job losses but will instead blame the Congress, its president Sonia Gandhi, RGF (Rajiv Gandhi Foundation), the weather and God.Targeting the Congress, Patra said Choksi, an accused in the PNB fraud case who has fled the country, donated Rs 10 lakh to the foundation in August 2014 through a company owned by his family while Kapoor, the arrested founder of Yes Bank, donated Rs 9.45 lakh to the foundation in September 2016.Shah-owned Financial Technologies India Limited donated Rs 50 lakh to the trust in 2011, he alleged.Naik, a hardline Islamic preacher, had donated Rs 50 lakh in 2011 to the trust, Patra noted and added that the money was returned by the trust to a different account after a controversy broke out.“Since the main account was under probe, so the Congress returned the money to another account,” he claimed.Patra alleged that the GVK group had also supplied 47 vehicles to the foundation for its use between 2011-12 and 2016-17.Meanwhile, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury asked as to how these accused managed to flee the country under the BJP dispensation. “BJP is at the helm of affairs. If the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation has committed any wrong or any legal infirmities are found, then the government is at liberty to do anything,” he said.He then asked as to how many Chinese companies have donated to the PM Cares Fund, and said this also should be investigated.Patra cited the Supreme Court judgment, which had refused to direct the Centre to transfer the contributions made to the PM Cares Fund to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), and asked Chowdhury to trust the court.Congress secretary Pranab Jha dismissed the allegations as “plants” and said these are rehashed, old charges. “We reject them with the contempt they deserve,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-row-as-bjp-attacks-cong-over-rgf-donations/story-ZpyAKMVvkHDhzI7l7EDd3M.html
31-08-2020||India||Chhattisgarh CM tells Centre to borrow to pay GST compensation||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Monday asked the Union Government to borrow and pay off GST compensation to states, according to an official statement of the state government.In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Baghel has also demanded that the Central Government should provide Rs 2,828 crore to Chhattisgarh as GST compensation amount for the year 2020-21. On the option of the State Government taking loan to deal with the shortage in GST compensation Baghel, said that the Central Government had assured the states in GST council in year 2017 that any shortage in state’s revenue after implementation of GST will be compensated till 2022. Hence, under the current circumstances, a more practical and logical step for the Central government would be to take a loan and provide GST compensation amounts to the states, the statement said.Baghel in his letter to Sitaraman said that every year the states generally get an increased amount of revenue, and any shortage in this protected revenue should be compensated by the Central Government. For this, the Central government should be directly taking loan to provide GST compensation amount to the states, instead of advising the states to take loan. He also said that since the Reserve Bank of India provides loans to each state on different interest rates, it would be more practical if the Central Government takes loan and provides it to the states. The chief minister further stated in the letter that as per the constitutional provisions, it is the responsibility of the Central government to provide GST compensation amount. If states take the loan to meet the shortage of GST collection, then the financial burden would fall on the states, and as the Central government is responsible for payment of GST compensation amount, the loan repayment situation would become uncertain and complicated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-tells-centre-to-borrow-to-pay-gst-compensation/story-6BOC1WLho31vvX4tWKdwtK.html

The West Bengal government has also decided to go ahead with a complete state-wide lockdown on September 7, 11 and 12. This comes just two days after the Union government, in its Unlock 4 guidelines said that states shall not impose any lockdown (outside containment zones) without prior consultation of the Centre. “The state government’s notification declaring lockdown days was issued following proper protocols,” said a top official of the state government. The West Bengal government had earlier written to the Railway Board that it has no issues if local trains and Kolkata Metro resume services. On Monday, the notification issued by the state government said that Metro may resume services from September 8 in a graded manner. “We are waiting for the SOP from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Once we receive the SOP, we would discuss with the state government and then work oyt a plan,” said a spokesperson of the Kolkata Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlock-4-kolkata-metro-may-resume-services-from-sept-8/story-2LGnX0vsabFAuBGgep44GL.html
31-08-2020||India||PIL in Jharkhand high court seeks to move Lalu Prasad back to jail||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been moved in the Jharkhand high court seeking judicial order to the state government to immediately shift Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief and fodder scam convict Lalu Prasad to the Ranchi jail.Prasad began his latest jail term on December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases in quick succession.But the former Bihar chief minister has been undergoing treatment in custody at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for the last two years. He was shifted from the hospital’s paying ward to the director’s bungalow early this month due to the Covid-19 pandemic. One Manish Kumar has filed the PIL highlighting how Prasad, unlike any ordinary convict, is availing VIP facilities at RIMS’ director’s bungalow in flagrant violation of jail manual.The petitioner alleged that Prasad was allowed to meet his acquaintances regularly without having any regard to the jail manual.“This all is happening under the garb of treatment right under the nose of the state government and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the prosecuting agency, which remain a mute spectator,” said the petitioner’s lawyer Manoj Tondon.He added that all convicted persons should be treated at par. “When an ordinary convicted person is compelled to remain behind bars, why Prasad, being a political leader, should be given extra favour and why he should be allowed to enjoy the facilities at the director’s bungalow,” Tondon argued, saying, “This is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.”Earlier, when Prasad was arrested in Bihar as an accused in the fodder scam, he was put in a guest house. After the Supreme Court’s intervention, he was finally sent to Beur Jail, Patna, Tondon said.He added that the said apex court’s order was annexed with the PIL. Prasad had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.The former Bihar chief minister’s trouble renewed again after December 23, 2017, when he had been convicted in three other fodder scam cases in quick succession and awarded different terms of imprisonment. After spending initial two months from December, 2017, to February, 2018, in Birsa Munda Central Jail in Ranchi, Prasad had developed health complications in the middle of March, 2018, and he was shifted to hospital. Since then, he has not returned to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-in-jharkhand-high-court-seeks-to-move-lalu-prasad-back-to-jail/story-yjjDRS4xMnOXKyXWQAt3WP.html

A devout Hindu, Pranab Mukherjee never missed his priest’s role except only in 2015, when his wife, Suvra, passed away just a few days before the annual festival. Although other priests performed the routine rituals, it was Mukherjee’s job to chant scriptures from the 13 chapters of Chandi. The puja was started by Mukherjee’s ancestor Jangaleswar Mukherjee 126 years ago. To the villagers, who gathered in mourning on Monday evening, Mukherjee was always Poltu, the nickname his parents gave him. His elder sister Annapurna Devi, the only member of the family who lived in the house, died in January this year. “We lost our guardian as Bengal lost a glorious son. An era has ended and this void will remain forever,” said Rabi Chattaraj, 71, the former Congress leader’s follower in politics and a resident of Miriti. The village is located around 230 km to the South-West of Kolkata. “I became his disciple ever since I joined the Youth Congress as a young man. Dada was affectionate to me. Last year, when he came to attend the puja, he asked me to look after the guests and ensure that everyone gets the prasad,” Chattaraj told HT as his voice choked. “The puja at Dada’s home has always been devoid of any kind of luxury despite his stature. Thousands of people, including VIPs, have attended the puja. Dada used to request everybody not to leave without taking the prasad,” said Chattaraj. During his stay in the village, Mukherjee used to spend time with family and old friends, some of whom went to the Shib Chandra High School at Kirnahar which is more commonly referred to as ‘Pranab’s school.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darkness-descends-on-miriti-pranab-mukherjee-s-village-in-bengal/story-iF6kjdRbpmE2VGIbzmSYjN.html

According to a police press statement on Monday, the five accused were arrested by a team of seven officers from CM’s special vigilance cell on August 27 following raids at some remote areas of Gorakhpur and Basti districts of Uttar Pradesh. The accused, identified as Mohammad Arif, Mohammad Asif, Lalji, Sarvesh Rao and Ravindra Kumar, have been brought to Assam on remand of 10 days have reportedly admitted to their crime. They said they had withdrawn funds fraudulently from relief funds of CMs from other states as well. “During interrogation, they admitted to have committed the offence and also said that they had committed the same from other states but only recently they tried to withdraw sum from Assam CM’s relief fund starting with withdrawal of very little amounts,” the statement said. The matter first came to light on August 10 when the Assam CM’s office detected some unusual transactions from the relief fund. The matter was immediately informed to the vigilance cell and a case registered. During investigation it was found that some amounts were fraudulently withdrawn using cheques in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh by forging the cheques and signatures of Sonowal. Details of the total sum withdrawn from the fund have not been disclosed yet. “The government money fraudulently withdrawn was refunded by State Bank of India as there were faults on their part,” the statement said. The covert operation to nab the culprits was successful due to close coordination between the offices of CMs of Assam and Uttar Pradesh as well as police departments of both states. “Chief Minister of Assam has warned that he will not allow a single penny meant for the poor people of Assam to go to the hands of criminals,” the statement stated. The scam revealed that criminals can withdraw sums from such government funds where there is less auditing and monitoring. “This is a wake up call for all the state governments of India to secure government funds as there are huge credit balances in the accounts and very less monitoring and auditing of the funds, and this is taken as an advantage by criminals who have been involved in fraudulent withdrawal of money from government funds across the country,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-police-arrest-5-from-up-for-siphoning-money-from-cm-s-relief-fund/story-qLfK7e2ki5XvSXg7rFNnyN.html

Gandhi, in the letter said, that the former President played a crucial role both in shaping the course of events as well as actively participating in them, whether as a cabinet minister, parliamentarian or President of India. “Pranabda had been such an integral and prominent part of national life, the Congress party and the central government for over five decades, it is hard to imagine how we can do without his wisdom, experience, sage advice and deep understanding of so many subjects,” Gandhi wrote in the letter.

31-08-2020||India||Nitish Kumar’s call to Sharad Yadav sparks speculation of his return to JD(U)||A courtesy call by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to the family of former JD (U) president Sharad Yadav to enquire about his health, has sparked off speculation in the political circle about his possible return to the party.Yadav, who was undergoing treatment at New Delhi’s AIIMS, was discharged from hospital on Sunday. “Yes, this is true that Nitish Kumar ji called Sharad Yadav but it was just a courtesy call to enquire about his health,” said general secretary of Yadav’s Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), Arun Srivastava. He, however, was quick to add, “Anything is possible in politics which is full of probabilities. Nitishji has been our leader and we have worked together.” Yadav formed LJD after he was expelled from the JD (U) for his anti-party activities in August 2017. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Madhepura as a Grand Alliance candidate and lost the elections. What has sparked the rumours about his return to JD (U) is that during the course of his illness, several JD (U) leaders contacted him and enquired about his health. According to Yadav’s party sources, the LJD leader, like other Grand Alliance partners, was feeling neglected in the alliance. Only recently, HAM-S, one of the GA partners, exited from the alliance. “If he joins it will definitely be a good move,” said JD (U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan. “He is a tall leader. It will strengthen the NDA,” said BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav. However, a section of the JD (U) doesn’t see this happening. “He doesn’t have a base. Moreover, if he joins, it will be difficult to adjust his candidates in the coming Assembly polls,” said a senior JD (U) leader, wishing anonymity. The RJD also sees this as propaganda. “The JD (U) has become desperate. They are moving from the doors of one leader to another and extending them invites to join their party,” said RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary. The JD (U) had removed Yadav as the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha in 2017 after he publicly disapproved of Nitish Kumar’s decision to re-join the NDA in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-s-call-to-sharad-yadav-sparks-speculation-of-his-return-to-jd-u/story-Esl0fVoR6z0In9mf8AnnEM.html

He said the order to the Indian firms would boost the Make in India initiative at a time when self-reliance in the defence sector is a top priority for the government. The six Pinaka Regiments will consist of 114 launchers with automated gun aiming and positioning systems and 45 command posts to be bought from TPCL and L&T, and 330 vehicles to be procured from BEML, the ministry said in a statement. The Defence Research and Development Organisation has locally designed and developed the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system. It will now be produced by the firms to whom the contract has been awarded. “These six Pinaka regiments will be operationalised along the northern and eastern borders of our country further enhancing the operation preparedness of the armed forces,” the ministry said. The new regiments will be operational by 2024. Last week, PM Narendra Modi said India has the potential to become a reliable weapons supplier to friendly foreign countries and strengthen its strategic partnerships as it takes strides towards self-reliance in the defence sector. Earlier this month, the government announced a separate budgetary outlay of Rs 52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement and came out with a negative import list. India on August 9 announced it will ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years --- from artillery guns to light military transport aircraft and conventional submarines to long-range land attack cruise missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-inks-contract-worth-rs-2-580-crore-with-indian-firms-to-boost-army-s-firepower/story-OZdkSlk9ALcVeIJMU7h7JI.html

The driver was trying to overtake another vehicle when he lost control and plunged into the icy Chenab river which is in spate due to recent rain. “We have not been able to retrieve travellers. The Chenab is in full spate and nothing has been found so far,” Ramban district commissioner Nazim Zai Khan said. The accident occurred around 4.30 pm. “There were nine on board the ill-fated vehicle, out of whom one, a police constable Mehraj Din, was thrown out of it when the vehicle was rolling down into the river,” said Khan. “He is being treated at district hospital in Ramban. Prima facie it appeared to be a case of negligent driving,” said the DC. Ramban’s senior superintendent of police Haseeb-ur-Rehman said, “the vehicle was on its way to Ramban from Udhampur. We tried to trace the vehicle with the help of hooks but there is no clue so far. The river is in spate.” “We have requisitioned army divers on Tuesday morning to trace the passengers. However, we have recovered some bags from the slope,” he added The vehicle skidded off the road at Mehar on the outskirts of Ramban town. According to the lone survivor Mehraj Din, two other policemen - head constable Ajay Kumar and constable Hafiz Hussain of Akhnoor - were also in the vehicle when it fell into the river. Two women had de-boarded at Karol, just two kms short of the mishap site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-feared-dead-as-van-plunges-into-chenab-river-in-j-k-s-ramban/story-AU8FlCdj75AxNajT5oxlyN.html

31-08-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee, India’s former president who never became PM||During five decades in Indian politics, Pranab Mukherjee, who died on Monday after a lung infection, led some of the nation’s most powerful ministries and eventually became its president, but the ultimate prize still eluded him: the prime ministership.Mukherjee tested positive for Covid-19 on August 10 and had been in hospital since. He was 84.Valued for his ability to build consensus by exerting his charm to bring together disparate groups, Mukherjee never won the top job, despite decades of loyalty to the Congress party.The former college teacher and journalist lacked a grassroots political base, but held more than a dozen federal portfolios between 1973 and 2012, ranging from commerce and finance to defence and foreign affairs.But he could also raise hackles, as when finance minister in 2012, he demanded a $2-billion payment from Vodafone, then India’s largest overseas corporate investor, as part of a retrospective tax on long-concluded corporate deals.Mukherjee entered parliament in 1969, following his father into the Congress party led by Indira Gandhi, just as she steered the country on a sharp turn towards socialism.He rose under Gandhi’s mentorship, only to be sidelined by her son, Rajiv, after elections in 1984.But Mukherjee managed to regain his proximity to the Congress leadership and the Gandhi family, becoming one of India’s most influential politicians during the 1990s and 2000s, by building a deep network of inter-party relationships.“Everybody realised he was so clever that they would rather have him as a number two than a number one,” said Sanjaya Baru, a former adviser to Manmohan Singh, the architect of India’s financial reforms who beat Mukherjee to the top job in 2004.“He had a tremendous role on policies, right from the 1980s.” Mukherjee’s reward then should have been a stint as prime minister, by his own estimation as well as that of some others, but he was passed over by Rajiv’s Italian-born widow, Sonia, who gave it instead to Singh, an Oxbridge-trained economist. In 2012, Mukherjee resigned from parliament to take the largely figurehead role of head of state. He was sworn in as India’s 13th president, with cross-party support that underlined his wide acceptability, an attribute rare in Indian politics.A corruption scandal two years into his presidency led to a defeat in general elections for Congress, which has ruled India for most of its independent history, and Mukherjee had to swear in BJP’s Narendra Modi as prime minister.Born on Dec. 11, 1935 in the village of Mirati, in the eastern state of West Bengal, Mukherjee studied history, political science and law.“My passion has been the service of the people of India,” Mukherjee said in a speech summing up 50 years in public life when he left the office of president in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-india-s-former-president-who-never-became-pm/story-usguDDNqcwNmFdj7q6eHkJ.html

The police have appealed to citizens to not to unnecessarily go to immersion points.A senior police officer said that the staff of all the 94 police stations will be deployed from Monday midnight. Nearly 1,500 men from the special units and side branches such as crime branches, local arms police, Economic Offenses Wing, special branch and protection and security branch will be helping local police stations maintain law and order in the respective areas.“CCTV network of over 5,000 cameras would be used to monitor people’s movement on the street leading to Chowpatties for Ganesh idols immersions. The police have also roped in additional troops of State Reserve Police Force, Riot Control Force and Rapid Action Force, Quick Response Teams (QRTs), Bomb Detection Disposal Squads and homeguards for the bandobast,” a statement from police stated.“Policemen in plain clothes would be deployed at the places which witness big crowds to keep a check on the eve teasers and molesters,” said Mumbai police spokesperson N Ambika, deputy commissioner of police (Headquarters-1).Mounted police will be deployed to ensure that people do not gather in large numbers on the Chowpatties. Drone cameras may be used at the major Chowpatties such as Girgaon and Juhu.The police have also said that since there would not be any big procession this year as all the Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandals following government’s order of maintaining the 10-day festival at very low scale, and also with lockdown is in effect, the city traffic police has not made any special arrangements for the vehicular movements for Tuesday. But traffic cops and wardens in big numbers would be seen managing traffic on the streets, a senior traffic police officer said.The city police will be deploying sea divers, and would also make arrangements of boats and launches in coordination with the Coast Guard and Navy at the immersion points.The police requested citizens to avoid performing aartis at the immersion points and instead perform them at home. “The citizens shall not come out and crowd the street unnecessarily amid the pandemic,” DCP Ambika said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-to-deploy-35-000-cops-to-ensure-peaceful-ganesh-immersion/story-UQZVW7phoyLrj9fdxKRDUM.html

Each of the multi-sectoral teams will consist of an epidemiologist and a public health expert. The teams will support the state in strengthening containment, surveillance, testing, and effective clinical management of positive cases to prevent deaths. Of the four states, with 54,666 patients Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of active cases or those still living with the infection. This is followed by Odisha with 27,219 active cases, Chhattisgarh with 13,520 cases, and Jharkhand with 11,577 cases.

31-08-2020||India||Telangana Congress chief writes to PM Modi for CBI probe into Srisailam power station mishap||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president A Revanth Reddy on Monday demanded that the Centre order a thorough investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the accident in Srisailam Left Bank Hydro-electric Project (SLBHP) on August 20 that claimed nine lives. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the PCC leader, who also represents Malkajgiri constituency in the Lok Sabha, said the accident in the underground hydro-electric project was totally avoidable and was the result of the negligence of the state government. He said the Srisailam plant, which was the most essential source of power generation, lacked basic safety provisions including fire alarm alert, fire suppression system, fire hazard risk assessment and emergency action plan. “It lacks training of the employees for emergency situations as per the ‘Recommended Practice for Fire Protection for Hydroelectric Generating Power’ mentioned in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code,” the MP said. “Had the officials responded to the periodical warnings on time, this loss of life and public property could have been avoided,” Reddy said. He urged the Prime Minister to order an impartial inquiry by the CBI into the incident. Similarly, an independent body constituted by the Central Electricity Authority, a team of experts in fire safety, fire hazard assessment, power generation and related disciplines, with no conflicts of interest must investigate the technical lapse which leads to this tragic incident, the Congress leader said. “It is also necessary to investigate the alleged corruption in the power purchases by the Telangana energy department and Telangana power distribution companies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-congress-chief-writes-to-pm-modi-for-cbi-probe-into-srisailam-power-station-mishap/story-8UBtqFv2zLrdB5JuBFqraO.html

31-08-2020||India||Twin murders rock Kerala on Onam, CPM and Congress trade charges||The murder of two Democratic Youth Federation of India (DFYI) activists allegedly by a group of Youth Congress workers late Sunday night on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram rocked Kerala on the harvest festival of Onam.Police said Midhilaj (30) and Mohammad Haq (28) were waylaid and attacked with sharp-edged weapons when they were returning home on Sunday night. One person died on the spot and the other succumbed to injuries at the hospital, they said. The DFYI, which is the youth wing of the ruling CPI (M), alleged that the Youth Congress workers were behind the attack but the latter distanced itself from the twin murder.State Congress president Mullappally Ramachandran also said a tiff between two gangs led to the murder and the CPI(M) was busy blaming the Congress to divert attention from the sensational gold smuggling case which has cast its shadow on the government. On Monday, angry DFYI activists clashed with Youth Congress workers at several places and the Kollam office of the district Congress committee was stoned. Five Youth Congress activists suffered injuries after their dharna site was attacked by DFYI workers in the state capital. “It was a well planned murder. The Congress leadership will have to explain a lot why they carried out such brutal murders on Onam,” said CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. But the police said the area had witnessed minor clashes between two groups in the last two weeks and they suspect the latest incident was a sequel to this. The deceased were block-level leaders of the DYFI. The CPI (M) observed Monday as a black day in protest.The Youth Congress said its workers had no role in it and a turf war between two gangs led to killings. “We condemn the murder in strongest terms. If anyone is involved, we will take strong action. We will not shield murderers like the CPI(M),” said Youth Congress state president Shafi Parambhil. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also condemned the killings. According to the police, the attack took place around 11.30 pm when the deceased were returning home on their motorcycle. They were waylaid and attacked by a group of five people. The victims received more than 25 stab wounds. CCTV visuals from the area showed the deceased also resisted the attack and it continued for 15 minutes. Thiruvananthapuram rural police superintendent B Ashokan said four people have been detained in connection with the murder. Deputy Inspector General of Police Sanjay Kumar Gurudin said the real motive behind the murder can be established only after investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twin-murders-rock-kerala-on-onam-cpm-and-congress-trade-charges/story-kgtTX8KyAnCnkEZogmMFqM.html

31-08-2020||India||Jobless migrant workers in Bengal become cross-border smugglers||On the night of August 23, the Border Security Force nabbed a 25-year-old youth Ahsan Ali from West Bengal’s Murshidabad district when he was allegedly trying to smuggle cattle to Bangladesh across the border. During interrogation, Ali told the officials that he used to work as a labourer in Kerala and had returned to his native village in Murshidabad because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as he was jobless, he was lured to smuggling by another villager. Ali, however, is not the only one. When BSF apprehended 42-year-old Nitai Mondol on August 27 from Nadia district, while allegedly trying to smuggle Phensedyl cough syrup to Bangladesh, he told the officers during interrogation that he took to smuggling after losing his job because of the lockdown. He used to work as a vendor in Howrah and earn around Rs 8,000 per month. For every smuggling consignment he was promised Rs 300. Over the past few months, BSF officials have intercepted quite a few cases in which jobless migrant workers who returned from other states are being lured to smuggling and trafficking with the promise of easy money. Even women are being lured to join the trade to smuggle Phensedyl, yaba tablets and jewelry. More than 100 people have been arrested in the past one month. While migrant workers started arriving in the state from the end of May, BSF have apprehended 104 people allegedly involved in smuggling cases in June and July. In 2019, 80 people were nabbed and in 2018, 39 people were nabbed in these two months. This year between June and August, 21 human traffickers were apprehended. In 2018 BSF apprehended only two traffickers in these three months. In 2019 none were arrested.“Some jobless migrant workers are being targeted and lured into criminal activities including cross-border smuggling of cattle and narcotics with the promise of easy money. Some have already been apprehended and have spilled the names of those involved. The BSF is alert and keeping a close watch,” said SS Guleria, deputy inspector general (South Bengal Frontier) of BSF. While the BSF has managed to bring down cattle smuggling and infiltration, smuggling of smaller items such as yaba tablets, ganja, Phensedyl and jewelry still continues. The smugglers just throw the items in pouches over the boundary fence. Innovative ways like hiding smuggled items inside cattle carcasses floating down the river are also used. According to data from the 2011 census, Bengal ranks fourth among the states from where people migrate. Between 2001 and 2011, 5.8 lakh people had migrated from Bengal. Murshidabad, a border district accounts for the most migration among all districts. “More than 10 lakh migrant workers have returned to the state during the pandemic. The state government has already engaged nearly six lakhs in 100-day work programme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,” said a senior official of the state government. The Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state in the country. Out of the 4,096 km long Indo-Bangla border, West Bengal alone shares 2,216 km with the neighbouring country. In south Bengal, the border is more than 900 km long out which nearly 60% is riverine. The Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly in West Bengal, is also one of the most porous. Data placed by the Union ministry of home affairs in the Parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 security agencies arrested 1,175, 1,118 and 1,351 people along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India. Migrant workers started returning to the state when Shramik Special trains were allowed in mid-May. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that the government would create a database of migrant workers on the basis of their skills so that a bank of manpower could be created and the migrant workers could be provided with livelihood opportunities. “Several migrant workers have already started returning to their place of work in other states as they could not find any job in Bengal,” said a senior official of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jobless-migrant-workers-in-bengal-become-cross-border-smugglers/story-SDPjsiQyQXfNDkNBb8KEON.html
31-08-2020||India||The other side of Pranab babu||Chowdhury Charan Singh brandished sheets of paper in the Lok Sabha, read out what he termed as the forthcoming union budget and accused then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of leaking the sovereign document to the International Monetary Fund (a three-letter abbreviation but a four-letter word back at the time).Gandhi panicked momentarily and summoned her finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the other House of Parliament. Mukherjee came, heard Singh for a few seconds and turned to Gandhi to reassure her that things were under control.After Singh’s tirade ended, Pranab spoke briefly: “What you read is correct, but you didn’t see the date of the speech. It is my last year’s speech,” the young finance minister quipped and the Congress benches erupted into laughter.Also read | ‘A scholar par excellence’: PM Modi condoles demise of Pranab MukherjeeMukherjee, India’s politician for all seasons was close to Gandhi, but his decision to contest the 1980 Lok Sabha polls irked her. After the results came out (and Mukherjee lost miserably) a furious Indira Gandhi dialled him at Kolkata to say, “Everyone knew that you will lose. Even Geeta (as friends called Mukherjee’s wife) knew it. But still you went ahead and created trouble for me.”Two days later, another call came. This time, Sanjay Gandhi spoke: “Mummy is very angry with you. But she also said, ‘There can’t be any cabinet without Pranab’. Take a flight for Delhi tomorrow.”In later years, when the rest of Lutyens’ Delhi was asleep, Mukherjee would narrate these stories -- immaculate portraits of his past with minute details (he even remembered what Gandhi ate when she met Margaret Thatcher for the first time).Gandhi, Mukherjee’s political mentor, also told him to appoint a teacher to improve his English accent. He refused saying, “Madam, what is done cannot be undone. Don’t try to make a square out of a circle.”His Hindi was worse, even after spending five decades in Delhi. Mukherjee’s adversaries in Congress once approached then PM Narsimha Rao to shunt him to a gubernatorial role in UP. Rao told them, “As it is half of our vote base has gone to Mulayam Singh Yadav. If Pranab goes to UP, the remaining voters will also run away when they hear his Hindi.”FROM THE ARCHIVES | ‘Pranab, I know of the consequences’: Indira on storming Golden TempleAn avid reader, and history lover (World War 2 was his favourite part of history), Mukherjee was a foodie till he turned 40 and resorted to a diet -- chapatis that were only slightly larger than drink coasters.But when then railway minister Lalu Prasad boasted about the mangoes and lychees of Muzaffarpur at a UPA cabinet meeting, Mukherjee couldn’t remain silent. “You are wrong. The best mango and lychee are found in my electoral district of Murshidabad,” he announced. And as proof of the pudding, he started gifting specially packed mangoes and lychees to all his ministerial colleagues, allies— even key opposition leaders—every year to build a consensus on Murshidabad mangos.In the Congress, his favourite juniors were Shashi Tharoor, Kapil Sibal, Jairam Ramesh, Kamal Nath and Ghulam Nabi Azad. When Tharoor landed in trouble over his “holy cow” tweet, Mukherjee came to his rescue but also cautioned him : “This is the Congress party not circus party”. He disliked socializing in the Delhi circuit and listed that he had attended just one personal dinner in Delhi -- hosted by Sibal. He backed Kamal Nath on several key issues but when Nath argued for almost 15 minutes at a cabinet meeting for adding Chhindwara to Aspirational Districts’s list, an exasperated Mukherjee stopped him, “Kamal, this is the union cabinet, not your gram panchayat meeting.” He called Ramesh “Joyram” and Pawan Bansal, his junior minister in finance, as “a boy”.For the chief trouble-shooter of the party, number 13 was, surprisingly, a lucky number. He got married on July 13; both his residence at Talkatora Road and parliament office were number 13; and he was the 13th person to become the President of India.Mukherjee’s wife put her foot down to proposals to shift home after he became defence minister. But the small bungalow at 13, Talkatora Road was the big world of strategies and policies. Left-UPA meetings on the Indo-US Nuclear Deal, phone calls with world leaders, interacting with top industrialists and even drafting key party documents like amendments of the Congress’ Constitution—all happened in that bungalow. Mukherjee was famous for working till late at night but once told Montek Singh Ahluwalia, “I can read files till 2 am but as soon as I start reading Planning Commission reports, I fall asleep.”FROM THE ARCHIVES | Pranab Mukherjee recalls how Rajiv Gandhi became PM after Indira’s deathPrime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was once his next-door neighbour when they both lived near Safdarjung road. In an interview to HT after Vajpayee’s death, Mukherjee described how Vajpayee asked his late wife, Suvra Mukherjee, to oversee all preparations for Vajpayee’s foster daughter Namita’s marriage. The late Biju Patnaik would at times drop in to relish Hilsa fish at the Mukherjee household and even offered a recipe for Hilsa.Pranabda couldn’t use a computer. His pastime revolved around books. And Aamir Khan’s Rang de Basanti was the first Hindi film he watched. Then censor board chief Sharmila Tagore was hesitant as the film involves revenge on India’s defence minister. She wanted Mukherjee to watch it first.Mukherjee, then defence minister, watched the first half and left the Mahadev Road theatre, telling a bewildered Khan and Tagore: “My job is to protect the country, not give censor certificate to films.”The next, and possibly his last, Hindi film was Piku. He invited Lal Krishna Advani, a film buff, to Rashtrapati Bhavan to watch the film that revolved around the relationship between an aged father and his daughter—a theme that played out in both the leaders’ daily lives too.Over 18 years since this writer’s first meeting with Pranab babu, he has been the source of many everlasting memories, some avuncular raps on the knuckles, and a witnes to a deeply embarrassing moment -- the rendition of a lesser-known Rabindrasangeet mid-air in the Presidential flight. It didn’t go wellAlways eager to pursue knowledge, Pranab Mukherjee called this writer to his suite on the return flight and announced that he had got someone to download the song so that he could memorize its lyrics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-mukherjee-passes-away-the-other-side-of-pranab-babu/story-EewFN8vDDGmiJiTWH9avSJ.html

Dr Naresh Napalchyal, president of Provincial Medical Association, the body of doctors associated with the state government said, “We have been working continuously for months now, without caring about our families or personal lives and still, we are not treated with the respect we deserve. Doctors in all other states are being given incentives or pay hikes for working extra hours and here the state government deducts a day’s salary.” The salary deduction was a reference to the government’s step to deduct a day’s salary from its employees for the chief minister’s relief fund. The step was announced when the Covid-pandemic hit the state but the monthly deductions are still continuing. Dr Napalchyal added that in January, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had announced that doctors doing their post-graduation and working will be given full salary, but that has not been implemented till now. “The chief minister had himself announced that doctors who are doing their post-graduation and working will get a full salary, but even after so many months, no government order has been issued in this regard. Despite shift duties, we work 24x7 but we are not treated properly. Regular inspections are conducted by tehsildars or revenue officials on instructions of district magistrates, which give out a message to the public that the doctors are not working properly,” he said.The doctors said that they are giving a week’s time to the state government to hold talks with them, after which they will either opt for taking voluntary retirement (only those doctors who have already worked for almost 20 years) or go for mass resignation. Dr. SK Gupta, director of the state medical and health department said that the doctors gave a memorandum with their demands to the director general of health in the state on Monday. “We will be talking to the doctors and come to a solution. All our staff are responsible and will not take any step which will cause inconvenience to the people of the state during an epidemic,” said Dr. Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-700-uttarakhand-govt-doctors-threaten-mass-resignation-over-pay-hike-delay/story-IuvJbtbAZl53YQO9kTAH9N.html

The GDP data had shown that consumer spending slowing, private investments and exports contracting in the March quarter.Experts had said the country’s economy was expected to contract mainly because this quarter had seen more of the 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were enforced by the government from March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Data showed earlier that India’s GDP growth had slowed even before the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions. The growth rate in Q4 FY20 at 3.1% was the weakest point in the new data series that had started in 2012-2013. The FY20 real GDP growth is 4.2%, which is also the weakest in the series.India’s economy grew at its weakest pace since 2013 between April and June period last year as consumer demand and government spending slowed amid global trade frictions, raising chances of the central bank cutting interest rates further at its next meeting.

The police seized Rs 5.23 lakh cash besides two laptop computers, 20 ATM cards, bank pass books, two memory cards, 30 SIM cards and three motorcycles from their possession.During initial scanning of bank passbooks, the police found transactions of over Rs 1 crore between July 7 and July 30. Bilaspur’s superintendent of police Prashant Agrawal said over phone that two of the five men are the main culprits and others were probably relatives of the accused.“During the investigation, the Cyber Crime team analysed the call data records (CDR), obtained bank account statements and account holder details. The team located the offenders at Nawada and apprehended them,” Agarwal added.According to a police report, the victim identified as C L Patel, 80, was lured into depositing a huge sum of money with a call saying “Congratulations, you have won a luxury car.”According to police officials, such victims are generally told to keep the winning secret. “No lottery can be won unless a ticket is purchased and normally the processing fees are deducted from the prize money,” officials warn.Patel, currently residing in Sakra police station area of Bilaspur, has lodged a complaint with concerned police station on July 30 that he had received a call from a noted automobile company informing him that he had been selected for a prize in a lucky draw due to a purchase from online marketplace Flipkart. Patel said he was contacted by a person and asked to deposit processing fee, taxes and other charges in an account number to release the luxury car.He deposited Rs 14.5 lakh in a bank account provided by the accused. The money was transferred through the branch of a nationalized bank based in Sakra. But after the money was deposited, they did not respond to his calls. When he did not receive the car, he visited the showroom only to realise that he had been cheated.Meanwhile, Pakribarama (in Nawada district) sub divisional police officer Mukesh Kumar Saha said following a tip-off provided by Chhattisgarh police, a joint team carried out a raid at Warshaliganj area and arrested five suspects involved in the fraud. Ahead of their arrest, the accused had been under mobile surveillance.

31-08-2020||India||Treat doctors losing lives in Covid fight at par with martyrs of armed forces: IMA to PM||The Indian Medical Association has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking that all doctors who have died of Covid-19 be treated at par with martyrs of the armed forces, and their dependents be provided government jobs in accordance with their qualifications. In a letter to the prime minister, the country’s largest body of doctors said only an “inclusive national solatium” for all doctors who have lost their lives fighting the pandemic would render justice to the sacrifice of their families. The IMA cited government data and said 87,000 healthcare workers had been infected and 573 of them had lost their lives due to Covid-19. However, the Centre has not officially released these figures. Noting that the data has raised concerns all across the country, the IMA said its data for doctors alone has registered 307 deaths and a total 2,006 infected. It said 188 of those died are general practitioners who are the first point of contact for people. “Doctors suffer a higher viral load and a higher CFR (Case Fatality Rate) as a community. IMA is constrained to point out that they could have stayed back at home during the epidemic safely. They chose to serve the nation in the best traditions of the medical profession,” said the letter dated August 30. The solatium approved by the government for their colleagues in government services in all fairness is deserved by the children of these martyrs as well, the association said. “All doctors who have laid down their lives in fighting this epidemic should be treated at par with the martyrs of Indian Armed Forces and acknowledged appropriately. The surviving spouse or dependent should be provided a government job as per their qualifications,” the IMA said. It also raised the issue that whatever solatium that is in place had failed to reach the beneficiaries due to the inadequacy of the chosen instrument and the “indifference”. “The scheme is reported to have been lapsed as well. There is a pressing need to reconsider the same on merit and create a dedicated system to administer,” the IMA said. A national scheme to support the “soldiers fighting a pandemic” cannot be allowed to degenerate into just another pecuniary benefit for government servants, it said. “We once again appeal to your goodself that such a sacrifice by doctors needs to be acknowledged by the highest office of the nation irrespective of the sectors,” the IMA said in the letter to Modi. “We are also writing to you at this juncture since it has been predicted that India will top the world in number of cases in a few weeks. Healthcare manpower is precious. Uniform practices have to be put in place throughout the country,” it said. The IMA said substantial differences were noticed from district to district in how doctors and healthcare workers were deployed. It asserted that districts were not sensitive to the safety angle, and the concerns of stress and fatigue of the medical manpower. Noting that the nation deserves a radical approach to the situation, the IMA appealed to the prime minister for the government to bring in appropriate reforms, which it said were long overdue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-doctors-losing-lives-in-covid-fight-at-par-with-martyrs-of-armed-forces-ima-to-pm/story-sVJEPiY6wO1qG1WDzwcTZM.html

Varanasi, the PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency, is a hub of wooden toys which are made in the city’s Kashmiriganj Khojwan area.“We are very happy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the toy industry and also pitched for its promotion. I am sure the golden days of the wooden toy industry will be back soon,” he said.The artisans would strive to make Varanasi’s toy industry worth Rs 70 crore in the next one year, he added.In his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’, PM Modi on Sunday appealed to start-up entrepreneurs to “team up for toys”, saying it was the time to get “vocal” for local toys.Also read: Toy cluster at Koppala can generate 40,000 jobs in 5 years - Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa“Around 3,000 artisans, including craftsmen and craftswomen, earn their livelihood by making toys out of wood (in Varanasi),” said Dr Rajnikant, a Padma Shri awardee who works for the conservation and promotion of traditional crafts.The wooden toys are exported to the United States, Russia, Latin American countries, European countries, including Germany and Spain, several South-East Asian countries and the Gulf, Dr Rajnikant stated. These are also in demand in different states of the country.Lacquerware and wooden toys made in Varanasi, Sonbhadra, Chandauli and Mirzapur got the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2015 following his efforts, he added.GI is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (a town, region or country). The GI tag ensures that none other than those registered as authorised users, or at least those residing inside the geographic territory, are allowed to use the popular product name.Dr Rajnikant also said he was instrumental in getting the GI tag for a total of 12 products in Varanasi and the adjoining areas.About 15 years ago, the Varanasi wooden toy cottage industry suffered a jolt due to a flood of Chinese plastic toys in the market. But the local industry’s condition started improving in 2015 after it got the GI tag.“We make traditional wooden toys, including wooden utensils, lattoo (spinning top), small wooden birds and animals. We also carve many decorative items out of wood. These are especially used on the occasions of Shri Krishna Janmashtami and Deepawali,” said Rameshwar Singh, adding that he learned the craft from his father Ramkhelawan Singh at the age of ten. Rameshwar has been engaged in making wooden toys for over three decades now.Sunita Devi, Pushpa and Geeta, who also give shape to wooden toys, echoed the same sentiments.Shivanand Maurya, a master artisan, said the wooden toys made in Varanasi were unique, beautiful and sustainable. They were made of mango, mahua and eucalyptus wood, he added.“We are preserving the traditional art of making wooden toys. With the PM pitching for increasing the share of Indian toys in the global industry, we hope that the wooden toys made in Varanasi and adjoining pockets would further strengthen and expand their presence in the global market,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pm-s-pitch-kashi-artisans-hope-to-add-golden-chapter-to-their-toy-story/story-uqfmROWhT7KAG1fgI65eKM.html

The court said that since the Centre had issued new guidelines under Unlock 4, more people would come to Delhi and that it was important to check the spread of the virus.The high court also asked the state government to re-strategise its policy for testing Covid-19 patients in the national capital to accommodate asymptomatic patients in the wake of the increasing number of cases. A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad was hearing a plea filed through advocate Rakesh Malhotra on ramping up the number of tests in the city.“You ( Delhi government ) thought that you had slayed the dragon (Covid-19). However, this dragon has several heads which is making life miserable for people. Cases are rising in the city every day,” the court said while expressing concern on the increasing number of cases in the city.Expressing dissatisfaction on the number of tests conducted, the court sought to know from Dr Nivedita Gupta from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), whether the strategy with respect to testing in Delhi can be changed. To this, Gupta said that ICMR is only an advisory body and is going to come out with fresh guidelines.She, however, stated, that its guidelines do not stop any state government from coming out with their own rules. Citing the example of Punjab, Gupta said that the state government had done away with the need for prescription for getting tests conducted. She said that Maharashtra has also tweaked its (ICMR) rules according to its own needs.To this, the court asked the Delhi government about the possibility of opening private labs for RT-PCR tests of asymptomatic patients, so much so that it does not affect the current functioning of the labs.Dr Nutan Mundeja, DGHS, Delhi government, told the court that it would re-strategise the policy/plan for testing. “We expect the Delhi government to come up with an advisory for private persons..,” the bench said.During the hearing, the court was given a comparative study of the two Sero Survelliance that has been conducted in the city. The bench observed that the data showed a steep rise in Covid-19 cases in three districts—south east, south and West Delhi—while stating that the result was alarming.It observed that the report pointed out that a significant number of the population was asymptomatic which acted as “silent spreaders” and caused damage to the city. It said that there is an urgent need for testing such persons to curb the further spread more so because everything has been thrown open in Unlock-4 guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-asks-govt-to-set-up-testing-centres-at-bus-stops-for-migrants/story-ijHHnWvpWV0b6BJ9DNKcHP.html

Read full statement here||Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who was found guilty of contempt by the Supreme Court, said that he will happily accept the judgement, but would file a review.“I propose to submit myself to this order and respectful pay the fine. But I reserve the right to seek the review of the conviction and sentencing,” Bhushan said while reading from a statement at a press conference in New Delhi.Bhushan was held guilty by the apex court for criminal contempt of court on August 14 over his tweets against the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. Here is the full statement by Prashant Bhushan on SC’s verdict:The Supreme Court of India has announced its verdict on the contempt case against me. It holds me guilty of contempt of court and has decided to impose a fine of Re 1, and failing that imprisonment of three months and debarring me from practicing for three years. I had already said in my first statement to the Court: “I am here to cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted upon me for what the Court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen”. Therefore, while I reserve the right to seek a review of the conviction and sentencing, by way of an appropriate legal remedy, I propose to submit myself to this order and will respectfully pay the fine, just as I would have submitted to any other lawful punishment. I have had the greatest respect for the institution of the Supreme Court. I have always believed it to be the last bastion of hope, particularly for the weak and the oppressed who knock at its door for the protection of their rights, often against a powerful executive. My tweets were not intended in any way to disrespect the Supreme Court or the judiciary as a whole, but were merely meant to express my anguish, at what I felt, was a deviation from its sterling past record. This issue was never about me versus the Hon’ble Judges, much less about me vs the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court of India wins, every Indian wins. Every Indian wants a strong and independent judiciary. Obviously if the courts get weakened, it weakens the republic and harms every citizen. I am extremely grateful and humbled by the solidarity and support expressed by countless persons, ex-judges, lawyers, activists and fellow citizens who encouraged me to remain firm and true to my beliefs and conscience. They strengthen my hope that this trial may draw the country’s attention to the cause of freedom of speech and judicial accountability and reform. What is very heartening is that this case has become a watershed moment for freedom of speech and seems to have encouraged many people to stand up and speak out against the injustices in our society. I would be failing in my duty if I do not thank my legal team, especially senior Advocates Dr Rajeev Dhawan and Shri Dushyant Dave. I am more confident now than ever before that truth shall prevail. Long live democracy! Satyameva Jayate!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watershed-moment-for-freedom-of-speech-prashant-bhushan-on-sc-verdict-read-full-statement-here/story-0d5l0wvefmBhkmhaoqdwvL.html

Negi, on the other hand, has accused the Congress of hatching a conspiracy against him. A few days ago, he had asked the police for a Narco test to prove his innocence in the case. He also demanded that the woman, whose rape he is allegedly accused of, should also take the test. The woman has accused the BJP MLA of raping and says she has a daughter with him. She also demanded that a DNA test be conducted on Negi and her daughter to ‘reveal the truth’. “We will hold a protest at our state headquarters and district offices demanding a case against Negi as, despite a complaint by a woman with serious accusations of rape, no case has been registered against him yet,” said Pritam Singh, Congress state president. Also read: First cases of Covid-19 deaths emerge in Uttarakhand PoliceAlleging the administration of working under the pressure of the ruling BJP, he said, “We are not involved in the case in any way but have come forward in the matter after seeing that no action has been taken against Negi, but the woman was booked for extortion and blackmailing Negi’s wife on the same day.” Singh said that the allegations against an MLA are serious on which a DNA test should be done to reveal the truth. “The CM and MLA Negi have both said that they have no problem with the DNA test then why is the government not initiating any legal process for it? It should be done to reveal the truth. If Negi is found guilty, strict action should be taken against him and if the accusations are found to be false then the woman should be punished as per the law,” said Singh. The BJP, meanwhile, said that the Congress’ move to hold protests proves that Negi’s allegations of the party’s involvement in a conspiracy against him are true. Devendra Bhasin, party state vice-president said, “With the way Congress is moving in this matter, it is just proving Negi’s allegations of a conspiracy by it to be right.” “Secondly, it seems that they are not aware of the law which says that if a complaint is lodged by anyone which is related to an existing case, then it is clubbed in the probe of that case. The police are probing the case as per law and we are waiting for the results to be out,” said Bhasin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-congress-to-hold-state-wide-protests-demanding-fir-case-against-rape-accused-bjp-mla/story-oxeF4VtfuV1qO4RZrkttoI.html

Everyday there is a Chinese intrusion ... Pangong Tso lake area, Gogra and Galwan valley, Depsang plains, Lipulekh pass, Doka La and Naku La. Our armed forces are standing fearlessly to protect Mother India. But when will Modiji show his red eyes?”Patra said the issue pertaining to China is not about a single party but about the country. He said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has issued a statement in which it said that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops tried to violate Indian sovereignty, but its attempts were thwarted.“The BJP and the people of India salute the Indian Army. The bravery with which they have discharged their duty and protected India’s sovereignty deserves our salute,” he said.Also Read: Chinese troops ‘strictly’ abide by the LAC, never cross the line: BeijingAttacking the Congress, he said, “India and Modi ji have shown their red eyes (laal aankh).

Everyone has trust in the Indian Army and Modiji, and stands by them.”Patra said nobody played with the country’s sovereignty.“I want to ask Randeep Singh Surjewala and Rahul Gandhi that we have red eyes, but why do you have moist eyes? Whenever we are attacked or we carry out a surgical strike to destroy terrorist camps, then why do you start crying? You should be happy,” he said.Our army has valour, and our government and the PM have self-confidence, he added. In a fresh incident in eastern Ladakh, the Chinese PLA had carried out “provocative military movements” to “unilaterally” change the status quo ante on the southern bank of Pangong Tso lake but the attempt was thwarted by Indian troops, the Army had said in a statement earlier in the day.Patra also levelled a series of allegations at the Congress. He alleged that there were contributions made by Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapur, fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi and absconding Islamic cleric Zakir Naik or companies linked to them to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sambit-patra-hits-outs-at-congress-on-china-issue-contributions-to-rgf/story-sqAf5MkAGddDoYDqCXCATO.html

The CM has now assured me that the government will issue Standard Operating procedures for devotees and open temples in next eight days. I welcome his decision,” Ambedkar told reporters.When Ambedkar arrived at the Shivaji square, a massive crowd accompanied him to enter the temple. As he began marching towards the temple with a select number of followers, police stopped him and asked him to wait for administration’s response to a letter Ambedkar had handed over to the District Collector.“I had given a letter to Solapur district collector for allowing us to enter the temple. The collector responded after talking to the government and allowed 15 people to enter the temple,” Ambedkar said.To prevent protesters from entering the temple, the local administration at Pandharpur had put up checkpoints at entry and exit points to the temple town while barricading the roads leading to Lord Vitthal temple.Several pilgrim organisations have extended their support to VBA agitation seeking the opening of religious places across Maharashtra.According to Solapur Superintendent of Police, Manoj Patil, notices have been issued to VBA workers. “We have served them notices under section 149 of CrPC. We have also barricaded streets leading to the temple in order to prevent anyone visiting the religious place,” Patil said. The notices asked protesters not to break the law.To prevent anyone from entering the temple town, authorities had suspended the state transport bus service to Pandharpur for a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-allows-prakash-ambedkar-to-visit-temple-in-pandharpur-after-protest-by-vba/story-IcK14HYjaJrita8iXJuRXM.html

31-08-2020||India||Now, Uttar Pradesh set to launch 594-km Ganga Expressway||After giving momentum to the construction of three expressways -- Purvanchal, Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur-Link amid the fight against Covid pandemic -- the Uttar Pradesh government is geared up to launch construction of the 594-km Ganga Expressway. The Uttar Pradesh Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) has planned to construct the expressway, said to be the dream project of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, in 12 packages. “We have decided to invite international open bids for construction of the expressway. The state government is working to start the construction of the expressway in the current financial year and to open it for public by 2023,” said UPEIDA, CEO, Awanish Kumar Awasthi. Yogi had announced construction of Ganga expressway -- connecting Meerut with Prayagraj -- during Kumbh-2019. The project was pending for the last 15 years. Immediately, after the CM’s announcement, the government started work on the state’s longest, six-lane (expandable to eight lanes) expressway connecting west UP with east UP immediately, Awasthi said. The expressway will start from NH-235, near Shankarpur village in Meerut and will end at NH 330 near Soraon in Prayagraj district. The government has sanctioned Rs 37,350 crore for the project of which Rs 9,500 crore will be spent on acquisition of land and Rs 24,091 on the construction works. The unique aspect of Ganga Expressway is that it will link other expressways in the state through Lucknow-Agra Expressway, Purvanchal Expressway and Ballia Link Expressway. Once completed, the total network of expressways in Uttar Pradesh will be 1,900 km and provide pace to industrial, agriculture development and draw investments in various sectors, Awasthi said. The state government has planned to launch a massive plantation drive along the Ganga expressway. “UP is one of the major importers of paper. In the coming years, it will turn into a major supplier of paper and other products,” he said. The expressway will pass through 12 districts -- Meerut, Bulandshahar, Hapur, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjhanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj. Yogi has asked UPEIDA to consider linking the proposed expressway with Varanasi and facilitate movement of traffic from Haridwar to the expressway. The expressway will give fillip to the tourism and pilgrimage and UPEIDA plans to connect all important tourist and religious spots with the high speed corridor for fast movement of traffic,” Awasthi said. The chief minister has told UPEIDA that design of the expressway should minimise road accidents. To check road accidents, the expressway will have a 15-metre wide depressed median and raised profile edge lines will be provided on both sides on the main carriageway, which will alert road users and reduce road accidents. Advanced traffic management system will be provided all along the expressway, Awasthi said. The design speed of the expressway will be 120 kmph whereas travelling speed will be 100 kmph. To check movement of stray cattle and locals, a precast concrete boundary wall will be constructed along the expressway. For public convenience, way-side amenities will be provided, Awasthi said. All cities, towns, highways and roads on the expressway will be connected with the 19 inter-changes. The agency hired by UPEIDA -- M/s LN Malviya Infra Projects Private Limited and Infratech Civil Solutions, Bhopal -- is likely to complete the final detailed project report (DPR) by August 31. Details of the land acquisition plan have also been finalised. Once it gets approval by the state cabinet and financial approval, work on the project will commence, he said. “Along with fighting the Covid pandemic, the state government is pushing the expressway project fast. We have been able to control the spread of the coronavirus infection and maintain the morale of personnel engaged in development projects,” Awasthi said. A consortium of banks has been formed for construction of Purvnachal, Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur Link expressways. UPEIDA will complete all the projects in scheduled time, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-uttar-pradesh-set-to-launch-594-km-ganga-expressway/story-YmpyrzdfmBCB0Ab1lpkC8L.html
31-08-2020||India||When will PM show his ‘red eyes’ to China, asks Congress||The Congress on Monday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Chinese aggression in the Ladakh sector along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) and asked when he would show his “red eyes” to Beijing. Randeep Singh Surjewala, chief spokesperson, Congress, said the PM and defence minister Rajnath Singh should inform the nation about the situation on the borders with China. “There has been another brazen attempt at aggression by China in Pangong Tso lake. Everyday there is a Chinese intrusion ... Pangong Tso lake area, Gogra and Galwan Valley, Depsang plains, Lipulekh pass, Doka La and Naku La,” he said. “Our armed forces are standing fearlessly to protect Mother India. But, when will Modiji show his red eyes to China?” he asked. In a fresh incident in Ladakh, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had carried out “provocative military movements to unilaterally change the status quo” on the southern bank of Pangong Tso lake in the intervening night of August 29 and 30, but the attempt was thwarted by Indian troops, army spokesperson Col Aman Anand said. He said Chinese troops “violated” the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements in the ongoing standoff in eastern Ladakh.

The imagery, shared by the open source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter, shows the suspected heliport under construction at the tri-junction of the borders of India, Bhutan and China, and at a distance of about 100 km from Doka La (Doka pass) and Naku La (Naku pass). “Suspected PLA heliport infrastructure spotted [as] part of an ongoing investigation near the #Doklam region of the #India #China #Bhutan tri junction, this support unit could sustain all weather & rapid troop deployments in the sector along with improving surveillance operations,” the analyst tweeted.  Suspected PLA heliport infrastructure spotted part of an ongoing investigation near the #Doklam region of the #India #China #Bhutan tri junction, this support unit could sustain all weather & rapid troop deployments in the sector along with improving surveillance operations https://t.co/aOeZ3deGzI pic.twitter.com/ycS32tFxJeThe suspected heliport is located almost equidistant from the two sites at which the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing surface-to-air missile facilities, according to imagery tweeted earlier by @detresfa. Both the missile facilities are near what have been described as “suspected early warning radar sites” opposite Sikkim state. In a graphic posted on Twitter, @detresfa said the “steady build-up of support infrastructure by the People’s Liberation Army of China [near] areas with a history of clashes [and] disputed territorial claims demonstrates the long-term Chinese ambitions in these sectors”. ALSO READ | New satellite imagery suggests China developing missile bases to cover Doklam, Naku La“With the addition of a heliport along with area denial systems within 100 km from Doka La [and] Naku La, China would be able to sustain all weather operations in the disputed areas regardless of the harsh terrain [and] conditions,” according to the graphic. The new missile facilities are located roughly 50 km from Naku La (Naku pass), where troops from the two countries had clashed on May 9, and Doka La (Doka pass), close to the Doklam plateau that was the scene of a 73-day military standoff between India and China in 2017. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured in the clash at Naku La, the second such reported incident since the current standoff began in early May. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the reported development of the heliport and the missile sites by the Chinese. After the end of the Doklam standoff in 2017 following several rounds of negotiations, there were reports the Chinese side hadn’t fully pulled back its troops from the area. There were also reports that Chinese troops had built trenches, fortified positions and infrastructure to support operations by helicopters and aircraft in the area. Last month, Hindustan Times had first reported that China had officially stated for the first time that it has a boundary dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, a development with significant implications for India as the region borders Arunachal Pradesh state, which is also claimed by Beijing. Earlier this month, @detresfa had used open source satellite imagery to report that China had stepped up work on military infrastructure opposite Lipulekh region in Uttarakhand. The infrastructure included a surface-to-air missile site on the banks of Mansarovar Lake in Tibet. The imagery showed what appeared to be two sites at which PLA is creating new infrastructure and accommodation. Both are not far from the Kalapani-Lipulekh region that is at the heart of a new border row between India and Nepal. These developments come against the backdrop of the Indian Army’s acknowledgement on Monday that its troops had pre-empted efforts by PLA to unilaterally change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of Pangong lake in the Ladakh sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-imagery-shows-pla-building-heliport-at-tri-junction-of-india-bhutan-and-china/story-a7d3LPqoHGo3JS8oQXx9xI.html

31-08-2020||India||Mega land allotment could turn Agra into a garment hub||The Taj city’s dreams of turning itself into a garment hub hinges on the allotment of approximately 45-acre of unutilized land for an integrated textile and apparel industrial park, say experts dealing with the issue. The land in question is owned by the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA). It is part of the 1,000-acre land parcel that was originally earmarked for a theme park project visualised by a prominent actor-cum-film-maker.While the textile park is expected to give employment to at least 25,000 workers, the theme park project is dying a slow death in files, those in the know of things have said.So far, two private developers have come forward to submit e-tenders of their expression of interest (EOI) to the state textile department for setting up of the integrated textile and apparel industrial park in Agra. “They submitted their EOIs on 20.08.2020 (August 8, 2020) pursuant to the policy of the department of textile. These EOIs are particularly important for Agra, which is an ecologically sensitive area, being part of the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ). In TTZ, no polluting industries are permitted,” said KC Jain, chairman of the legal cell of the National Chamber of Industries and Commerce (NCIC), Agra chapter. Also read: India’s GDP numbers could be worst in decades. What experts sayThese EOIs were invited for seven tentative locations - Meerut, Agra, Jhansi, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Lucknow and Kanpur.“Since garment manufacturing is classified as a white category industry by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), there are no environmental hassles in setting them up. Recently, a virtual meeting was also held on 26.08.2020 (August 26, 2020) by Rama Raman, additional chief secretary, textiles, to have a dialogue with these private developers who have been asked to submit their detailed project reports (DPRs) in 45 days,” Jain said. “One of these private developers, headed by Ashok Goyal of Surat, has asked for the allotment of 45 acres of land out of the 1,000 acres reserved for the ‘theme park’ in Agra. Owned by the UPSIDA, this land is located on Inner Ring Road with connectivity to the Yamuna Expressway and the Lucknow Expressway,” Jain added.Jain further said that the land for the theme park project should be utilised for the apparel park and industrial cluster. “The very purpose of the acquisition of the land for the theme park has become non-existent with the actor having given up on this project. This land for the theme park is lying unutilised since 2014 and the UPSIDA is incurring heavy liability on the payment of interest,” he said. Jain further said NCIC had recently conducted a demand survey of industrial plots in Agra. In the survey, 291 entrepreneurs responded and 206 favoured garment and accessories manufacturing units, reflecting the market demand. Once the apparel and textile park comes up, these entrepreneurs can begin to set up their units there.Ashok Goyal has also said the allotment is important as a government scheme envisages a subsidy of 50 percent on the purchase of land from a government agency. Without subsidy, it would not be possible to provide developed plots at an affordable price, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mega-land-allotment-could-turn-agra-into-a-garment-hub/story-SuEcHBFIo7o6acYIhOcLkI.html

Chandrashekhar Joshi, divisional forest officer (DFO) Ramnagar, where the incident happened, informed that the man was trampled to death when he took his cattle for grazing in the forest. “A 47-year-old man was trampled by an elephant in Devchauri range of Ramnagar forest division on Sunday evening around 6:45 pm. The man was grazing his cattle when he by mistake entered the reserve forest area and was attacked by the elephant,” said Joshi. He added that the man was injured and was rushed to a hospital by forest officials but was declared dead at the hospital. The deceased’s family is being given due compensation of Rs 3 lakh by the forest department. Aggression of some elephants in Uttarakhand’s Corbett and Rajaji National Park landscape, two bastions of wild elephants in the state, is a major concern for wildlife officials. Earlier, Bhuwan Ram, 51, a forest watcher was killed by an elephant in Karakot in the Haldwani forest division in the month of June. In July Parvati Devi, 60, a forest watcher’s wife, was attacked and killed in Kishanpur range of Terai east forest division. Parag Madhukar Dhakate, conservator of the western division in Kumaon, said that man-animal conflict has increased because of several reasons, including humans coming close to the forests for habitation. “The natural corridors have been encroached by humans and people go inside the forests and it’s a huge risk as forests are the territory of the wild animals. There is a need to sensitise people about man-animal conflict and how to avoid it.” In November last, a wild elephant killed two people in Haridwar when it went on a rampage in two villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/47-year-old-man-trampled-to-death-by-elephant-in-uttarakhand/story-zgtXAglLc4Lz0aqmFJkWbM.html

Ambedkar, who is grandson of BR Ambedkar, arrived at the Shivaji square where a large number of followers accompanied him to enter the temple. He later marched towards the temple with a select number of followers. “We have submitted a letter to Solapur district collector for allowing us to enter the temple. I am waiting for the administration’s response. I am appealing to all not to cross barricades put up by administration,” Ambedkar told reporters at Pandharpur. The local administration at Pandharpur has put up checkpoints at entry and exit points to the temple town while barricading the roads leading to Lord Vitthal temple in view of Monday’s agitation by the Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi (VBA).Several varkari organisations (pilgrims) have extended their support to VBA agitation that demands opening of religious places across Maharashtra.According to Solapur Superintendent of Police, Manoj Patil, notices have been issued to VBA workers. “We have served them notices under section 149 of CrPC. We have also barricaded streets leading to the temple in order to prevent anyone visiting the religious place,” Patil said. The notices asked protesters not to break the law.To prevent anyone from entering into the temple town, the state transport bus service has been suspended in Pandharpur for a day.Since March 25, all the places of worship across the state have been closed for devotees in view of Covid pandemic. However, there is a growing chorus from various sectors for opening temples and other religious places. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday staged ghatna-nad (bell ringing) agitation across the state pressing for its demand to open temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prakash-ambedkar-arrives-in-pandharpur-leads-march-to-reopen-temples/story-XEQe1Cxy9TSU8c8qJIZ4XM.html

The government should also provide data separately on the number of suspected Covid-19 cases and the cases being reported in urban and rural areas, Mavalankar said.“The disease will, of course, spread. Even high profile people are getting the disease. We need to focus on reducing the number of deaths. In terms of data, we need to ask the government to separate mild cases from moderate and severe,” he said.In Gujarat, Surat city has reported the highest number of new Covid-19 cases in recent times.“But, that alone should not concern us as only about 400 patients are hospitalised, and the rest, around 500, are in home isolation, taken care of by a dedicated team of doctors,” Surat Municipal Commissioner B N Pani said.There is a perception that the situation is quite bad because of the number of cases being very high. But a look at the bed occupancy shows the number of people in hospitals is very low, he said.“There are currently 872 active COVID-19 cases in Surat, out of whom 400 patients are hospitalised. Plasma therapy and medicines like Ramdesivir have helped treat severe cases and reduce the number of deaths. Early detection is also reducing the mortality,” he said.Pani said the Covid-19 death rate has come down in Surat and the severity of cases has also considerably decreased.He claimed Surat has achieved the highest number of plasma donations and use of plasma therapy in the entire country. So far, around 994 patients here have been given the plasma therapy, he added.Also, the civic body has formed a task force for the diamond and textiles industries and issued standard operating procedures for them.Till Sunday, Surat reported 20,855 Covid-19 cases and 809 deaths due to the disease. The state has so far reported 95,155 cases and 3,008 deaths, as per the health department. Gujarat Covid-19 task force member Dr Tushar Patel said though more new cases of the disease are being reported every day, a large number of patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.“Hence, the situation is not worrying as such patients get treated with home isolation,” he said.“There are active cases, but the number of critically ill patients has gone down, as we can see empty beds in ICUs of dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Active cases will remain, but at the same time the positivity rate has come down,” he said.Three months ago, reports of eight out of 10 people tested used to come out positive for Covid-19. Now only about two out of 10 come out positive, said Dr Patel, who is a pulmonologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-surge-not-so-worrying-if-serious-cases-deaths-are-low-experts/story-sfCc8Foscj17k3nN2k5TqM.html

31-08-2020||India||States can allow reservations for in-service candidates in PG medical courses: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the Medical Council of India (MCI) is not empowered to make regulations providing for reservation in favour of in-service candidates for admission to post-graduate medical courses.The five-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra held MCI is a body constituted for the regulation of medical education and profession but the right to provide reservation lies with the respective states. States, the bench held, can frame regulations for separate entry for such in-service candidates. Such doctors, who are already working, should, however, be mandated to serve in rural and tribal areas for five years.It held that MCI regulation that barred such reservation was unconstitutional and arbitrary. It has asked the states to formulate a scheme for rural and remote service by in-service doctors after completing their postgraduate degree.The ruling came on a plea by doctors from Kerala, Maharashtra and Haryana who said granting reservation benefits would encourage those working in government hospitals and in rural areas. The doctors had challenged the validity of the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, framed by MCI.At present, 50% seats in PG diploma courses are reserved for medical officers in the government service but MCI regulations barred it in PG degree courses. All admissions to PG degree courses are conducted through the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) exams and 50% seats are filled through all-India quota while the remaining 50% are from state quota.The in-service candidates had submitted that they work round the clock and hardly find any time to update their knowledge and compete with the general category merit candidates.The Centre and MCI had opposed the plea saying granting reservations or a separate source of entry for in-service candidates would directly impinge on the authority of MCI to coordinate and determine standards of medical education.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-allow-reservations-for-in-service-candidates-in-pg-medical-courses-supreme-court/story-cxFtp6c6Y8TPbMaHlQVbSJ.html

The move is in step with the increasing culture among political parties to adopt remote audio-visual means to inform and influence people. Bicycle is the election symbol of the SP.The SP soft-launched the Bicycle TV (on YouTube) on August 15 - with the Independence Day message by party president Akhilesh Yadav. Since then, in a fortnight, the media team of the party handling the channel has uploaded a dozen curated short video documentaries. Some of them are a scathing attack on the ruling BJP and its government on various issues while others are publicising the party and its previous government’s achievements.“The channel will be used to beam campaign, propagation of the party’s ideas and ideologies, previous SP government’s achievements, party’s future programmes, announcements, expose the ruling party and their lies, live press conferences and live party events,” said Abhishek Mishra, SP national secretary and former UP minister.If ‘Mission 2022: Baaees Main Bicycle (bicycle in 2022)’ nudges people to vote for the party in 2022 UP assembly elections, then ‘Save UP, the heart of India’ targets the UP government and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. One short film is focused on Agra-Lucknow Expressway and another one on 108 ambulances, while ‘Samajwadi Hausala (socialist grit) highlights the lathicharge on SP youth volunteers’ incident of August 28. Some other BicycleTV video stories are: Bhagwan sabke hai (God belong to all), mismanagement of government hospitals in Covid-19 and Dharti-putra Mulayam Singh Yadav--the political journey of the party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav.The party has a team of media experts, researchers, curators, photographers and videographers that is creating content for the Bicycle TV. The SP is the only regional party in UP to have an active channel, though it is not the first one to venture into it. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) had launched a channel three years ago, but the channel has been dormant for two years. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) does not have one yet. Both Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress have their active YouTube channels with a large subscription base, but they are of the national outfit and not of UP counterparts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-launches-bicycle-tv-to-expand-reach/story-1JpJbKeQZlp5PXiMefaD1M.html

He cited the need to prevent misuse of social and online news media platforms and added summoning Facebook’s representatives in this regard is within his mandate. Also read: Kerala Congress chief steps in after party leader attacks Shashi TharoorThe panel has summoned the social media company’s representatives over a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report this month that said Facebook’s India policy head, Ankhi Das, opposed applying hate-speech rules to a BJP politician whose posts targeted Muslims. According to a new WSJ report on Sunday, Das also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the “strongman” who had broken the Congress’ socialist hold. The comments were made in a Facebook group designed for employees in India, but it was open to a global audience. The panel has been split over asking Facebook executives to explain the report. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Nishikant Dubey, who is a member of the panel, has maintained Tharoor cannot call Facebook to seek an explanation because the House rules do not allow it. He cited Rule 269 and added the secretary-general has the power to summon.Parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have supported Tharoor’s decision to call Facebook for an explanation and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has demanded a criminal investigation into the matter.Birla had written to the chairpersons of all parliamentary panels and asked them to select subjects in line with Parliamentary rules and conventions, which include not taking up subjects pending before courts.In a letter to Birla last week, a copy of which HT has seen, Tharoor addressed various points the speaker has highlighted. He cited the Internet shutdowns in Jammu & Kashmir and referred to the May 11 Supreme Court judgment related to it and the dismissal of a subsequent contempt petition that followed to make his point. The Centre on August 11 told the Supreme Court that restrictions on 4G mobile internet will be relaxed in one district each of Jammu and Kashmir divisions of the Union Territory after August 15 on a trial basis. The decision was arrived at on the recommendations made of a special committee constituted on the top court’s May 11 directive to the Centre to review restrictions on high-speed mobile internet.The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed in June by the Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-government organisation, seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre and Jammu & Kashmir administration for failure to comply with the top court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speeds in the Union Territory, where people are only able to access 2G services.The top court appreciated the stand taken by the Centre and closed the contempt case on August 11.Tharoor added that since the matter has been addressed, it should no longer be considered sub judice and the panel would proceed on considering it. The panel was slated to hear from the Union home ministry, department of telecommunications and representatives from the states and Union territories on the issue on September 1. HT on August 25 reported Birla had written to the chairpersons of all parliamentary panels on the selection of subjects based on rules and conventions.In a ‘partially modified agenda’ circulated among members on August 29, there was no mention of Jammu & Kashmir, even though the panel was still slated to hear from Delhi and Bihar on internet curbs. The modified agenda came after Dubey said since the issue was sub judice, it should not be discussed.A member of the panel told HT that they would still like to hear from the government about the facts of the case. “We should still like to hear the facts from the government, even if we do not have a discussion on J&K [Jammu & Kashmir],” said the member on the condition of anonymity. “A statement has been allowed in the past. It should not be against the rules.”According to experts, there is no rule that the panel cannot take up subjects pending before courts and a topic already bulletinised can be discussed.Former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary said a chairperson has additional powers, including a second casting vote. “There is no particular rule that prohibits the panel from taking up matters that are pending before courts.” With reference to the Facebook issue that the panel is slated to hear, Tharoor, in his letter, said that under the topic of “Safeguarding citizens’ rights & prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms” summoning the social media company representatives is within his mandate.

Here’s what it said||The Supreme Court on Monday imposed a fine of Re 1 on lawyer Prashant Bhushan for the offence of criminal contempt of court for his tweets criticising the top court and Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde. A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra ruled Bhushan will have to deposit the fine with the court’s registry by September 15. If Bhushan does not pay the fine, he will have to undergo a jail term of three months and will also be debarred from legal practice for three years, it said. The top court had on August 14 found Bhushan guilty for putting out the two tweets.The case took 40 days to reach a conclusion from the date of its first hearing. It was registered on July 9 and the first hearing in the matter was held on July 22. Here is what the top court said on Monday:* “We gave him several opportunities to express regret. The Attorney General also asked the court to close the case once he tenders an apology,” the bench observed.* The bench also state no such apology was offered by Bhushan.* The court also took exception to the fact that Bhushan frequently went to the press even when the case was pending and gave wide publicity to his statements and gave interviews to the media about the case.* Bhushan’s past conduct was also taken into account with the court observing that it had initiated contempt cases against Bhushan on previous occasions too for his statements.* “Publication of statements in the press by the contemnor before they were submitted before this court was done to interfere with judicial functioning,” the bench which also comprised justice BR Gavai and justice Krishna Murari said.* Bhushan had posted two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and another against CJI Bobde on June 29.* Bhushan’s first tweet said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”* The second tweet referred to CJI Bobde. “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-fines-prashant-bhushan-re-1-here-s-what-it-said/story-yMXIaDO874VW1IP5PSMpkJ.html
31-08-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi lashes out at Centre, says Modi govt has no interest in seeking truth||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday released the first part of his video series attacking the Modi government for the “economic tragedy that the country is facing for the first time in 40 years.”He launched an attack on the Centre saying “asatyagrahi” (someone who doesn’t have interest in seeking truth) are blaming God for the fallout. His tweet was an apparent counter to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement last week where she referred to the coronavirus pandemic as an ‘Act of God’ that may result in contraction of the economy this fiscal.In a video series titled ‘Arthavyavastha ki baat Rahul Gandhi ke saath’ or ‘State of the Economy with Rahul Gandhi’, the Congress leader claimed that the BJP government has attacked the informal structure of the economy and has attempted to turn people into slaves. “In 2008, the world was hit by an economic storm. It affected the entire world including the United States, China, Europe and Japan. Many banks and firms in the US and Europe shut down but India remained unaffected under the leadership of the UPA government,” Gandhi claimed.He said he asked former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh as to how India did not suffer losses like the rest of the world due to the recession and was told that there were two types of economies within the country: organised and unorganised. Gandhi says Singh explained to him that as long as the nation’s unorganised sector, which includes farmers, small and medium size businesses and labourers, stands strong no economic storm can take down India. “For the past six years, the BJP government has been attacking the informal sector,” he said and stated that demonetisation, “wrong” Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Covid-19 lockdown were the biggest examples of the same. “The lockdown wasn’t planned last minute, instead the aim of these three moves (demonetisation, GST, and lockdown) was to destroy the informal sector. As many as 40 crore people working in the informal sector may face extreme poverty, he said citing an International Labour Organization report. At least two crore people have lost their jobs in the last four months, he added. He claimed that the informal sector has a lot of money that the government can’t touch and so they’re trying to break the sector to extort the money. “The result will be that India will not be able to produce jobs as the informal sector generates over 90% of the jobs. Unemployment will be the highest in 45 years,” he said.He asserted that the government is cheating people and so the country needs to stand united to fight this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-nirmala-sitharaman-s-act-of-god-comment-rahul-gandhi-s-asatyagrahi-comeback/story-0LSiamu3HI1254MXZGGqAI.html

The family members of the deceased have accused police of “torture” and, along with some locals, staged a protest against the police and blocked a road.The district administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. The station house officer (SHO) of Lalganj police station has been suspended for unlawful detention. A departmental inquiry has also been ordered by the Superintendent of Police (SP), Raebareli, Swapnil Mamgain, into the incident.Mohit and his brother Sonu, residents of Behta Kalan village, were detained by the police on suspicion of vehicle theft on Friday and taken to Lalganj police station. While Sonu was released after a few hours, Mohit, according to family members, was tortured by the police personnel at the station.He was rushed to the District hospital on Sunday where he died at around 11 am.

31-08-2020||India||Supreme Court imposes Re 1 fine on Prashant Bhushan for contempt||The Supreme Court on Monday imposed a Re 1 fine on activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan days after holding him guilty of criminal contempt of court for two tweets against the apex court and Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde. It said if he fails to pay the fine by September 15, Bhushan will have to undergo three-month simple imprisonment and be barred from practising for three years.Bhushan said he gratefully accepted the judgement and his lawyer, Rajiv Dhavan, immediately paid the fine. “My lawyer & senior colleague Rajiv Dhavan contributed 1 Re immediately after the contempt judgement today which I gratefully accepted,” he tweetedAccording to the Contempt of Courts Act, the offence of criminal contempt carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to Rs 2,000 or both. The court has also barred lawyers found guilty of contempt from practising before it for a limited period while refraining from imposing any jail sentence.The verdict was reserved on Tuesday last after the court gave Bhushan a fresh opportunity to apologise, withdraw his comments, or express regret.Also Read: How Prashant Bhushan criminal contempt case progressed in Supreme CourtDhawan and Attorney General of India KK Venugopal, the Centre’s top law officer who appeared in his personal capacity, last week urged the court to not punish the activist-lawyer and let him off with a reprimand. Dhavan said the effect of punishment will make Bhushan a martyr and urged the court not to do so. The court considered these requests and wanted Bhushan to apologise before taking a lenient view. The bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, suggested that Bhushan must “express regret” for his tweets, and subsequent statements defending them.At one point last week, the court gave Bhushan time to think over his responses and consider retracting his statements. But no apology or retraction was offered as Bhushan maintained that it would be ingenuous and a “contempt of his conscience”. He argued that his criticism came with the best interests of the court in mind.The bench said the court welcomes fair criticism, but critics should not attribute motives to judges. Justice Mishra, who will retire on Wednesday, last week said lawyers and judges are part of the same institution and should work together to ensure that the dignity of the institution is not compromised. Several eminent jurists have said that the court was being overly harsh in initiating criminal contempt proceedings against Bhushan.The bench last week said Bhushan has declined to apologise and has also filed statements sticking to his stance. Bhushan had posted two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and another against CJI Bobde on June 29.Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association secretary Rohit Sud called the apex court’s order harsh while underlining the need for the Bar and bench try to maintain cordial relations. DPS Randhawa, the association’s president, said there should not be a hitch in dialogue between the two. “The court should have referred the matter to the Bar Council [of India] so that relations between the two remain cordial.”Mandeep Bedi, the president of the Senior Advocates’ Association of Punjab and Haryana High Court, said Bhushan should not have been fined. “A fine, whether of Re 1 or Rs 10,000, is a fine. He should have been let off with a warning because it was just a tweet.”Former Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana chairman Lekh Raj Sharma called the decision a balanced one. “The rule of law should prevail and I think it has been upheld in this case to save the institution. In the name of fair criticism and freedom of expression, no one should be allowed to scandalise the courts,” he said. Mehek Maheshwari, an advocate, filed a petition before the Supreme Court on July 9 seeking contempt of court proceedings against Bhushan for the tweets. Based on his petition, the court took suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the matter and listed it for the first time on July 22 and issued notice to Bhushan the same day.The court then heard the matter on August 5 and held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court on August 14. It then posted the case for hearing on August 20 to decide the sentence.When the matter was heard on August 20, Bhushan read out a statement expressing dismay over his conviction. He said that he was standing by his tweets, which he described as an attempt to discharge his duty towards the country.The three-judge bench said it could show leniency only if Bhushan expressed regret and reconsidered his statement declining to apologise. It gave Bhushan time to submit an unconditional apology by August 24 failing which it would proceed against him.Bhushan submitted a supplementary statement before the court on August 24 persisting with his stance and refusing to offer an apology. He submitted his views represented his bona fide (good faith) beliefs and, therefore, offering an apology for expressing them would be insincere.His tweets were not intended to malign the apex court or the CJI but only offered constructive criticism “so that the court could arrest any drift away from its longstanding role as a guardian of the Constitution”, Bhushan said.Dhavan suggested on Tuesday last that the court should close the case after issuing a general direction that the Bar should exercise restraint while criticising the court. He also pointed out instances when lawyers and judges have criticised the court and its judgments. One of Bhushan’s main arguments was that criticising courts is protected by free speech and will not amount to contempt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-imposes-re-1-fine-on-prashant-bhushan-for-contempt/story-dHCjR9OQfiXmjG0G5JSXfL.html

We wanted to send a wider message to New Delhi that, on this question of what happened on August 5 [when the process for the nullification of Article 370 that gave Jammu & Kashmir special status began], liked-minded parties will come together,” said Omar Abdullah in a joint interview to HT with his father, Farooq Abdullah.The political environment in Jammu & Kashmir is in flux again a year after the nullification and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two federally-run territories. Omar Abdullah and his father, Farooq Abdullah, are at the heart of the churning following their release from detention.Read the full interview here.Farooq Abdullah last week emerged as the pivot in the formation of a conglomerate of the six parties that has posed the first challenge to the Centre by reaffirming commitment to the declaration pegged to the demand for restoration of the special status and semi-autonomous status.Farooq Abdullah dismissed the newly-formed Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party, which is not a part of the conglomerate, as the “formation of IB (Intelligence Bureau)”. Omar Abdullah said the party was welcome to try its luck in the political arena. “Political space is open to everybody. Come, try your luck. Who stops anybody from trying?”Also Read: BJP wants a Hindu majority to emerge in J&K: Farooq AbdullahMost Unionist parties in Jammu & Kashmir, particularly the Nation Conference (NC) of the Abdullahs that played a key role in the region’s accession to India in 1947, have traditionally been seen as a bridge between New Delhi and Srinagar.Farooq Abdullah said he did not want to be the bridge anymore. “They have deceived my people,” he said.Omar Abdullah added the “bridge” would only work if New Delhi allowed them to propagate the voices of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. “If by the bridge, you mean that we will allow them to bring their voices and propagate it here, that is not a bridge. If by the bridge you mean that you will allow us to take the voices of J&K and Ladakh and propagate it there, it is fine.

Bhushan’s tweets were based on distorted facts and have the effect of destabilising the foundation of the judiciary, the court had added.Also read: How Prashant Bhushan criminal contempt case progressed in Supreme CourtThough the court gave him time to “think over”, Bhushan maintained that he will not apologise and in a statement on August 24 said that the views expressed by him through his tweets represented his bona fide (good faith) beliefs and, therefore, an apology for expressing such beliefs would be insincere.“An apology cannot be a mere incantation and any apology has to be sincerely made. If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology, that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution (Supreme Court ) that I hold in highest esteem,” he said.However, Attorney General KK Venugopal had urged the court to not punish Bhushan and let him off with a warning but the court refused to do so unless he tendered an apology. Bhushan had on June 27 tweeted that historians will mark the role of the Supreme Court in contributing to what he considered as destruction of democracy. “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs”, he wrote on Twitter.

The low-pressure system will again develop on Monday, subsequently; heavy rainfall will start from Bastar and reach the northern part of the state,” meteorologist HP Chandra from Raipur MeT centre told Hindustan Times.Chhattisgarh witnessed incessant rainfall since August 20 in several parts, leading to a flood-like situation in some areas of Bastar division and plains of the state.Also read: Why is it flooding in Central India?Collectors were instructed to deploy a joint team of staff of revenue department, district panchayat, janpad panchayat and forest department to provide relief to the affected people, the official said.

31-08-2020||India||Shiv Sena hits out at BJP over demand to reopen temples||The ruling Shiv Sena took on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over its Ghantanaad protest, which has demanded reopening of temples in Maharashtra, and asked if the opposition party would take the blame for a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the state following the relaxation. The Maharashtra unit of the BJP on Saturday had warned the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government that it would forcibly reopen all the temples in the state if the government did not give permission for it. Also read: States to resume buses, trainsThe BJP’s threat came after a day-long ghantanad andolan held across Maharashtra. As part of the protest, party workers had assembled outside temples ringing brass bells, blowing conches and chanting hymns across various cities and towns in Maharashtra, demanding their reopening. “People would get mental peace through the reopening of temples, but if there is again an explosion in Covid-19 cases, will the opposition take responsibility of it? Devendra Fadnavis said that people understand how to maintain physical distancing after religious places are reopened. But it was visible how the physical distancing was maintained in the ghantanaad andolan held by the BJP the other day. The opposition should understand the situation rather than making such unrealistic demands,” said an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Monday.It questioned if the demand to allow reopening of religious places had anything to do with faith or it was only a political ploy. Prakash Ambedkar, the president of Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, has also demanded the reopening of the Vitthal-Rukmai temple at Pandharpur in Solapur district. The editorial cited that All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) Member of Parliament (MP) Imtiaz Jaleel had also threatened that he would “break the locks” of mosques in Aurangabad on September 2, if the state government did not allow them to reopen.The demand for reopening of religious places has been going on for around a month, but the Uddhav Thackeray government is treading cautiously to avoid crowding because Covid-19 cases have been steadily climbing in Maharashtra.Fadnavis, the leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra legislative assembly, had questioned the rationale behind keeping temples shut while allowing shopping malls, liqour stores etc to remain open.“There are many aspects, including livelihood of the poor, interlinked to pilgrimage centres to social aspects, which cannot be overlooked. It’s a matter of an individual’s faith and belief, which the government should respect and open temples,” Fadnavis had said on Saturday. In an apparent response to Fadnavis, the editorial said, “... Besides peace of the mind, temples should be reopened, as they are a source of livelihood for lakhs of families. The locks on temples should be opened for peace of mind, but not for political reasons. First, let people live, the rest will be dealt with later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-hits-out-at-bjp-over-demand-to-reopen-temples/story-4qJNFOjqdxdTGlxfVWH5kI.html
31-08-2020||India||Our Supreme Court petition makes an incredibly strong case: Omar Abdullah on legal fight against nullification of Article 370||Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) has vowed to fight the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370 that stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status last year legally, politically and peacefully.Constitution’s Article 35A, which empowered the state legislature to define permanent residents for government jobs and property ownership, was also removed last year when the state was split into two federally-run territories.“Our petition [before the Supreme Court] makes an incredibly strong case on a simple point: a governor cannot assume the powers of an assembly, and an assembly cannot assume the powers of a constituent assembly. Because if an assembly can assume the power of a constituent assembly, tomorrow what stops a state in the North-east that has a simmering discontent from converting their assembly into a constituent assembly and then saying, ‘I have the constituent assembly’s powers as demonstrated by J&K [Jammu & Kashmir] and therefore I am redrawing our relationship with the rest of India’,” said NC leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah in a joint interview to HT with Farooq Abdullah.Read the full interview here.Jammu & Kashmir’s special status allowed it to have a separate constitution and flag. A constituent assembly drafted the erstwhile state’s constitution in the 1950s. Omar Abdullah argued there is a fundamental flaw in what New Delhi did on August 5, 2019, when the process for the constitutional changes to Jammu & Kashmir’s status began. “You can wish away the merit of our case politically, but not legally. The government’s case is all political and emotional. If J&K has suffered, it is not because of its special status but because of militancy. Either militancy is the product of Pakistan or it is the product of Article 370. How can it be both? When we talk to people on the Gupkar Declaration, we will make an emotional argument. Let us see where it takes us.”The declaration of major regional parties last year pledged to fight against the constitutional changes together.Omar Abdullah underlined they are a mainstream political party and will fight using legal means at their disposal. “...one is the power that the Constitution gives us to challenge the decisions in the court; and the second is forums available, including Parliament, media, social media, and public meetings.”Omar Abdullah said NC’s three Parliament members will take the voices of region’s people to the highest platform of democracy. “We are not a party that has ever subscribed to violence as a means of achieving our ends. In fact, if anything, the NC has always been the victim of violence.”Also Read: BJP wants a Hindu majority to emerge in J&K: Farooq AbdullahFarooq Abdullah cited his government’s dismissal in 1984 when Jagmohan was sent as governor to remove him. “He [Jagmohan] told Indira Gandhi [the then prime minister] that Farooq Abdullah would put the state to fire. I said I do not want the blood of people on my hands. I believe that today also. I will fight for their rights even if it takes my life but I am not going to take their lives.”The political environment in Jammu & Kashmir is in flux again a year after the nullification and bifurcation of the erstwhile state.

The DFYI alleged that the Youth Congress workers were behind the attack, but the latter has distanced itself from the murder.The area had witnessed minor clashes between the two in the last two weeks, said the police, adding they suspect the latest incident was a sequel to this. The deceased are block-level leaders of the DYFI. “It was a well planned murder. The Congress leadership will have to explain why they took out such a brutal murder on Onam day,” said CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.On its part, the Youth Congress said its workers have no role in it. “We condemn the murder in strongest terms. If anyone is involved, we will take strong action. Like CPI(M), we will not shield murderers,” said Youth Congress state president Shafi Parambhil. The DYFI has asked party workers to observe Monday a black day to protest against the murder. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also condemned the killings. According to the police, the attack took place around 11.30 pm when the deceased were returning home on their motorcycle. They were waylaid and attacked by a group of five persons. The victims received more than 25 stab wounds. One died on the spot and the other succumbed to injuries at the hospital. Thiruvananthapuram rural police superintendent B Ashokan said three persons have been detained in connection with the murder. The police are keeping a strict vigil in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-workers-of-cpi-m-youth-wing-hacked-to-death-in-kerala/story-7iAtARLMx3ilYHxRxmBCXI.html
31-08-2020||India||India pre-empts China’s aggressive move near Pangong Lake||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) carried out “provocative military movements” on the southern bank of Pangong Tso on the night of August 29/30 to change the status quo in the area, the Indian Army said in a statement on Monday. The army said it pre-empted the Chinese move. So far Chinese aggression was confined to the lake’s northern bank—the Finger Area. The statement said the army took measures to strengthen its positions and thwart the PLA’s intention to unilaterally change facts on the ground on the lake’s southern bank. “The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity through dialogue, but is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity,” the statement said. A brigade commander-level flag meeting is in progress at Chushul to resolve the issues. Also Read: ‘Situation in Ladakh as severe as it was during India-China war in 1962’: Shiv SenaThe army said the PLA violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in eastern Ladakh. The development comes at a time when talks with China to reduce border tensions in eastern Ladakh are at a stalemate. India and China were unable to bridge their differences on the disengagement and de-escalation process along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) during recent diplomatic talks, with New Delhi emphasising the need to resolve “outstanding issues” speedily, as reported by Hindustan Times on August 20. People familiar with developments during the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs dismissed an assertion in a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry that the two sides had “positively evaluated the progress” in the disengagement process. Also Read: Ahead of PM Modi’s visit, strategic Atal Rohtang Tunnel ready for inaugurationThe military dialogue between senior commanders from the two sides has hit a roadblock due to Chinese reluctance to restore status quo ante in some key friction areas along the LAC. The commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process. No dates have yet been fixed for the next round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers who have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock. The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, remains an area of key concern for the Indian Army. The Finger Area—a set of eight cliffs jutting out of Sirijap range overlooking Pangong Lake—has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process. Disengagement has progressed somewhat smoothly at friction points in Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, but its pace remains sluggish in Gogra area. There is growing consensus among Indian officials and China experts that military talks are unlikely to deliver further results, and the resolution of the issue will require political and diplomatic intervention. De-escalation along the disputed border can only begin after complete disengagement between the two armies on the LAC. The ground situation remains unchanged in Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. Last week, India pulled out of a multi-nation army exercise being hosted by Russia in which around 20 countries including China are expected to take part next month.

31-08-2020||India||Supreme Court dismisses Vijay Mallya’s review plea against 2017 contempt verdict||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed review petition filed by former liquor baron Vijay Mallya challenging the order holding him guilty of contempt. A bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan said, “We find no merits in review petitions. Review petitions dismissed.”He was found guilty by the apex court on May 9, 2017 for transferring USD 40 million received from Diageo into the accounts of his children. Mallya owes over Rs 9,000 crore in form of unpaid loans towards consortium of banks led by SBI. The SBI had filed contempt petition against Mallya for not disclosing the bank accounts into which USD 40 million was transferred. Further, the Court found him guilty of siphoning off this amount which otherwise had to be deposited with the banks. Mallya had filed review to consider an affidavit claiming this amount was not part of his assets. Further he claimed that he will lose his valuable right of appeal if held guilty by the Supreme Court.When the case came up for hearing in June 2020, the top court had sought an explanation from its registry officials regarding the undue delay in listing the review petition.When the matter was taken up on August 6, it was adjourned again since some crucial records pertaining to the case could not be located. Eventually the case was heard on August 27 and reserved for verdict.At least 14 banks had moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru, against Mallya seeking recovery of over Rs 6,300 crore owed to them in 2016 by Mallya’s companies. The banks had also prayed that Mallya’s passport should be frozen and he should be arrested.However, the DRT failed to hear those prayers, prompting the banks to approach the Karnataka high court seeking appropriate directions to DRT for speedy disposal of the applications they moved.The high court had declined to grant such a prayer and the banks then moved the Supreme Court.Mallya had fled the country by then. The Supreme Court in its May 2017 order had asked the Centre to produce Mallya before the court to decide on the punishment to be handed down to him for contempt of court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-vijay-mallya-s-review-plea-against-2017-contempt-verdict/story-ADDIZRCRRI3whdDhOuFmyI.html
31-08-2020||India||BJP govt attacking informal sector: Rahul Gandhi||New Delhi: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday launched a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, alleging that it has destroyed the economy by repeatedly assaulting the informal sector. “There is an attempt to turn you into a slave,” he said in a 3.38-minute video on the present state of economy. In 2008, Gandhi said the world was hit by an economic storm, affecting the entire world, including the United States, Japan, Europe, China, everywhere. In the US and Europe, banks collapsed, corporations companies shut down their businesses, but India remained unaffected, he added. “India had a UPA government at that time. I went to the Prime Minister and asked him, Manmohan Singh ji, what is the reason that when the entire world has suffered an economic crisis India has remained unaffected?” the former Congress chief said. “Manmohan Singh ji replied, Rahul if you want to understand India’s economy, you will have to understand that India has two economic structures. One is the formal economy and the other is the informal economy,” he added. The video is a part of Gandhi’s fresh series on economy. He had earlier released a five part series on Chinese incursions in Ladakh. “You know the big companies which constitute the formal sector. The informal sector comprises of farmers, labourers and MSMEs. Till the time India’s informal sector is strong, no economic storm can touch India,” he said. “But in the last six years, the BJP government has been attacking the informal sector. I am giving you three massive examples right now- demonetisation, wrong Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the lockdown enforced to contain the coronavirus pandemic,” Gandhi alleged. “Don’t think the lockdown was unplanned. Don’t think it was done at the last minute. The aim of these three decisions was to destroy our informal sector,” he alleged. From March 25, India witnessed phases of nationwide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Gandhi had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and criticised the move, saying it will have disastrous consequences on the economy. In the fresh video, Gandhi again took on Modi, saying he “needs the media and marketing” to run the government. “This media management and marketing is done by 15-20 people.” Gandhi said the informal sector has a lot of money which the government cannot touch. “They want to break this sector and extort this money from them,” he added. Gandhi said the effects of this attack on informal sector will be seen soon. “The results will be that India won’t be able to produce jobs because the informal sector produces 90% of the jobs. Once the informal sector is destroyed India won’t be able to produce jobs,” he claimed. The Congress has been attacking the government over unemployment, saying it had assumed “fearsome” proportions. It also claimed that a record of 45 years of unemployment has been broken as around 135 million youth are likely to lose their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “You are the ones who run this country. You take us forward and there is a conspiracy against you. You are being cheated and there is an attempt to turn you into slaves. We have to understand this attack and the entire country has to unite to fight against this,” Gandhi said in his message to those involved in the informal sector. The BJP, however, took a jibe at Gandhi, saying he should release a video about the “G-23”, a reference to 23 dissenters who wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking complete overhaul of the party organisation. “People are trying to seize his house. There are talks of election, selection, inability to have a president... He (Rahul) should worry about it. The country is very much in safe hands. He should worry about his party,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-govt-attacking-informal-sector-rahul-gandhi/story-cWeFltcoxNkrdQIcqlMhZK.html
31-08-2020||India||BJP alleges Cong-Facebook nexus, new report says Das took credit for ‘Modi’s campaign’||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress got into a fresh war of words and accused each other of alleged nexus with Facebook hours after a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report on Sunday cited messages of the social media company’s India public policy head, Ankhi Das, in which she claimed to have “lit a fire to his [Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s] social media campaign” before he swept to power in 2014.Also read: Facebook row intensifies as Tharoor, BJP’s Dubey move breach of privilege notice against each otherAnother WSJ report earlier this month said Das opposed applying hate-speech rules to a BJP politician whose posts targeted Muslims. The report prompted Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor-led Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology (IT) to summon Facebook’s representatives for an explanation.The Congress again attacked the BJP over its alleged nexus with Facebook and for undermining the country’s democratic ethos after WSJ’s Sunday report. “Facebook was subverting India’s Democracy & Electoral Process. Shocking & gory details revealed by @wsj_com. If this is not ‘Criminality’, what is? Nothing short of a ‘full independent investigation’ will unravel all the layers of BJP-Facebook nexus,” Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted on Monday.BJP’s national Information and technology in charge, Amit Malviya, earlier tweeted: “Meet Vijaya Moorthy. Supposedly, heads government outreach at Facebook. Worked with Rahul Gandhi’s team for nearly a decade (love for his former boss still going strong)... Talk about Congress-Facebook nexus? Well, it seems Congress is running Facebook!” he tweeted.Malviya questioned how come the “mandarins at WSJ keep missing Ankhi Das’ posts sympathetic” to the Aam Aadmi Party or the Trinamool Congress. He added the paper keeps harping on her perceived bias for the BJP. “Is it because they want people who are uncompromisingly Left.”Facebook referred to Das’s messages cited in the fresh report and insisted they have been taken out of context and do not represent the full scope of the company’s efforts to support the use of the platform by parties across the Indian political spectrum in 2014. “Facebook’s public policy team operates with integrity and any suggestion that their efforts are motivated by partisanship discounts their hard work every day,” it said in response to HT’s request for comments on the WSJ report.According to the fresh report, Das praised Modi as the “strongman” who had broken the Congress’ socialist hold on the state. The posts were made in a Facebook group designed for employees in India but was open to a global audience. The report also mentioned a photograph of Das with her “longest fellow traveller”, top global elections official Katie Harbath, and Modi. Das, according to the report, arrived at Facebook in 2011, at a time “when the social media giant was eager to demonstrate its utility in politics”. “It rolled out training for several Indian political parties on how best to use the platform to mobilize supporters. One was Mr. Modi’s 2012 campaign for re-election as chief minister of the western Indian state of Gujarat,” the report said. It added Das in 2012 wrote about Modi’s victory of the “success of our Gujarat campaign”, which was close to reaching a million fans on Facebook.“Mr. Modi soon launched his campaign for national office, with Facebook again offering training and assistance… Ms. Das made her sentiments on the race clear. When a fellow staffer noted in response to one of her internal posts that the BJP’s primary opponent, the Indian National Congress, had a larger following on Facebook than Mr. Modi’s individual page, Ms. Das responded: ‘Don’t diminish him by comparing him with INC. Ah well—let my bias not show’,” the report said.The report alleged the company has acted in a biased manner when taking down fake pages and accounts during India’s 2019 national elections. “In another incident, which hasn’t been previously reported, Facebook declined to act after discovering that the BJP was circumventing its political ad transparency requirements...”It added Facebook neither took down the pages nor flagged the ads. “Instead, it privately raised the matter with the BJP...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-alleges-cong-facebook-nexus-new-report-says-das-took-credit-for-modi-s-campaign/story-ihowF372Hzebj9R39A8LvI.html

The Mid Day Meal is a school food programme of the central government aimed at improving nutrition level among students. The training will be imparted to cooks in preparing nourishing and tasty food in a hygienic manner. This comes as many of such cooks have little or no understanding about the nutritional value of foodstuff or food safety aspects. The training also comes at a time amid the global pandemic. Also read: Uttar Pradesh’s ‘Unlock 4’ guidelines - What’s new and what remains unchangedA proper training module has already been prepared by the state education department and Mid Day Meal Authority for this mission. The training would start as soon as the pandemic is eased, said Vijay Kiran Anand, director general (school education) and the state project director of Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. The cooks would receive lessons in food hygiene and food safety aspects along with personal hygiene requirements commensurate with their work, besides the nature of food, its handling, preparation and distribution, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-84-lakh-mid-day-meal-cooks-in-uttar-pradesh-to-be-trained-in-food-safety-nutrition/story-91DoZ0DewJbeOUXpiWs2eL.html

The statement said Indian troops had been able to pre-empt the PLA from trying to change the facts on the ground.A Brigade Commander level Flag Meeting is in progress at Chushul to resolve the issues.The movement of Chinese troops in the East Ladakh sector is seen as an effort by the Chinese side to expand the border row to the southern bank of the lake. So far, much of the Chinese deployment around the lake has been concentrated around its southern bank. The two armies have been locked in a stand-off at multiple points in the East Ladakh sector for nearly four months. Also Watch | Indian Army thwarts fresh Chinese attempt to change status quo in LadakhThere have been several agreements between the two sides to disengage, particularly after scores of soldiers clashed in Galwan Valley on June 15 that led to casualties on both sides. But Chinese troops have been slow to step back, particularly around Pangong Tso, the saltwater glacial lake spread across 700 sq km.Also Read: For peace along border, one must adhere to agreements, says S JaishankarIn Monday’s statement, the Indian army called the movement of troops a violation of “previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh”.“Indian troops preempted this PLA activity on the Southern Bank of Pangong Tso Lake, undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground. The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquility through dialogue, but is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity,” army spokesman Colonel Aman Anand said in the statement.The army statement did not spell out the nature of the Chinese provocation and how soldiers of the Indian army blocked the effort.The Chinese effort to enlarge the border row came just two days after the defence ministry in Beijing told India that it should look at the “big picture” of bilateral ties and work with it and take concrete steps to bring the relationship back on the “right track of normal development.”India has made it clear that China should work on complete disengagement, and then de-escalation of troops in eastern Ladakh, underlining that this can be achieved only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions. The message from New Delhi has been that the Indian army will stay firm on Chinese efforts to alter the status quo and has stressed that the PLA will have to return to their April 20 position.Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last week said complete disengagement requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and this can be done only through mutually agreed actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-pla-troops-carry-out-provocative-military-movements-near-pangong-tso-to-change-status-quo-says-army/story-603TodUqMIEFpQKrMlHi7I.html

The IMS and SUM Hospital is one of the 12 medical centres in the country chosen by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting the human trial of the vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. “Two doses of the vaccine were administered to each volunteer after they were selected through a screening process conducted over a period of three to seven days prior to vaccination. The first dose was administered on Day Zero while the blood sample was collected. The second dose was given on Day 14 and the blood sample was also collected,” Dr Rao said.Blood samples of the volunteers will also be collected on different days (28, 42, 104, 194 day) for estimating the duration of protection subsequently, he added. Dr Rao said there was a lot of enthusiasm among people to be part of the second phase of the human trial.Those who wish to be part of this trial could contact the centre at http://ptctu.soa.ac.in, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/preparations-on-for-second-phase-of-human-clinical-trial-of-covaxin-vaccine/story-obDz1kSTRaXYjoiplEO4wO.html
31-08-2020||India||Centre wants us to accept nullification of Article 370, I am not going to do that: Farooq||Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah has rejected the idea of accepting the Constitution’s Article 370 as history a year after it was nullified to strip Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and semi-autonomous status. “They want us to accept that through the gun. I am not going to do that,” said Farooq Abdullah in a joint interview to HT with his son and another former chief minister, Omar Abdullah.Also read: Centre notifies distribution of power between L-G, govt in Jammu and KashmirFarooq Abdullah rejected as lies the reasons cited for the nullification that it was discriminatory, impeded development, promoted corruption and dynastic rule, separatism, and obstructed the state’s integration with the country. “I am living in this house [in Srinagar] since 1974 when my father was not Prime Minister or chief minister of J&K [Jammu & Kashmir]. We sold our ancestral property and with that money my father was able to buy this house for me when I was in England. Eighteen members of our family own that [the ancestral properties]. Are we that corrupt? And they said Farooq Abdullah has homes in Dubai, Paris, London, and America,” he said.Farooq Abdullah challenged his detractors to show him where all these houses are so that he can go and occupy them. “My wife [Mollie Abdullah] is an Englishwoman. She has a home there [England]. She is entitled to her home.”He referred to the argument that development suffered because of Article 370 and added thank God Congress leader and former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, was able to prove in Rajya Sabha that the region is far better than Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state. “What we are suffering from is their [the Centre’s] lack of support. To this date, rail has not arrived from Katra to Banihal. There is more separatism now than before August 5 last year [when the process for the nullification and Jammu & Kashmir’s division began].”He said guns were booming daily and people are giving up their lives. “It is not the Pakistanis who are dying today; it is the Kashmiris. Who has created them [militants]? Not Farooq Abdullah. I was in jail. They [the government] created them. The hatred they have created between Hindus and Muslims in the rest of the nation… do you think it will not have an effect here? It will.”Farooq Abdullah was among three former chief ministers detained as part of sweeping measures to prevent protests against the constitutional changes to Jammu & Kashmir’s status last year. He along with Omar Abdullah was released in March while another former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, continues to be under detention under the draconian Public Safety Act that allows incarceration for up to two years without trial.The father-son duo has lately been galvanising dormant cadres of their party, the region’s biggest and the oldest.Omar Abdullah said the new reality does not mean they cannot argue against what has been done. “If dissent is the essence of democracy, then what we are doing is strengthening democracy. We are dissenting against a government decision,” he said.He underlined the need for an understanding of how difficult it is for them. “We get fixed from both sides. The ultra-nationalists in the rest of the country treat us as separatists. But here in Kashmir, we are treated as nationalists. Please tell me what we are.”The political environment in Jammu & Kashmir is in flux again a year after the nullification and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union Territories. Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah are at the heart of the churning following their release from detention.Farooq Abdullah last week emerged as the pivot in the formation of a conglomerate of the Valley’s six parties that has posed the first challenge to the Centre by reaffirming commitment to the Gupkar Declaration pegged to the demand for restoration of the special status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-wants-us-to-accept-nullification-of-article-370-i-am-not-going-to-do-that-farooq/story-EgnkBrMhyncYakZ9OsFvsJ.html

On Sunday, India had made a world record after recording 78,761 cases of the infection.The number of active cases in the country has reached 7,81,975 whereas 27,74,801 patients have been discharged from hospitals. The death toll reached 64,469 after 971 fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, according health ministry.This comes a day before the fourth phase of relaxation, called Unlock 4, kicks in. The central government has announced resumption of metro train services and some other relaxation, which a few experts say will lead to surge in Covid-19 infections.Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said on Sunday that this increase in cases was expected but pointed out that it is not a homogenous phenomenon across the states.“It is happening in some pockets and among groups where there is an intermixing of the susceptible population and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases which is leading to a transmission of the disease. So, efforts have to be made to interrupt this transmission in these pockets,” Dr Panda said.Also, testing has been ramped up exponentially which is leading to more number of cases getting detected, he said.Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said that people are not following advisories on wearing masks, hand hygiene and social distancing which is driving up the number of cases.India conducted more than 10.5 lakh tests on Saturday, which took the total number of tests to 4.14 crore, the health ministry said on Sunday.The Centre, keeping in view the evolving global context of Covid-19, conceptualised and implemented the continuum of care strategy of “test, track and treat” in close coordination with the states and union territories, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yet-another-spike-of-over-78-000-covid-19-cases-all-india-tally-above-3-62-million/story-rAFaYmsVslkOH0jrexwbPN.html
31-08-2020||India||Babri Masjid case: Legal proceedings likely to end today, accused to reply in CBI court||All legal proceedings in the Babri Masjid demolition case will end on Monday after all 32 accused submit their written replies in the decades-old case. Surendra Kumar Yadav, judge, special CBI court, has set a deadline of August 31 for all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case to submit their written replies in the case. The court has already given two extensions to all accused for submitting their replies. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has already submitted its written reply (argument) in the CBI court. “The CBI court had issued a deadline of August 31 for filing reply in the Babri Masjid demolition case. On Monday, I will file the replies,” said lawyer KK Mishra, who is representing 25 out of 32 accused in the case. Mishra is representing senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Kalyan Singh among others in the Ayodhya case. The apex court’s deadline for pronouncement of the judgment in the Ayodhya case was to expire on August 31.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had extended the deadline for the special CBI court hearing the Babri Masjid demolition case in Lucknow by a month, till September 30. Now, the CBI court will have to pronounce judgment in the case before or on September 30. “The Supreme Court has extended the deadline of the special CBI court (Ayodhya case) till September 30 for pronouncing judgment in the Babri Masjid demolition case,” said lawyer KK Mishra. On November 9 last, the constitution bench of the Supreme Court, led by then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had ruled in favour of Ram Mandir in the decades-old Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Masjid dispute. On apex court’s directive, the Centre has also constituted the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the Ram temple, in the historic bhoomi pujan ceremony at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-masjid-case-legal-proceedings-likely-to-end-today-accused-to-reply-in-cbi-court/story-r8plCB4RQLaonZztL0ppgK.html

This is the least number of tests performed in five days. Also read: Covid vaccine diplomacy in India’s outreach planHowever, many states report a decrease in the number of tests on weekends. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India was working to increase its Covid-19 testing capacity to a million a day in July-end, the number of tests has breached the mark twice. The first time was on August 21 when 1.02 million samples were tested. Following the test-trace-treat strategy, the number of recoveries in the country is also on the rise. Around three in four people who have been diagnosed with the infection have recovered, according to the data released by the ministry. The last 500,000 recoveries in India had been recorded in eight days, which came down from nine days for the previous 500,000 recoveries, and 10 days before that. “Responsive, collaborative and effective measures right from early identification through aggressive TESTING to efficient TRACKING and comprehensive TREATMENT have collectively led to these outcomes,” the union health ministry said. The increased testing has also meant higher number of new cases being reported every day. On Sunday, India became the first country in the world to report 80,000 cases in a day. A total of 80,097 new infections were reported across the country on Sunday, taking the nationwide tally to 3,616,747, according to HT’s dashboard. In comparison, China, where the virus originated, has a total 85,031 confirmed infections to date. The proportion of deaths, however, has remained low. Only 1.82% of the people who have been diagnosed with the infection in the country have died of it. In comparison, over 12% of those who were diagnosed with the infection in the UK died of it and almost 11% in Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-500k-recoveries-in-eight-days-health-ministry/story-iDrXOCwC1DVYLfhGUHyL7J.html
31-08-2020||India||Uttar Pradesh trader’s tobacco-free organic beedi in great demand overseas||An Uttar Pradesh entrepreneur is manufacturing and marketing tobacco-free organic bidi, which is now in high demand overseas, taking his family’s decades-old bidi business upmarket. With no advertisements and solely banking on trust built over years and bonding of his foreign customers, Adil Masood, a middle-aged entrepreneur, decided to exclusively market this unique organic bidi with the brand name ‘Favourite Leaf’ almost two years ago.The idea was liked by the foreign smokers and within a short span of two years, his organic bidi export to the USA and European countries, including Poland and Switzerland, started fetching a revenue of over Rs 1.5 crore annually. The product, claims Adil, received an overwhelming response from foreign customers. “Now we are planning to extend its export to the entire Europe and a few other countries,” he said.These organic bidis, says Adil, are free of tobacco and nicotine with no additives and are sometimes stuffed with an Ayurvedic mixture which is also 100 per cent tobacco-free, with some medicinal values to clear the throat and relieve cough symptoms.Adill’s family has been in the trade of manufacturing bidi for over five decades. His father late Masood Ali and uncle Islam Ahmad started it and ran it as a traditional trade. Adil took over the business almost six years ago after the death of his uncle. “I didn’t dare to bring changes in the traditional trading of my uncle and father. But after their death I made up my mind to try something new and innovative to give the trade a new dimension and the idea of organic bidi came up. I launched it in the overseas markets after carrying out research on its demand and requirement for over three years,” he said. Traditionally in India, says Adil, tendu leaves were used to roll bidis but he searched for a leaf with a more cosmetic look, greenish, thin and durable, to replace the rough and rustic look of the tendu leaf. After a hunt of over two years, he finally found the leaf he was looking for and started using it. “For these leaves, we cultivate the plants in Tamil Nadu and other southern states. Bidis rolled out with these leaves attract overseas smokers because of their slick looks,” he said. His research team also decided to replace synthetic filters with organic ones made of leaves of a plant found in abundance in northern states (he requested to not disclose the names of the plants). A thin thread is used for fixing filters instead of using gum.“All these initiatives were taken to make the product more authentic,” he said.Some brands of organic bidi are also being sold in India by online shopping companies, but Adil claims all these brands came after the launch of his brand overseas two years ago.Because of duplicacy issues he had avoided launching his brand in the domestic market yet, he added. Those who were in the bidi trade or smoked bidi, he continued, could easily differentiate between his product and copied brands. “They are still using traditional tendu leaves, which we replaced with new and more authentic leaves. So the difference between the finishing of our original product and its copy is easily discernible.“Our research team is still working to bring more changes in the product as per the requirement of the customers and our efforts to give them the best would continue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-trader-s-tobacco-free-organic-beedi-in-great-demand-overseas/story-7yExZCcp2YxZhJi4fTLUiP.html
31-08-2020||India||BJP wants a Hindu majority to emerge in J&K: Farooq Abdullah||Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah has said his National Conference (NC) opted out of the Delimitation Commission in May as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was allegedly seeking to create Hindu dominance in the Muslim majority region and to divide the Union Territory on religious lines through the process.The Centre in March set up the commission to redraw parliamentary and assembly constituencies based on the recent census in Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and Nagaland. NC opted out of it in May. “That is because we told them on their face that we do not believe in your delimitation. The BJP has a certain purpose. It wants that in J&K [Jammu & Kashmir], a Hindu majority emerges, and the Muslim majority goes down,” he told HT in a joint interview with his son, another former chief minister, Omar Abdullah. “Can you beat what the government of India is trying to do here?”Farooq Abdullah said when he was the chief minister, the assembly of the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir decided to go for the delimitation exercise along with the rest of the country in 2026. “Then, why has the Centre suddenly brought it forward? They want to divide us on the Hindu-Muslim lines and create Hindu dominance. That will never happen,” he said.Farooq Abdullah was among three NC Parliamentarians named as the members of the commission.Omar Abdullah called the commission a product of the constitutional changes brought in August last year to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and to divide it into two Union territories. “When we do not recognise those changes, how can we recognise this panel? By participating in its proceedings, we will essentially be lending credence to the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019. When we are fighting this Act, there is no question of participation.”Omar Abdullah said the commission’s membership does not grant one the veto power. “Our three MPs [members of Parliament] may have been able to share their views, but that would not have been binding on the commission. Our participation would have been used as a rubber stamp.”The political environment in Jammu & Kashmir is in flux again a year after the constitutional changes that prompted sweeping measures, including the incarceration of hundreds of people, to prevent protests against them. Farooq Abdullah, who was among the three former chief ministers also detained, has emerged as the prime mover and pivot in the formation of a conglomerate of the six regional parties – some of them sworn rivals – that has posed the first challenge to the Centre by reaffirming commitment to the Gupkar Declaration pegged to the demand for restoration of the special status.Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to delimitation exercise in his Independence Day speech and said it is underway and assembly elections would follow in Jammu & Kashmir.Also Read: Farooq Abdullah meets more National Conference leadersWhen asked if he would contest the elections, Farooq Abdullah said: “Any decision [on contesting] will depend first on my party and we will take a call subject to the situation. We will talk to other stakeholders in the Gupkar Declaration. If we are united in this exercise, we will take them on board and decide.” Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah were released in March while another former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, continues to be under detention under draconian Public Safety Act that allows incarceration for up to two years without trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wants-a-hindu-majority-to-emerge-in-j-k-farooq-abdullah/story-gev4j1qk4Pgbv7KWbpttsK.html

This implies that the economy may perform better in the successive three quarters of the current fiscal year.The economic crisis is not unique to India. Global economies are experiencing contraction due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated a global contraction of 4.9% in 2020. The United Kingdom’s (UK) economy has reported a 21.7% year-on-year plunge in the June quarter.Data showed that India’s GDP growth had slowed even before the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions. The growth rate in Q4 FY20 was 3.1%, the weakest point in the new data series that had started in 2012-2013. The FY20 real GDP growth is 4.2%, which is also the weakest in the series.Ecowrap, a research report published by State Bank of India (SBI) on August 17, estimates Q1 FY21 GDP degrowth will be around -16.5%, though with the relevant caveats in the current uncertain scenario due to the pandemic. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gdp-numbers-to-be-out-today-q1-growth-likely-to-be-worst/story-ytITJo7xg0rREscDHBqFZM.html

The court had pronounced him guilty of contempt of court for violating its orders and those of the Karnataka high court.The judgment will be pronounced by a bench of justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan.“He is guilty of disobeying the orders passed by this court (Supreme Court) in not disclosing full particulars of the assets as was directed by this Court. He is guilty of violating the express orders of restraint passed by the high court of Karnataka in the same cause from which the present proceedings have arisen,” the Supreme Court had said in its order passed on May 9, 2017.When the case came up for hearing in June 2020, the top court had sought an explanation from its registry officials regarding the undue delay in listing the review petition.When the matter was taken up on August 6, it was adjourned again since some crucial records pertaining to the case could not be located. Eventually the case was heard on August 27 and reserved for verdict.At least 14 banks had moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru, against Mallya seeking recovery of over Rs 6,300 crore owed to them in 2016 by Mallya’s companies. The banks had also prayed that Mallya’s passport should be frozen and he should be arrested.However, the DRT failed to hear those prayers, prompting the banks to approach the Karnataka high court seeking appropriate directions to DRT for speedy disposal of the applications they moved.The high court had declined to grant such a prayer and the banks then moved the Supreme Court.Mallya had fled the country by then. The Supreme Court in its May 2017 order had asked the Centre to produce Mallya before the court to decide on the punishment to be handed down to him for contempt of court.“We direct the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi to secure and ensure presence of Respondent No.3 before this Court on 10.07.2017,” the order read..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-order-today-on-vijay-mallya-s-review-plea-against-2017-contempt-verdict/story-AmPi5OlkPFFut4uGYHGUeI.html

Also read: DUET 2020 admit card released at du.ac.in, here’s direct linkThe online registration process stretched to around 10 weeks following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The Central university is set to look at the highest-ever applications for these courses in recent times.The applicants will be allowed to upload their documents later. DU has received 349,357 paid applications – over a lakh more than last year – until Monday morning. In 2019, 258,388 applicants had registered during the three-week registration period. In 2018, the corresponding figure was 278, 544.Though there are over 550,000 registrations on the admissions portal so far, the number of paid applicants is much less because of various factors, including duplicity and multiple registrations per candidate.“Applicants, whose qualifying examination is yet to be held, or applicants who are required to upload their marksheet/certificates are informed that the university will give them sufficient time to do so even after the registration is closed. This is likely to happen sometime in the second/third week of September,” DU’s admission branch had said in a statement on Saturday.A member of the admission branch, requesting anonymity, said that the cut-offs for undergraduate courses might be released in the first week of October. In July, HT had reported that the university might set higher cut-offs this year, as more number of students had scored above 90% in their class 12 Central Board of Secondary Examinations (CBSE) this year.

31-08-2020||India||A louder first voice and a more accessible last word||Nothing can be better than to engage in transformation when an organisation comes from a distinguished history. Such is the case for the Hindustan Times, the newspaper title you have trusted for almost a century. History alone does not sustain an institution, but it fosters it, reinforces it, and, in the case of a newspaper it gives it a sense of stability, authority and credibility.The Hindustan Times has a glorious history that begins with the words and inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi on September 15, 1924.“Every word and sentence published in the paper should be wrighed. There should not only be no untrue statements, but no suggestio falsi or suppressio veri.”The Mahatma’s message represents the first voice and the last word and it is as inspirational today as it was then. So, what a responsibility it is for those involved with the transformation of this iconic Indian news title. I am honoured to be involved with this transformation, as I have been withpreviousengagementswith the Hindustan Times as well as its sister newspaper, Mint. What is different is that this transformation in 2020 — one in which the world wakes up each day to the surreal times of a pandemic — comes at a time when the media landscape is in the midst of an unrivaled revolution. So much has happened in the past 10 years to change the way we consume information. We live in a multimedia world. The days of a person reading the newspaper in the morning with that first cup of coffee, and then not getting any more news till the next day are finished. Today, we are bombarded by news and information 24/7. Many turn to their mobile devices as many as 114 times or more a day. Headlines are there to be consumed, tempting us to read stories constantly. We lean forward to read those headlines, and lean back to read the stories beyond the headline.In a multiplatform world, an average news consumer may journey through three of those platforms in the course of a day. Perhaps starting a story in the printed edition of the newspaper, only to continue reading on the phone but finishing the story at the larger screen of a desktop computer at the office. It is in the midst of this amazing revolution in the way we consume news that the Hindustan Times has undertaken this ultimate transformation.I have accompanied the team of the Hindustan Times through this careful planning and detailed analysis of the existing product and how to improve it for the needs of news consumers today.Here are some key centerpieces of our work:1. The brand: A return to a nameplate (logo) that shakes hands with the rich past of the journalistic institution that is the Hindustan Times. 2. Multiplatform approach: The Hindustan Times as a true multiplatform title for our times: The new Hindustan Times offers the information when you want it, how you want it.3. Linear/mobile storytelling: Stories must be told with narratives and visuals. This is real transformation at work in the craft of journalism in your new Hindustan Times.4. Easier to navigate content: We value your time with our news brand. We want to make it easier for you to navigate from section to section, regardless of platform.5. The special characteristics of print: You will see the care and attention to detail that has gone in our rethink of the print edition: larger photos and graphics, more modular layout that is more visually appealing and easier to consume.6. Visuals at a glance: Through a system of “social cards”, you will see highlights of stories — the best quotes, the story in numbers, the key points of longer stories.If times were different, I would be present to witness the birth of this new Hindustan Times, my project #729 in 121 countries. I am there in spirit — and working closely with creative director Anup Gupta and his talented team via Zoom.This new Hindustan Times would make the Mahatma proud. It will now be a louder first voice, a more accessible last word.CEO/Founder, García Media Senior Adviser on News Design/Adjunct Professor Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Hearst Digital Media Professor in Residence (2013) garciamedia.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-louder-first-voice-and-a-more-accessible-last-word/story-2PmGbOTZ3DiscrhNzXLZML.html
31-08-2020||India||How Prashant Bhushan criminal contempt case progressed in Supreme Court||The Supreme Court (SC) will pronounce its judgment on Monday on the sentence to be awarded to activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan for the offence of criminal contempt of court.On August 14, the SC had found Bhushan guilty for putting out two tweets criticising the apex court and the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.The case was registered on July 9 and the first hearing in the matter was held on July 22. The case took 40 days to reach a conclusion from the date of its first hearing.Here is a timeline of how the case progressed and a conclusion was reached in little over a month: June 27: First TweetThe first of the two tweets criticised the functioning of the SC in the past six years. The tweet alleged that the historians would mark the role of the apex court in contributing to what Bhushan considered as destruction of democracy.“When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs”, the tweet had alleged.June 29: Second tweet“The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!” Bhushan had alleged in his second tweet that had accompanied a picture of CJI Bobde, sitting on a stationary Harley Davidson motorcycle. July 9: Petition against BhushanMehek Maheshwari, an advocate, filed a petition before the SC seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Bhushan for his tweets. As per Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of SC, the consent of the Attorney- General (A-G) or the Solicitor-General (S-G) is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt petition filed by an individual.Maheswari’s petition did not have such consent, but the court still decided to proceed suo motu (on its own motion) based on Maheshwari’s petition.July 22: First hearing in Supreme Court, notice to BhushanThe SC listed the case suo motu based on Maheshwari’s petition and issued notice to Bhushan seeking his response. The court also issued notice to A-G KK Venugopal seeking the assistance of the veteran lawyer in his personal capacity.August 2: Bhushan refuses to apologiseBhushan filed his response before the SC in which he refused to apologise for his tweets stating that it fell within the domain of free speech. This would be the first time in this case that Bhushan would refuse to apologise. Bhushan in his defence cited similar criticism of the SC made by its sitting and retired judges.“So serious were the misgivings of the senior sitting judges that they (the four judges) felt compelled to disregard the code of judicial conduct to call a press conference and warn citizens of danger to democracy because of danger to a free judiciary,” Bhushan submitted before the apex court.August 5: HearingA three-judge bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra and also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, heard the case for a day and reserved its verdict.August 14: Bhushan pronounced guilty, sentence hearing deferredIn a strongly-worded judgment, the three-judge bench held that the allegations levelled in the tweets against the apex court and CJI are malicious in nature and have the tendency to scandalise the SC and such conduct was not expected from Bhushan, who is a lawyer of 30 years standing at the Bar.The tweets, the apex court held, were based on the distorted facts and have the effect of destabilising the foundation of the Indian judiciary, the court said holding him guilty of criminal contempt of court.The court then posted the case for August 20 to hold a separate hearing to decide on the punishment to be given to Bhushan.August 20: AG KK Venugopal urges court not to punish BhushanWhen the case came up for hearing on sentencing, Bhushan found an unlikely ally in A-G Venugopal who prayed before the SC to take a lenient view and not to punish him taking into account his contributions in the fight against corruption and for the poor.Bhushan maintained that he would not apologise and quoted the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi:“I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal to magnanimity. I am here, therefore, to cheerfully submit to any penalty that can lawfully be inflicted upon me for what the court has determined to be an offence, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.”The court gave Bhushan time to “think over” and concluded the hearing.Read More: ‘History will judge the court’: Kapil Sibal on Prashant Bhushan contempt caseAugust 24: Bhushan stands his groundBhushan submitted another statement before the apex court maintaining that he would not apologise. He said that the views expressed by him through his tweets represented his bona fide (good faith) beliefs and, as a result, an apology for expressing such beliefs would be insincere.“An apology cannot be a mere incantation and any apology has to be sincerely made. If I retract a statement before this court that I otherwise believe to be true or offer an insincere apology, that in my eyes would amount to the contempt of my conscience and of an institution (SC) that I hold in highest esteem,” read the supplementary statement.August 25: Verdict on sentencing reservedThe court heard Bhushan on the statement submitted by him the day before. While the A-G urged the SC to let Bhushan off with a warning, the apex court said that it cannot do so unless Bhushan expresses regret for his tweets.Since no such regret was forthcoming, the SC said that it would not close the case and proceeded to reserve its judgment on the sentence to be awarded to Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-bhushan-criminal-contempt-case-how-the-case-progressed-in-sc/story-Cn7mKnM3gP8IBa8MxiIcxN.html
31-08-2020||India||The new, new Hindustan Times||This redesigned newspaper that you hold in your hands has been in the works for at least eight months, or BC, as some people have started referring to events of that vintage (Before Corona, if you must know). Even then, the idea was not so much to redesign the newspaper, but to use the redesign to effect a change in the newsroom’s approach to content across platforms (print and digital). For readers (and listeners and viewers), that means a few things. One, this change will be dynamic and ongoing. What you see today in the newspaper and the website is, to use a cliche, just the tip of the iceberg. Over the next few months (and perhaps even beyond that), you will continue to see changes, new features, and new utilities (especially on the website). All of them began from the exercise we kicked off in January - the first result of which you hold in your hands. Two, this change is more than skin deep. It will be reflected in how we treat stories and themes across print and digital. It will affect the choice of stories. And it will be showcased in how we display our work. This is best not spoken of, but experienced over time. Three, even as we have embarked on these changes, we have retained all that is good - the constancy, the reliability, the credibility, the respectability, the authoritativeness, and, above all, the rich legacy of Hindustan Times, which was founded in 1924. The new masthead is a direct result and also a manifestation of this- as is our new tagline, FirstVoice, Last Word (but more on this in a bit).The design of the paper itself has been driven by the most important drivers of how all of us have begun to interact with any content, including news, over the past decade (but more so in the past five years). Two words best encapsulate this approach - share and save. Everyone is starved for time (and also low on attention), so the immediate tendency when we come across something that requires more than a few minutes (sometimes more than a few seconds) is to save it. And often, when we encounter something we like, we like to share it, preferably through social networks. The print media does not encourage or facilitate sharing and saving. The design of the new HT seeks to address that inadequacy by using QR codes for most important articles (scanning them on a mobile phone will take readers to a web version of the article; a larger version; or a video, podcast, or interactive related to it) and by visualising important articles differently and through the filter of visual social media platforms. The social media cards that you will see across the print edition of the new HT are also influenced by this, as is the packaging of important must-reads as readily Instagrammable stories. This is also an area on which the HT newsroom will continue to work in the months to come millennial reader. Bookended by ‘aides and multimedia stories from ) the Einstein riddle and news-youen mental health. It’s *the* paper to with one purpose - deepening audience engagement.The coronavirus disease hit India in early March. The lock-down imposed to slow its spread (in late March) disrupted most activities, including the circulation of newspapers. At least some readers whose newspaper-reading moved online in this period may not return to the print paper. While the objectives of the HT redesign, when we started in January, did not visualise this short-term eventuality (of newspaper vendors not being allowed in some neighbourhoods on account of the pandemic, or, in a more extreme manifestation, of people entertaining baseless fears about the newspaper carrying the infection), it did recognise that ultimately, many readers would do their newspaper-reading online. The redesigned print paper was always going to be a tasting menu of sorts for the website www.hindustantimes. cornNow, it will be even more so - doing more than just its traditional role in the continuum of news that most readers dip into at various times of the day. At the same time, the clean design, with a clear hierarchy of headlines, and smart navigational nudges, is aimed at making the paper itself easy to read, or browse. For we must not forget that, even in this connected world, the daily newspaper serves as a record of history in a manner that no other medium or platform does.Now for the tagline. Traditionally, websites (even websites of newspapers) correspond to speed and print to credibility and authoritativeness. HT’s redesign exercise seeks to combine and balance the two -providing readers with news, information and knowledge fast (and sometimes, first), but while ensuring that this is done without compromising on clarity, credibility, depth and perspective Being both the first voice and the last word has required the redefinition of roles and processes within the larger HT newsroom and a change in how we work.We’d like to be the first voice, but we definitely want to be the last word.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-new-new-hindustan-times/story-iVySupLF0faX7wgo4fcq8I.html

31-08-2020||India||Why is it flooding in Central India?||An overflowing Narmada threw life out of gear in parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and water released from the Hirakud dam flooded several districts of Odisha on the weekend. At least 24 people were killed in flooding in MP and Odisha and thousands were displaced as heavy rainfall lashed other parts of India, causing reservoirs to overflow. Rainfall has been 25% more than normal in August, which India Meteorological Department (IMD) says is the highest for the month in 44 years. The previous highest in August was recorded in 1983, when rain was 23.8% more than the normal. Here’s a quick look at reasons for flooding in central India:• Persistent very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), was recorded in two-three days between August 25 and 27 in Odisha and from August 27 to 30 over Madhya Pradesh (MP). MP’s Chhindwara district’s 12 weather stations recorded between 20 and 41 cm of rainfall on August 28 to 29. Chaurai recorded 41 cm in a day. India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities are still assessing the data to come to the conclusion whether this is the highest-ever precipitation recorded on a day. Gujarat region continues to record very heavy rain. • A well-marked low-pressure area had formed over the Bay of Bengal, which moved very slowly from August 24 to 31 up to western Rajasthan bringing extremely heavy rainfall in its path. “Our analysis shows extremely heavy spells over MP were recorded only during one day between August 28 and 29 that triggered flooding. There is no likelihood of another low-pressure area forming over the Bay of Bengal immediately,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre (NWFC), IMD. • Now, rain will gradually reduce over central India and will begin over the northern plains, according to scientists. “Extremely heavy rain in MP and other parts of central India is mainly because of the formation of strong low-pressure area over western MP and eastern Rajasthan. We are expecting rain to decrease gradually over central India but Gujarat may experience very heavy rains for one more day. Rains will increase over the northern plains, when the monsoon trough shifts northwards around Wednesday (September 2),” said Dr Mrutyunja Mohapatra, director-general, IMD. • Such unusually heavy rains led to rivers flowing at extreme flood situations. It signifies that the highest flood level is breached. Stretches of Mahanadi, Wainganaga and Narmada rivers are still flowing in extreme flood situations. Eight dams in Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and MP are at 100% capacity and will have to release water to accommodate more rainfall. • While the floods have disrupted lives in these states, the excess rainfall can improve soil moisture and help with a good crop during the upcoming rabi season. “There are different ways of harvesting water. But the most important source of water for agriculture is groundwater. The focus should be on local storage and recharge systems. We have to store rainwater and avoid its run-off,” said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator, South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People. • The country has recorded 26.3% excess rains in August –-- the highest in 44 years with 61.5% excess over central India, 36.7% excess over the southern peninsula, 19.1% deficient over east and the north-east and 1.9% excess over the north-west parts of the country. Scientists have not linked the current spell with climate change, but central India has been recording a rising trend in extreme heavy rain events. According to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region”, a report of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) released earlier this year, showed that from 1950 onwards there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme heavy rainfall events over central India, along with a decreasing trend in the moderate rain events. A study published in the Nature journal in 2017 by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) had concluded that there was a three-fold rise in extreme rainfall along the west coast and central India between 1950 and 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-it-flooding-in-central-india/story-KpsDiw5nbu5OaAYdcckaLL.html

The order had come on a plea filed by a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) alleging that the liquor baron had received the money from British firm Diageo. They had accused him of concealing the facts and diverting money to his children in “flagrant violation” of various judicial orders.The top court had on August 27 reserved the order that will be delivered today by a bench of justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan. The court had earlier asked Mallya about the “truthfulness” of his disclosure of assets and the transfer of money to his children.In June, the apex court had directed its registry to explain as to why Mallya’s review petition had not been listed before the concerned court for the last three years and asked it to furnish all the details including names of officials who had dealt with the file concerning the review petition in the last three years.Mallya, who is an accused in a bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is presently in the United Kingdom.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-on-vijay-mallya-s-review-plea-on-transfer-of-40-mn-to-his-children-today/story-aGOoJVmKhkrDHXaxsJmGZN.html

31-08-2020||India||Govt should not be running airports and airlines; hopeful of privatising AI in 2020: Hardeep Puri||The government should not be running airports and airlines, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Sunday, adding that he hopes to privatise Air India during 2020.His remarks come at a time when the Kerala government has opposed the Union Cabinet’s approval on August 19 to lease out the Thiruvananthapuram airport to Adani Enterprises under the public-private partnership (PPP) model for a period of 50 years. Addressing a virtual meet on Namo app, Puri said, “I can tell you from my heart the government should not be running airports and the government should not be running airlines.” The Centre-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) owns and manages more than 100 airports, including the one in Kerala’s capital city. On Air India’s privatisation, Puri said, “As a going concern, one that is attractive to potential bidders, we should privatise it (Air India). And I am hopeful that we will be able to complete that privatisation process during this year.” Last Tuesday, the Central government extended by two months the deadline for placing bids for Air India till October 30 as the Covid-19 fallout has disrupted economic activity globally. The process of stake sale in the national carrier was initiated on January 27. This is the fourth extension given by the government for putting in bids. “If the government runs an airport or an airline, then they have to follow the government rules like L1 and L2, and that is not how commercial entities can run,” Puri said.When the government issues a tender, the lowest bidder deemed as L1 is the winner.Puri said he expects that the domestic air traffic would reach pre-Covid levels by the end of this year. Domestic flights resumed on May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. Currently, airlines are allowed to operate maximum 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights.The central government privatised six major airports -- Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Guwahati -- in February 2019. After a competitive bidding process, Adani Enterprises won the rights to run all of them.In July 2019, the Union Cabinet had approved the proposal for leasing out three airports -- Ahmedabad, Mangaluru and Lucknow - to Adani Enterprises.On August 19 this year, the Union Cabinet approved the proposal for leasing out the other three airports to the Ahmedabad-based company. Earlier this month, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposing the August 19 Cabinet decision to lease out the Thiruvananthapuram airport to the company. Vijayan stated in the letter that the Centre needs to reconsider the decision as it will be “difficult” for the state to cooperate.Kerala’s repeated requests to entrust the airport management with the special purpose vehicle (SPV) in which the state government is the major stakeholder was also ignored, Vijayan mentioned.“In view of the unilateral decision taken by the Government of India without giving credence to the cogent arguments put forward by the State government, it will be difficult for us to offer cooperation to the implementation of the decision, which is against the wishes of the people of the State,” he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-should-not-be-running-airports-and-airlines-hopeful-of-privatising-ai-in-2020-hardeep-puri/story-aMzP0dWHZzcy7Omlk56fKJ.html
31-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Friday, as reported by Hindustan Times the same day, India crossed the peak seven-day average of the US in terms of daily coronavirus cases, according to both worldometers.info and the New York Times database. The US saw its peak seven-day average in mid-July; India saw it in late August. A seven-day average is more representative than just a day’s number. It accounts for spikes, including those caused by reporting delays. For instance, for most countries in the world, the skyline of daily case numbers (represented in bars), shows a dip every five days – at the weekend. In India, even testing drops off on Sundays.Since mid to late July, the US has been on its second trough, with daily cases dropping off by almost 25,000. India’s seven-day average of daily cases has at least doubled since mid-July. And unlike the US, the country hasn’t seen any troughs. The progress of the pandemic in India has been on a steadily rising curve, definitely slowed by the 68-day lockdown imposed by the federal government, but still one that continues to inch up. And that shouldn’t surprise anyone.Why today’s GDP numbers matterIt shouldn’t because of four reasons. One, India is testing more than it used to. At the end of June, the country was averaging 210,525 tests a day, according to the HT dashboard (the number is, again, a seven-day average). By the end of July, this number increased to 501,370 tests a day on average. And by the end of August (as of Saturday), this number was 881,345 tests a day. This is a significant increase (although India continues to remain a laggard in terms of tests per million people compared to many other countries), and when you test more, it is only natural that you find more cases. The average positivity rate (again, a weekly average) has remained in the 8-12% corridor in this period, moving from 8.87% in late June to 10.4% in late July. It was at 8.14% as of Saturday. I’ve always discounted the national positivity rate for two reasons: disparities between testing intensity across states; and the fact that many states have not seen their positivity rates follow the established pattern (as testing is increased continuously, a rise, then a long plateau, and finally a fall) indicating that they are testing nowhere close to the numbers they should be.Vaccine diplomacy in India’s outreach planTwo, India is opening up, and as countries open up, they will see a rise in daily cases (the important question is the efficacy with which they quell these flare-ups). Given India’s size and population, it definitely did not make sense for India to wait, like countries in Europe did, for the number of cases to start declining before opening up. That would have meant waiting till the end of the year perhaps – something the economy could have ill-afforded. The home ministry has issued guidelines for what it calls Unlock 4.0, the fourth stage of India’s phased reopening, and welcome as this is from the point of view of livelihoods and the economy, it will result in some flare-ups.Three, and regular readers will recognise the refrain, India isn’t testing enough. It is only when it tests adequately can infected individuals be identified and isolated, and people exposed to them be traced. Four, the ability of a country to keep the number of coronavirus disease cases under check once it eases its lockdown is directly proportional to its ability and willingness to enforce measures such as the wearing of masks and social distancing (and also directly proportional to the willingness of its people to be disciplined about both). India, unfortunately, lags on this count – as do other countries including the US, but other people’s mess is other people’s problem.India’s peak still seems sometime away, which means the number of daily cases will continue to rise. While the country’s low case fatality rate – touted often by health administrators – is definitely cause for cheer, at the current 1.8%, it is worth noting that 80,000 cases a day, today, will translate into 1,440 deaths, weeks from now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-cCerxiJkXCYYkmq0Tj6CiP.html
31-08-2020||India||Ultra-nationalists call us separatists; treated as nationalists in J-K: Omar Abdullah||A year after a constitutional change nullified its seven-decade-old special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories, the political environment in Jammu & Kashmir is in flux – again. At the heart of the churning, spurred mostly by the release of frontline mainstream political leaders from months of preventive detention, are Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah of the National Conference (NC). Last week, Farooq, 83, emerged as the prime mover and pivot in the formation of a conglomerate of the Valley’s six parties – some of them sworn rivals – that has posed the first challenge to the Centre by reaffirming commitment to the Gupkar Declaration, pegged to the demand for restoration of J&K’s special status. The father-son duo, both former chief ministers and the second and third generations of Kashmir’s formidable Abdullah dynasty, is actively galvanising dormant cadres. On Friday, a day before the party’s first political affairs committee meeting in a year, the Abdullahs spoke to Ramesh Vinayak at their home in Srinagar in their first joint political interview. Edited excerpts:Ramesh Vinayak: How will you take the Gupkar Declaration forward?Farooq: We are not users of guns or stones. We will protest peacefully like Mahatma Gandhi did. Every constituent in this [six-party conglomerate] has its own agenda. But on the restoration of statehood, Article 370 and Article 35A, we are together. Whatever action we take will be joint. It won’t be only of Farooq Abdullah or the National Conference.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech, said the delimitation exercise is underway and assembly elections will followQ: Will you contest the elections? Farooq: Any decision [on contesting] will depend first on my party and we will take a call subject to the situation. We will talk to other stakeholders in the Gupkar Declaration. If we are united in this exercise, we will take them on board and decide. National Conference’s political committee meets for the first time since nullification of Article 370Q: But your party has opted out of the delimitation commission.Farooq: That’s because we told them on their face that we don’t believe in your delimitation. The BJP has a certain purpose. It wants that in J&K, a Hindu majority emerges, and the Muslim majority goes down. Can you beat what the government of India is trying to do here? The state assembly, when I was chief minister, had decided to go for delimitation along with the rest of the country in 2026. Then, why has the Centre suddenly brought it forward? They want to divide us on Hindu-Muslim lines and create Hindu dominance. That will never happen. Omar: It’s not just that. The delimitation commission is a product of the changes brought about on August 5 last year. When we don’t recognise those changes, how can we recognise this panel? By participating in its proceedings, we will essentially be lending credence to the J&K Reorganisaton Act, 2019. When we are fighting this Act, there is no question of participation. The commission’s membership doesn’t grant you the power of veto. Our three MPs may have been able to share their views, but that would not have been binding on the commission. Our participation would’ve been used as a rubber stamp. Q: You are betting on a legal fight in the Supreme Court that may take years to conclude. Farooq: The legal battle is just one fight. We will also fight it politically. Q: How?Omar: We are a mainstream political party. We will fight using legal means at our disposal which are two -- one is the power that the Constitution gives us to challenge the decisions in the court; and the second is forums available, including Parliament, media, social media, and public meetings. We have three MPs to take the voices of the people of J&K to the highest platform of democracy. We are not a party that has ever subscribed to violence as a means to achieving our end. In fact, if anything, the NC has always been the victim of violence. Farooq: Let me also remind you of 1984 when Jagmohan was sent as J&K governor to dismiss me (as chief minister). He told Indira Gandhi (the then prime minister) that Farooq Abdullah would put the state to fire. I said I don’t want the blood of people on my hands. I believe that today also. I’ll fight for their rights even if it takes my life but I’m not going to take their lives. Business revival panel meets in Jammu-Kashmir, discusses way forwardQ: But New Delhi expects you accept the new reality that Article 370 is history and move on. Farooq: (laughs) They want us to accept that through the gun. I’m not going to do that. Omar: The new reality doesn’t mean we can’t argue against what has been done. If dissent is the essence of democracy, then what we are doing is strengthening democracy. We are dissenting against a government decision by democratic means. The fundamental premise in the August 5 decision was that Article 370 was discriminatory, impeding development, promoting corruption and dynastic rule, breeding separatism, and obstructing the state’s integration with the country.Farooq: All that was [said] to sell a lie. I’m living in this house since 1974, when my father was not prime minister or chief minister of J&K. We sold our ancestral property and with that money my father was able to buy this house for me when I was in England. Eighteen members of our family own that (the ancestral properties). Are we that corrupt? And they said, Farooq Abdullah has homes in Dubai, Paris, London and America. Show me where all these houses are, so that I can go and occupy them? My wife is an English woman. She has a home there (England). She is entitled to her home. Then, they said development suffered. Thank God, Ghulam Nabi Azad was able to prove in the Rajya Sabha that J&K is far better than their great state of Gujarat. What we are suffering from is their (the Centre’s) lack of support. To this date, rail has not arrived from Katra to Banihal.There is more separatism now than before August 5 last year. Every day, guns are booming and people are giving up their lives. It’s not the Pakistanis who are dying today, it is the Kashmiris. Who has created them [militants]? Not Farooq Abdullah. I was in jail. They [the BJP government] created them. The hatred they have created between Hindus and Muslims in the rest of the nation… do you think it will not have an effect here? It will. Q: But what if the SC upholds the abrogation of Article 370? Omar: You are asking me to give a categorical answer to a hypothetical question. The arguments are yet to begin in the Supreme Court. Our petition makes an incredibly strong case on a simple point: a governor cannot assume the powers of an assembly, and an assembly cannot assume the powers of a constituent assembly. Because if an assembly can assume the power of a constituent assembly, tomorrow what stops a state in the North-east that has a simmering discontent from converting their assembly into a constituent assembly and then saying, ‘I have the constituent assembly’s powers as demonstrated by J&K and therefore I’m redrawing our relationship with the rest of India’. There is a fundamental flaw to what New Delhi did on August 5, 2019. You can wish away the merit of our case politically, but not legally. The government’s case is all political and emotional. If J&K has suffered, it’s not because of its special status but because of militancy. Either militancy is the product of Pakistan or it is product of Article 370. How can it be both? When we talk to people on the Gupkar Declaration, we will make an emotional argument. Let’s see where it takes us. Centre notifies distribution of power between L-G, govt in Jammu and KashmirQ: A broader national consensus has endorsed the nullification of Article 370 as fait accompli.Omar: I agree that we are on the losing side of public opinion. In J&K, we are losers because we are mainstream political operatives. We lose out elsewhere as well for being the proponents of special status. Article 370 has never been explained in its correct context to the rest of the country. It was always seen as a barrier to buying land in J&K. That is not the nuts and bolts. There are still parties that lend their voice to us, particularly the Left, DMK, and TMC. Would I like to see more? Yes. But we take what we can get. Q: There is a sense that the August 5 move has constricted political space for mainstream political parties in Kashmir? Farooq: Mainstream parties were always taken by the people of Kashmir to be mouthpieces of Delhi. They always thought they are not a part of us and they don’t stand by our emotions. That is so even today. When we (NC) fought the 1996 assembly elections, on what basis did we fight? Narasimha Rao ji, as prime minister, had on the floor of Parliament promised us that sky is the limit and there is no azadi. We never asked for azadi, but we wanted back what has been taken away from us. Where was the BJP at that time? Where was any other party except Farooq Abdullah’s NC. We lost our workers and ministers because they were standing by the nation. But did the nation stand with us? Omar: You have to understand how difficult it is for us. We get fixed from both sides. The ultra nationalists in the rest of country treat us as separatists. But here in Kashmir we are treated as nationalists. Please tell me what we are. IT panel drops J-K internet restrictions from its agendaQ: What is your reading of the mood on the streets in Kashmir? Farooq: If you want to know the honest truth, they are not part of India. This is God’s truth. You ask an ordinary person, he does not want to be Pakistani. Let’s be frank about it. He is not a Pakistani, but he is not an Indian today after what they (the Centre) did. Q: Will the six-party conglomerate become a joint front in the elections? Omar: There is no possibility of an election in J&K before 2021. Thankfully, the Government of India has willy-nilly given us this breathing space to work together on the Gupkar Declaration which is not an announcement of pre-electoral understanding. Q: But there are ideological contradictions between the constituents.Omar: We have different political ideologies, but for the time being, these have been set aside for a larger goal. We wanted to send a wider message to New Delhi that on this question of what happened on August 5, like-minded parties will come together. The legal fight is not being fought together. The government says now J&K’s integration is complete and it will be a harbinger of ‘Naya Kashmir’? Farooq: We are so integrated… my God! That’s why we have sold this in every corner. Do they mention any other state? Every day Kashmir, Kashmir, Kashmir… ‘Kashmir hamara hai’ (Kashmir is ours). Do they ever say ‘Maharashtra hamara hai’ or ‘Bengal hamara hai’. Because they are not sure that Kashmir ‘hamara hai’. Q: How real are the apprehensions on altering the demographic character of Muslim-majority J&K after the government allayed that at the highest level?Farooq: How can you believe the home minister who lied in Parliament that I have been freed? How can I believe their assurances? Omar: Look at the numbers. Take the domicile certificates that have been issued thus far and see what is the religious break-up? I don’t have actual numbers, but I can guarantee you that more than 90% of the new domicile certificates that have been issued will be non-Muslims. Not that the demographic change will take place overnight; it will be a creeping effect. But if this domicile law is not overturned, eventually that is where we will be. That’s why it’s important J&K is given back its statehood so that we can legislate our own domicile law. Today, the domicile law you have given us is weaker than even Himachal Pradesh’s. Q: Both the PM and home minister have said that restoration of statehood is a possibility. Will that help bring the mainstream parties on board? Farooq: You have lost the hearts of the people. It will be difficult for a political party to just accept that statehood has been restored and, therefore, you’re alright. Ceasefire violations in J&K rose by 60 times since 2010: Home ministry in response to RTI queryOmar: It’s a much bigger fight. Statehood is one part of what was done on August 5. Therefore, when you trap us into this argument about statehood, you try and give this impression as if once statehood is done, everything else will be forgotten. How can that be? Domicile is one part. What about the representative character of the government? We are still a Muslim-majority state. Please look at the make-up of our administration today. Your LG is non-Muslim; chief secretary non-Muslim; DGP non-Muslim; both your divisional commissioners are non-Muslims; both your IGs of police non-Muslims; the chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir high court is non-Muslim; the rest of the high court bench, barring two judges, are all non-Muslims. How many of your deputy commissioners and SPs posted in Kashmir today are Kashmiri-speaking? It may appear minor, but please understand these are the issues that resonate with people. We are not fundamentalist people. We don’t play the religious card, but when there is such a severe communal imbalance, there will be resentment. ‘No justification for delay in elections’: J&K Apni PartyQ: Do you see some design behind all this? Omar: Design or not, it affects public perception. You are trying to change the script in which Kashmiri is written. These are changes you are forcing on us and then saying ‘you are integrated’. Integration doesn’t come from a piece of paper. It comes from emotions. I have to feel integrated. If you change the script in which I am writing, you change the language in which an officer on the ground is addressing me, and then you turn around and tell me: ‘I am integrated.’ I am not. I dare you to do this in Tamil Nadu. I dare you to change their script and see what happens. There will be hell to pay there. Why do all experiments have to happen here? Q: The mainstream Kashmiri parties, particularly the NC, have for long been seen as a bridge between New Delhi and Srinagar. Has that changed? Farooq: I don’t want to be the bridge any more. They have deceived my people. Omar: If by bridge you mean that we will allow them to bring their voices and propagate it here, that’s not a bridge. If by bridge you mean that you will allow us to take the voices of J&K and Ladakh and propagate it there, it is fine. Enforced communication will not work. Q: Is there a meeting ground between Kashmiri parties and the Centre?Farooq: No, I don’t see any ground. Omar: We are not appealing to Prime Minister Modi to reverse what he has done. When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee sahib said that the matter of Kashmir will be decided within the umbrella of ‘Jamooriyat, insaniyat, Kashmiriyat’, that opened the door for us. Today, no such door is open. Our fight revolves around the Supreme Court. Tomorrow, if a government is formed in Delhi that is open to a dialogue, then we will see. We are not asking anything beyond the Constitution, so why should we surrender. Police stop PDP rally in Srinagar, detain half a dozen leadersQ: Doing away with Article 370 has been a core ideological agenda of the BJP. Why did the August 5 happenings surprise you? Farooq: I agree. But is Mr Modi the prime minister of the BJP or Prime Minister of India? Omar: I’m surprised because what you have reversed is not a party’s political position. You have betrayed a sovereign commitment of the Union of India with the state of J&K. The BJP is not India. It is a political party in India. It can play politics. But the BJP, I don’t believe, should have the power to reverse a sovereign commitment that was not time-bound. Q: Some quarters believe the Centre is propping up a new crop of leaders in Kashmir. Omar: You can’t prop up a politician or a party. That has always been the mistake that gets made in places like Delhi. Politicians don’t get propped up by anyone except the people. Haven’t you tried such experiments before? Q: How do you look at the new formation, Apni Party?Farooq: IB (Intelligence Bureau) formation. Omar: Political space is open to everybody. Aaiye apni kismet azamayiye (Come, try your luck). Who stops anybody from trying? Q: What will it take to repair the trust deficit between the Centre and mainstream parties of Kashmir? Farooq: First, honesty of purpose. If they want to win hearts, they will have to reverse what they did on August 5. That will be the starting point. It is not that people will suddenly feel happy. No. A lot more will have to be done. Q: Aren’t you being unrealistic in expecting the Centre to undo Article 370 move? Farooq: We don’t expect them to undo that. Omar: Look, there is a trust deficit. If they are willing to accept that, we will start resolving it. At the moment, they don’t even believe there is trust deficit. They feel everything is fine. Q: Why has Mehbooba Mufti not been released, while you and other mainstream leaders have been set free?Farooq: That only she can answer. We have not cut any deal for our release. We are not dealers. Omar: Whatever freedom we have achieved has been fought for. I’m sitting here today because I went to the Supreme Court and fought my case and was able to get out just before the coronavirus set in. Q: What stops the NC from holding political activities on the ground? Omar: We are battling an illness beyond comprehension. Just a few days ago, we had a meeting of 10 people in this garden and one turned out to be corona positive. All my colleagues were sitting home for 10 days. How can you have bigger gatherings than that? Farooq: I had to lock myself up. I’m more at risk, being on immune-suppressive drugs. Omar: An artificial detention situation has been created here. There is still a threat to life for a mainstream political operative. Yet none of them have security to move around. Today, security and vehicles are provided to only the BJP and the Apni Party. Ram Madhav’s Kashmir visit amid killing of BJP leaders and a political churnQ: What is the way out of the current political vacuum?Omar: Slowly, we will start political activity. We will craft a narrative and move forward. The way forward will not be decided by one or two persons sitting in the garden. What we have lost is 70 years of what we had. Q: How has the August 5 move impacted you personally?Farooq: I felt betrayed as a man who stood for the nation. Friends on the other side (Pakistan) hated us. For them, we were slaves or mouthpieces of India. The only thing that mattered to them is the Hurriyat. If anything gave me strength, it was the Quran. I will fight till my last breath. Omar: I’m bitter and less trusting. I used to be cautiously optimistic, now I’m pessimistic than even realistic. I don’t care that I spent eight months in detention. It’s not a big deal in a life of 50 years. The betrayal with J&K is far deeper. It’s a betrayal of an idea of the relationship between J&K and India that was crafted by far greater minds. It is difficult to reconcile. We are still trying to come to terms. I don’t know if we ever will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ultra-nationalists-call-us-separatists-in-j-k-we-re-treated-as-nationalists-omar-abdullah/story-8q8c1mRrhyWMwkWQaULRVK.html
31-08-2020||India||‘Will contest Article 370 move legally, democratically’: Farooq and Omar Abdullah||National Conference (NC) leaders and former chief ministers Farooq and Omar Abdullah are “bitter” about, and feel “betrayed” by, the constitutional changes related to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) pushed through by the Centre last year, and will contest them both politically and legally, while asserting that their struggle will be entirely peaceful.The two leaders, in perhaps their first joint interview, said they rejected the Union government’s constituency delimitation exercise and domicile laws as efforts to change the demography of the Valley. They also spoke of the pain of on the one hand being seen as separatists by “ultra-nationalists” in the rest of the country, and on the other, as nationalists in Kashmir.Read the full interview hereThe father-son duo — sitting in their heavily protected Gupkar residence in Srinagar — told Hindustan Times that the mood on the Kashmiri street was of not being a part of India and “not Indian”; warned about the impact in J&K of growing Hindu-Muslim “hatred” in the rest of the country; pointed to the unrepresentative character of the current administration in the UT — with local Muslims having little space; and said that no door was open for a dialogue with the Centre.When asked about the mood on the Kashmiri street, Farooq Abdullah, 83, said: “If you want to know the honest truth, they are not part of India. This is God’s truth. You ask an ordinary person, he does not want to be Pakistani. Let’s be frank about it. He is not a Pakistani, but he is not an Indian today after what they (the Centre) did.”Last year, Parliament effectively nullified Article 370, which conferred special status on J&K, removed Article 35A, which empowered the state legislature to define permanent residents for government jobs and property ownership, reorganised the state into two separate administrative units of J&K and Ladakh, and made them both Union Territories. On August 15 this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that after the delimitation process is complete, there would be elections to the new assembly in J&K. The Centre has also appointed a new lieutenant governor, Manoj Sinha. The new UT’s major parties have, meanwhile, issued a Gupkar joint statement, taking forward their Gupkar declaration of last year, pledging that they will fight the constitutional changes together.Rejecting the charge that Article 370 led to separatism, Farooq Abdullah said, “There is more separatism now than before August 5 last year. It’s not the Pakistanis who are dying today, it is the Kashmiris. Who has created them (militants)? Not Farooq Abdullah. I was in the jail. They (the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government) created them. The hatred they have created between Hindus and Muslims in the rest of the nation…do you think it will not have an effect here? It will.”Elaborating on the legal dimension of their battle against the constitutional changes, the younger Abdullah, 50, said that their petition in the Supreme Court rested on a strong point. “A governor cannot assume the powers of an assembly, and an assembly cannot assume the powers of a constituent assembly....There is a fundamental flaw to what New Delhi did on August 5, 2019. You can wish away the merit of our case politically, but not legally.”When asked about the fact that there appeared to be a broader national consensus against Article 370, Omar Abdullah acknowledged being on the losing side of “public opinion”. On the position of mainstream parties in the UT, he later said, “You have to understand how difficult it is for us. We get fixed from both sides. The ultra-nationalists in the rest of country treat us as separatists. But here in Kashmir we are treated as nationalists. Please tell me what we are.” On the PM’s statement on delimitation, Farooq Abdullah said, “We told them on their face that we don’t believe in your delimitation. The BJP has a certain purpose. It wants that in J&K, a Hindu majority emerges and the Muslim majority goes down.” Omar Abdullah added: “The delimitation commission is a product of the changes brought about on August 5 last year. When we don’t recognise those changes, how can we recognise this panel?” National Conference’s political committee meets for the first time since nullification of Article 370He also elaborated on the apprehensions about demographic changes in the Valley, especially due to the domicile law. “I don’t have actual numbers but I can guarantee you that more than 90% of the new domicile certificates that have been issued will be to non-Muslims. Not that the demographic change will take place overnight; it will be a creeping effect.”While Farooq Abdullah said he did not want to be a bridge between Delhi and Srinagar since the Centre had “deceived” his people, Omar Abdullah said that if being a bridge meant voicing the concerns of the people, they would do so — but if it meant propagating the Centre’s views, they would not do so. Farooq Abdullah also said that he saw no meeting ground with the Centre, while his son said, “When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee sahib said that the matter of Kashmir will be decided within the umbrella of ‘Jamooriyat, Insaniyat, Kashmiriyat’, that opened the door for us. Today, no such door is open...Tomorrow, if a government is formed in Delhi that is open to a dialogue, then we will see.”Business revival panel meets in Jammu-Kashmir, discusses way forwardReferring to the move to nullify Article 370, Omar Abdullah said that “integration does not come from a piece of paper, “it comes from emotions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-contest-370-move-legally-democratically-farooq-and-omar-abdullah/story-ijLqt6hbQyeIph4HEMRvzN.html
31-08-2020||India||Number Theory: How rainfall pattern is changing significantly||Total monsoon rainfall in 2020, as of 8.30am on Sunday, is the 11th highest for this period since 1901. However, 2020 seems to be an outlier when read with long-term rainfall statistics. Monsoon rainfall in India has been gradually declining since the 1950s. This trend has been accompanied by rains becoming more skewed; most of the rains fall over a smaller period of time. Rains are also getting more intense, meaning there are fewer episodes of rain, but when it rains, it pours. In 2019, heavy and extreme intensity rainfall was the highest since 1901.Total monsoon rainfall in the country this year, as of 8.30am on Sunday, has been 771.1 mmTotal monsoon rainfall in the country this year, as of 8.30am on Sunday, has been 771.1 mm, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s gridded rainfall data set. This is the 11th highest monsoon rainfall for the June 1-August 30 period since 1901. That makes 2020 an outlier already. Decadal averages of monsoon rainfall up to August 30 suggest that total monsoon rainfall in India has been declining. The period from June 1 to September 30 is considered the monsoon season. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Not only are rains declining, they are also getting skewedThis decrease in total rainfall has accompanied another trend: the decrease in the number of days on which at least half the rain falls. In the last decade (2020 has been excluded to see the pattern over the entire monsoon season), 50% of the rainfall over the 122-day monsoon was seen on an average of 40.4 days. This was the fastest in the 12 decades since 1901. To be sure, the corresponding time for 75% of rainfall and 90% was only the fourth highest (70.6 days and 94.3 days respectively), although the long-term trend for those higher shares of rainfall is also the same: it takes fewer days now. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Regional variations in the number of days it takes for rainfall to take placeThe all-India numbers hide a significant regional variation in this pattern. For example, Delhi received 50% of its total monsoon rainfall in 2011-19 in just 83 days. This number was 30 for Karnataka. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();When it rains, it poursSkewed rainfall could mean an increase in heavy and extreme rainfall. And this has indeed happened for India as a whole since the second half of the last century. Combined heavy and extreme intensity rainfall was the third highest in this decade. In 2019, heavy and extreme intensity rainfall was the highest since 1901. A 24-hour rainfall between 35.5 mm and 244.5 mm in a grid - this analysis uses IMD’s gridded rainfall data set - is considered heavy intensity rainfall and that above 244.5 mm, extreme rainfall. A grid is a box bound by two latitudes and longitudes 0.25 degrees apart.Skewed rainfall does not guarantee heavy rainfallThe two trends - days taken for a certain proportion of monsoon rain to fall, and its intensity - can diverge when the total monsoon rainfall is decreasing. This is exactly what has happened over north-central India, the lndo-Gangetic plains and the northeastern states. With declining total rainfall, the amount of heavy intensity rainfall has decreased although the number of days it takes for 50% of monsoon rainfall to fall has reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-how-rainfall-pattern-is-changing-significantly/story-up9eTfw4P3G8Na9r2gk2zH.html
31-08-2020||India||Why GDP data matters and key indicators to look for||The National Statistical Office (NSO) will release the GDP numbers for the April-June quarter of the current financial year on Monday and there is a wide consensus among economists that the data will reflect an economic contraction.To be sure, the estimates vary. SBI’ Ecowrap research expects a 16.5% contraction in the first quarter. A research note by Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Pvt. Ltd, expects a 17.5% contraction. Pranab Sen, India’s former chief statistician, expected the economy to contract between 12% and 40% in an earlier comment to HT (see https://bit.ly/34PFsTV). And a Bloomberg poll of 15 economists, put the contraction at 19.2%.Here are three things to keep in mind while reading the data. Monday’s “first estimates” could see further downward revisions: India’s GDP calculation methodology uses formal sector activity as a proxy for informal sector activity while calculating the first estimates. A research note by Pranjul Bhandari says that because the pandemic has affected the informal sector more than the formal sector, and given the lower shock absorption capacity of firms in the former, the initial numbers could overestimate economic activity in manufacturing and services. Once the informal sector numbers are available, the 17.5% contraction could increase to as much as 25%, she adds.What is happening to nominal growth rate: While the real growth rate is expected to remain in contraction zone not just in the first quarter but also the full financial year, today’s release will give an idea about the hit to nominal growth. Because the consumer price index and wholesale price index have been diverging, there is a lack of clarity on this count at the moment. Nominal growth numbers matter significantly for revenue collections. Taxes, after all, are a fraction of nominal incomes. Nominal GDP growth plummeted to 7.2% in 2019-20, the lowest since 1975-76. A disproportionate fall in nominal growth, and its adverse effect on revenue collection, will make it more difficult for the government to boost economic activity. This will also worsen the already growing tension between the Centre and the states, given the ongoing controversy around the payment of Goods and Services Tax compensation.Sector-wise pain of the pandemic’s disruption: Monday’s GDP numbers will not be the first indicators of economic activity during this period, as there are other high-frequency indicators such as the Purchasing Managers’ Indices, the Index of Industrial Production and the performance of core sector industries. However, the Gross Value Added (GVA) numbers will give a detailed estimate of sector-wise performance of the economy. This, when read with respective employment shares, will tell us the extent of pain that India’s 400 million-plus workforce suffered during the lockdown. For example, construction had a share of 8% in GVA in 2018-19, but its employment share, according to the 2018-19 Periodic Labour Force Survey was 12.1%. A larger contraction in the employment-intensive non-farm sector will mean that the economic pain of the pandemic has been more widespread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-today-s-gdp-numbers-matter/story-gydjxb6sZCt372kG6rpbaI.html

IMA’s data for doctors alone has registered 307 deaths as of today and a total of 2,006 infected. 188 of those who died are General Practitioners who are the first point of contact for people,” IMA wrote in its letter. “All doctors who have laid down their lives in fighting this epidemic should be treated at par with the martyrs of Indian Armed Forces and acknowledged appropriately,” the letter by IMA stated.Also read | 2.2 million health workers taking care of Covid-19 patients get special insuranceThe authorities at IMA have also underlined that doctors suffer a viral load and higher Case Fatality Rate (CFR). It added, the surviving spouse or dependent should be provided a Government job as per their qualifications. The letter to the prime minister comes almost five months after the government had announced a special insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh for doctors, nurses, paramedics, technicians, and other health care professionals involved in the care of Covid-19 patients. Around 2.2 million health workers were expected to be covered in this scheme. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in March this year, had said that the government want to attend to the front-line warriors first, not forgetting the risks that they are putting themselves in by dealing with patients affected with coronavirus.“For them, we are providing an insurance cover. In the three months that they are exposing themselves to this virus – hopefully, by then this will be contained – we shall be providing ₹50 lakhs to each person as medical insurance cover in case they need it,” said Sitharaman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-at-par-with-armed-forces-martyrs-ima-asks-pm-modi-for-inclusive-solatium-for-doctors/story-5fStTiIT1c9U3whfPXeFAN.html
31-08-2020||India||Elephant found dead in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar, seventh jumbo to die in less than 3 months||An elephant was found dead in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar forest division on Sunday making it the seventh jumbo to die in the state in less than three months. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department said that prima facie the death appears to be due to natural causes. “One male elephant, around 30-years-old was found dead on Sunday morning in an agricultural field at Shah Mansur beat of Khanpur range of Haridwar forest division. As of now, it appears that the elephant died due to a natural cause or could have been electrocuted as a high-tension wire is passing through that area. A post-mortem examination is being conducted, after which the actual cause of death will be known,” said Suhag. In the third week of August (August 20 and August 19), two elephants were reported dead from Lansdowne forest division of Uttarakhand within 24 hours. Sant Ram, divisional forest officer for Lansdowne forest division said that both the elephants were adolescents and the deaths were reported from Kotdwar and Laldhang regions. Of these two elephants, officials had informed that one could have died due to electrocution as a high tension line goes through the place where the elephant carcass was found. On July 27, the carcass of a three-year-old elephant was found in a gorge near Nakraunda area in Dehradun forest division after it was hit by a train. On July 19, a carcass of a sub-adult elephant was found in Jaspur range in Udham Singh Nagar district. On July 14, a carcass of 25-year-old wild tusker was spotted in the forests near a factory under the Mohan forest range of Almora forest division which is adjacent to the Corbett Tiger Reserve. On June 14, a carcass of a seven-year-old female elephant was found in Corbett Tiger Reserve’s Dhela range. Uttarakhand government had recently reported that elephant numbers crossed the 2,000 mark in the state after a recently concluded elephant estimation process. The state reported a 29.9% increase since 2015, and reported a total of 2,026 elephants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-found-dead-in-uttarakhand-s-haridwar-seventh-jumbo-to-die-in-less-than-3-months/story-23QEM1AUlngGTh8a9rswYN.html
31-08-2020||India||DoPT spells out quarterly review for early retirement of bureaucrats||The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on August 28 has asked all departments and ministries to maintain a register of officers attaining 50/55 years of age or completing 30 years of service who may be asked to take early retirement in ‘public interest’ grounds of ‘doubtful integrity’ and ‘ineffectiveness’. The notification, viewed by HT, states that the register is to be scrutinised at the beginning of every quarter by a senior officer in the Ministry/Department/cadre and who will undertake a review of the same to decide on pre-mature retirement or retention of an officer. At present, FR 56 (j) and 56 (l) monitored premature retirement of officials from Group A and B and Group C respectively. The step is being taken to ‘strengthen the administrative machinery by developing responsible and efficient administration at all levels and to achieve efficiency, economy and speed in the disposal of Government functions’. “In order to bring in better clarity to the existing instructions and enable uniform implementation, an effort has been made to review, consolidate and reiterate the guidelines so far issued on the subject at one place,” the DoPT said in the notification. The performance review will be done in January to March, for July to September of the same year. Similarly in April to June, the review will be done for October to December of the same year. July to September, will be reviewed from January to March of the next year and October to December quarter performances, will be done from April to June of the next year. “The move is targeted at removing deadwood and maintaining a high level of efficiency in the bureaucracy,” a ministry of personnel, grievances and pensions official. “It will also help reduce corruption in the system.” The government has also instituted review committee under the concerned secretary of the Cadre Controlling Authority (CAA) having two members. For Group A officers, the review Committee shall be headed by the Secretary of the concerned CCA. Where there are Boards CBDT, CBEC, Railway Board, etc, the Chairman will head the review committee. For Group B officers, an Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary level officer shall head the Review Committee. In the case of Non-Gazetted employees, an officer of the level of Joint Secretary will head the Committee. However, in case the Appointing Authority is lower in rank than a Joint Secretary, then an officer of the level of Director/Deputy Secretary will be the head. In the case of Non-Gazetted employees in other than centralized cadres, Head of Department/Head of the Organisation shall decide the composition of the Review Committee. “Chief Vigilance Officer, in case of Gazetted officers, or his representative in case of non-Gazetted officers, will be associated in case of record reflecting adversely on the integrity of any employee,” states the notification. On August 5, the DoPT also set up a new Representation Committee for civil servants headed by Leela Nanda, secretary, consumer affairs, Ashutosh Jindal, joint secretary, cabinet secretariat and a member to be nominated by the CCA. “Government may, at any time after a Government servant has attained the age of 50/55 years or completed 30 years of service, as the case may be, retire him pre-maturely in public interest,” states the notification. It, however, adds that that premature retirement is distinct from compulsory retirement, which is prescribed as a penalty. In its bid to reduce corruption in the bureaucracy, the Central government last year had compulsorily retired at least 30 Indian Revenue Service officials. There is also no bar on the Government to review any such case again where it had decided earlier to retain the officer, but the Appropriate/Appointing Authority is of the opinion that it is ‘expedient to undertake the review again on account of changed circumstances, in public interest’. “In such cases, the Appropriate Authority is expected to demonstrate visible meticulousness as such Government servants have been found effective on earlier occasion for retention in service,” states the DoPT notification The broad criteria to be followed, according to the DoPT notification includes doubtful integrity and ineffectiveness. However, it adds, no Government servant should ‘ordinarily be retired on ground of ineffectiveness, if, in any event, he would be retiring on superannuation within a period of one year from the date of consideration of his case’. Ineffectiveness also does not hold if a government servant has been promoted to a higher post during the preceding five-year period and ‘his/her service in the highest post, has been found satisfactory’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dopt-spells-out-quarterly-review-for-early-retirement-of-bureaucrats/story-pNAT9ZHLFaocP9QdLVcWWI.html

So far, we have detained eight people for questioning. Raids are on,” Murshidabad superintendent of police K Sabari Rajkumar said.On Friday morning, Manjarul Sheikh, 15, and Tanjarul Sheikh, 16, went to the field to catch fish. They were carrying a small boat. The teenagers were not seen again.Large tracts of lowlands and agricultural fields are under water in the area in the aftermath of heavy rains.On Saturday, officers from Berhampore police station went to Kanthali on receiving a complaint, but failed to trace the boys, whose fathers work as labourers in Saudi Arabia.A search operation on Sunday led to the bodies being found near a bush. Their heads were found about 40 meters away.“The boys were fishing to earn some money and help the family. Some local men threatened them against fishing at Hijaler math (where the boys had gone). We informed the police after we found their boat, fishing net, sandals and their clothes near the area,” Firoza Bibi, an aunt, said. “There are several stab injuries on the bodies,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-bengal-teens-beheaded-for-fishing-in-field-alleges-family/story-jI6egQwShI1VPMvNZzFmBJ.html
31-08-2020||India||India first to hit 80,000 coronavirus cases in single day||India on Sunday became the first country in the world to report more than 80,000 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a single day, as the outbreak continued to grow and set new records.A total of 80,097 new infections were reported across India on Sunday, taking the nationwide tally to 3,616,747, according to HT’s dashboard. To contextualise the size of the daily tally, China, where the virus originated in December 2019, has a total 85,031 confirmed infections to date. After Sunday’s spike, the seven-day average of daily cases in the country stands at 73,318, also a new global record, and taking it higher than the seven-day daily case peak recorded in the United States when the number touched 69,330 for the week ending July 25. In Delhi, after a gap of over 50 days, new cases of Covid-19 breached the 2,000 mark on Sunday as the resurgence of daily infections in the city continued. The Covid-19 positivity rate in Delhi also continued to rise, with 8.7% of all tests conducted in the last week coming back positive, suggesting that more and more Delhi residents are now carrying the virus. In terms of the single-day, 9.9% of samples tested on Sunday came back positive — the highest since July 13, or in 48 days.On Sunday, the city recorded 2,024 new cases, the highest single-day increase in cases since July 10, when the city reported 2,089 new infections. After Sunday’s new cases, Delhi’s total case count stands at 173,390. Twenty-two new deaths were reported on Sunday, taking the total number of deaths in the city to 4,426. Delhi has seen an average of 1,703 new cases every day in the last seven days — the highest this number has touched since July 17. The seven-day average of daily cases in the Capital, which peaked at 3,446 on June 26 before falling to 983 on August 4, has now gone up for the 14th consecutive day.Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held an emergency meeting as he acknowledged that cases were increasing again after dropping for a month-and-a-half. He announced the city government would “double the number of daily tests” from current levels to around 40,000 per day in an effort to catch and isolate more patients.“An increasing positivity rate means that the transmission of the infection is going up in the city. And, this is likely to increase further as we open up the economy, the metro. We need to keep following the test-trace-treat strategy to keep things under control. We also need to identify cases who need intensive care early to prevent deaths,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Some experts said Delhi may be facing a fresh challenge to control an outbreak it had contained to a considerable extent.“Yes, there has been an increase in the number of cases being reported daily, but it is not alarming as we are not reporting extremely high number of hospitalisations or deaths, like it happened in June. Plus, the government is well prepared and the infrastructure is in place. That said, people should continue following the general precautions like wearing masks and washing hands frequently,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“I do not think there will be a second surge like the one in June. Around 30% people in Delhi already have antibodies against the infection,” he said, pointing to the second sero surveillance that said almost 30% of the people in Delhi have antibodies against the infection.The seven-day average positivity rate, meanwhile, has been rising consistently with 8.7% of all tests conducted in the last week coming back positive, the highest in 47 days, in what experts said was an alarming trend. Positivity rate — the fraction of tests that return positive — had dropped from a peak of 31.4% in mid-June to 5.7% at the end of July, but is now consistently rising again. The case fatality rate (CFR) – the fraction of people who die among the confirmed cases – in Delhi stands at 2.6%, much higher than the national average of 1.82%. According to Sunday’s bulletin by the Delhi government, 20,437 new samples were tested in the last 24 hours, of which 6,881 were RT-PCR or molecular tests, while 13,555 were rapid antigen tests.Across the country, with 959 new deaths lodged on Sunday, the total number of people who have died from the disease now stands at 64,610, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-first-to-hit-80k-cases-in-single-day/story-J5AgzrIsVDne7cMouEJVCJ.html
31-08-2020||India||MF Husain painting auctioned for ₹18.5cr||Mumbai: An artwork by the late Maqbool Fida Husain titled Voices sold for Rs 18.47 crore at an online auction on Sunday setting a record for as the highest price ever fetched by any of the artist’s works in a public domain sale.The oil-on-canvas (18 feet 10 inches) made in 1958, which was part of a private collection till now, went under the hammer for the first time at a two-day AstaGuru auction of 36 lots of the artist’s works, which included toys, jewellery and tapestry designed and co-created by Husain. It was bought by an anonymous buyer.Voices broke the artist’s existing sale record set by his Battle of Ganga and Jamuna: Mahabharata 12, which fetched Rs 13.44 crore at Saffronart’s March 2020 auction of items seized from the fugitive Indian businessman Nirav Modi’s estate.The artist made Voices shortly after the Progressive Artists’ Group which he had co-founded with other Indian modernist artists, including FN Souza, SH Raza, KH Ara among others, had disbanded and Husain was beginning to achieve global fame. The prices quoted are inclusive of buyer’s premium, a percentage charged by the auctioneer on the winning bid amount.MF Husain, one of India’s leading Modern artists, died in 2011.“Contrary to expectation, there has been a spate of enthusiastic bidding at auctions recorded post-March,” said Arvind Vijaymohan, CEO of the art research firm Artery India. “This could be on account of euphoric buying to ease the Covid-induced locked-in gloom, or more likely new capital entering the market and being deployed.”According to the Artery India Price Databank, the auction also set the record for the most expensive work on paper by the artist — a 1956 ink-on-paper titled Between the Spider and the Lamp, a rare preparatory sketch for one of his most well-known works, sold for Rs 83.4 lakh. The highest selling work of Indian modern art is an untitled painting by VS Gaitonde, which fetched Rs 29.3 crore at a Christie’s auction held in Mumbai in 2015. The second-highest sale recorded is Raza’s Tapovan, which fetched Rs 29.03 crore at another Christie’s auction held in New York, in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mf-husain-painting-auctioned-for-18-5cr/story-DcBhcdhDD9HUohB7vjNoCM.html

31-08-2020||India||States to resume buses, trains||Interstate bus services are to resume in Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu starting Tuesday, September 1, and metro services in Kochi and Bangalore beginning on September 7 as mass transport systems in the states and cities resume after the five-month lockdown for Covid-19 pandemic. Maharashtra is contemplating allowing inter-state buses to ply from September 7, officials in the state said.This comes a day after the Union home ministry allowed states to resume metro services and hotels and bars to reopen from September 7 as part of Unlock 4.Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, meanwhile, announced extension of lockdown till September 30. “Under relaxed norms, no complete lockdown will be enforced on Sundays in September. E-pass system for inter-district travel will be discontinued. All places of worship, hotels and resorts have been allowed to re-open,” he said. Buses run by state owned enterprise will run with 50% capacity with the government deciding to bear the loss.Bihar, which is likely to hold assembly polls in November-December, however, is likely to announce significant relaxations after September 6, when the state-wide lockdown ends. The Centre has prohibited lockdowns outside containment zones without its permission as part of the Unlock 4 guidelines.The Bihar government may come up with guidelines related to social gatherings, public meetings and political functions in view of the elections. In the state-wide lockdown, enforced since August 1, only shops selling essential goods remained open. “Till September 6, the state-wide lockdown is in force. The government will review the situation and likely issue new orders,” said additional chief secretary, home, Amir Subhani. As social distancing norms are being enforced, bus travel in Jharkhand would become costlier from September 1 as the state has allowed only 50% seating capacity to be occupied. Kerala government officials said Kochi Metro will start functioning from September 7 in a staggered manner. Maharashtra government officials said more relaxations would be offered under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ in a calibrated manner including opening up of inter-state bus travel. The state is likely to allow gymnasiums to open and government and private establishments to increase employee strength to between 30% and 50% from the present 10-15%, the officials said.“Going by the surge in cases, we are not in a position to open what all has been allowed by the Centre,” said an official. He said the government is unlikely to open religious places despite demands by the opposition. The relaxations are likely to be notified on Monday.Officials in the West Bengal said that new Unlock guidelines may not be announced as chief minister Mamata Banerjee has declared a complete state-wide lockdown on September 7, 11 and 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-to-resume-buses-trains/story-2BdytXqyP2Pjl4W7xO11ZO.html
31-08-2020||India||New protocol for parliament’s upcoming monsoon session||Doorstep Covid-19 tests for MPs, the freedom to deliver a speech in the House while seated, options to undergo real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at their constituency before heading to Delhi, and one-way movement in the Central Hall and key corridors -- these are some of the new measures the Lok Sabha will see in its upcoming monsoon session, following Speaker Om Birla’s meeting with health sector experts last week. The Lok Sabha Speaker met union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, ICMR chief Dr Balaram Bhargava and DRDO and Delhi government officials on Friday for a brainstorming session where he was quick to approve some new ideas, a top functionary aware of the proceedings at the meeting said on condition of anonymity.For instance, Dr Guleria suggested that it would be better if MPs could talk while seated —a departure from the tradition of standing while speaking—as this would restrict any possible spread of aerosols, an idea that was approved. He also suggested that since the home addresses and locations of all MPs are known, they could be administered RT-PCR tests before the session (and in many cases before the parliamentarians left for Delhi). Rajesh Bhushan, the Union health secretary suggested that the Vande Bharat experiment of asking passengers to conduct RT-PCR tests from their place of boarding a flight can be replicated for MPs. Vande Bharat Mission evacuees are allowed to undergo RT-PCR tests 96 hours before take-off. If they test negative, they avoid quarantine in the port of arrival. In the case of MPs who are living outside Delhi, it was decided to request them to undertake such tests in their constituencies 72 hours before coming to Parliament. The much-awaited monsoon session of Parliament, delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will be held between September 14 and October 1. Dr Guleria also suggested that one-way movement should be enforced in some key corridors and the Central Hall of Parliament, according to the functionary. This measure, the AIIMS chief explained, would prevent MPs coming face-to-face with their colleagues and reduce the chance of infection. This suggestion was also accepted.Indian Parliament will see major changes and severe restrictions during the monsoon session and both Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla are focusing on every detail to ensure the safety of lawmakers and workers in the Parliament complex that will house the session for 18 days. Visitors and media persons will not be allowed access to areas including the Central Hall during the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament. Media, however, will be allowed to cover the session from press gallery. A second functionary familiar with the meeting and also the thinking in the speaker’s office said that Birla sees himself as the head of “this large family of Lok Sabha MPs”, and considers it his duty to ensure highest safety standards in the House. This person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Birla plans a special meeting between the MPs and Guleria, Bhushan and Bhargava. “In the proposed meeting, these health experts will explain details of the Covid virus and it will not just help MPs to take extra care but also educate people in their constituencies.” Indian Tea Board and Indian Coffee Board have also been asked to supply the beverages in disposable paper cups and not use glass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-protocol-for-monsoon-session/story-4C77aX9YpqRzi09IyR7o5H.html
31-08-2020||India||Video of local Trinamool Congress leader firing pistol at rivals goes viral in Bengal||A video of a local Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader firing a pistol on a busy street during a feud between two groups in Murshidabad district on Sunday afternoon, has turned viral on social media. The leader, identified as Asadul Sheikh is a municipal ward-level president of the TMC in the district’s Domkal town. Two people were allegedly injured in the firing but local police refused to comment on the issue till Sunday night. Sheikh could not be contacted while the TMC leadership said he would be arrested. The incident, local people alleged, was triggered by a dispute between two rival TMC groups over setting up some shops by the roadside. In the video, pedestrians and three-wheelers can be seen passing by the spot where Sheikh takes the pistol from an associate and fires it. “Give it to me,” he can be heard saying. Some women can also be heard wailing in the background. Abul Hossain, a local TMC leader whose son Johny sustained a bullet injury, said, “Sheikh tried to shoot me but I grabbed the pistol and moved away. A bullet went through my shirt. A second bullet hit my son. Many shots were fired. They came with bombs as well.” Abu Taher, the TMC’s district president and Lok Sabha member, said, “This sort of activity will not be tolerated. The police will take action. The party will take disciplinary action as well.” Ashok Das, the TMC’s district coordinator said, “The party has nothing to do with the incident. There was a feud between two groups of people.” Zafiqul Islam, chairman of the TMC-controlled Domkal municipality said, “The shops over which the two groups were fighting are being illegally set up on the footpath which is government land.” Bharatiya Janata Party state president Dilip Ghosh condemned the incident and said it was a proof of lawlessness in Bengal. In another incident, in the Bali area of Howrah district the police on Sunday arrested Biswajoy Banerjee, a local TMC leader, for allegedly asking for protection money from Mahesh Surekha, a real estate businessman. Surekha is building a project close by the banks of the Hooghly River. Surekha recorded the phone conversation he had with Banerjee. The recording was given to the media. The accused could be heard saying, “I am surprised that you do not know me. Mamata Banerjee and Mukul Roy know me very well.” Surekha lodged a police complaint on Friday night. Mukul Roy, incidentally, joined the BJP in 2017. TMC’s senior district leader and minister Arup Roy said, “A man does not become a leader of the party just by claiming to be one.” During his arrest Banerjee told the local media that he and his family members are dedicated followers of the chief minister. “The construction is illegal. I called up only to inquire about it. The recording has been edited,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/video-of-local-trinamool-congress-leader-firing-pistol-at-rivals-goes-viral-in-bengal/story-jITfUsmqol9R2M1VfdEXDM.html
31-08-2020||India||Mann ki Baat: PM stresses on need for self-reliance||Prime Minister Narendra Modi was vocal for local in his monthly outreach talk on radio, Mann Ki Baat, stressing on the need for and the importance of India-made apps and toys, and mentioning the USPs of indie dog breeds such as Kombai. “At a time when Atmanirbhar Bharat is becoming a mantra of the people, how can any domain be left untouched by its influence?,” he said, asking people to consider bringing home “one of these Indian breeds.” Atmanirbhar Bharat (self reliant India) has been the Prime Minister and the government’s theme for some time. The Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus and relief package announced by the government to help individuals and businesses cope with the Covid-19 pandemic was built around this theme. In his 31-minute talk in Hindi, Modi said he brainstormed with various ministries on how students and children should spend their time during lockdown. It was in this context that he mentioned toys and games. India should become a hub for toy production, he said. The global toy industry is over Rs 7 lakh crore but India’s share is very small and we will have to work to increase it, Modi added. Some areas are being developed as toy clusters, he said. The best toys are those which encourage the creativity of children, he added, suggesting that start-ups to “team up for toys”. Come, let’s play,” he added. The PM also highlighted the potential of the country’s young people by drawing attention to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s Atmanirbhar app challenge that threw up alternatives to popular applications such as Twitter and TikTok. The Atmanirbhar app challenge was launched Modi on July 4. Among the indigenous applications to win the challenge were Koo, an alternative to Twitter; MapMyIndia, an alternative to Google maps; and Chingari, an alternative to TikTok. “Dear countrymen, everyone acknowledges capability of Indians to offer innovation, solutions, when there is dedication and sensitivity, this power becomes limitless... Be it virtual games, be it the sector of toys in the self-reliant India campaign, all have to play very important role...,” Modi said. He mentioned an app called KutukiKids “This is an interactive app for children using which they can easily learn many aspects of maths, science through songs and stories.” Kutukikids won the second prize in the e-learning category. A pair of army dogs, honoured with the army chief’s commendation card on Independence Day for their heroics, found a special mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat address on Sunday, with the PM hailing them as “bravehearts” who performed their duties diligently to protect the country. While Vida, a black Labrador, sniffed out landmines and grenades during a demining operation in Jammu and Kashmir and prevented army casualties, Sophie, a Cocker Spaniel from a bomb disposal unit, helped avert a tragedy by detecting explosives in Delhi, two army officials said. Their names and unique service numbers will be put up on roll-of-honour boards at their respective units. “Army dogs and their handlers perform dangerous tasks but they receive little attention. Many of them have been killed in the combat zone. The PM has thrust them into the limelight by highlighting their contribution in his address,” said a senior army officer, asking not to be named. In his address, the PM also talked about the gallant actions of Balaram, who detected explosives on the Amarnath Yatra route, and Bhavana, who sniffed out an improvised explosive device (IED) many years ago, but was killed as terrorists managed to trigger the explosive.. The PM said indigenous dog breeds such Mudhol Hound, Himachali Hound, Rajapalayam, Kanni, Chippiparai and Kombai were “fabulous,” cheaper to raise and better adapted to the Indian environment. He said the security forces were increasingly inducting these local breeds. In his talk, Modi also focused on nutrition . The month of September will celebrated as nutrition month and schools should have not just report cards but also nutrition cards and nutrition monitors along with class monitors, he said. “Schools are being involved. There should be a nutrition monitor just like there is a class monitor. There should be a nutrition card along with the report card.” Modi said normally this time of the year is festive but this time the situation is different because of Covid-19. He said there has been unprecedented restraint, simplicity in our festivals this time, he said. He said many Indian festivals celebrate nature. Modi made a special mention of a festival celebrated by Bihar’s Tharu tribe in this regard along with Onam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-stresses-on-need-for-self-reliance/story-mlV5U7tGJWPW1skv9AFMiP.html
31-08-2020||India||4 states reject Centre’s options over GST dues||The Centre’s suggestion that states borrow to meet the revenue shortfall in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has run into some turbulence with some states ruled by non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parties rejecting both options presented to them. West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi and Punjab have all objected to the plan. The two options presented are totally unacceptable because such a move will badly impact the financial health of states, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra said on Sunday, warning of what he called a “planned strategy to crush federalism”. Mitra also said huge debt was being thrust on states in the name of an “Act of God” — a reference to the phrase used by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to describe the Covid-19 pandemic that she said had hit GST collections.“Many people are worried and see this as a pattern. Once the financial health of states becomes shaky, the brute power of centralism will come into play. Is this the new ideology?” Mitra asked at a virtual news conference.“At the GST Council meeting, 15 states, including some ruled by the BJP, said the states cannot be asked to borrow to make up for the shortfall in GST revenue collection as this will increase debt burden and [lead to] more expenditure. After the meeting, the Centre has sent us a written reply saying we have to borrow from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),” Mitra, who was present at the meeting, said. He did not name the states.Since the meeting of the GST Council last week, Kerala, Punjab, and Delhi all ruled by non-BJP parties, have expressed their discomfort with the plan, and asked the Centre to borrow to make good its commitment to the states. Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism. HT learns that other states such as Maharashtra and Chattisgarh are also opposed to the plan. Ahead of the GST Council meeting last week, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray suggested moving to the older tax regime because GST wasn’t working. The Centre has guaranteed states compensation for any shortfall arising from GST for five years starting 2017. Annual revenue growth of 14% was assumed for this. This year, the finance ministry expects the compensation to be around Rs 3 lakh crore, and says Rs 65,000 crore can be met through the collection of cess on luxury and sin goods. The Centre offered states two options to plug a shortfall in their revenue, estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the financial year that ends in March 2021, at the 41st meeting of the GST Council on Thursday,.First, states can borrow Rs 97,000 crore at reasonable interest rates from a special window that will be opened in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India. Both the principal and the interest payments will come from cess collections. In the second option, the states can borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore, but will have to bear the interest cost. The Centre has defined losses arising from implementation of GST at Rs 97,000 crore and the balance as losses arising from an Act of God (Covid-19).On March 14 — before the pandemic spread — Sitharaman said the Centre was duty-bound to compensate the states, MItra said. “Now, they are saying just the opposite. This is totally subterfuge,” Mitra added.According to him, if the states go and borrow, yields will be affected. “Why is the Centre not borrowing directly? The Centre can monetise debt by printing money which the states cannot,” he said.The Union finance ministry did not reply to queries seeking comment. Reacting to Mitra’s allegation that the Centre was trying to crush the federal structure by financially hurting the states, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said: “He is parroting a rhetoric that chief minister Mamata Banerjee has scripted for him. He made similar statements when the Centre declared the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package.” Sarthak Roychaudhury, a Kolkata-based economics professor, said that in a federal structure, states should not be asked to take loans from RBI and pay interest on them at a time like this. “The Centre should take the loan and pass on the compensation to the states. The states do not have the machinery to recover the losses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-states-reject-centre-s-options-over-gst-dues/story-ZLSIQ8NDaQrzHtATAo3IiO.html
31-08-2020||India||Thousands displaced, 24 dead, as excess rain and overflowing dams flood central India||An overflowing Narmada threw life out of gear in parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and water released from the Hirakud dam flooded several districts of Odisha on the weekend. At least 24 people were killed in flooding in MP and Odisha. and thousands were displaced as heavy rainfall lashed other parts of India, causing reservors to overflow. Rainfall has been 25% more than normal in August, which India Meteorological Department (IMD) is the highest for the month in 44 years. The previous highest in August was recorded in 1983, when rain was 23.8% more than the normal. In Madhya Pradesh, at least eight people were killed in the past 24 hours and more than 9,000 were moved to relief camps during rescue operations; 454 villages in 12 districts of Madhya Pradesh have been affected by the floods caused by incessant rain since Thursday. The latest fatalities took the rain- and flood-related death toll in MP to 129 since this monsoon. Sixteen people died in flooding in Odisha, officials said.Rain intensity reduces in Mumbai, IMD predicts moderate rain for todayFlood-hit districts in the state include Hoshangabad, Raisen, Sehore, Bhopal, Vidisha, Chhindwara, Balaghat, Seoni, Katni, Sagar, Shivpuri and Ujjain. A large number of people were airlifted to safety with the help of air force helicopters; they included 62 residents of Somalwada village in Sehore district.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday morning and sought his help in rescue operations being carried on by National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Home Guards, police and personnel of other departments.Photos: India’s wettest August in 44 years brings 25% excess rains“The rescue operations have been continuing since Friday evening. There are 454 villages in 12 districts affected by the flood. As many as 9,300 people have been moved to 170 relief camps,” Chouhan said, adding that he was monitoring the flood situation from a control room set up at his residence. He said huge damage had been caused to standing crops and added that farmers will be compensated with crop insurance and other relief schemes.Large parts of the Narmada river basin in Gujarat were flooded as excess water was released from the Sardar Sarovar dam in the state and dams in Madhya Pradesh.According to home ministry data, until Sunday, 175 people had died because in floods in Gujarat with half the deaths reported in August. “We are providing relief and relocating people from the worst affected areas,” PTI quoted chief minister Vijay Rupani as saying. Over 800,000 have been affected across 500 villages of Odisha, said Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) Pradeep Kumar Jena on Sunday. He said 50,000 people evacuated to safe shelters.According to the the Central Water Commission’s update dated August 29, eight dams have overflown including the Tawa dam in MP on the river Narmada; Rengali dam in Odisha on river Brahmani; and Hidkal in Karnataka on Ghataptrabha. River Mahanadi in parts of Chhattisgarh; Wainganga and Narmada in MP are rising rapidly because of heavy rain forecast for the next two days, CWC said.“It’s a dangerous situation. Any dam that reaches full reservoir level when monsoon is still underway can be disastrous for districts downstream. The dam operators should have released water gradually and not when it’s already 100%. Naramada, Mahanadi and Godavari basins are affected. CWC and dam operators should have been aware of the likely inflow and planned release accordingly,” said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People. The well-marked low pressure area over West Madhya Pradesh and adjoining East Rajasthan is likely to move west-northwestwards during the next two days, IMD said in its Sunday bulletin.“Extremely heavy rain in Madhya Pradesh and other parts of central India is mainly because of a strong low pressure area over west Madhya Pradesh and east Rajasthan. We are expecting rain to decrease gradually over central India but Gujarat may experience very heavy rains for one more day. Then rains will increase over the northern plains when the monsoon trough shifts northwards around September 2,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.The western end of the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) lies south to its normal position and its eastern end lies close to foothills of the Himalayas. Under the influence of these systems, widespread and very heavy to extremely heavy rain is likely over Gujarat on August 30 and 31. Widespread rain with very heavy rain is likely over West Madhya Pradesh and north Konkan on August 30 and over Rajasthan on August 30 and 31.“We are not expecting any low-pressure area to develop next week so we are hoping rain will gradually reduce in central India. Rains may increase over northwest India, northeast India and south Peninsula particularly Kerala-Karnataka region,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre.Excess rains could ensure soil moisture for months. “There are different ways of harvesting water. But the most important source of water for agriculture is groundwater, more than both dams and rivers. So the focus should be on local storage and local recharge systems. We have to store rainwater where it falls and avoid runoff,” added Thakkar.Monsoon rain over the country since June 1 has been 9% excess with 21% excess over the southern Peninsula; 19% excess over central India; 11% deficiency over northwest India and 3% over east and northeast India.According to Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region, a report by the ministry of earth sciences released earlier this year, from 1950 onwards there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme and heavy rain events over central India, along with a decreasing trend in moderate rain events.A study published in Nature journal in 2017 by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology had concluded that there had been a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India during 1950 to 2015||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excess-rain-overflowing-dams-flood-central-india/story-YUUni3yQk0eMQwxa9ce48M.html

31-08-2020||Editorials||Covid-19 is spreading both in terms of numbers and geography. Follow protocols||Covid-19 is now spreading in India at a rate quicker than any other country so far, ever since the pandemic began. India is reporting more cases every day than the United States (US) and Brazil were reporting even when the outbreak there was at its peak. India is also one of only the three nations to have had, consistently, over 1,000 deaths daily in recent days. But while cases in the other two nations appear to have plateaued, India hasn’t yet reached its peak. There are, however, areas where India has fared much better than others. For every million residents, India has reported 2,600 cases, against around 18,000 each in the US and Brazil. The same holds true for deaths — India has 48 deaths per million against around 500 in the other two. India’s case fatality rate is 1.8%, which is not only much better than the global average of 3.4%, but also better than the US (3.1%) and Brazil (3.2%). One of the reasons for the high number of reported cases in India now is the enhanced level of testing. For the second time, the country’s daily tests crossed the million-mark on Saturday. This is a huge jump from June, when 200,000 samples were being tested a day. But while the absolute numbers are positive, the relative proportion to population still leaves room to improve. The US has conducted 250,000 tests per million, while Brazil has tested 67,000 per million; for India, this number is a little over 31,000. But the biggest challenge is harder to denote in numbers. While the first five months of the outbreak in India saw cases largely from urban areas, the bulk of the latest wave of infections has been from the hinterland, where the health care infrastructure is much weaker. And while the lower population density may help rural areas, experts fear that there is a greater chance of cases and deaths going unreported since there are fewer labs, hospitals and trained medical professionals. The ultimate goal for a country (till a vaccine is developed and mass produced) is to prevent deaths. And though India has fared better than most nations in that aspect, it should not let its guard down. It must test, isolate and treat with even greater intensity, and spread the network of labs, hospitals and expertise to the country’s rural pockets, where they will be needed the most in coming weeks.--||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-the-infection-is-spreading-both-in-terms-of-numbers-and-geography-follow-protocols/story-TmCp2074NsQyCoi8kIFcYJ.html
31-08-2020||Editorials||The disturbing story from India’s prisons||The latest (2019) data on prisons released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that Dalits, tribals, and Muslims continue to be jailed in numbers disproportionate to their share in the total population of India, according to a report in The Indian Express. The NCRB data shows that while people from Scheduled Castes (SCs) accounted for 21.7% of convicts and 21% of undertrials; those from Scheduled Tribes (STs) accounted for 13.6% of convicts and 10.5% of undertrials; and Muslims, 16.6% of convicts and 18.7% of undertrials.While it is not the case that the demographic mix in prison must be a reflection of the demographic mix in society, the NCRB data underlines a deeper sociological truth about India — of the historic marginalisation of these communities. Their socioeconomic indicators are weak; they are unable to access opportunities for livelihoods; their encounters with the legal machinery are common and often brutal; and if they are implicated in cases, even ordinary crimes, they often have to battle discriminatory attitudes and are unable to access effective legal support. It is not surprising that African-Americans constitute a disproportionate number of prisoners in the United States (US). It is not because Blacks in the US, or the Dalits, Muslims or tribals in India, violate the law more often than others — it is because structural conditions in both society and the State force a certain life on them. While there is a larger battle that must be fought to change this discriminatory structure, an immediate priority must be providing urgent legal help. A State-run free legal aid system was introduced in 1995 with the establishment of the Legal Services Authorities Act. But, legal experts suggest that the system has been ineffective because of daunting procedures, low remuneration from the State, and corruption discourage lawyers from taking up these cases. Ensuring access to justice must be the first step to correcting the imbalance in India’s prisons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-disturbing-story-from-india-s-prisons/story-VFNlDJf9zwFT0EZfQx9mWN.html
