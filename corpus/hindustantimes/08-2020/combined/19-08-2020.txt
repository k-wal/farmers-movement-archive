19-08-2020||News||For his vision and actions, Bihar trusts Nitish Kumar | Opinion||If the Election Commission (EC) decides to conduct the 2020 Bihar assembly elections in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the exercise will be a watershed event for several reasons.The first critical change will be the showcasing of the power, versatility and the near-universal application of the digital and virtual media as the primary medium of campaigning, voter connect, and possibly also the casting of votes.The second, and most vital, aspect of this election will be a paradigm shift in the electoral plank. The clichéd bijli, sadak, paani (power, roads, water) trope will no longer hold. I feel that the main determinant to shaping voter perception in this election will be centred on delivery — assured delivery to be precise. And this is where the incumbent chief minister (CM), Nitish Kumar, has no competition.Nitish is not just a visionary, but an energetic doer. A product of socialist and youth movements, his politics and policies are guided by principles of equality, justice, social welfare and progress. He stands out among the select group of politicians who have been in public life for over four decades. As Union minister, and then as CM of Bihar, he has gone through all the rough and tumble of politics. He has never strayed from his principles in his stewardship of the state.He has used his successive stints as CM to deliver on basic amenities such as electricity, water, social security, road connectivity and, most important, law and order. So, it is little wonder that bijli, sadak, paani are issues of the past.The Bihar of today is a far cry from the one that we inherited in 2005. We have round-the-year connectivity to the farthest corners of the state, thanks to the 27,000 kilometres of state highways and district roads and 96,417km of rural roads completed over the last 15 years. We have moved to being a power-surplus state with all of Bihar’s villages on the electricity grid. Today, even far-flung rural areas get 20 hours or more of electricity.The state’s piped water supply scheme — Har Ghar Nal ka Jal — which is close to connecting every household with piped potable water, on the lines of a similar central government scheme, was conceived by Nitish in the early days of his current term. It has been executed on schedule. This August 15, the CM promised that, if re-elected, he would ensure water for every plot in Bihar. This will give agriculture in the state a critical push and help farmers harvest three-to-four crops annually. And the CM’s record shows that he delivers on his promises. Nitish’s name has come to be associated, even in the remotest parts of the state, with roads, electricity, drinking water, the girl child’s education, women’s empowerment and access to public services. This means that the expectations from him are enormous.With such expectations, there will be some dissatisfaction which will also be expressed. But this is because he has set the benchmark very high and people feel confident in expressing their satisfaction and grievances. This is a sign of the trust that people repose in him.His opponents may feel that anti-incumbency will work against him, but there is little evidence on the ground to support this. No other public figure or political opponent comes even remotely close to generating the public confidence Nitish does. At the more subliminal level though, his appeal is also based on his having revived the image of Bihar, and all things Bihari, cutting across all castes and creeds. While Biharis were once thought of as rustic and laggardly, today they are considered hardworking and persevering, thanks to the model of development pursued by the CM namely nyay ke saath vikas (justice and development).One must remember that Bihar was in a dismal state when Nitish took charge in 2005. It soon moved to a double-digit growth rate through an entire decade. Successive governments led by Nitish had to work on many fronts — systemic reforms, robust governance and social mobilisation. It was the first state to implement 50% reservation for women in panchayats. Bihar’s espousal of many social engineering initiatives aimed primarily at empowerment, among them the girl child’s education, prohibition, curbing child labour, and the Jal Jeevan Hariyali Abhiyan targeted at addressing the climate crisis, have all been important cogs in the wheel of Bihar’s makeover that Nitish has diligently crafted over 15 years.Not surprisingly, this makeover is integral to the consciousness of every individual. It can be seen in the way they conduct themselves in their daily lives, in the confidence with which many women transact business across the million-strong self-help groups of Jeevika, in the images of young girls cycling through Bihar’s village roads to schools and, indeed, in the ease with which trade and commerce are carried out daily.For several generations of voters, this revitalisation of their collective persona is too precious to compromise with. The modern voter is discerning enough to tell the difference between propaganda and real promises. They will be selective about who they will vote for in the elections. They will want continuity and development, they will not give up on the gains they have made during the last 15 years. They will vote for a new, resurgent Bihar.

19-08-2020||News||How Nitish Kumar has halted Bihar’s progress, writes Tejashwi Prasad Yadav||The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the colossal failure of the leadership in Bihar. Disturbing images from the state have shown the reality of sushasan (good governance) for what it is. While several other states have grown rapidly over the past decade, Bihar, under Nitish Kumar, has been on a downward spiral.Development is an evolving process and its trajectory is shaped by the size and direction of the national economy. Our party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), formerly the Janata Dal, was in power in the state from 1990-2005.In 1990, my father, Lalu Prasad, took over a state crippled by huge debt, gross social inequality, rampant corruption and social and political discrimination against the communities on the margins. My mother, Rabri Devi, was chief minister (CM) from 1997 to 2005. During this time, there was significant progress on all these parameters. In hindsight, we realise that the 1990s required immediate intervention in correcting an unequal social and political order. It also needed leading from the front to achieve the goals of social justice for oppressed and vulnerable citizens so that they could get a sense of belonging in a structure which had turned its back on them. My father is secular to the core. He did not mind risking his government when it came to saving the people under attack by the forces which threatened to destroy the social fabric and composite culture of India.Remarkable progress was achieved in education, health, social sector and the economy. When Lalu Prasad became CM, he started the recruitment of teachers through competitive examinations under the Bihar Public Service Commission, thereby bringing transparency into the process. A series of such reforms to ensure a level-playing field for everyone posed a serious challenge to the hegemony and dominance of some caste supremacists. Initiatives such as this became a trigger for sinister conspiracies to defame and frame him. The rest, as they say, is history.Nitish did some good work in his first term (2005-2010) as every freshman does in his probation period. But in his successive terms, from 2010 onwards, he faltered in evolving any sort of inclusive development agenda for the state. Instead, by spending huge amounts on image-building exercises, he was able to project himself as an able administrator and mask his failures. The state performed poorly on all indices of every government evaluation report. Going by data, the situation went downhill after 2005.Today, Bihar’s per capita income is the lowest in the country, and its per capita debt is the highest. It is high on unemployment and crime. Outward migration from Bihar for work and education is the highest in the country. The CM has ruined the education, health, agriculture and industry sectors. Operating factories, sugar and jute mills were shut down and no new industries were set up. Public health care has collapsed as is evident in the Covid-19 crisis. He gave powers to mukhiyas (headmen) to directly recruit teachers and set the terrible precedent of hiring on a contractual basis. Corruption is institutionalised to such an extent that not a single bit of work gets down without bribing officials — from getting a caste/nativity certificate to filing the First Information Reports. Bihar is perhaps the only state where bridges collapse even before their inauguration, roads cannot withstand one monsoon and dams are damaged by rats. As many as 57 huge scams involving colossal amounts of money have come to light. Clearly, Nitish abandoned governance and public welfare from his second term onwards, and spent all the state’s resources on trying to stay in power. Ties between the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) started worsening in his second innings. In 2013, he snapped ties with the BJP and made Jitan Ram Manjhi the CM in 2014. Then, in 2015, he joined hands with the RJD and became the CM again. True to type, he ditched us in 2017 and again tied up with the BJP and remained the CM. But this game of thrones has cost the state dearly in terms of development.During his tenure, which still continues, Nitish has turned Bihar into a wasteland. For him, image is all. He announced the prohibition on alcohol and dowry to project himself as a reformer. But the reality is that there is home delivery of liquor, and no marriage takes place without a dowry. Thanks to a favourable media, he has got away with it by conveniently blaming our party for his shortcomings.But now the day of reckoning is approaching. In each election, he has gone out to seek votes, not based on his track record, but by making personal accusations against my family. He and his party will stop at nothing to come up with some evidence or the other to defame my family and our party. But it must be asked how these personal attacks are of any benefit to the state.Over his 15-year rule, we have seen how this negative politics has proved disastrous for Bihar. It diverts attention from the bigger picture and puts paid to any prospect of progress. Now it is time to consider whether we should trust a person who constantly talks about the past to lead us into the future. The strength of electoral democracy is that the key to power is in the hands of the people.I can only hope that the wisdom of my compatriots from Bihar will bring in a progressive government in this new decade, one which collectively works for the peace and prosperity of the beleaguered state.Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is the leader of Opposition, BiharThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-nitish-kumar-has-halted-bihar-s-progress/story-oRCtQSjXDyQOypZl86IhxM.html
19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Admn to calculate exact pricing for Chandigarh Housing Board’s scheme for UT employees||The UT administration will be recalculating the exact pricing of the two different options for making the UT Employees’ Housing Scheme affordable. The detailed pricing will be shared with the employee representatives for their consent.This was decided in a virtual meeting held here on Wednesday on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, and chaired by the Union home secretary.Senior UT officials including UT adviser Manoj Parida, Chandigarh Housing Board chairman Ajoy Kumar Sinha, CHB chief executive officer Yashpal Garg along with the employees’ representatives Dr Dharmender Shastri, Balwinder Singh, and Dr Brahmprakash Yadav were present in the meeting.Dr Shashtri said, “The administration has shared three options. First, charging only for the plotted land, and not for the total land. Second, construction of an 11-storey tower project in Sector 56. Third, the Solanki proposal—to allot at an old rate with 10% interest. But, we said, employees need to know the exact pricing in each of the options before they can take any decision.”“After deliberations to resolve the issue regarding rates of flats, it was decided that the calculation of rates be made again for different categories by applying various factors like floor area ratio, collector rate, plotted area etc. in consultation with the representatives of petitioners of the scheme’s court case,” stated an administration press statement.Thereafter, another meeting will be held with the Union home secretary for further directions in the matter. Parida stated that the project will not be abandoned and employees will certainly get houses at concessional rates.The housing scheme, floated in 2008, failed to take off even though the employees had already deposited around ₹57 crore with the CHB in 2012. The latest administration action to resolve the issue pending for more than a decade came only after the HC intervened. The court had stated that it will hold individual administration’s officers accountable for the non-resolution of the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/admn-to-calculate-exact-pricing-for-chandigarh-housing-board-s-scheme-for-ut-employees/story-9WU18HHLJSIaKHyf6RFjQN.html

Meanwhile, the other couple was released on bail.A woman had alleged that Naveen had molested her and even tore her clothes after a fight with her and her husband on August 16. The woman also alleged that Aarti, Naveen’s wife, had manhandled her. A case under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354B (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (insulting modesty of women) of the Indian Penal Code was registered.Aarti, working as a staff nurse in GMCH-32, in a counter complaint said that on August 16, she and her husband Naveen were playing with their daughter when a few men and two females came and started verbally abusing them, asking them to leave the place.When they resisted, the group in which some people were drunk started assaulting them. She alleged that one of the females tore her clothes and threatened to frame Naveen in a false case. Another case was registered under Sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 352 (assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-couples-including-traffic-cop-gmch-nurse-held-for-brawl-in-chandigarh-s-sector-33/story-9ek3UG8T6cWguWitmsjQZJ.html
19-08-2020||City||Seven years on, Mohali’s ring road project now caught up in bureaucratic maze||Hanging fire for nearly seven years now, the construction of the 200 feet wide, six-lane ring road project, which was to decongest Zirakpur by providing an alternative route to the Shimla-bound traffic incoming from Ambala, is now stuck in a bureaucratic maze.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has asked Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to transfer the 100 acres of land, which they have already acquired, but GMADA is yet to take a decision on it.The 8-kilometre road will originate from McDonald’s on the Ambala-Zirakpur highway, will pass through Peer Muchalla, Sanoli, Gazipur, Nagla, all Mohali villages, and then join the Sector 20-21 dividing road in Panchkula.A senior official of NHAI said, “We held a meeting with the senior officials of GMADA and have requested them to hand over the land to us, which they have already acquired, and they have assured us they will expedite the issue.”Superintending engineer of GMADA Davinder Singh said a meeting in this regard was held and a decision was expected soon.PROJECT CAME TO HALT IN 2014It was in 2013 that the work on the project had started, but it came to a halt in February 2014 when some of the landowners went to court seeking higher compensation. Once the road is complete, the Shimla-bound traffic can take this road, bypass the bottleneck meted at Zirakpur, and join the Shimla highway at the Panchkula end. Similarly, Ambala or Delhi-bound traffic from Shimla can also avoid Zirakpur.The road will also open an alternative route from Panchkula to the new international airport terminal in Mohali, but it will be much longer than the existing route via the Industrial Area, the Zirakpur-Chandigarh road, Sector 48 of Chandigarh, through Aerocity and IT City in Mohali. However, the new route will avoid the traffic of Chandigarh.APPROVED BY MASTER PLAN COMMITTEEThe project is being implemented to prevent around 1.5 lakh vehicles from Punjab and Haryana from entering the city daily. Chandigarh’s Master Plan also proposes this road to divert the inter-state traffic around the city for better traffic management.According to the Master Plan committee, traffic between Mullanpur and Panchkula, and that from Kansal, Zirakpur and Panchkula, goes towards Chandigarh for “no reason”. Hence, the project will help significantly reduce traffic congestion on the arterial roads of Chandigarh—Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg.In August 2017, the then Union home minister Rajnath Singh had approved the project during a meeting of the Northern Zonal Council in Chandigarh. The project holds more significance in the wake of Rajnath putting the brakes on the much-touted Metro project for Chandigarh in July 2017, and asking the UT administration to look for alternative modes of transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-years-on-mohali-s-ring-road-project-now-caught-up-in-bureaucratic-maze/story-zXPf98QAGjpWjUMJ9JuUHM.html

19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Now, Chandigarh admn asks private hospitals to reserve 25% bed for Covid-19 patients||In wake of the sharp fall in the city’s Covid-19 recovery rate and rise in growth rate, the UT administration on Wednesday directed private hospitals in the city to reserve 25% of their beds for Covid patients.The recovery rate in the city is around 56%, which is much below the national average of 73%. At the same time, the growth rate is hovering at more than 5%. Both, these parameters indicate that patients requiring hospitalisation is increasing rapidly, consequently, the need for beds.An order for tapping into the city’s private hospital bed capacity was issued by UT principal health secretary Arun Gupta on Wednesday, wherein the administration also capped the treatment rates. The charges will be borne by the patients willing to avail the facility at these private hospitals. (see box for detailed rates)Significantly, city MP Kirron Kher, in a recent interaction with UT officials, had also recommended involving private hospitals in Covid care.Last week, Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore had directed Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to extend their bed capacities for Covid patients by 100 beds each.RS Bedi, former president of Chandigarh IMA, said, “Private sector is taking the load of non-covid patients, which is equally important. The process of reserving beds for Covid patients has been initiated in private hospitals in consultation with health authorities. It is a lesson that robust and parallel healthcare system should be created in the private sector of the city.”DISCONCERTING FIGURESThe rapidly spreading infection has led to a massive decrease in the recovery rate of Chandigarh. At the onset of July, Chandigarh had a high recovery rate of 88%. It meant 88% of the city residents infected till early July had been discharged.However, by August 19, the recovery rate had fallen sharply to 56%, 17% less than the national recovery rate.The trend of sharp increase in cases, and lesser recoveries started in July. In June, 364 recoveries were recorded against 147 new cases. However, in July only 280 recoveries were noted against 570 fresh cases. Meanwhile, in August till now, 1,435 cases have been recorded against only 668 recoveries.Another grim factor, the number of people who died on account of Covid in August has doubled as compared to four months between March and July.While no death was recorded in March and April, four fatalities were recorded in May. Again in June, only two deaths were reported which increased to nine in July making a cumulative figure of 15.The number of deaths, however, has reached 15, in less than three weeks of August.OTHER MEASURESUT administrator VPS Badnore on Wednesday directed UT health department and MC to ensure that the vendors in markets are tested through Rapid Antigen Method, so that they do not become super spreaders in the community.The administrator also directed PGIMER to create plasma bank and also to study whether the Covid patients are suffering from any side-effects after treatment and recovery.UT administration on Wednesday also directed Dharam Hospital, Sector 15C, and Rahi Care Dialysis, Sector 22C, to reserve two dialysis machines each for Covid-19 Patients. These hospitals/facilities can charge up to Rs 800 over and above the normal charges from Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-ut-asks-private-hospitals-to-reserve-25-bed-for-covid-19-patients/story-Z2vBzjJtCDfXUn3ljgJC0M.html

Vij said this decision has been taken in view of the upcoming assembly monsoon session, which will commence on August 26. He said directions have been issued to all civil surgeons of the state to conduct Covid-19 test of the MLAs of their areas at their homes. Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora said sufficient labs have been set up by the government to conduct tests for coronavirus. “If a person still wants to get tested by a private laboratory, then he/she can get the test done at a cost of ₹2,400,” he said , adding that the testing should be increased to curtail the death rate due to coronavirus. He said all DCs should inspect the Covid-19 care centres at regular intervals in their respective districts to ensure best medical facilities. He further asked the officers to check the availability of sufficient quantity of beds as well as oxygen cylinders. He also directed to depute a yoga teacher in each Covid hospital. Regular visits of psychologists should also be ensured in these hospitals to handle any kind of negative effect on the patients under treatment, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-claims-10-more-lives-in-haryana/story-ZWPWs1HpkPFeBjtLWXCnDO.html
19-08-2020||Chandigarh||HSSC dodges high court order to upload detailed results on website||Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) has been evading a six-year-old Punjab and Haryana high court direction to start uploading detailed results with break-up of marks, it has emerged. The high court has described as “defiance” the HSSC’s excuse that it is not feasible to upload the result. The HSSC conducts examinations for appointments to Group ‘C’ services and if required by the state government, the recruitment body also holds examinations for the appointment to Group ‘B’ and ‘D’ services. According to Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill’s August 13 order, as the case in question came up for hearing, the HSSC counsel sought four weeks’ adjournment to fulfil July 29, 2020 order of the court to upload the result. “No doubt at times there is some delay in accessing a website, but to say that it is not feasible to upload the result with detailed marks virtually amounts to defiance,” Justice Gill has stated in his order and described as “unfortunate” the delay in implementing the order. RECRUITMENT OF CONSTABLES As per the court orders, the petitioners were unsuccessful in the recruitment of police constables that HSSC had conducted. Their plea was that some of the successful candidates had made it on the basis of additional five marks given under the ‘socio-economic criteria’ although they were not eligible for the said marks. The petitioners’ counsel submitted that HSSC didn’t upload the detailed result with break-up of marks obtained by each candidate even as directions to this effect had been issued by this court on May 22, 2014, while dealing with another matter with identical facts. The HSSC, meanwhile, submitted the existing configuration of its web servers on which HSSC site is hosted can manage up to maximum 400 hits per minute. If the entire result file is uploaded, HSSC said, the web server may stop functioning as the maximum number of candidates will try to download the results. In case of server failure, HSSC stated, it takes one week to restore the website. The HSSC cited numerous instances when the server had crashed earlier. “This court is unable to accept the aforesaid explanation,” Justice Gill said in the July 29 order, directing the HSSC to discuss the matter with NIC and “apprise this court as to why it is impossible to upload complete result with break-up of marks obtained under each head by the candidates”. A RAP ON THE KNUCKLE When the hearing of the case began on August 13, the state’s counsel submitted that he had received instructions from the respondents concerned to request for adjournment for four weeks to comply with the July 29 order. “It is highly unfortunate that despite sufficient time of about three weeks having been afforded to the respondents, the needful has not been done,” Justice Gill’s orders says. “...the state counsel,” the order reads, “has today again tried to justify that uploading of the result with detailed marks is not feasible and in case it is uploaded, after 400 hits per minute, the web server will crash down.” Justice Gill stated that “this court is absolutely unable to accept the aforesaid reasons for non-compliance…” and set August 24 deadline to comply with July 29 order with direction to the HSSC to come up with a definite solution of the “so-called problem of uploading of result.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hssc-dodges-high-court-order-to-upload-detailed-results-on-website/story-p2trIqG8iHRO9iVI9mFz5H.html
19-08-2020||Noida||Waterlogged stretches slow down traffic in Noida||Traffic remained slow at different places in Noida and Greater Noida due to heavy rain on Wednesday while some motorcyclists took shelter at underpasses during downpour which further slowed down vehicular movement. There was waterlogging at the DND Flyway loops on both sides at Noida Film City, Mamoora underpass and Noida Phase 2. Traffic was also slow at Mahamaya Flyway in Noida and Pari Chowk in Greater Noida.Robin Mittal, a resident of Fusion Homes in Greater Noida west, said due to heavy rains, the road outside the society was waterlogged. “It appears waterlogging is due to clogged drains. This damages the road and also leads to health issues such as mosquito-borne diseases. The water receded once it stopped raining,” he said.Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Noida’s Sector 77, said Noida on Wednesday fared well. “There was some waterlogging in sectors during rain. We found that Noida has drains which are not well connected to the sewage line. There is a need for a revisit to these drains and conduct a cleanliness drive as monsoon has arrived,” he said.According to Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Traffic, there was heavy rain which slowed down traffic in the city. “Vehicular movement remained slow for a few hours during rain but there was no jam. We had alerted the traffic cops to facilitate commuting. Our control room did not receive calls about traffic jams on Wednesday,” he said.In Sector 34, a branch of a tree fell on an overhead wire which restricted internal traffic movement and resulted in power outage for four hours.K K Jain, General Secretary of the federation of Noida residents’ welfare associations (FONRWA), said the city is notified as a ‘no power cut zone’, but still it faces long-term outages. “Outages are caused by snags during the rainy season, not due to supply shortages. We feel that panel boxes and circuit breakers are rusty and the cables are defective. They need to be upgraded urgently,” he said. Rajeev Tyagi, general manager, Noida Authority, on the other hand, said the authority conducted cleanliness drive ahead of the monsoon. “We had directed the departments of civil, water and health to work on sanitisation and cleanliness of drains and sewages in advance. These departments worked in tandem with each other and we see the result as there is no waterlogging,” he said. He said that alleged residents have encroached and made unauthorised constructions at their residences by covering drains, which sometimes becomes a problem in cleanliness drive. “These drains sometimes choke and the water overflows. The residents should cooperate in making Noida a beautiful city,” he said.V N Singh, chief engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) was not available for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/waterlogged-stretches-slow-down-traffic-in-noida/story-RRI2rGbd29XvnogSNgnW2I.html
19-08-2020||City||Noida, Ghaziabad battered by rain, several places waterlogged||Noida, Ghaziabad and their adjoining regions saw heavy rain Wednesday morning which lasted almost throughout the day, bringing mercury down. According to weather analysts, both Noida and Ghaziabad received an estimated rainfall of around 60 to 70 millimetre (mm) from 8.30am on Wednesday. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Noida had also received an average of 6.5 mm of rainfall between Tuesday night and early Wednesday. The rain deprived Gautam Budh Nagar district – which, according to the IMD’s records had received only an average of 26.2mm till Tuesday rainfall against an expected 360.9 mm – may see light to moderate rain showers on Thursday.Rain below 15mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm moderate, and above 64.5mm is heavy. “Noida and Ghaziabad received heavy rainfall on Wednesday and it’s estimated to be at least 60 to 70mm, though it could be more. The heavy rains could be attributed to favourable weather conditions as the monsoon line of trough passed over Delhi. It’s now shifting northwards, however Thursday could still be rainy with light to moderate rains expected in the morning hours,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. The IMD had unmanned weather stations in Noida and Ghaziabad but both have been defunct for over a year and thus are unable to measure local precipitation or rainfall data. However, the regional meteorological centre in New Delhi -- as a pilot project -- has recently started mapping the rainfall in these two cities through the radar that provides estimated rainfall of a number of cities.The last time Noida saw such heavy rains this season was on July 19, with a recording of 56.7 mm.On Wednesday, mercury dropped by at least eight degrees Celsius from past 24 hours. Wednesday’s maximum temperature was recorded at 27.7 degrees Celsius, six notches below the season’s average, against 35.7 degrees a day earlier, while humidity oscillated between 100 to 97%. “The maximum temperatures are set to rise on Thursday and are likely to hover between 32 and 33 degrees Celsius due to likely drop in rains,” said Srivastava.Meanwhile, a number of places saw waterlogging and many a commuter were affected. While the Mamura underpass of Sector 66 was heavily waterlogged, among the industrial areas like Sector 63 and 62, phase-2, Sector 128, a few places along Noida expressway, Sector 76, Bhangel locality to name a few were hit. At Sector 63, commuters stated that the condition has not changed a bit over the past few years. “I live in Sector 46 and my office is in G block of Sector 63, which was all submerged in water. At some places, it was over two metres deep. My son who works in the same company has to leave late, so I suggested him not to come to the office as the condition was really miserable and it could have been dangerous. This is something that happens every year,” said TC Gaur, a resident of Sector 46.Another resident who was stuck in water logging stated that while the drains were cleaned, water logging still continued. “At a U-turn near Sector 76, there was heavy waterlogging; it was seen at other spots on the road from Sector 70 square towards Bhangel too. The issue is that while the drains were clean, there are no slopes on the roads, thus the water doesn’t drain properly,” said Kartik Sharma, a resident of sector 76.Several Ghaziabad areas submerged after rainMassive water-logging was reported from various locations on Wednesday afternoon after the deluge of the morning, which also spelt traffic snarls for residents.Residents said areas such as Indirapuram, Brij Vihar, Vasundhara, Govindpuram, Shalimar Garden, Navyug Market, and the Gaushala underpass were inundated in rainwater. “In Indirapuram, localities such as Ahimsa Khand-2, Kala Patthar road witnessed heavy water-logging. As a result, many vehicles submerged in water which had reached up to two feet. Traffic snarls were witnessed on one side of the CISF road as a result of rain-induced water-logging,” said BK Pandey, an Ahimsa Khand-2 resident. “Construction work is going on one side of the CISF road while the other side (Indirapuram to Vasundhara) witnessed heavy water-logging which resulted in traffic snarls adjacent to the sewage treatment plant,” he added.In other areas such as Govindpuram, residents found themselves stuck in heavily water-logged roads where many two-wheelers and cars also broke down. “We had to wade through heavily water-logged roads. My two-wheeler broke down in the rain and there was a mechanic available around. Even pedestrians had no clue how to cross the submerged roads” said Nishant Goel, a resident.As rain lashed the city, a fully-grown tree fell and damaged about four-five cars outside the district headquarters in Raj Nagar. At Indergarhi near Dasna, the wall of a local panchayat office collapsed due to heavy rains. No injuries were reported in both incidents.The Gaushala underpass a remained submerged in water, forcing commuters going from Ghaziabad city to Vijay Nagar to take alternate routes. In Loni, a two km stretch on the Delhi-Sahranpur road, outside the Loni police station, remained waterlogged.“Traffic snarls were reported from Bhopra, Sikandarpur, descending side of the Hindon elevated road, near Khoda underpass and also at Loni due to water-logging on Wednesday. However, traffic personnel deployed in the city stayed out and facilitated the movement of vehicles,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).The Ghaziabad municipal corporation said it deployed pumps in various waterlogged spots and the water drained out from most of the areas by 2 to3 pm as the rain subsided.“There was massive water-logging in several areas and we had to rope in pumps to flush out water. If water doesn’t drain out within two to four hours at a spot, we categorise it as a waterlogged area,” said Pramod Kumar, additional municipal commissioner.“Since the drains have a limited capacity to carry water, waterlogging was witnessed in low-lying areas but the rain was also heavy on Wednesday. We will rope in more pumps if heavy rain continues,” he added.He added that most of the 554 small and big drains in the city were de-silted before the monsoon arrived this year. “Work on cleaning the rest of the drains is also going on and will be finished soon,” Kumar said.Residents in Kaushambi, however, said they experienced less waterlogging this year. “In light of the petition the residents had filed with the National Green Tribunal about construction of drains, the municipal corporation had renovated/built about 18 drains. Hence, the water drained out very fast this year. There was some water-logging but not as massive as last year,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments’ RWA (residents welfare association).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-ghaziabad-battered-by-rain-several-places-waterlogged/story-nQu6OwIKSzY20mybzyCNGL.html
19-08-2020||Kolkata||Bengal government panel to probe ‘corruption’ in Covid-19 procurement||The Mamata Banerjee led administration in West Bengal has ordered a probe into the allegations of corruption in purchasing of medical equipment to fight Covid-19 pandemic in the state. A three-member committee headed by the state home secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay will look into the allegations and submit a report to the chief secretary. “The state health department has purchased several items in the past few months to fight the pandemic. More than Rs 2,000 crore have been spent. The allegations relate to corruption in this expenditure,” said a senior official of the state government. Usually it is the West Bengal Medical Services Corporation Limited which purchases medicines and medical equipment in bulk. But the government had formed a committee for procuring equipment and medicines for Covid-19 to eschew delay. Also Read: Bengal BJP targets CM Mamata Banerjee with new anti-corruption campaign“Some of the allegations are serious, including purchasing items from some particular agencies bypassing rules. In some cases, the quality of the products is also alleged to be inferior. The allegations reached the chief minister a few days ago following which she enquired about it. Thereafter a committee was formed to look into the allegations,” said the official. The ruling Trinamool Congress has been on the back foot following two recent allegations of corruption—one involving relief distribution to Amphan-hit people and second involving the public distribution system. CM Mamata Banerjee has had to intervene in both the cases to contain the damage. Also Read: Bengal police raids MP Arjun Singh’s home, BJP vows change after 2021 pollsThe need for medical equipment and kits were felt in large numbers since the government announced free treatment for Covid-19 in government hospitals. “The state government has ordered nearly three million PPEs, around 3.7 million N95 masks and around 4 million gloves among others. Huge amount of expenditure is involved,” said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-government-panel-to-probe-corruption-in-covid-19-procurement/story-jcLjXLfQJXBcQXvwkXsnLM.html

19-08-2020||City||Head constable arrested for hiding robbery booty||New Delhi: A serving Delhi Police head constable posted in north Delhi has been arrested for allegedly misappropriating R5 lakh he had recovered from a suspected robber. The robber and his three associates had snatched the money from a property dealer in north Delhi’s Civil Lines on August 6, officials privy to the development said on Wednesday.Officials said instead of informing his seniors about the cash recovery, the head constable allegedly concealed the fact and misled them by saying the person he had caught was involved in a vehicle theft case. The recovery of four stolen two-wheelers was shown with the arrest of the suspect, the officials said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj confirmed the head constable’s arrest. “An enquiry has been initiated to ascertain how and why the suspect, who was involved in a robbery case, was arrested in auto-lifting cases and recovery of stolen vehicles was shown. We have arrested three of the four robbers involved in the Civil Lines robbery. They have been identified as Rohan, Kunal alias Sanjay and Sumit. The head constable has been arrested in the same case,” Bhardwaj said.The concealing of information was discovered when a team of south district police caught Rohan and Kunal on August 14 in some other case and during interrogation, they told the police about their involvement in the Civil Lines robbery of August 6. The team contacted the Civil Lines police, which substantiated the duo’s disclosure regarding the robbery, said a police officer who did not want to be named.“Rohan and Kunal said that while they were fleeing after the robbery, one associate was caught by a policeman near Red Fort with their scooter and the stolen cash bag. The Civil Lines police visited that spot and scanned CCTV footage, which confirmed their claims. The footage showed a head constable catching the suspect with a scooter and the cash bag,” the officer said.Further probe revealed that the head constable posted with the Kotwali police station did not inform anyone in the police station about the recovery of the stolen cash.“The head constable was confronted and his questioning led to the recovery of the stolen cash. We arrested him,” DCP Bhardwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/head-constable-arrested-for-hiding-robbery-booty/story-fzcSCXfKlYQ30h2A8vXoDL.html

19-08-2020||Delhi||Former football coach held for stealing phones, wallets from dressing room at JLN stadium||The Delhi Police Wednesday said they have arrested a 50-year-old man for allegedly stealing 12 mobiles phones and wallets (together containing nearly ₹10,000 cash) of the players of Delhi United football club during the Delhi Football league match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in March this year.The phones and wallets belonged to players from Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Delhi, and were stolen from the dressing room of the stadium on March 13. Of the 12 stolen phones, nine have been recovered from the arrested man, identified as Shekhar Pathak, a former football coach, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said Pathak has told them that he committed the crime to take revenge on a former football player on whose complaint he was removed as coach of that team.“Pathak told us that when he got to know that the former player is presently associated with Delhi United club, he decided to settle the old score. However, he did not verify whether the player was actually associated with the club. He stole the belongings of the players to take revenge on that person,” Thakur said.Football Delhi association president Shaji Prabhakaran, however, said the theft had taken place during the senior division game between Delhi United and City FC in March.“This happened just before we had to close the league because of the (Covid-19) pandemic. They (team management) had the key to the dressing room and we knew it must have been someone from inside the club. But they were blaming Football Delhi,” said Prabhakaran, adding, “I am not aware of who Shekhar Pathak is.”Aditya Raghav, team manager of Delhi United, said, “After our third league match of the season in March, the team went back into the dressing room. So there are two keys to the dressing room -- one is given to us and the other remains with the office of Football Delhi. Our key was with me and I was in the dugout throughout the match. When we returned, we saw the lock intact and there were no signs of forced entry. But the phones and wallets were stolen. The Football Delhi officials had left the stadium by then.”“Shekhar Pathak was not involved with us, nor am I aware if he was part of the opposing team,” Raghav said.During the probe, Thakur said the investigating team checked CCTV cameras and put the stolen phones on surveillance. Recently, one of the phones was switched on and the investigating team caught its user after identifying his location. The person told the police that he had purchased the phone from Pathak but returned it since he did not show its original purchase receipt.“The person led us to Pathak, who was arrested and his interrogation led to the recovery of nine more stolen phones,” Thakur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/former-football-coach-held-for-stealing-phones-wallets-from-dressing-room-at-jln-stadium/story-7HhFDzvFIII6wZAfDimDmI.html
19-08-2020||City||North Delhi civic body postpones proposal on new professional tax||New Delhi: The standing committee of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday postponed all four proposals to increase different taxes, including introduction of a new professional fee, due to resistance from the opposition and also to facilitate a discussion on the move.The proposals were tabled for approval with an aim to improve the civic body’s financial situation, which took a hit due to the Covid-induced lockdown. These included a new professional tax of different slabs, 1% hike in the duty on the transfer of immovable properties, 1% increase in electricity tax and a property tax hike.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and councillors staged a protest at the Civic Centre, the headquarters of the corporation, to oppose these proposals. The north corporation decided to propose these taxes on the lines of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which had cleared a professional fee and increased tax on the transfer of property. North body officials said the professional tax was to be imposed on self-employed people and on professionals working in companies.According to the proposal, those earning up to Rs 50,000 per month, or Rs 6 lakh per annum, will not have to pay the professional tax. Those earning between Rs 50,000 and Rs 75,000 per month will pay Rs 100 per month. For people earning between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1 Lakh, the charge will be Rs 150 per month, while it is Rs 200 per month for earnings above Rs 1 lakh. The north civic body had also moved a proposal to hike tax on the transfer of immovable properties. The present transfer duty is 3% for male buyers and 2% for female buyers. The corporation proposes to hike it by 1%. Another proposal envisaged an increase in electricity tax from 5% on the bill amount to 6%. The electricity tax is added in the power bill and collected by discoms on behalf of the corporation. A fourth proposal was moved to change the categories of properties in its jurisdiction. This would have led to an increase in property tax.A senior official said the civic body is going through a financial crisis ever since the lockdown. “Increasing our source of revenue and taxes is the only possible way to fill the financial deficit. But the proposals were postponed and we will table them again in the next meeting,” the official said.The officials estimated that the civic body had incurred losses between Rs 150 crore and Rs 200 crore.The north corporation had last month approved recommendations of the municipal valuation committee-3 (MVC-3) to increase tax on rented commercial properties, guest houses and banquet halls. Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said, “We are undergoing a financial crisis. We are making efforts to manage it. We have postponed the tax hike proposals as we cannot approve any hike without proper discussion. We don’t want the public to suffer.”Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak led a protest along with party councillors, opposing the tax hike proposals. “The proposals to hike taxes and to introduce professional tax are anti-people and we will not let this pass. We will keep opposing such proposals that put an extra burden on people’s pockets,” Pathak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-delhi-civic-body-postpones-proposal-on-new-professional-tax/story-tUTxjdEWPwnU5w6ii0TxYO.html
19-08-2020||Delhi||Woman security guard found hammered to death at home||A 43-year-old woman security guard was found hammered to death at her home in east Delhi’s Vinod Nagar on Tuesday night. Police said her live-in partner has since gone missing and is the prime suspect in the case. The woman was identified by her first name, Mamata, and her body was discovered by her 17-year-old son when he returned home from a restaurant with food parcels, prompting the police to believe that the murder took place during his absence, said Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east). The suspect, 45-year-old Brahm Pal, the woman’s live-in partner, is on the run and efforts are on to trace him, the officer said. The motive behind the murder too is unknown, he said. Police said Mamata, who worked as a security guard with a private firm, had separated from her husband years ago. She has two sons -- the older one lived with her while her 14-year-old son attended school while living with a relative elsewhere in Delhi. “Mamata was involved with the suspect. Before the lockdown, he had moved into her rented home in Vinod Nagar,” the DCP said. Brahm Pal lived off money he received by renting out his home in another neighbourhood in east Delhi. “On Monday night, Brahm Pal sent the boy to fetch dinner from a nearby restaurant. When he returned around 10pm, he found his mother dead, her head smashed in with a hammer that was lying nearby,” the DCP said. Brahm Pal was missing from the scene. “We have registered a murder case and are looking for the suspect,” the DCP said, adding that the boy couldn’t shed any light on whether the couple had any differences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-security-guard-found-hammered-to-death-at-home/story-DxmUSRwBTEvZ5i63iRm2FN.html

Three days have passed since I filed the complaint, but no concrete steps have been taken to stop the illegal practice.”Aggarwal also questioned why the MC did not snap the sewer connections of such units.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that untreated waste being dumped by scattered units had always remained a major concern and the owners of those units had not even applied for connections of common effluent treatment plants (CETP) being established for the dyeing industry situated on Tajpur road and Focal point area.The MC officials said they had written to the PPCB several times in the past, but no concrete action was taken against the dyeing units.Earlier, MLA Sanjay Talwar had also raised the issue in MC General House and a resolution that the MC would snap the sewer connections of dyeing units if they fail to come up with CETPs by March 2020 was also passed.But the deadline to establish the CETPs was extended till December due to the lockdown and delays by the Union and state governments to release the subsidy.MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said, “PPCB has to take action in the matter and we are writing a letter to them for conducting an inspection at the point.”PPCB chairman Gulshan Rai said, “We have not yet received any complaint in this regard, but I will direct the department officials to inspect the point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dumping-of-untreated-waste-by-dyeing-units-goes-unabated-in-ludhiana/story-XdBhsksUgcQSxpgCw7lsaI.html
19-08-2020||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah seeks judicial probe into Bengaluru violence||Former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday alleged the BJP government in Karnataka was only interested in gaining mileage using the recent mob violence here and no relief measures had been taken up in the flood-hit areas.He also sought a judicial inquiry into the violence that broke out over a social media post by the nephew of a Congress MLA, claiming it showed intelligence ‘failure’.In a series of tweets, Siddaramaiah, who is also the Congress Legislature Party leader, asked Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to direct his ministers to visit the affected places to carry out relief works.“The whole state is suffering due to floods & its mismanagement. But @BJP4Karnataka is only interested in gaining political mileage using Bengaluru violence,” he charged.He also claimed ‘failure’ to provide relief and rehabilitation for last year’s flood victims has added to the misery.Taking a dig at Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Revenue Minister R Ashoka, he tweeted the Home Minister was surveying flood affected areas while the latter continued to ‘speculate’ on Bengaluru violence, that left four people dead last week.“Is it not the duty of the Revenue minister to assess the damage due to floods?” he asked and urged Yediyurappa to “direct your ministers to carry out their work.” On the situation in his assembly constituency Badami, he said people there were under stress due to floods.Later in a letter to Yediyurappa, he demanded a judicial inquiry into the violence at the Devara Jeevanahalli and Kadugondanahalli, claiming it was an outcome of the “failure” of the government and the Intelligence department.If the government cannot protect an MLA and the police station then how can it be able to protect the people of the state?” Siddaramaiah asked.Reacting to it, Bommai said Siddaramaiah was agitated with the ‘squabbling’ in Congress.“His condition in the Congress is very critical. Hence, he speaks only about the BJP all the time,” he claimed.The violence in DJ Halli and adjoining areas on August 11 night was unleashed by hundreds of people over an inflammatory social media post allegedly put out by P Naveen, a relative of Pulakeshinagar Congress MLA R Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/siddaramaiah-seeks-judicial-probe-into-bengaluru-violence/story-XuvHBGdJZNbp1yhmVobzcJ.html
19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Shifting of Ambala oil terminal gathers pace, truckers protest||Truckers staged a protest against the decision to shift the Indian Oil Terminal on National Highway 44 in Ambala Cantonment on Wednesday.The shifting of the 40-acre terminal has been pending for years. Locals have long demanded that the terminal be shifted because of the high population density around it and its proximity to the railway lines and the national highway that connects north India with the rest of the country.Truck drivers, on the other hand, said the decision will affect them and their families adversely amid the pandemic. “The decision will cost me my job. Around 300 trucks were stopped today without a reason. The depot supplies to the army and air force and in case of an emergency, it will take hours to supply fuel to the vehicles and aircrafts of the defence forces,” said one of the protesters, Praveen Kumar. Truck drivers’ union president Vinod Kumar said , “We are being hassled. Most of us have been waiting since morning and are being asked to leave in the evening without supply.”General manager of the terminal Ravi Sharma couldn’t be reached for a comment despite several attempts. A senior official of Indian Oil, Chandigarh, who did not wish to be named, said the shifting process had been initiated in phases and will be complete by September. “Security and safety threat to the cantonment area could also be one of the reasons behind the terminal’s closure,” the official said. “The Ambala terminal is one of the oldest in the region. A new terminal has come up in Una, Himachal Pradesh, which could cater to Punjab and north Haryana. Other districts of Haryana will probably get their supply from Panipat. There are depot terminals in Bathinda and Sangrur that could supply to Ambala’s customers but it all depends on the lending costs,” the official said.Ambala Sadar Municipal Council executive officer Vinod Nehra confirmed that the lease of land had expired long ago and was not extended by authorities. “We had sent them notices about their pending lease earlier this year but they moved to court,” Nehra said. The issue was a poll plank during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when locals called for its closure yet again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shifting-of-ambala-oil-terminal-gathers-pace-truckers-protest/story-LTTS9yy8LjCMRCN4djX14N.html
19-08-2020||Mumbai||Man hammers friend to death, injures other||A 45-year-old man bludgeoned one of his two friends with a hammer and inflicted serious injuries to another in an inebriated state. The injured man has been admitted to Sion hospital in a critical state. His condition is stable. The incident took place in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday when Sabbal Jagal Chaudhary alias Bengali, who digs graves at Bohri cemetery at Kurla (West), was consuming alcohol with his friend Javed Shaikh, 32, at Chaudhary’s residence in Kurla. During their conversation, Chaudhary got angry over a trivial issue and started fighting. Another friend of theirs, Ayyaz Ejaz Khan, 29, heard them fight and went to check on them around 1.30am on Wednesday. According to Khan, both Chaudhary and Shaikh were drunk and Shaikh was allegedly asking Chaudhary as to why he wanted to kill Shaikh.“Chaudhary then picked up a hammer from the kitchen and hit Shaikh’s head two to three times. When Khan tried to intervene, Chaudhary hit him on his head with the hammer as well. However, Chaudhary managed to flee while Khan informed other neighbours about the incident,” said senior inspector Dattatray Shinde of Kurla police station. Shaikh’s brother Farukh and his friends rushed them to Sion hospital where Shaikh was declared dead on arrival. “Khan’s condition was critical till afternoon, but later the doctor said his condition was stable,” said Shinde. Following Khan’s statement, a case of murder and attempt to murder has been registered against Chaudhary. He was traced to Bhandup and was subsequently arrested on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-hammers-friend-to-death-injures-other/story-fvQSoy21mxVKUOiSPJqrcM.html
19-08-2020||City||Cases rising, but state well placed to handle situation: Chief secy||Chandigarh Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan on Wednesday said the state is well prepared to handle the current patient load and there was no dearth of facilities for the treatment of Covid patients at any level. In a statement, she said all necessary arrangements have been ensured at level 2 and 3 facilities. Level- 2 facilities in the state are well prepared to handle the current patient load with more than 60% beds lying vacant in the four worst Covid-hit districts — Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar. She said Punjab government has partnered with the private healthcare sector to ensure greater coverage and better utilisation of the available resources. The chief secretary said at Level 3 facilities in these four districts, cumulatively more than 40% beds are currently unoccupied. Though the occupancy of hospital/ICU beds by critically ill patients is increasing, the situation is far from being as grave as mentioned in some news reports, she said. She said it is possible that some individual centres may report full occupancy at times, but there is a strong mechanism in place at the district level to ensure that patients are referred immediately to another centre and given the best possible medical care. “The Punjab government has designated dedicated officers, called Covid Patient Tracking Officers (CPTOs), who monitor every person that tests positive right from the time that the test result comes till the completion of treatment. Similarly, senior IAS and PCS officers have also been made incharge of tertiary care and Level 3 facilities to ensure that there is optimal utilisation of resources,” she said. The live bed status availability will also be made available to the public shortly on the COVA App, she said. “While it is true that there is a spurt in the number of COVID positive cases, it has been limited to big cities. It is primarily driven by the easing of the lockdown restrictions, ramping up of testing facilities and also because of non-observance of the government directives, such as use of mask, social distancing, etc.,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cases-rising-but-state-well-placed-to-handle-situation-chief-secy/story-xORexzRdbdbmne8wazpFQN.html
19-08-2020||Mumbai||Developer’s murder in Juhu: 29-year-old attacker arrested||The Mumbai crime branch arrested 29-year-old Nadim Naushad Shaikh, the assailant who killed 55-year-old real estate developer and chairman of Al Sofi Group, Abdul Munaf Shaikh, in Juhu, on Wednesday from a slum pocket in Govandi. Following the arrest of Nadim, the case was transferred to the Mumbai crime branch. The victim, Shaikh was walking towards a mosque at around 6am on Monday morning to offer prayers when Nadim attacked the builder from behind, slit his throat and stabbed him multiple times with a chopper. Akbar Pathan, deputy commissioner of police (detection) said, “We found Nadim’s whereabouts through our informants and a team was formed. We arrested him from Govandi.” Nadim during interrogation has confessed of being offered ₹5 lakh to kill Shaikh. Crime branch officers said that Nadim was hiding in a ground plus two structure in the Shivaji Nagar slum in Govandi. “Nadim was playing carrom when a constable of ours walked into the second floor of the house. The moment he saw the constable, he jumped off from the window and ran on the rooftop of the houses in the slum,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity. Mahesh Desai, a senior police inspector who was leading the investigation, had formed a team of police inspector Sanjeev Gavade and assistant police inspector Vijay Ambawde who were standing outside the house with their staff. The moment they saw the accused run, the team started chasing the accused. Nadim after running through the rooftop of at least 20 houses reached a dead end and was then arrested. Nadim during preliminary questioning has revealed that he was arrested in a murder case at Vikhroli in 2014, and had been released on bail in 2018. After his release, he had started his own scrap business in Govandi. Four months ago, he got in touch with Abdul Rehman Abdul Latif Shaikh alias Sonu, who was arrested by Juhu police yesterday in the murder case. “Nadim was looking for a job and Sonu helped him get a job as an office boy. Three months ago, Sonu called him and offered him ₹5 lakh to kill Shaikh,” said a police inspector, requesting anonymity. Nadim agreed to Sonu’s offer. “Nadim and Sonu followed him on six to seven occasion in the morning. On Monday, Nadim took his employer’ bike to reach the spot alone and at around 6am he stabbed him to death,” added the officer. Crime branch sources said the conspiracy to kill Abdul Munaf Shaikh could have a larger plot with other elements being involved in the murder apart from Sonu. “We are investigating the possibility of the involvement of ganglords of a 6-acre slum pocket in Andheri which Abdul Munaf Shaikh was supposed to redevelop,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/developer-s-murder-in-juhu-29-year-old-attacker-arrested/story-vBd0BfEE3MfpKyV33l9VXL.html

Dr Pandav was placed ahead of Dr Jain in the seniority list notified by the institute in September 2018, which was challenged by the latter before CAT. The tribunal had ruled in favour of Dr Jain, following which the matter had reached the high court in June 2020. HC in its order said that seniority list till September 2018 was the provisional/tentative seniority and did not create any vested right in favour of Dr Jain. “It was open to PGIMER to have corrected the mistake in assigning the right seniority to Dr Pandav in the earlier provisional seniority lists when it issued the list dated September 25, 2018,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-overturns-cat-order-on-seniority-dispute-between-two-pgimer-professors/story-3vCGMeCfLstVr5BvoNKc0M.html

19-08-2020||Patna||Bihar govt cancels famous Pitripaksh mela due to Covid-19 crisis||The famous Pitripaksh Mela at Gaya, scheduled to begin on September 1, will not be held this time owing to Covid-19 outbreak.Based on the recommendation of the revenue and land reforms department in view of the ongoing lockdown, the Gaya district administration on Wednesday issued a notification to cancel the fair—an annual ritual for people to pay homage and offer food (pind-daan) to their ancestors.Gaya district magistrate (DM) Abhishek Singh on Wednesday said the decision to shelve the ritual was taken in view of the state government’s lockdown, which is effective till September 6, and the challenges of maintaining social distancing norms.Earlier, the district magistrate held a meeting with the management of committee members of Vishnupad Temple and convinced them to discontinue the ritual in view of the health risk due to surge in Covid-19 cases. He also urged the priests to convey the message to devotees, who were planning to attend the ritual. “It would be highly risky to allow the ritual, as devotees happen to be the vulnerable age group of 60-65 years. Those willing to offer pind-daan may come here after the coronavirus is contained. Moreover, all types of religious activities have been banned due to Covid. Even Vishnupad temple will remain closed till September 6 due to the lockdown,” the district magistrate said. The Pitripaksh Mela, which is scheduled to be held between September 3 and 17, invites people from all across the world. An estimated 5 lakh people usually visit Gaya to offer homage to their ancestors and catalayse economic activities of the town.Local legislator and agriculture minister Prem Kumar, however, expressed his reservations over cancellation of the fair and wrote to chief minister Nitish Kumar, urging him to reconsider the government’s decision. Prem Kumar said the priest community (Pandas) and local businessmen were enraged over the decision, as they rested on this fair to earn livelihoods for the entire year.Justifying the contention of Pandas and local traders, Kumar said that the fair could also be held in a controlled way as all activities in Bihar were limping back to normal after lockdown.Some local voluntary organisations have also protested the state government’s decision, saying that the temple management committee had already descaled the ritual and less than 50,000 people were expected to arrive in Gaya this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-govt-cancels-famous-pitripaksh-mela-due-to-covid1-9-crisis/story-bCE5pB8dg9zaUuFdqixAJI.html
19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Govt not following SYL case to its root cause: Bains||At a time when chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh has urged the Union government to be cautious about the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue as it has potential to disturb the nation’s security, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) president and MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains has accused the Congress and SAD-BJP alliance of not following the case to its root cause and fooling residents of the state. During a press meet organised at his residence in Kot Mangal Singh area on Wednesday, Bains demanded that the CM call a session of the Vidhan Sabha and make changes in the The Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004. “A pending case in the Supreme Court where the Punjab government challenged Sections 78 and 79 of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966, should be followed properly to save the water of Punjab,” he said.“Rather than stopping Haryana from claiming its right on the waters of Punjab, the government is saying they do not have water for Haryana,” he said. Bains said if the state government follows up the matter to its root, then the matter can be resolved but government is politicising the issue. “The Captain Amarinder Singh-led government had approved The Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, but a clause was mentioned where it was stated that Punjab has no issue with the water, which was already moving out of the state at the time. That clause should be cancelled,” he said. “Further efforts should be made to abolish the unconstitutional sections of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966, which stops Punjab from having right over its water. The state government had filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the same in 2007, which is pending. But the government has not moved an application for hearing the case for a long time,” said Bains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-not-following-syl-case-to-its-root-cause-bains/story-HFT7kccYhOtCoUQSMpwj1J.html

He has suggested various measures to handle the situation. The court has posted the matter for September 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-shift-patients-from-sirmaur-solan-and-kinnaur-to-ddu-hospital-hc-to-himachal-govt/story-9UHna8VCzO8XrwcieAEGlN.html

Though we sprayed pesticides time to time, the results have not been encouraging,” said Mohammad Ramzan Bhat, who owns an apple orchard in Goshbough of Pattan, known for its high-quality apple varieties in north Kashmir. “This year, the production is half of what we had last year. Our aim now is to save the remaining harvest in the orchards from diseases.”Another orchardist from Sangrama, Mohammad Maqbool Rishi, is finding it difficult to sell his produce this season. “I used to sell my produce in mid-June, much before harvesting, to commission agents who used to form a beeline. This time, only one agent approached and offered a mere 30% of last year’s price. This is happening due to the quality of the apples. I have no option but to sell my produce in the next few weeks.”From early this year, Kashmir has witnessed bad weather which has affected the quality of apples and other fruits.Parimpora fruit growers’ association president, Bashir Ahmad Bhat, said from August last year, the growers have suffered heavy losses. “Even commission agents and big dealers who used to give advance money to growers haven’t released payments due to Covid-19, less and inferior fruit,” he said adding that this year’s cherry and plum crops also did not fetch good prices. “It is a bad time not only for growers but commission agents too.”However, there are some pockets, especially in south Kashmir’s lower belt, where production is normal and scab hasn’t affected the orchards. “I think the weather and substandard pesticides played a role in the spread of scab across orchards this year. I got pesticides from reputed companies so my orchards are free from the disease,” said Abdul Qayoom Bhat, a fruit grower from Pulwama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-low-rainfall-poor-yield-fruit-traders-in-kashmir-stare-at-losses/story-1p1npUO3Jy68C6rbmtD9rK.html

19-08-2020||City||Punjab to provide masks to govt school students along with uniforms||With masks becoming an essential commodity in the fight against Covid-19, Punjab government schools are all set to provide two reusable masks to students along with their uniforms this time. According to officials, a grant of Rs 77 crore has already been received by the state under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme and this will soon be transferred to the districts and subsequently to the schools. Each school will get Rs 600 for purchasing shoes, socks, belt, tie, shirt, trousers, skirt, sweater and turban. The masks are to be made from the leftover fabric of the uniforms. Over 12 lakh students across the state will benefit from the scheme. While many school principals appreciated the move, saying that it will help students coming from poor families who may not be able to purchase masks, others questioned as to how it was relevant as schools are not likely to open anytime soon in view of the rising Covid-19 cases. Punjab DGSE-cum-state project director, SSA authority, Mohammad Tayyab said,“The members of school management committees also need time to purchase the material and then get it stitched. If schools re-open in the next few months, then what will students wear if new uniform is not provided to them on time.”To ensure that students don’t have to venture out amid the pandemic, the authorities have decided that parents will be asked to provide the measurements of their wards to the school for stitching and collect it once it is ready. Till last year, students used to be handed over the uniform in the school itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-to-provide-masks-to-govt-school-students-along-with-uniforms/story-DH5x20cdEAru1qqOFz67VN.html

The test provides information about past infection too,” said Dr Sabiya Majid, biochemistry HOD and co-principal investigator.“Seventy-two HCWs were positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2, giving a prevalence of 2.5%. Out of them, 50 were males and 22 females. Among the HCWs, the prevalence was 2.7% among males and 2.1% in females. Twelve HCWs were above 60 years of age. The IgG positives included 27 doctors, 9 nurses, 10 technicians, two ambulance drivers, and eight hospital security staff among others. As many as 339 HCWs are reported to have at least one contact with a Covid-19 patient,” said Dr Inaam-ul-Haq, assistant professor, community medicine, and co-investigator.To check the prevalence of IgG antibodies among the general population, total 2,923 blood samples were collected from people visiting 20 selected hospitals across the district and three other sites.Officials said if this is applied to the current adult population of the district, which is over 10 lakh, then the number of IgG positives at the time of the survey was approximately 38,000.“Of the 111 IgG positives, 63 were males and 48 females. The prevalence of IgG positives was 4.3% among males and 3.3% in females. Total 115 persons were reported to have influenza-like symptoms four weeks prior to the survey and out of them 12.2% showed presence of IgG antibodies,” said Dr Salim Khan.He said IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 usually develop two weeks after the infection. Thus, the presence of IgG antibodies is indicative of past coronavirus infection.The results of this seroprevalence study shows that on an average, 3.8% people in the district have been infected with Covid-19.“As positive cases continue to emerge from the district, it is expected that seroprevalence may further increase in the near future as more and more individuals are getting infected and developing virus antibodies,” said Dr Samia Rashid, Principal GMC Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/serosurvey-shows-covid-infection-among-2-5-health-workers-in-srinagar-district/story-j600951fVdStdgrmT0yxPM.html

A dog bite victim has to undergo a course of seven vials of the vaccine, which is administered free at government hospitals, but costs Rs 300 per vial in a private hospital. The district had reported 8,951 dog bite cases till July. The record of August could not be maintained, due to the shortage of vaccine. Ludhiana also reported 15,000 dog bite cases last year, and has also been the district with the most number of covid-19 cases to date.

Both dispatch and receiving units will have to maintain records and certifications to this effect for each tanker/truck, said Agarwal.EN ROUTE STOPPING NOT ALLOWEDIn no case will the transport vehicle be allowed to stop en route its destination within Punjab, except in case of breakdown, when the manufacturing unit will be duty bound to inform the excise officer in-charge of the unit within 15 minutes of such breakdown. The seals on the outlet of the transport vehicle must be kept intact and not broken in any way in such instances, said the excise commissioner.If the breakdown necessitates transfer of the material/products to another vehicle, the same will be done in the presence of, or in accordance with the instructions of an excise officer of the jurisdiction in which the breakdown has occurred.In case the vehicle stops en route within the jurisdiction of Punjab for reasons other than breakdown, it would be assumed that the vehicle has been stopped for pilferage and should such a scenario arise, the distillery and the transporter shall be jointly and severely liable for civil and/or criminal action as per the law.Further, it will be the responsibility of the receiving unit to ensure that the entire contents of the material purchased and carried in the transport vehicle have been unloaded and there is no residue material in the transport vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gps-enabled-tracking-device-must-in-vehicles-carrying-spirit-in-punjab/story-Xj8vBa6K2LC3uSjFzVq7YO.html

Concurrently, DNA samples have been collected from Rajouri, under the aegis of JK Police, and are being matched with those of terrorists killed on July 18,” he said.“Cases where doubts are raised are investigated under due process as per the law of the land. Since the case is under investigation, further details will be shared periodically, as appropriate without affecting due legal process,” he had said. The encounter took place on July 18 when the army claimed to have killed three militants at Amshipora in the higher reaches of Shopian in south Kashmir.However, little over two weeks thereafter, missing complaints were lodged in Rajouri area of Jammu region by the families of three youths, working as labourers in apple and walnut orchards, who had disappeared from the same region and they had last talked to them on July 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shopian-encounter-army-asks-locals-to-share-info-for-probe/story-ljQIbKjkX8MCqhiiWn39jJ.html

19-08-2020||City||Police to roll out ITMS in Dharamshala town from Sep 1||The district police will roll out Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) in Dharamshala town to rein in on traffic violators from September 1.The project is currently on a trial run and the results are encouraging, said Kangra senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vimukt Ranjan.Dharamshala will be the second town in Himachal after Kullu to have ITMS.Ranjan said two high-definition Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras have been installed on the highway connecting Dharamshala. The cameras, capable of different video analytics, are linked to a control room set up at district police headquarters through leas line.Presently, these cameras have analytics for three violations including overspeed, without helmet and triple riding, he said, adding that the cameras can capture clear images in any weather and more analytics will be added at the later stages.Ranjan said the personnel monitoring the traffic in control room can access the footages upto last one month. Once a violation is caught on camera, a video footage and picture of the number plate is stored in the control room system.“After analysis, the control room person in-charge pushes the data to the District Centre of National Informatics Centre (NIC) and ITMS service provider and a notice to the violator is generated on his mobile phone,” the SSP said.In case of false detection, the error is corrected at the control room. “From September 1, the system will be fully functional and we will start issuing challans to violators through it,” he said.The SSP said the initial plan was to install the system on all the access roads to the town but could not be materialised due to lack of funds. This system will reduce human intervention in implementation of traffic rules. Currently, the district police were running a campaign on social media to make residents aware about the new system.“This is to inform the people that no one will go scot free for violating traffic rules. They are being watched,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-to-roll-out-itms-in-dharamshala-town-from-sep-1/story-BfhBTpB7yy1qK49rUl0EKL.html

The rains flooded many streets, turning them into small rivers, as traffic came to a virtual standstill at key stretches. An underpass on the Golf Course Road was also submerged under water.   Many vehicles lay marooned on the roads as they got stuck due to the water. Police were also seen moving them to keep the traffic going. The traffic congestion also brought back the memories of the rains in 2016 when commuters were stuck in a massive jam for hours.   Also read: Incessant rains lash Delhi; waterlogging woes continue“Traffic has not moved an inch on Subhash Chowk (Gurgaon) since an hour because there is waterlogging,” said Deepak Sharma, a resident of Gurugram said. The Millennium City was among the worst hit as water entered complexes of high-rises, forcing them to turn off the power to avoid any mishap.   “The city has come to a standstill, roads are submerged under water, imagine what would be the state of subways. Gurugram is never prepared for rains,” said Nidhi Shukla, a Gurgaon-based architect. Keerti Uppal, another resident of Gurgaon, said the situation is so bad in up-class Gurugram areas, what could be the state of interior Gurgaon. “If it is known as cyber city, it cannot be floating every time it rains for an hour,” she added. In Delhi, waterlogging took place at 16 different locations in areas, including Kirari, Burari and Rohini, the North MCD said.Trees fell at seven different locations and at eight places and parts of buildings collapse due to rain.Seven cars were damaged after the boundary wall of a school in Block J, Saket in south Delhi collapsed allegedly due to heavy rains, the police said.   On road, vehicles moved bumper to bumper during the morning rush hours, as the downpour led to heavy waterlogging at key road stretches.The Delhi Traffic Police has been constantly updating its Twitter handle alerting commuters about waterlogging at several intersections across the city.According to them, waterlogging was reported at BRT near Central School, Badarpur to Ashram, Badarpur flyover underpass, Sarita Vihar flyover underpass, Dhaula Kuan towards AIIMS carriageway, Moti Bagh flyover underpass, MB Road near Batra Hospital, Palam Flyover and Chhata Rail.Also read: IMD predicts widespread rain in Delhi, monsoon deficit dropsOther areas, including Mayur Vihar Phase-2, Sarai Kale Khan to DND, Sashi Garden to Kotla, Seemapuri to Dilshad Garden underpass, MB Road at Maidan Garhi, MB Road at Anuvrat Marg, Apsara Border have also reported water-logging.The Delhi Traffic Police has alerted commuters to avoid specific stretches of roads where traffic congestion has been witnessed.Srivastava said Delhi recorded moderate rains till 11:30 am.

The agency also allowed reopening of weekly markets on a trial basis. However, gymnasiums will continue to remain closed.The Delhi government led by Aam Aadmi Party’s Arvind Kejriwal had been advocating the reopening of hotels, gyms and weekly markets in the national capital since the start of Unlock 3.0 in the country. It had sent a proposal for this twice to the Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, who also heads the SDMA, citing the decline in the number of Covid 19 cases in the national capital. However, the LG’s office had indicated that relaxations such as allowing local weekly markets and gymnasiums to operate may lead to a resurgence in the number of cases and, therefore, rejected Kejriwal government’s insistence on that count.Wednesday’s decision to reopen hotels is likely to benefit around four lakh people employed in the hotel industry in the national capital.Senior government officials said that the trial period for re-opening weekly markets is likely to be anywhere between one week to 10 days.However, gymnasiums and yoga centres cannot open in Delhi as of now. A decision on this will be taken at a later stage in another meeting of the SDMA. Senior government officials said that a major concern expressed by the LG was the number of fresh cases Delhi continues to witness on a daily basis. According to the last one week’s data, Delhi on an average is getting 1,033 cases every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ddma-gives-nod-to-reopen-hotels-in-delhi-weekly-markets-to-open-on-trial-basis-gyms-to-remain-closed/story-bTNmE56IxvHiQQilJoMbFM.html

He said there is a threat of spread of Covid-19 in the fruit markets due to poor management by the state government.While addressing a press conference at Rajiv Bhawan here, Rathore said he along with president of district Congress committee Shimla (rural) Yashwant Chhajta went on a two-day visit to apple growing areas of the district during which they interacted with orchardists, truck drivers and others involved in the trade. He said they came to know that there are no proper safety and security arrangements in the fruit markets and commission agents have made some arrangements at their level that are not enough.“No screening for the virus is being conducted, people are not practicing social distancing, no cleanliness is maintained and there are no safety and security arrangements in the fruit markets. No one is checking any person coming and going out of these fruit markets which shows that the government is least bothered, “ Rathore said.He said despite making huge promises, the state government has not been able to provide enough labourers to the orchardists till now. “The orchardists had no choice but to bring labourers on their own expense for which they had to pay excessive amounts to private taxis and buses. No arrangements were made by the state government to quarantine labourers,” Rathore alleged.He said diseases like scab are also spreading in apple growing areas due to unavailability of required pesticides and fungicides. “Commission agents have made it clear that they will not purchase scab affected apples but the chief minister and horticulture minister are not worried about it and their attitudes shows that they are anti-orchardists,” he added.Rathore also lashed out at the state government for adopting double standards in dealing with the pandemic. He demanded that cases should be filed against BJP leaders for spreading the virus and violating Covid-19 rules and guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-accuses-hp-govt-of-mismanagement-in-fruit-markets-amid-pandemic/story-LUp5vRXvc9ByJa0tC9HVSJ.html
19-08-2020||Patna||Parties see opportunity in Dalit assertion in Bihar||Dalit leaders have been hogging the limelight in poll-bound Bihar as the state gears for assembly elections scheduled in October-November. Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) president Chirag Paswan has been attacking the Bihar government and chief minister Nitish Kumar over governance and management of migrant crisis and Covid-19 pandemic. Paswan has been upset over Janata Dal-United (JDU)’s reluctance in accommodating LJP in the 12 nominations to the Bihar Legislative Council from the governor’s quota even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wanted to give it one seat. The result has been the nominations still remain stuck.JD-U has maintained it does not have an alliance with LJP in the state and has become friendlier with former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi as it seeks to have a Dalit leader by its side to offset possible exit of Chirag Paswan’s party from the ruling National Democratic Alliance.Former Bihar minister Shyam Razak this month defected to Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) saying 99% of the leaders in JD-U were upset with the Kumar but did not have a voice. “I cannot stay in a party where social justice is stripped,” he said.Also Read: RJD, Congress finalise seat-sharing deal for Bihar polls, Manjhi’s HAM not happyBJP’s Dalit leader, Sanjay Paswan, a former union minister, has asked Kumar to vacate his post for someone else after having served for 15 years. This also antagonized the JD-U, but Paswan termed it his personal opinion.Sanjay Paswan said his attacks on Kumar were a kind of manifestation of the Dalit assertion. “Why only Chirag, even Shyam Razak’s move to resign as minister and assembly member... is a sign of growing Dalit assertion and there is nothing surprising in Dalit politics gaining momentum as it is a natural process.”Sanjay Paswan, who is a legislative council member, said the first phase of state politics was dominated by the forward castes, then came backward classes and now it was the turn of Dalits and extremely backward classes. “Earlier also Bihar saw the emergence of Dalit leaders like Bhola Paswan Shastri, Karpoori Thakur, and Ram Sunder Das... Now, Dalit politics is becoming stable and self-reliant.”Sanjay Paswan said that Dalit leaders would have to make sacrifices and refrain from blackmailing for petty gains. “They should not get carried away by the lure of identity politics as it will render them ineffective and defeat the larger goal.”DM Diwakar, a former director of Patna’s AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said with over 18% of Bihar’s population, Dalits are a potent force that none of the political parties wants to antagonize. “In the past, Dalits identified with the Left parties and then with the Congress, but gradually they too drifted towards liberal parties once the Left weakened. ...Dalits [in the 1990s] found in Lalu Prasad [Yadav of RJD] a saviour and along with Muslims formed a potent force. Today all the parties have their Dalit morcha to take advantage of identity politics among Dalits and that is the reason quite a few leaders have emerged and are in demand by one party or the other to counter one another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/parties-see-opportunity-in-dalit-assertion-in-bihar/story-RgaXlhRVKWdnp1GQhOuyzO.html

19-08-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata maid held for stealing ₹35 lakh using dead employer’s ATM card||The Kolkata Police have arrested a maid who made her two sons-in-law withdraw ₹34.90 lakh from her dead employer’s account through several ATMs over 71 days. In what police officers called a “rare case,” 45-year-old Rita Roy, a widow, stole the ATM card of her dead employer Satyanarayan Agarwal who lived in an upmarket residential complex in south Kolkata. Since Agarwal used to forget the card’s PIN frequently, his son Anurag had saved it as a text message on Agarwal’s phone. The woman accessed the phone and got the PIN, said Murlidhar Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime). She got her sons-in-law, Ranjit Mallick (31), a resident of Karimpur in Nadia district and Soumitra Sarkar (45) a resident of Balagarh in Hooghly district, to steal the money. Anurag detected the theft and lodged a complaint at Jadavpur police station on June 1. The detective department at Lalbazar police headquarters took the case. The records of Yes Bank, where Agarwal had an account, showed that the money had been withdrawn from ATMs of various banks at Karimpur, Krishnanagar and Ranaghat in Nadia and Guptipara in Hooghly between March 20 and May 30. Security camera footage from these ATM kiosks showed that the thieves wore masks and caps inside the counters, taking advantage of the pandemic. With face recognition difficult, the detectives started tapping locals and nabbed Mallick and Sarkar on August 13. Their interrogation led to Roy’s arrest from her residence in the Nakashipara area of Nadia district on the same day. The police have recovered ₹27 lakh in cash from their homes. They will be in police custody until August 25, said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-maid-held-for-stealing-35-lakh-using-dead-employer-s-atm-card/story-TlsLlktgrd6ZsMzDl8VEYK.html
19-08-2020||Patna||Sero survey to start in six more districts of Bihar from today||Come Wednesday, Bihar will embark on second round of serological survey, commonly referred to as sero survey, to assess the Covid spread in six of its 38 districts.It will also indicate if the community transmission of the virus has happened in an area, as people to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, will be asked if they ever came in contact with a Covid-19 person.The five-day survey will be confined to Arwal, Begusarai, Buxar, Madhubani, Muzaffarpur and Purnia districts.These districts have been selected as per the randomization plan of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which has collaborated with the National Institute of Research for Tuberculosis (NIRT), with headquarters in Chennai, for the survey across 70 districts in India.Even villages and urban wards within the districts have been selected as per their randomization plan to cover four corners of a district, said officials associated with the survey.A total 2,400 samples — 400 from each of the six districts — will be collected from Bihar. The result of the sero-survey is expected by mid-September, they said.The ICMR’s Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) will undertake the survey in Bihar.“The cumulative seropositivity in these districts was 0.7% during an earlier survey undertaken between May 17 and 20. This meant that only 17 out of 2,400 people surveyed developed antibodies (immunity) against SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr Pradeep Das, director RMRIMS, Patna.Of the 400 people sampled in each district earlier, Arwal had a seropositivity of 1%, Begusarai 0.25%; Buxar 1.25%; Madhepura 1%, Purnia 0.75% while Muzaffarpur reported 0%, he said.“We now have a baseline data and will compare it with the findings of this survey to find out the level of IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 (IgG is one of the predictive markers for Covid-19 antibody),” added Dr Das.“Higher the serological positivity, better for the community, as it indicates lower probability of re-infection of Covid-19. An antibody level of 30%-40% indicates better chance of protection against the virus,” said Dr Das.According to studies, India has recently reported a seropositivity of 17%-18% for IgG, he added.“We are expanding the age group of people to be surveyed. We will take samples from people in the age group of 10 years and above, as compared to 18 years and above in the first survey,” said Dr Das.Presence of Covid-specific antibodies reveals that the person has had the infection at some point of time.Bihar’s cumulative Covid-19 case count was 1,09,875, with 558 fatalities as on Tuesday. Of these, the six districts to be surveyed accounted for 18,765 cases.Arwal reported 1,068 Covid-19 cases with five deaths; Begusarai 4,304 cases and 13 deaths; Buxar 2,564 cases and seven deaths; Madhbani 3,300 cases and four deaths; Muzaffarpur 4,523 cases and 22 deaths and Purnia 3,006 cases with four deaths as on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/sero-survey-in-six-bihar-districts-from-aug-19/story-5iHMkUohe81Zo4iCsIkrmL.html
19-08-2020||Lucknow||UP will soon need post-Covid care clinics: Experts||While coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients are returning to normal life after being cured, experts fear that several of them may face long-term health issues, including shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and other disorders that can be cured only in post-Covid care clinics.While a few such clinics have recently come up in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh is yet to establish a centre where patients who have recovered from Covid-19 can be looked after.“Over one lakh patients have recovered from Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh and are at home, trying to catch up with normal life. However, very few realise that the three months after being discharged from the hospital are very important. Many patients can face post-Covid health issues, which need to be managed through proper medication,” said Dr Rakesh Kapoor, the director of Medanta Hospital, Lucknow. “Some recovered patients complain about discomfort in breathing, mental and physical fatigue, etc. For such patients, post-Covid care in post-Covid management clinics, like the ones set up in Delhi, is important,” added Kapoor, who is the former director of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS). Insisting that UP will also have to set up such clinics soon, Dr PK Gupta of Indian Medical Association said, “At post-Covid care clinics, recovered patients are given regular check-ups by cardiologists, chest specialists, psychologists, nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychiatrists and other specialists, as required for full recovery.” According to Dr Gupta, some patients will also require a CT scan of the lungs and other tests to ensure that they are completely rid of the virus. “Private hospitals must be roped in along with government facilities for this purpose. Private sector has doctors and trained paramedical staff to handle such patients.” “Post-Covid care is important as there have been cases wherein patients have reported a fall in oxygen levels, breathlessness and even psychological problems. In such cases, counselling and lung physiotherapy is required, which could be take place in post-Covid care clinics,” said professor Radha Krishna Dheeman, director, SGPGIMS. An official of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), who recovered from the infection around a fortnight ago, said, “Many things change after you get infected. I feel tired much quicker; for that I have been advised lung physiotherapy to expand my lung capacity, but I don’t know where to go. Perhaps a post-Covid care clinic would be helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-will-soon-need-post-covid-care-clinics-experts/story-LExhZ23HX4eykMemO8OXcK.html

He also stressed on making general public aware of such societies.Gehlot was addressing a review meeting of agriculture, cooperative and other departments on Tuesday.The chief minister also said that the benefit of the scheme of setting up an agro-processing unit to provide fair value to farmers and increase their income should be given to farmers on a priority basis.He said that this scheme will not only increase the income of farmers but also add value to crop and create new employment opportunities in the agriculture sector at the local level. Under this scheme, farmers can get a loan of up to Rs 1 crore for setting up agro-processing industries, on which a grant of up to 50 per cent will be given by the state government, a statement quoted Gehlot.The chief minister also gave directions to sanction Rs 250 crore from Farmers Welfare Fund for payment of insurance claims for the Rabi crop 2019-20.  He said that the process of recruitment of 1,000 posts in various cooperative institutions should be started soon.The chief minister has also decided to set up a State Level Monitoring Committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary to provide maximum benefit of the agricultural infrastructure fund started by the Government of India to the farmers through the purchase and sale cooperative societies of the state.In Rajasthan, a target has been set to allocate Rs 9,000 crore under this fund and the newly-formed committee will regularly monitor its implementation.The chief minister said that the medical sales centres of all the cooperative stores in the state will be made online.Principal Secretary of Agriculture and Cooperative Department Kunji Lal Meena said that the Cooperative Department has disbursed short term cooperative crop loan of Rs 9,541 crore to 21.86 lakh farmers in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/ashok-gehlot-directs-officials-to-check-frauds-by-credit-societies/story-riSidx4vRm6K6OGiZw1z6N.html
19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Five months on, Lahaul-Spiti gets its first Covid-19 testing machine||Shimla: Five months after the first Covid-19 case was reported in Himachal Pradesh, a Covid-19 testing machine was set up at the community health centre (CHC) at Kaza in the tribal district of Lahaul-Spiti on Tuesday. So far, samples were being sent to Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla, and local residents had to wait for days to get to know the results. At times, the district health officials had to take samples more than once. State technical education minister and the Lahaul-Spiti MLA Ram Lal Markanda had urged the district administration to get the TrueNat Quantitative Micro PCR worth Rs 14.56 lakh installed. Lahaul-Spiti, which has reported only six Covid patients so far, is the least populated district of the state. Sending samples from the district to IGMC, Shimla, was challenging for the administration as sometimes road traffic was disrupted due to bad weather. There was a possibility of samples getting wasted during transportation. Kaza sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Gian Singh Negi said that residents were concerned how samples would be sent to IGMC during the monsoon and later winter so the administration decided to install the Covid testing machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-months-on-lahaul-spiti-gets-its-first-covid-19-testing-machine/story-dyQpCPAQaz5cupRnpG2WwI.html
19-08-2020||Delhi||DMRC introduces smart card with auto top-up facility||In a bid to promote cashless transactions and ensure contactless travel especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has decided to switch to new smart cards with automatic top-up facility. The cards will be available to commuters once the Metro gets a go-ahead to resume its train operations. According to senior Metro officials, the smart cards will automatically be recharged at the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) entry gates with ₹200 whenever the balance reduces to under ₹100. For this, the DMRC has tied up with Autope, a mobile site specially developed for DMRC’s cashless transaction system, which will issue these smart cards. To avail the facilities, Metro users will have to download the Autope mobile application. They will have to register and link their bank / credit card / UPI account with the smart card. A DMRC official said that a nominal amount will be charged as a convenience fee from the customer for each transaction. Autope will auto-debit the topped up amount from the customer’s linked account the next working day.Mangu Singh, managing director, DMRC, said, “This initiative is in line with DMRC’s commitment towards supporting the digital drive to promote cashless transactions among Delhi Metro’s commuters. This new feature empowers a commuter to get his/her smart card auto topped up at AFC Gates across the network which will help him/her travel seamlessly without worrying about top ups from time to time”.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said that existing Metro smart card users can also avail the facility. “Those who have Metro smart cards will have to visit the customer care centre of any of the Metro stations three days after registering on the mobile application. They can get their smart cards activated for this facility as a one-time exercise.” The facility will be available from the day Metro operations resume. DMRC officials said that the new smart card will be home-delivered. Dayal said, “This new measure will eliminate the need to queue up at Metro stations for recharge. Currently, even when a smart card is recharged online, it has to be presented at Add Value Machines (AVMs) for the balance to be validated. But Autope will eliminate the need for AVM validation.”Anurag Bajpai and Pankaj Gambhir, founders of Autope, said, “The current Covid-19 situation has highlighted importance of contactless services and we remain committed to offering a full-scale and smart and hassle-free platform supported by innovative and scalable technology solutions to all our clients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dmrc-introduces-smart-card-with-auto-top-up-facility/story-LL3uhE38CgQyYOdjR4FB4K.html
19-08-2020||Delhi||A brick falling on a tray of eggs leads to murder in south Delhi||An altercation over a petty issue of a brick falling on a tray of eggs in a shop led to a fight between two groups, during which a 16-year-old boy was allegedly stabbed to death in front of his family members in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar on Tuesday. The alleged attacker, 22-year-old Farookh (who goes by his first name) fled the crime scene after stabbing the teenager, but was caught later in the evening. His interrogation led to the recovery of the bloodstained dagger that he had used to kill the teenager, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.The teenager lived with his parents and four siblings in Sangam Vihar. His father is an electrician. Since their house was being renovated, the family had rented a house in the neighbourhood.On Tuesday around 9am, the teenager, along with his father and brother, was stacking bricks outside a shop selling eggs, which belonged to their neighbour Taj Mohammad. One brick slipped from teen’s brother’s hand and fell on a tray of eggs, breaking five-six of them.“An argument started between the two groups, but it was resolved after some neighbours intervened and the teenager’s father said that he would compensate for the loss,” a police officer, who did not want to be named, said, quoting the First Information Report (FIR) registered on the complaint of the deceased teenager’s brother.Minutes later, the officer said, Mohammad’s son Farookh came by and started quarrelling with the teenager’s brother. The teenager intervened and pulled his brother away. That enraged Farookh, who took out a dagger and repeatedly stabbed the teenager before fleeing the crime scene, the officer added.The injured teenager was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The police has registered a case of murder. “Our teams scanned CCTV cameras in the area and caught the suspect and recovered the bloodstained dagger,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-brick-falling-on-a-tray-of-eggs-leads-to-murder-in-south-delhi/story-Bso51tDhgv2Ggx75OWuoQM.html

19-08-2020||Delhi||Incessant rains lash Delhi; waterlogging woes continue||Incessant rains lashed the national capital on Wednesday, submerging low-lying areas in knee-deep water and affecting traffic on key roads during morning rush hours. The India Meteorological Department issued an alert at 10:05 am for heavy rains in the national capital. Thunderstorms and moderate to heavy spell of rains are very likely to continue over the entire Delhi and adjoining areas over the next two hours, it said. The downpour may lead to “major traffic disruption” and there is an “increased chance” of road accidents, it warned. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said Delhi recorded light to moderate rains between 6 am and 8:30 am, thereafter the intensity increased. Heavy rains are very likely as the day progresses, he said. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 7.4 mm rains till 8:30 am. The Lodhi Road, Ridge and Ayanagar weather stations gauged 9.2, 8.2 and 2.8 mm precipitation. Rainfall recorded below 15 mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate and above 64.5 mm is heavy. Vehicles moved bumper to bumper during the morning rush hours, as the downpour led to heavy waterlogging at key road stretches. Pictures and videos of vehicles and people wading through waist-deep water were widely shared on social media. Srivastava said the axis of monsoon will remain close to the national capital till Thursday. Therefore, more rains are likely. Southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and southeasterly winds from the Bay of Bengal are also feeding moisture to the region, he said. The downpour is expected to reduce the rain deficiency in the capital. The Safdarjung Observatory has recorded 139.2 mm rainfall against the normal of 157.1 mm in August so far, a deficiency of 11 per cent. Overall, it has recorded 457.8 mm rainfall, six per cent more than the normal of 433.2 mm since June 1 when the monsoon season starts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/incessant-rains-lash-delhi-waterlogging-woes-continue/story-zINf9FFmMqsS9FxlsIQGkK.html

19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Rising water level in Pareechu river from China puts Himachal Pradesh on alert||Shimla: The rising water level in the Pareechu river, which meanders through the mountains of China-occupied Tibetan Autonomous Region before entering India, has the Himachal Pradesh government on alert. Pareechu is a tributary of the Spiti river that merges with the Sutlej at Khab, a village in tribal Kinnaur district of the hill state. “Water in the river has been rising consistently due to clear weather in the mountains which has accelerated glacial melting. We are keeping a close watch but there is no immediate threat. We have apprised the state government,” says Somesh Kumar, the executive engineer of the Central Water Commission. The flow of the Pareechu is recorded at a station at Zada in China, while the Central Water Commission has set up two stations at Chumar near Leh and Sumdoh in Lahaul and Spiti, where the Sutlej confluences with the main tributary of the Spiti river. Water flow is also monitored at Khab, where a dam is built on the Sutlej to generate 1,500 megawatt electricity for the Nathpa-Jhakri project. The Pareechu originates in India, meanders through the mountainous terrain in China-occupied Tibet and then merges into the Sutlej near Samdoh in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh. LAKE CREATED HAVOC IN 2004 A glacial lake was formed in 2004 after a landslide in the Tibetan Himalayas on the banks of the Pareechu, causing water to build up into an artificial lake spread over 200 hectares and 60 metres deep. The lake formed behind the landslide dam burst on June 26, 2005. Gushing waters washed away the strategic Hindustan-Tibet road and National Highway-22 at a number of places. It swept away 10 bridges and 11 ropeways. Fifteen bridges and eight roads and footbridges were damaged on the 10-km stretch of NH-22 between Wangtoo in Kinnaur and Samdoh in Lahaul-Spiti. No loss of life was reported as the army and civil authorities had evacuated 5,000 people along the Sutlej, anticipating the breach of the lake. The flooding had caused a loss of Rs 800 crore. After the 2005 flooding, India and China signed a protocol for sharing information on the water level from the Pareechu. The lakes in the catchment area of the Pareechu are regularly monitored by the Himachal government’s State Centre in Climate Change (SCCC) by using satellite data. Last month, scientists had detected two landslides using satellite imagery but ruled out the possibility of flooding at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rising-water-level-in-pareechu-river-from-china-puts-himachal-pradesh-on-alert/story-3Jpt7rs1UxxFesXjcLwI3N.html

19-08-2020||Chandigarh||Centre talks of keeping SYL canal ready as Punjab, Haryana stick to their stands||Even as Punjab and Haryana stuck to their “stated positions” on the contentious Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday said the SYL could be completed and kept ready while discussions on water sharing continue and the final formula could be decided later. The Union minister’s view was reflected in an official statement issued by the Punjab government after his meeting with the state’s chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Shekhawat and Khattar were present in Delhi whereas Amarinder joined the meeting through video conference. “Detailed discussion was held in a positive and cordial atmosphere. Both chief ministers expressed their views in the first round of talks. Another meeting will be held in a week or so to take things forward,” Shekhawat told reporters after the meeting, adding that the logjam between the two states has been broken. The central minister convened the meeting with the two chief ministers to work out a solution for implementation of Supreme Court’s January 15, 2002, and June 4, 2004, orders to complete the remaining portion of the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. The meeting was called on the directions of the apex court which, during a hearing on July 28, directed that the chief ministers of the two states “meet to find out the solution if any, else there is a decree which has to be executed”. The sharing of the Ravi-Beas waters has been a bone of contention between Punjab and Haryana for decades. While Haryana has been seeking its “rightful” share, successive Punjab governments have refused to share water and complete the SYL canal, which was to carry the former’s share of water, stating that it has not water to spare. During the video conference, Amarinder reiterated the need for a tribunal to make a fresh time-bound assessment of the water availability, even as he sought complete share of water for his state from the total resource available, including from Yamuna. Besides asking the Centre to look at the “emotive” canal issue from the national security perspective, he suggested that Rajasthan be involved in discussions on the SYL canal/Ravi-Beas waters as it was also a stakeholder. Construction of SYL canal has absolutely no connection with sharing of water between the states… The canal must be completed as per decree of the Supreme Court. Not doing so is gross injustice to the people of water- deprived areas of Haryana Khattar, on the other hand, said that completion of the SYL canal by Punjab and availability of water were entirely different issues. “We are open for dialogue and discussion on the subject but with a clear stipulation and condition that construction of SYL must be completed as per decree of the Supreme Court at the earliest. Not doing so is gross injustice to the people of water deprived areas of Haryana,’’ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-talks-of-keeping-syl-canal-ready-as-punjab-haryana-stick-to-their-stands/story-DHdXIgiscMzBj6gAMoxz3L.html
19-08-2020||Mumbai||Social worker, booked for obstructing shelter for migrant workers, granted anticipatory bail by Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court (HC) on Monday granted anticipatory bail to a social worker booked for obstructing revenue officers from creating a temporary shelter for migrant workers at a school in Shirur village, Thane district, on the condition that he will contribute ₹50,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Social worker Farukh Sattar Dalvi had moved the HC after Kasara police booked him under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for obstructing the tehsildar from creating a temporary shelter for 80 migrant labourers who had walked from the Vasai-Virar to their hometowns.On April 5, 2020, the tehsildar of Shahapur and some other revenue staff were making preparations to create a temporary shelter at the school in Shirur, when Dalvi, along with several other persons, reached the spot and opposed the move.The tehsildar alleged that Dalvi verbally abused and threatened her with dire consequences if they continued with the work, and so she was forced to file a police complaint against him.The social worker had moved the high court after the district court rejected his anticipatory bail plea. He told the HC that he was apprehensive about the possible threat of exposure to the villagers from the migrant workers.“It is no doubt true that the applicant has attempted to deter the complainant from discharging her duty and, particularly when he considers himself to be a social worker, it was rather imperative on his part to assist the government agency in securing shelter for the migrants,” justice Bharati Dangre said.The judge, however, accepted that Dalvi acted on his genuine concern for the villagers and added that, “as a responsible person and a social worker, he must contribute an amount of ₹50,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to aid the state government which is grappling with an unpredicted situation and coping with a grim and stressful scenario.”The HC has granted him bail on a personal bond of ₹25,000, on the condition that he will cooperate with the investigation and visit Kasara police station on September 2, 3 and 4. He is supposed to submit the receipt of deposit made to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund when he visits the police station on September 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-worker-booked-for-obstructing-shelter-for-migrant-workers-granted-anticipatory-bail-by-bombay-hc/story-1ALaquq9XVuj6C30Cq3ivI.html
19-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Living room of the pigeons||The house is quiet — well, almost. The late afternoon sky is glowing with brilliant sunshine. The balcony is framed by a leaf-heavy kachnar tree. The mistress of this elegant Nizamuddin East apartment in central Delhi is presently enjoying an afternoon nap, while her cook in the kitchen listens to romantic Mohammed Rafi songs on his mobile phone. The volume is low, as if it weren’t a famous playback singer but a gentle father lulling his child to sleep.Neither the mistress nor the cook immediately find out that a pigeon is trapped inside the drawing room, trying to find its way back to the great outdoors. The hapless creature is gliding about the book-lined walls like a shaky plane in massive turbulence, struggling to find a safe spot for emergency landing.The bird flaps its wings repeatedly, as if in distress. The cook enters the room to check what the fuss is about. His gaze follows the haphazard movements of the bird, who is now circling about the ceiling, close to the fan. The cook shakes his head resignedly, as if he has seen this movie too many times. Even so, he comes to the rescue, and opens wide the door to the balcony. The bird quickly escapes, and the cook lets the door remain open—just in case there might be other birds trapped inside, he explains. The sunlight swiftly streams inside the book-filled drawing room, spreading up to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s classic Asar-al-Sanadid, while Vikram Seth’s An Equal Music remains coolly shaded. A thick hardbound of Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy is lying half-opened on the divan. Soon afterwards, another pigeon now flies in, propping itself atop a bookshelf, directly above — believe it or not — The Book of Indian Birds by Salim Ali. The new bird putters about and plunges down towards a settee, finally landing on the Kashmiri carpet.This bird is bolder than the earlier one, and seems unmindful of the much-treasured Sadequain painting hanging just behind the blue sofa. Now it’s joined by another bird, and together they roam around fearlessly, as though they had established that it was their own drawing room.The pair finally flies outside as the evening sun starts to burn golden bright.Not long after, the mistress appears on the scene sleepily, muttering affectionate words about “these foolish kabutar who happily come inside the house but don’t know how to get out.” She shakes the curtains one by one to check for other birds, possibly hiding in fright. Finally, she asks the cook to provide her with chai and butter-toast. The lady now settles down on the sofa with her mobile, her feet on the coffee table, as though by banishing the birds she had again rightly claimed back her undisputed ownership of the drawing room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-living-room-of-the-pigeons/story-NDCK3BEgSm7JjSU08pxAGK.html
19-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC restrains Emami from using ‘Glow and Handsome’ mark||Reiterating that the Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) was prima facie the prior adopter of the mark ‘Glow and Handsome,’ the Bombay high court (HC) temporarily restrained Emami Ltd from using the same trade mark for grooming and skincare products until further orders. The court also observed that the order would, however, not restrain Emami from gaining a similar order in the suit it filed in the Calcutta HC. The single bench of justice SC Gupte was hearing the interim application in a commercial suit filed by HUL – seeking a restraint on Emami from using the trademark ‘Glow and Handsome’. The counsels for HUL submitted that the mark was adopted by the company in September 2018 and it also applied for permission from the Food and Drug Administration to change the mark ‘Fair and Lovely’ to ‘Glow and Handsome’, which was granted on August 2 this year. The counsels further submitted that in July this year, HUL announced its decision to change the mark and also submitted details of the sales of its products under the new trademark as well as the expenditure it incurred for the promotion of the new trademark. Senior counsel Virag Tulzapurkar and advocate Hiren Kamod for HUL submitted that as Emami was in process of launching products under the trademark on August 17 or 18 and announced its intentions on July 27, the application seeking an interim injunction restrained Emami from using the trademark “Glow and Handsome”. Senior advocate Jishnu Saha for Emami opposed the application and said that it had been marketing skin care products under the trademark “Fair and Handsome” and if HUL was allowed to use the trademark “Glow and Handsome” for a similar product it would infringe their registered trademark. He also submitted that Emami had adopted the mark before and applied for its registration on June 25. He added that Emami moved an application against HUL before the Calcutta HC related to the use of the trademark in question, and did not obtain any interim order therein. Saha further submitted that if HUL was allowed to market its products under the “Glow and Handsome” mark, there was a concrete likelihood of confusion and deception in the public, if identical marks are allowed to hold the field for popular and much sold commodities. After hearing the submissions, the court noted that HUL’s action was an action in passing off, since it did not hold the registration of the trademark “Glow & Handsome”. The court then said that as Emami did not introduce its products into the market under its proposed trademark “Glow & Handsome”, it deserved to be restrained from doing so and passed an ad-interim injunction restraining Emami from using the alleged mark till the final disposal of the suit. The court while directing Emami to file its reply to the application within two weeks said, “It is made clear that this order shall not in any manner come in the way of the defendant (Emami) claiming in its own suit in Calcutta high court a restraint order against the plaintiff’s (HUL) use of the trademark “Glow & Handsome”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-restrains-emami-from-using-glow-and-handsome-mark/story-TILMcGO7z7YywZtGF8W0PN.html
19-08-2020||City||Kharegaon RoB to open by January: Thane civic body||Come January, the Kharegaon rail overbridge (RoB) will finally be ready for use, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) on Tuesday. The work for the bridge was delayed for almost a decade. After the bridge is constructed, the railway crossing used by motorists and pedestrians to travel between Kalwa east and west will be closed. Many people were hit by trains in the past while crossing the bridge. TMC executive engineer Pravin Papalkar said, “For two months during the lockdown, the construction work was stopped. We have resumed it now and only the work of installing the slabs is remaining. We are in the process of placing girders for this slab and shall complete the work by January 2021 and open the bridge for the citizens. After the bridge is constructed, we will close the railway crossing.” Constructed at a budget of Rs27 crore, the work for the RoB has been undertaken jointly by the railways and TMC. While the railways had completed the work of laying the girder over the tracks a year ago, the corporation started the work for the bridge in January 2018. The bridge will be 692.27m long, of which 625.83m will be constructed by the corporation. The budget will also be shared by both railway and TMC. For the convenience of pedestrians and motorists, the bridge will have a ramp as well as a staircase. Nandkumar Deshmukh, president of Thane Railway Passengers’ Association, said, “We have been demanding the RoB since many years. We have also written letters seeking an explanation on the delay. Many pedestrians cross the tracks during peak hours even if the gates are closed, leading to several deaths. More than 50,000 residents staying in Kalwa cross the track on a daily basis. In the past few years, the population in the vicinity has increased, making it necessary for the RoB to be constructed to avoid more deaths in the future.” The ground where the proposed bridge would land would have to be split into two, which the locals were not keen on. Hence, the civic body made some alterations to the plan and ensured that the ground is not affected. Similarly, one part of the land where the bridge is to come up, was owned by a firm and the matter was sub judice for many years, adding to the delay. The civic body has now paid compensation of Rs40 crore to the private company and taken over the land. Shrikant Shinde, Shiv Sena parliamentarian from Kalyan, said, “We held various meetings with the corporation, railway authorities and locals to resolve the multiple hindrances that caused the delay. Eventually, the work had started but the lockdown led to further delay. Otherwise, by now the bridge would have been opened to locals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharegaon-rob-to-open-by-january-thane-civic-body/story-ZzfK1PhRiGEiLjGBoMb1pO.html
19-08-2020||City||5 arrested for attacking youth with hockey stick, knives at Navi Mumbai||Days after a Pune family moved to Koparkhairane because they opposed their teenage daughter’s friendship to a 22-year-old man, the youth with his four other friends, armed with knives and a hockey stick, went to the girl’s new home at Navi Mumbai and attacked her brother outside their home. The police have nabbed the five accused. The girl’s brother has sustained minor injuries in the attack. According to the police, the main accused, Avinash Khatape, wanted to marry the minor girl but her family opposed the alliance. The girl’s family then moved from Pune around three days ago. An officer from Koparkhairane police station said, “After knowing about the girl’s whereabouts, he and his four friends reached Koparkhairane on Sunday to threaten the minor’s family. The five had a hockey stick and knives and attacked the girl’s brother.” The police received a call from the control room, following which constables Sainath Sonawane, Mahesh Gawde, Mukinda Solankar and Sachin Dalvi reached the spot at Sector 11 but by then the accused fled the area. “A crowd had gathered there. One of the persons managed to see the partial number of the accused’s van. We immediately left on the patrolling bikes to chase them,” said Sonawane. The five drove towards the Thane-Belapur Road. Along the way, with inputs from autorickshaw drivers and roadside shops, the police chased the car towards Dighe in Navi Mumbai for close to 8 kilometres and cornered the accused near Rabale MIDC area. The men then left the van and ran but the constables nabbed them from the forest area. The police recovered the hockey stick and three knives from their possession and seized the van. The other accused were identified as Sumit Shinde, 19; Bharat Parte, 22; Anil Pilane, 22, and Sandip Dardige, 23. All the five are arrested for rioting and assault along with other sections of the Indian Arms Act. They have been remanded in judicial custody. All the accused are unemployed, said the police.

19-08-2020||Mumbai||BJP used social media to spread religious hatred: Shiv Sena||The ruling Shiv Sena, which is part of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, on Tuesday, launched into ally-turned-rival the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and alleged that the party benefitted the most electorally using social media and gained politically by spreading religious hatred since it assumed power at the Centre in 2014.An editorial in Saamana, the party mouthpiece, referred to a news report published in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14 that took a dig at Facebook’s India operations for turning a blind eye to hate speech by a BJP elected representative and three other “Hindu nationalist individuals and groups” in a bid not to hurt the social media company’s lucrative business prospects in its biggest market.The editorial in the Marathi daily said that social media platforms can be used to voice opinions but “if it is used to spread hatred to divide the country, then action should be taken against those without thinking about which party they belong to. Facebook cannot turn a blind eye to the person spreading hatred because he is from the ruling party.” It exhorted foreign companies to abide by Indian laws.The BJP leader cited in the WSJ report is T Raja Singh, the lone party member of the Telangana legislative assembly (MLA), who is known for his provocative social media posts against Muslims and dabbling in divisive and rabble-rousing politics.“It is alright to have a difference of opinion on platforms such as Facebook… However, the social media company [Facebook] is not a platform to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims,” it said.“Instead of connecting society, social media is used to spread hatred. Today, countless new age Goebbels have their own law, judicial process, prison. Social media is on the payrolls of political parties. In 2014, the social media army had made a big contribution because of which the BJP had won the election under the leadership of [Narendra] Modi,” it said.“In the last seven years, truth is being twisted and falsehood is being openly propagated. Rumours and hatred against religion are being spread for political gains,” it added.The editorial pointed out that social media was full of jokes and memes about former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh until not too long ago, but now the same platform has turned on the heat on PM Modi and ex-Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, which is “tragic”.Keshav Upadhye, BJP’s chief spokesperson, Maharashtra, dismissed the allegation that the party has gained electorally because of its divisive politics. He described Sena’s charges as “laughable”.“Such claims made by the Congress or the Shiv Sena are baseless. It is far from reality. Before last year’s parliamentary elections, over 700 [Facebook] pages, which had right-wing propaganda, were banned. Today, too, materials written against Modiji are available on Facebook. The BJP has not benefitted electorally in any way,” Upadhye rebutted.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had also taken a swipe at the BJP over the WSJ report.“BJP and RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) control Facebook & WhatsApp in India. They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate. Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook,” Gandhi had tweeted on Sunday, two days after WSJ had published the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-used-social-media-to-spread-religious-hatred-shiv-sena/story-HpDf7dbtuRRaC2eJQKVnyI.html

If it is noticed during the treatment by the government-run hospital doctors that Wadhawan would need to be treated at a private hospital, then he could be shifted there. However, the hospital’s administrative and jail authorities’ advice will be required before he can be shifted to a private hospital,” said PP Rajvaidy, judge, special PMLA court.Wadhawan and his son Sarang have been booked by the Mumbai Police’s economic offence wing (EOW) after they had defaulted on the repayment of a loan taken from the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC).The bank had run into acute financial troubles, as HDIL had 73% of the financial institution’s total loan exposure of Rs 8,300, which works out to around Rs 6,226 crore.They had allegedly conspired with bank officials to secure the loan without security.Soon after the EOW case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also had initiated a separate probe into money laundering allegations against the Wadhawans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-case-shift-hdil-s-rakesh-wadhawan-to-govt-hospital-says-pmla-court/story-Po6RDe3T97Zn7ESwf57QBL.html
19-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows MMRDA to cut 86 mangroves for Metro Line-2B||The Bombay high court (HC) has allowed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to cut 86 mangroves in Parigachi Khadi for the construction of six piers of the Mumbai Metro Line-2B, which connects DN Nagar in Andheri to Mandale. MMRDA has pledged to plant 4,400 mangroves and deposited the amount required for compensatory afforestation.“We are convinced that Metro Line-2B project is carried out in public interest,” said a bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar last week while giving the go-ahead.The bench took into consideration the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority’s November 2018 clearance for the construction in the mangroves forest and the Union environment ministry’s approval for it in January.MMRDA moved the court after the latter in September 2018 held that mangroves cannot be permitted to be destructed unless the work is necessary for the public good or is in the public interest. It said about 111 square metres of forest land were permanently required for the construction of the six piers. About 1,860 square metres area around the piers was needed temporarily to enable their construction.MMRDA assured the court it will restore the temporary area to its original condition once the construction is completed, and abide by the Union ministry’s conditions for approving the proposal.Mumbai Metro Line-2B is a 23.64 km long elevated corridor which will have 22 stations. The corridor will reduce travel time between the eastern and western suburbs by 40 to 55 minutes. It will result in a 30 to 35℅ consequent reduction in vehicular traffic.MMRDA has argued that apart from providing eco-friendly transportation, the Metro Rail project is also expected to reduce emission, improve traffic conditions in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and save precious fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-mmrda-to-cut-86-mangroves-for-metro-line-2b/story-n2hYtIidj8HvV69tV8Ge4O.html

19-08-2020||Mumbai||JEE-Mains in September: 6-ft space between candidates is must||A day after the Supreme Court refused to further postpone the entrance examinations for admissions to undergraduate engineering and medical courses, the National Testing Agency (NTA) released the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for more than 9 lakh engineering aspirants, slated to appear for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Mains Paper 2 between September 1 and 6. The guidelines released by the national exam organising body requires that a 6-feet distance be maintained at all times between students. Candidates will also have to mandatorily wash and sanitise their hands before entering the examination centre. “Before the start of each shift, and after the last shift ends, candidates’ seating will be thoroughly sanitised, including the work station, keyboard, seat etc will be disinfected. Hand sanitisers will be available at the entrance of the examination centre and inside the exam hall at all times,” stated the SOP released by NTA. It further stated that the usual process of checking the admit cards of candidates will be replaced with barcode readers, which will be made available to the examination centre authorities. While all the candidates will be asked to go to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they enter the centre, they will have to use the masks provided by the examination authority. “Each candidate will be offered a 3-ply mask at the time of entry and expected to wear the same during the examination in order to avoid any form of unfair means at the time of examination,” stated the SOP, adding that each candidate will also be provided with separate rough sheets on their desks at the examination centre. NTA has further clarified that no eligible student will be denied permission to appear for the examination until the aspirant violates the Covid-19 directives/advisories given by the Centre. Candidates and parents, however, are worried if students who have tested positive for Covid-19 will also be allowed to appear for the exam. “NTA needs to clarify this in order to avoid any trouble in the future,” said a candidate. Based on the results of the JEE-Mains Paper 1 and Paper 2, the top 2.45 lakh candidates will be eligible to appear for the JEE-Advanced exam, which is a one-stop exam to get admission into the 23 premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

19-08-2020||Mumbai||1 dead, 1 injured after portion of Mumbai building collapses||One person died and another was injured after a portion of a vacated, two-storey building in Bandra (West), collapsed on Monday. The incident took place around 8.30pm. Mumbai Fire brigade rescued two persons who were trapped in the debris. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is yet to determine the legality of the structure. Debris was being cleared from the crash site at the time of going to print. According to BMC’s disaster management cell, around 8.30pm on Monday, one wing of the ground-plus-two storey Bharti Building collapsed on the compound wall of the neighbouring, four-storeyed Hardik Villa. Bharti Building has been empty for more than 20 years, said locals. Emergency responders were immediately sent to the site of the level-3 collapse. The deceased has been identified as Bruce D’Penha, 41, who was rescued and taken to Lilavati Hospital on Monday night. He succumbed to his injuries on Tuesday morning. D’Penha had been visiting an electronic repair on the ground floor of Hardik Villa. Arjun Pandit, 22, has sustained a head injury and is being treated at Bhabha Hospital. D’Penha had taken his laptop to be repaired at a shop on the ground floor of Hardik Villa. The proprietor of the shop Zeeshan Shaikh said D’Penha had been in the shop’s reception area. “He [D’Penha] had no chance to escape as it was a sudden crash. We were stuck inside the shop. The fire brigade and locals somehow managed to remove us,” Shaikh added. Hardik Villa was vacated after it sustained damage to its compound wall and ground floor. Some cars parked in its compound were also damaged. Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner of H (West) ward, said, “The debris is still being removed and we have allowed residents from Hardik Villa to go back to their homes for now. We will soon hold a meeting with building proposals department to get details of Bharti building. So far, we only know that it was a legal structure but thorough information can be only be given after inquiring the matter.” According to civic officials, Bharti Building was constructed in 1992 and Hardik Villa was constructed in the early 1980s. Sadiq Rizvi, a resident of a nearby building, said, “This structure [Bharti Building] was standing vacant for the past 20 years and none of the authorities have taken notice. The structure had become dangerous and BMC should have demolished the building long ago. This collapse could have caused major damage and casualties.” Meanwhile, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray visited the crash site on Tuesday. “This morning I visited the site of the crashed building and reviewed the ongoing relief work. I have suggested providing financial help from state government to the family of the deceased. Other injured person is getting treated in the hospital. Two persons were injured in the accident, one of whom died tragically,” Thackeray tweeted.Congress legislator Zeeshan Siddique said, “I have requested a thorough inquiry into the matter. The demolition of this building, provided no one was staying in the building, should have taken place before such an untoward incident happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-dead-1-injured-after-portion-of-mumbai-building-collapses/story-32ZYekK8Bs8mtiaM05kuAJ.html

19-08-2020||City||Small farmers seek support from government to deal with stubble burning||BLURB/ STRAP Allege small farmers are being ignored and big farmers are taking advantage of govt’s cash subsidy schemes  Some farmers have raised objection over the government’s policy of providing direct subsidy on machines being used for management of crop waste, saying the schemes are designed to benefit rich farmers with larger land holdings. During a virtual state-level seminar attended by farmers from all districts of the state, most farmers said the government’s scheme was not beneficial for small and marginal farmers as most machines were purchased by rich farmers. They said the machines purchased by farmers’ societies under the Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) schemes with hefty subsidies upto 80% were also beyond the reach of small farmers. “Heavy machines like the super seeder are being provided by the government but these machines are beyond the reach of small farmers as a 75HP tractor is needed to run big machines”, said a farmer from Karnal. A farmer from Nuh district said most machines and subsidies were meant for farmers who burn crop waste. “The government should introduce schemes for farmers who do not burn crop waste and harvest the crop manually,” he said. A farmer from Yamunanagar said the government should check CHCs as they do not help small farmers and rent the machines as per their whims. Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department director general VS Dahiya said that they have noted the suggestions of the farmers and efforts will be made to ensure that all farmers benefits from government schemes and shun the practice of stubble burning. He said as many as 2,089 CHCs had been set up in the state and 820 new CHCs will also be set up to eradicate the practice of burning crop waste in the coming Kharif harvesting season. Need to make crop waste profitable, says JP Dalal Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal said farmers should earn from crop waste to increase their income. He urged agricultural scientists to conduct research so that crop waste can be made profitable for the farmers. Dalal also urged the farmers to take advantage of government schemes. Responding to a question, Dalal said the BJP will win the Baroda bypoll with a considerable margin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/small-farmers-seek-support-from-government-to-deal-with-stubble-burning/story-3beGntecsbJH5Pn3xPN97M.html

19-08-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena MP writes to state home minister, demands action against Arnab Goswami||Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant on Tuesday wrote to home minister Anil Deshmukh demanding action against Republic TV editor Arnab Goswami for allegedly naming a Maharashtra cabinet minister in connection with the Sushant Singh Rajput case without any evidence and violating the norms of the Press Council of India.  Goswami did not respond to HT’s texts till the time of going to press. The former Union minister in his letter said that Goswami’s reference to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is “aggravating”. The South Mumbai MP alleged that Goswami, for the interest of a few people, was spreading false news. The news channels have named Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his son and minister Aaditya Thackeray in connection with Rajput’s suicide. “Under the garb of journalism, Mr Arnab Goswami, chief editor of Hindi news channel Republic Bharat and English news channel Republic TV, is constantly airing news irresponsibly. Without any evidence, the news channels and its chief editor Arnab Goswami have been levelling allegations on Maharashtra Cabinet minister,” he alleged in the letter. The Sena deputy leader alleged that in the past too, Goswami, while presenting news, had spoken in a derogatory manner against politicians and opposition leaders, for which cases have been lodged against him. Speaking to TV channels on Tuesday, Sawant said there is a new fad of “media trial” and said guidelines of the Press Council of India and code have to be followed while reporting about an ongoing case. “Recently, it is seen channels decide the accused, name some people, and indulge in character assassination. The body language and the manner in which this is done is so disrespectful. It came to a point where Maharashtra Chief Minister was singularly named. Such language is aggravating. This is not just disrespecting the person but the insult of the entire state, because he is the CM of this state. I have asked the home minister to take cognisance of this. They think nobody will question them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-mp-writes-to-state-home-minister-demands-action-against-arnab-goswami/story-toZaajDmXeuH9o09zfPDjI.html

The construction, if any, being done at the property has also been stayed.The July 8 plea had claimed that Singh never sold the 50% share of the property to a woman named Pritam Kaur. However, a fresh affidavit filed by Singh says that he has sold his share of property to the woman and that he had authorized none to file the July 8 plea. When the lawyer appearing in the July 8 petition was questioned, he told the court that the matter was brought to him by another lawyer and all requisite permissions to file the plea were obtained on mail, a fact denied by Singh in his latest plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-property-case-nri-alleges-impersonation-ut-top-law-officer-roped-in-for-probe/story-jlUno6C5aDJ5rWDthGD76L.html

The economists, in a video interaction with the CM on Tuesday, also suggested several measures for economic revival that included concessions for various sectors.The ongoing financial crisis has already led the state government to declare a 67% cut in its spending for developmental works this fiscal year. To revive the economic situation, Thackeray had called for the interaction with various economists and scientists associated with Pune International Centre.Deepak Parekh, chairman, HDFC, who also participated in the interaction, said that it is necessary to provide concessions in taxes and other charges for revival of the real estate sector. He said the sector should be given three months waiver from stamp duty; ready reckoner rates should be changed, and charges against of use of a plot should be reduced considering the current situation.Parekh further suggested that all taxes should be recovered only after completion of a housing project. Ajit Ranade, economist, said that the Maha Mumbai Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Raigad should be revived by bringing in fresh projects. He said that robotics, telemedicine, information and technology (IT) and export-oriented projects can be set up on the 5,000-acre plot acquired for SEZ. He said the state has also acquired 10,000 acre of land for the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (Mihan), and similar kinds of initiatives can be taken to bring new projects there too.Another economist, Vijay Kelkar suggested that the Nanar refinery project should be started which will bring jobs for 1 lakh people and an investment of Rs 3 lakh crore. He said that the Chembur refinery project can also be shifted from Mumbai and the plot can be properly developed.Responding to the suggestions, Thackeray asked for a time-bound action plan from the economists that will be prepared after further discussions with senior officials. The chief minister said that there should be complete transparency while bringing in any new projects. There should be a dialogue with locals and the state over the project. Thackeray said he did not believe in development that requires force, responding to the suggestion to start the Nanar refinery project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-action-plan-from-economists-scientists-to-revive-maharashtra-economy/story-x8segTBwHe92bNKFYX0IZM.html
19-08-2020||Delhi||ADB approves $1 billion package for Delhi-Meerut rapid rail project||In a big push for the high-speed Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor between Delhi and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $1 billion loan for the venture, officials of the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC), the entity executing the project, said on Tuesday. Civil construction work for the project, which aims at providing a high-speed rail link between Delhi and Meerut to cut down on travel time and boost housing in NCR towns and cities to ease pressure on the national capital, is on in full swing over a 50km stretch between Sahibabad in Ghaziabad and Shatabdipuram in Meerut. The 82-km corridor that will connect Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut will have with a total of 24 stations -- 21 in Uttar Pradesh and the rest in Delhi. According to officials, the detailed project report states that about eight lakh passengers will board the high-speed RRTS trains, which will run at 180kmph, for long and short-distance commuting every day. Commuting time between Delhi and Meerut is expected to reduce drastically — from around 120 minutes at present to 55 minutes once the line is commissioned. The Delhi-Meerut expressway is another project aimed at improving connectivity between Delhi, Meerut and other western UP towns.“The approval of the $1.049 billion funding package by ADB for the high-speed, high-capacity Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS reflects upon the funding agency’s trust in the project that promises to transform regional mobility besides giving push to polycentric economic development across the region and will lead to improvement in the quality of life of the citizens,” Vinay Kumar Singh, managing director of NCRTC said in a statement. “Efficient and integrated transport solutions are critical for managing the rapid urbanisation and ensuring balanced urban development of the region,” ADB’s principal transport specialist, Sharad Saxena, said in statement. “This project will provide safe, reliable and seamless travel between Delhi and other cities and pave the way for a paradigm shift in mobility across the NCR,” he said. The cost of the RRTS project is pegged at Rs 30,274 crore. The project will involve loans to the tune of about Rs 14,000-15,000 crore from external sources while the rest will come from the Centre and the state governments (UP and Delhi) involved, besides Rs 270 crore from the private sector, officials associated with the project said. “A total loan of about $2.049 billion will come from three sources and will amount to $1.049 billion and two other parts of $500 million each. ADB’s approval will give a major boost to the project. Civil construction tenders for the 50km stretch from Sahibabad to Shatabdipuram have been already awarded and construction activities are on. Tenders for rolling stock was awarded earlier. The rest of the tenders are in different stages,” said Sudhir Sharma, chief PRO of NCRTC. The NCRTC has first identified a priority stretch of 17km in Ghaziabad (Sahibabad to Duhai) for which work had started in the first phase. Work has also begun for another 33km from Duhai to Shatabdipuram in Meerut. The priority section is scheduled for commissioning in March, 2023, while the entire 82-km corridor from Delhi to Meerut is expected to be open by March 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/adb-approves-1-billion-package-for-delhi-meerut-rapid-rail-project/story-Lm80ShRwf3QWgib7MePSWN.html

The plea said Rs 181 crore under the same head for the second quarter is also due.On Tuesday, advocate Satyakam, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, told the court that it had not received over Rs 10,000 crore from the Centre as its share of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection and hence the government had not been able to release money to the civic bodies.Following this, the court said that a meeting between all stakeholders should be convened to discuss all the issues, especially the financial aspect. The matter would be now heard on September 8.In its plea filed through advocate Mini Pushkarna, the north corporation said the funding was meant for payment of salaries of sanitation activities.In its application, the north corporation has said expenses towards salaries till May 2020, sanitation services and providing PPE kits, gloves, masks, sanitizers to the workers, had been incurred by the corporation from its own internal resources, in the absence of any amount being released by the Delhi government.The application has been filed in a pending writ petition by one Rahul Birla seeking directions to the Delhi government and the municipal corporations to pay salaries to sanitation workers with arrears.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-asks-state-centre-and-civic-bodies-to-sit-together-and-sort-out-financial-issues/story-fDgMCslZhDMDCVlWA8UlkK.html

The BJP is scared of getting exposed now and that is why the central government did not let public prosecutors of the Delhi government argue on riot-related cases and instead appointed their own lawyers,” AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said in a press conference at the party head office in central Delhi.He said, “Several leaders of the BJP were creating tension among Hindus on the one hand, and, on the other, they were provoking Muslims protesting (against the amended citizenship law) in Shaheen Bagh. The BJP’s role stands exposed now after around 50 individuals of Shaheen Bagh associated with the protest recently joined the party. All these individuals should be probed – what roles they had in the protests, who they took instructions from and who were the top BJP leaders they were in touch with.”On Monday, Bharadwaj had alleged that the Shaheen Bagh protests were “pre-planned, scripted and strategised” by the BJP to win more seats in the February 8 Delhi Assembly elections. His remarks came after the BJP announcing on Sunday that around 50 Muslim residents of Shaheen Bagh had joined the party.Reacting to AAP’s latest charges, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “They are making an issue out of nothing. They are doing this as they fear of losing their support base of the Muslim community, which has come out in support of the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-provoked-people-in-north-east-delhi-aap/story-LLRU86ITBwPFF9mPTzMhTI.html

19-08-2020||Delhi||No digging of roads in Delhi till monsoon ends||Alarmed by incidents of heavy water logging across Delhi after short spells of rain, the municipal corporations and the public works department have decided not to permit any road-digging work till the monsoon season is over. Many agencies such as telecom companies, discoms and the Delhi Jal Board often have to dig up roads to lay or repair wires, sewer lines or water pipelines. According to municipal officials, digging of roads was one of the main reasons behind water logging and road cave-ins during the rainy season. Only crucial work may be permitted in special circumstances, they said.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said digging work by different agencies on municipal and PWD roads to lay or repair sewer lines, water pipelines, telephone cables and electric wires often lead to water logging during the rains.“Apart from clogged drains, road cutting was a major cause of water logging. Many a time, it is seen that the agency concerned, be it any discom or telecommunications company, does not properly repair the dug-up portion, which not only leads to accumulation of water but enhances the threat of road cave-in. As a precautionary measure, we have decided not to permit any road-cutting during monsoon. An order to this effect has been circulated,” he said.The mayor said in special circumstances, only works that are of “utmost importance” would be allowed.South Delhi Anamika Mithilesh also said only emergency work will be permitted, with a rider that the agency concerned will have to properly re-carpet the stretch so that it does not get inundated after rain.The municipal corporations manage over 1,000 km roads less than 60 feet in width. The PWD manages more than 1,260 km arterial and other big roads wider than 60 feet. Delhi has been experiencing heavy water logging even after moderate rain. In July, at least seven instances of road cave-ins were reported at different locations after just three days of heavy rain. The PWD has issued a circular to avoid deep digging work and cover open trenches during monsoons.“All deep work should be stopped and it should be ensured trenches are filled in and malba/surplus earth should be removed on a daily basis after completion of work. It should be ensured that trenches (where work is already in progress) are properly barricaded, diversion boards are fixed at appropriate locations and lighting arrangement during night hours are in place,” the PWD circular said.PWD officials said there are instances of dug-up stretches kept lying open or unattended, posing a threat to commuters, especially during the rainy season.The officials said the guidelines were issued to avoid instances of road cave-in, water logging and mishaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-digging-of-roads-in-delhi-till-monsoon-ends/story-zx07BeU6pPGa6JEYdrotlL.html

We write to the MC and the administration, but our complaints fall on deaf ears.”President of the Sector-39B RWA Amardeep Singh agreed that streetlights had remained non-operational for a while now and should be restored soon for the safety of the people.President of the Sector-48 RWA JJ Singh said even the parks weren’t properly lit. “Two flood lights were installed in the park here a year ago. The lights work, but their sensors are off and many times they don’t switch on even when it starts getting dark.”CYCLISTS, PEDESTRIANS AT RISKRoad safety activist Harpreet Singh said, “It is important for roads to be lit as dark patches put cyclists and pedestrians at risk. After a black spot is identified, one of the first courses of action should be to increase the luminosity of the streetlights installed there.”Meanwhile in the northern sectors, although most streetlights were functional, Sector 8 resident welfare body president Ranvinder Singh Gill said the timing of the lights was erratic. “Sometimes the lights would be on late in the morning and even afternoon. On one hand, the MC wants to charge an entry fee on gardens, and on the other power is being wasted.”MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “Everyday, we receive 15-20 complaints that are mostly fixed within a couple of days.”MC officials who maintain the lights said that many times, the lights stopped working because wires or other components would get stolen. The new parts would then take a few days to procure and so the process would take a fortnight to finish, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/malfunctioning-streetlights-irk-residents-of-chandigarh-s-southern-sectors/story-HTGvx3OnMrgGXk6YosMwxH.html
19-08-2020||Pune||SPPU online learning model to be followed by others||The ‘Pune Model’ for online learning started by the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is going to be implemented in all other universities across the state, announced state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant. Samant appreciated the efforts taken by SPPU to encourage online learning for its various courses. “The loss occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic is huge, but it has given new opportunities to us. Online education is the new way forward and SPPU has done fabulous work in terms of online learning for its students. I have personally seen the studios, facilities and work going into creating online content for students. So, there is a need to make all the universities in the state self-dependent and develop such an online education system,” said Samant.“The system which SPPU has put in place for online learning is different and is receiving good results. So, we are now planning to take the Pune Model of SPPU to all other universities in the state. For this, further process has been initiated by our department and soon we will see the outcome of it.” added Samant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-online-learning-model-to-be-followed-by-others/story-FyOOjkljqoqZUya4uypYCN.html
19-08-2020||Pune||Pune records highest active cases in the country||Pune district has now topped the country in terms of the number of active cases. Compared to some of the major cities, Pune is not far ahead in terms of the number of active cases which has raised serious questions on the administration’s capacity to handle the situation. Despite Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the district corporation claiming to test most number of tests per million and further ramping up the testing capacity since the past one month, city has failed to break the chain. The district administration is now accepting loopholes in its strategy to contain the spread.As of August 17, Pune has 39424 active cases, closely followed by Bengaluru which has 34,584 active cases, while Mumbai, which was considered as the worst hit city in the country, now has only 17,704 active cases; Delhi, country’s capital which has four civic bodies, has only 15,066 active cases while Chennai has 12,003 active cases. Due to data discrepancy, district health office for Pune reports 26,719 active cases, out of which 15,673 are in hospital isolation while 11,046 are in home isolation. Despite different agencies reporting different numbers, the fact remains that Pune district’s active cases are higher than most metro cities in the country. Admitting to the loopholes in strategy to contain the spread of the virus, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “It is true that we have the highest number of progressive positives and also active cases. The sero survey clearly shows that there is high prevalence and since we are doing high testing we are able to identify and isolate patients quickly. Further strategy is going to remain the same, aggressive testing and focusing on super spreaders. Super spreaders would include those who constantly come in and out of the containment zones, which includes those working in essential services, vegetable vendors, milkmen, nurses and sanitation workers. The economy is not opening up and it is not possible for the administration, including the police, to behave in a ruthless manner. Also, they are the most affected due to the lockdown economically, it would not be possible to keep people locked inside the containment zones anymore. We are focusing on comorbid patients and senior citizens for which we have dedicated teams which will help keep check on the case fatality rate.” Rao said, “However, it is also true that despite high testing we are unable to arrest the spread. There are two possible reasons, one people are not following the social distancing norms, not wearing masks or following respiratory and hand hygiene and the second is containment. We would accept it that there is some lethargy in containing the containment zones. Because in an ideal case, a containment zone should be free of the virus in the next 14 days. People are jumping over the barricades, but forcing them to stay inside since the past five months is not possible unless we are ruthless.” On August 17, PMC announced its latest list of containment zones which included 66 areas which would be barricaded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-records-highest-active-cases-in-the-country/story-j3rjpmmyMZBBkmpujv6dQL.html
19-08-2020||Pune||PMC deploys more staff for property assessment, tax collection||The standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) approved appointment of extra personnel for the property tax department in order to increase its tax collection capacity.Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “Standing committee approved appointment of at least 400 personnel for the property tax department as they can help in the recovery of more tax.”Rasne said, “Many new flat owners are willing to pay tax to the PMC, but as their property assessment has not been completed, they are unable to pay the tax. By using the additional manpower, the PMC administration will be able to complete more assessments and verify existing flats and its use. It will help get in additional revenue for the civic body.”Rasne added, “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the PMC has to bear an unexpected financial burden and hence, it is necessary to improve the revenue collection of the civic body. The standing committee had given Rs 2,000 crore tax collection target to the property tax department for the financial year 2020-21.”Due to pandemic induced lockdown, PMC collected Rs 673 crores, a fall of Rs 90 crores, in the first quarter of 2020-21 compared to Rs 763.90 crores during the same period last fiscal. This was mainly due to taxpayers did not pay tax for around 93000 properties. During last fiscal, PMC collected tax from around 5.95 lakh properties. The PMC this year encouraged online payment of tax, which helped he civic body as 84000 more online transactions were recorded. Rasne said, “PMC acquiring total 600 personal for property tax department. 200 employees from other departments and 400 are from contract who will get six months appointment and around Rs20000 per month salary. “These additional man power will mainly focus on increasing the tax. “From last few years many properties changed their use. Many residential properties converted in commercial spaces but till paying tax as a residential property. Even many illegal works happened in existing properties and some new illegal properties. Though properties are illegal, they need to pay tax as people staying in such properties are using services provided by pmc like water, road, public places and sewage facility. Paying a tax for illegal properties means, they are not became legal. Tax is only for using services. On this background the property tax focus would collect maximum tax from defaulters.Rasne said, “property tax is important tool for getting revenue. If pmc would get tax, it will help to carry out development works. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-deploys-more-staff-for-property-assessment-tax-collection/story-bJ2Zyh2d2uXod9paDKkU7J.html
19-08-2020||Pune||Special RTO drive in Pune to check private transport providers charging exorbitant fees||The Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) kicked off a special drive on Tuesday to check private travels and tourist buses charging exorbitant fares during the festive season. With the Ganpati festival next week, many people travel to their hometowns and village and private transport service providers charge high fees. Therefore to keep a check on such transport providers, the RTO started the drive, said officials. “The state government has fixed the per kilometre travel rate for private buses and other vehicles. They should follow the rules and regulations accordingly and if anyone is found violating the norms, they will face strict action. We appeal to all the private players to not charge more than 1.5 times the rates of the Maharashtra state road transport corporation (MSRTC) buses as per the instructions from the state government,” said Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde.Every year before Ganpati and Diwali festival, there is a heavy rush at ST stands and at private tourist buses parking lots around the city. Taking advantage of the situation, private players charge a high fare from passengers. This year, however, the inter district travel has been restricted, many travel agencies are taking necessary permission and passes to transport passengers to various destinations, but in turn charging a high fare for it.“I wanted to go to Solapur to my hometown for the Ganpati festival for which one of the private tourist owner quoted Rs 1,500 as the fare which included the police pass and fare tickets. It’s a very high charge and the common people cannot afford such heavy fares. Instead, I will prefer to stay in Pune and travel when the situation gets normal.” said Hari Reddy, a health professional.Meanwhile, the Pune RTO has increased its daily permanent licence quota. Earlier, the daily quota for Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) permanent licence and motorcycle with gear permanent licence was 80, which has now doubled to 160 per day. The motorcycle without gear permanent licence earlier quota has been increased to 90 from the earlier 60.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/special-rto-drive-in-pune-to-check-private-transport-providers-charging-exorbitant-fees/story-pZ2CtsY3c6S4sECr9yoifK.html
19-08-2020||Pune||Preterm and underweight Covid positive baby successfully discharged from Pune hospital after four weeks of ventilator support||A preterm baby boy born weighing just 1.8 kg was admitted for over a month after being tested positive for Covid-19 at a private hospital. The baby could be the first such occurrence as the first preterm baby who was successfully discharged after undergoing ventilator treatment for about 22 days, including 100% oxygen requirement, in the state, according to the hospital authorities. Although doctors could not confirm if this is a case of vertical transmission, they are reporting the case as the first of its kind in terms of multiple symptoms, including lung fibrosis, pneumonia in both the lungs and cytokine storm which are not usually reported in Covid-19 positive infants.Dr Pradeep Surawanshi, who was the treating doctor at Bharati Vidyapeeth University and Medical College and Hospital for the baby, said, “The baby was brought to us after delivery from another private hospital. He experienced breathlessness and was not responding to the normal treatment procedure, and so we got the baby tested for antibodies which tested positive for the Covid-19. The mother was also tested later and was found positive. The baby was born at 34 weeks and weighed only 1.8 kg. The baby was under ventilator treatment for over 22 days and was successfully discharged after 35 days of treatment. The baby is successfully breast feeding. This is a rare case because we observed cytokine storm and lung fibrosis, just like in case of adults. We will be reporting it to the Lancet publication as a first of its kind in the world.” Neelima Suryavanshi, aunt of the baby said, “The baby was born on July 12 and the same day was shifted to Bharati hospital after experiencing breathlessness. It was a very critical case, but thankfully due to timely intervention the baby is now healthy.” Dr Sanjay Gupta, former president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India said, “This is definitely a rare case and a positive one in that. However, the breathlessness in the baby could be because of either being born preterm and that the lungs were not fully developed and underweight or due to Covid.” The case study report of the case states that “the breathing difficulty gradually increased over the next two days and the baby was put on a ventilator. The infant also received two doses of special medicine called ‘surfactant’ into the baby’s lungs to help the delivery of oxygen. In spite of this, baby required 100% oxygen and was put on a special type of ventilator called high frequency ventilator. The X rays were showing widespread pneumonia in both lungs and resembled the disease presentation as seen in adults with severe Covid-19. “A special gas called nitric oxide was also used to help oxygen delivery. Baby also had all the blood investigations suggestive of the ‘cytokine storm’ and the antibody test for Covid-19 came to be positive in both baby and mother. It is noteworthy that mother never had any symptoms of Covid-19, except the fact that she had preterm delivery (which itself can be due to corona virus-2). “A special therapy (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) which helps the immune system was also given. Due to the severity of the disease and after detailed discussion with parents, baby was given high dose steroids (methylprednisolone) for 5 days after which the baby started its gradual recovery.“The child remained on ventilator for 22 days out of which high frequency ventilator was given for 16 days. In modern day NICU care it is an exceptional event to require such a prolonged ventilatory care. Eventually the baby came off the ventilator on 25th day of life. At this stage, the CT scan of the chest showed some residual scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs, which has been recently documented in adult patients, who have recovered from the severe Covid-19. After few days of oxygen therapy during the recovery process, baby was discharged home on day 35.” Dr Suryavanshi said, “This is a unique case of a preterm small baby, who suffered from severe Covid-19 disease and required almost 4 weeks of ventilatory support and heavy dose of steroids, which lead to recovery albeit with some residual damage. This kind of severe disease presentation has not been documented world over in preterm small babies. As we know babies have a tremendous potential to recover from any damage, much faster and better than adults, we hope with time, baby will eventually overcome the scars left by this dreadful disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/preterm-and-underweight-covid-positive-baby-successfully-discharged-after-four-weeks-of-ventilator-support/story-njiMrFEX5a3Kmdt0rQqGPM.html

Dabholkar was shot dead by two assailants near Omkareshwar temple in Sadashiv peth on August 20, 2013, when the rationalist was returning home after a morning walk. Dabholkar’s daughter Mukta and son Hamid in a joint statement on Tuesday said that the CBI has not been able to find the ‘masterminds’ who directed the killing of their father and as a result the threat to the lives of rationalists, activists and journalists remain imminent till date. “The murder investigation has stopped only till the arrest of eight persons including Virendra Tawade and Amol Kale. The CBI must go ahead and investigate the masterminds of the murder failing which the danger to the lives of rationalist thinkers will not fade away. Seven years after the murder, the investigation remains incomplete,” stated the release issued both by Hamid and Mukta on Tuesday. The family’s submission comes at a time when the Union home ministry on August 12 awarded the CBI officer, who probed the Dabholkar’s murder case. The Union home ministry awarded a total of 121 officers, including 15 from the CBI, which included assistant superintendent of police (ASP) SR Singh, who not just investigated the case, but also ensured that the weapon used in Dabholkar’s murder was recovered from the Thane creek. The family members said that it is a painful experience that the case has remained unsolved till date by an agency like the CBI. According to their statement, every government conveniently used the word ‘progressive’ for their political mileage. “The political parties and their leadership keeps espousing the ideology of Phule-Shahu-Ambedkar, but the murder investigation of a personality who gave his life for creating a progressive society is yet not over which pains us,” stated Hamid and Mukta. The CBI arrested ENT surgeon Dr Vinod Tawade, a Sanatan Sanstha member in 2016, alleging that he was the mastermind behind the murder. In the Dabholkar murder case, the CBI has also arrested three others identified as Amol Kale, Amit Digwekar and Rajesh Bangera — who are accused in the murder of Bengaluru-based journalist and activist Gauri Lankesh in September 2017. Later, the agency arrested Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, in August 2018, as the ones who opened fire at Dabholkar on August 20, 2013. Vikram Bhave and advocate Sanjiv Punalekar were arrested by the CBI in May 2019, on the basis of a statement by Kalaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/family-unhappy-with-cbi-investigation-in-dabholkar-murder-case/story-3kGVh9Ycp1mw669yyjTRuI.html

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who visited the facility last week, had asked officials to expedite the process of turning the building into a hospital. The hospital will soon be functional to serve patients with moderate and high-risk symptoms related to Covid-19. It will have 270 oxygenated beds and 42 beds with ventilator at intensive care units (ICU), said PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane. The standing committee on Tuesday approved the staff for the hospital coming up at Baner. “We have got the hospital ready for free with the help from corporates under corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative. The civic body will run the facility,” said Rasane. PMC city engineer Prashant Waghmare said that the PMC building was ready and lying unutilised. “PMC has got a 48,000 square feet ready building under reservation from the Panchshil builder at Baner survey number 109. Our department suggested to mayor Murlidhar Mohol and municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to start a Covid hospital in this building. They okayed our suggestion,” said Waghmare. The six-storey building has 48,000 square feet ready construction with each floor having 8,000 square feet. “Under the CSR, we had appealed to corporate firms to contribute for erecting the hospital and they agreed to our proposal,” said Waghmare. The latest facility will help to bring down the hospital bed burden in the city especially among critical patients. An 800-bed jumbo facility is coming up at College of Engineering, Pune and will be operational by this week. “The Baner facility will be permanent and PMC can run it as per the requirement even after the Covid pandemic,” said Waghmare, who added that many private firms are joining hands with PMC to strengthen the city’s medical infrastructure.

19-08-2020||Delhi||Skill training for class 9 and 11 drop-outs in Delhi govt schools||Around 34,000 class 9 and 11 students who dropped out of Delhi government schools in the 2018-19 academic session will get a chance to opt for free vocational training in a field of their choice. Following the completion of the training, the trainees will receive certificates and placement opportunities.The pilot project will be managed by the Delhi unit of Samagra Shiksha (SS) in collaboration with the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) and Department of Training and Technical Education (DTTE). The Union government’s Samagra Shiksha scheme is a holistic education programme functioning across the country, within the respective states’ education departments.“Vocational training, in a field of their choice, will provide these children with a respectable way to catch up on lost education, equip them with necessary skills and increase their employability for improved livelihoods,” read a circular released earlier this month signed by Rajanish Kumar Singh, special project director (SS). HT has a copy of the circular.The pilot project, a first of its kind under Samagra Shiksha, aims to reach out to 27,970 class 9 students, and 6,755 class 11 students who dropped out in the 2018-19 academic session. Kavita Rana, Assistant Project Director, Samagra Shiksha said, “Since the class 9 and 11 results for the previous academic session were delayed, we are starting the pilot project with these students. These children will also be in the appropriate age group for employment and internships. Once we are able to get these children skill training, we will expand the scope to all children above 14 years of age who have dropped out of school.”The vocational training programmes offered by these institutes include courses from the garments sector, such as tailoring or stitching; beautician courses; IT sector programmes offering computer training, web-design and data-entry courses; healthcare sector programmes like nursing courses, and others. “We had asked schools to contact children by Monday and forward the data to district offices. Once we have the compiled data, we plan to hold a meeting with DTTE and NULM to go ahead with the project,” Rana said. As per the circular, the meeting, scheduled for August 24, will also explore the feasibility of setting up vocational labs in schools for dropouts.Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of a Delhi government school for girls in New Kondli, welcomed the initiative, and said it would offer scopes for children who may not opt for academics. “It was difficult to compile data during the pandemic, since many students have left the city and we don’t know where they are. The goal is to start getting children on board at least. They will need to be motivated to bring them back into the mainstream. But there is hope for all dropouts, especially girls.”Sarbjeet Kaur, the Educational and Vocational Guidance Counsellor (EVGC) at Minj’s school, said, “We pulled out old registers to get in touch with students. In our school, of 80 students, we were able to track only 60. Among these, many either moved back to their hometowns outside Delhi or are married, or are not keen on joining the course for other reasons.”Schools have also been asked to constitute outreach teams consisting of EVGCs who can help these children opt for the right skill training, based on their aptitude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/skill-training-for-class-9-and-11-drop-outs-in-delhi-govt-schools/story-VWGyanHQewbaJRJg7TXGFK.html
19-08-2020||World||Ex-FBI lawyer pleads guilty to doctoring email in Russia probe of Trump campaign||Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith pleaded guilty on Wednesday in federal court to falsifying a document as part of the bureau’s early-stage probe into whether President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign colluded with the Russian government.Clinesmith is the first person criminally charged in an investigation by John Durham, a federal prosecutor tapped to probe mistakes the FBI made when it sought a warrant to conduct surveillance on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.During a virtual hearing in the US District Court in Washington, Clinesmith admitted to doctoring a CIA email the FBI used in 2017 when it applied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to renew its application for a secret wiretap to monitor Page.“At the time I believed that the information I was providing in the email was accurate, but I am agreeing that the information I inserted into the email was not originally there, and I inserted that information,” Clinesmith said during the hearing.In an August 2016 email, the CIA advised that Page, who is referenced in court documents as “Individual #1,” had been approved as an “operational contact” from 2008 to 2013.When Clinesmith was later asked to confirm this information, he doctored a follow-up email from the CIA to make it appear as though Page was not an agency source, according to the charging documents.Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz uncovered the doctored email and in December released a scathing report documenting 17 “basic and fundamental” errors and omissions in FBI surveillance warrant applications.Trump’s Republican allies have repeatedly pointed to that report as evidence of a wider conspiracy by “deep state” government actors to undermine Trump. There was no indication of a broad conspiracy in the charging documents filed against Clinesmith. US District Judge James Boasberg set a sentencing date for Dec. 10.While Clinesmith could face a statutory maximum of five years in prison, the U.S. sentencing guidelines in his case call for a range of zero to six months in prison, Boasberg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-fbi-lawyer-pleads-guilty-to-doctoring-email-in-russia-probe-of-trump-campaign/story-xm3C4ghX1BwL6SjkQdv3yL.html
19-08-2020||World||Imran Khan breaks silence on Qureshi remark, says no problems in ties with Saudi||Relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have deteriorated further after the country’s army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was denied an audience with Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman during his visit to the Kingdom on Monday. In h Pakistan, there is confusion over what the next step will be but so far foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has not been asked to step down.General Bajwa, accompanied by ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz, had gone to Saudi Arabia at the behest of Imran Khan’s government in a bid to clarify matters and restore good relations between the two countries. The Saudi leadership is believed to have taken offence over remarks made earlier this month, by Pakistan’s foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who accused the Saudi-backed Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of dilly-dallying on Pakistan’s request for a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers on Kashmir.Instead, Bajwa held talks with Saudi Deputy Minister for Defence Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.This is being seen as a deliberate snub by the Saudi leadership to Pakistan’s overtures, say officials in Islamabad. But the failed mission in Saudi Arabia is also creating a gap on foreign policy matters between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the military leadership. Officials say that major foreign policy initiatives are taken with the nod of the army high command and the statement by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi against the OIC was no exception.“It is in this context that one must read the statement of minister Dr Shireen Mazari,” said an analyst. Dr Mazari has bitterly criticized the foreign ministry and praised the foreign policy initiatives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.Khan finally broke his silence on the issue on Tuesday. In a wide ranging interview with a private television channel, when asked about relations with Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan’s role “is not to divide the Muslim world”.He commented that Saudi Arabia has its own foreign policy. “News of breakdown in relations with Saudi Arabia is completely baseless,” he told his interviewer, adding “Saudi Arabia has helped Pakistan in every difficult time.”At the same time, Khan called China a long-time friend of Pakistan. “It should be clear that our future is connected with China,” he stressed. He said China had stood by Pakistan through good and bad times. “We are further strengthening our ties with China. China also needs Pakistan very much. Unfortunately, Western countries are using India against China,” he added.Amidst the confusion, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who started the row, remains unfazed. Over the weekend, local channels reported that Qureshi had reportedly slapped the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, Azam Khan, after a heated argument.According to a media report, the minister wanted to meet Imran when Azam Khan stopped him outside the office. That is when Qureshi lost his temper and slapped him. Qureshi has reportedly expressed his disappointment at not being allowed to enter the office premises. The Foreign Office has rejected the report saying that no such incident took place.Critics are of the opinion that it is also not without significance that Qureshi met Qatar’s new envoy Sheikh Saoud bin Abdul Rehman Al-Thani on the same day as the army chief went to Saudi Arabia.The new envoy is from Qatar’s royal family.

And that means we could do something possibly right after Labor Day, when we return,” Kaine said in an online interview with Politico.The Senate is due to return from recess on Sept. 8 and the House on Sept. 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-white-house-pushes-skinny-covid-19-bill-democrat-sees-september-action/story-7doSuaARgAdXhBuIr8nVcO.html

Florida’s daily average reported deaths over the past week was 167 deaths. Two weeks ago, it peaked at 185 deaths.The state reported a total of 584,047 coronavirus cases, a daily increase of 4,115 cases.Hospitalizations for the virus have been declining for nearly a month, and the growth in new cases has been decelerating. The positivity rate for Covid-19 testing in Florida has averaged about 11.4% over the past week.There were 5,351 patients being treated for the disease in Florida hospitals early Wednesday — down from peaks above 9,500 patients in late July.Meanwhile, Florida’s largest teacher’s union argued with attorneys for the state of Florida during a hearing over whether schools should reopen during the pandemic.The Florida Education Association sued Governor Ron DeSantis, Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, the Florida Department of Education and others to stop brick-and-mortar schools from physically reopening, arguing it is unsafe to do so until the spread of the virus is under control.The teacher’s union is seeking an injunction from a judge in Tallahassee to stop schools from reopening by this Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/174-new-deaths-push-florida-s-covid-19-toll-to-over-10-000/story-HYYXNWlQ7PmWFvLLhMvS1N.html
19-08-2020||World||San Francisco blanketed in smoke as California fires rage||Thousands of people were under orders to evacuate in regions surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area Wednesday as nearly 40 wildfires blazed across the state amid a blistering heat wave now in its second week. Smoke blanketed the city of San Francisco.“Throughout the state of California right now, we are stretched thin for crews” because of the fires, said Will Powers, a state fire spokesman. “Air resources have been stretched thin throughout the whole state.”Police and firefighters went door-to-door early Wednesday in a frantic scramble to warn residents to evacuate as fire encroached on Vacaville, a city of about 100,000 that lies between San Francisco and Sacramento. Fire officials said at least 50 structures were destroyed and 50 damaged, and four people were injured.Television footage showed some homes in flames and thick ash dropping in a rural area near Interstate 80 as the fire appeared to head toward more densely populated areas.Diane Bustos told KPIX-TV that she and her husband tried to drive out but their vehicle caught on fire and they had to flee on foot.“I got all these flames on me and I lost my shoe, but I made it. God saved me,” she said.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the blaze was exhibiting “extreme fire behavior” and challenging firefighters.To the south in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, about 22,000 people were ordered to evacuate because of a fire that was burning in dense wooded parkland but threatened communities, Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox said.“This is a very active timber fire burning in two counties with a serious threat to both public safety and for structures that are out in front of it,” he said.Thousands of homes and businesses were also threatened in the wine-growing counties of Napa and Sonoma in an area devastated by a series of deadly blazes in the last three years. At least seven fires were grouped together as one of two major Lightning Fires in Northern California, a nod to their origins just a day earlier.Powers said much of the fire was burning through rural areas with steep terrain, making it difficult to get crews in.In Napa County, Gail Bickett, 80, loaded up her three dogs in a truck to evacuate as the fire burned behind houses across the road, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.“It’s scary,” she said. “It’s overwhelming.”In the East San Francisco Bay, a cluster of 20 separate lightning-sparked fires threatened about 1,400 structures in rugged terrain with dense brush. Strong winds and low humidity made the firefight challenging.Blazes engulfed rural and forest areas near the San Francisco Bay Area, near Salinas in Monterey County, around Oroville Dam north of Sacramento, forested areas west of Silicon Valley, in remote Mendocino County and near the Nevada state line north of Lake Tahoe.Several also were burning in northern coastline areas and in Southern California.Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a statewide state of emergency Tuesday.The cluster of wine country fires threaten an area that only last year grappled with another massive blaze that forced 200,000 to flee — a task made more complicated this year because of the pandemic.Tuesday afternoon, the fire was moving toward an area called Atlas Peak that burned in 2017 in a blaze that killed six people and destroyed nearly 800 buildings. The California Highway Patrol said helicopter crews were unable to do rescues in the area because the smoke was too thick to fly in.Robin Sisemore hosed down vegetation in front of her mother’s adjacent house. Both homes were new, replacing ones that burned just three years ago.To the south, evacuations were ordered for all of Boulder Creek to the west of Silicon Valley, a community of 5,000 high in the Santa Cruz mountains where windy, long, forested roads, some paved, some dirt, can easily become blocked during storms or fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/san-francisco-blanketed-in-smoke-as-california-fires-rage/story-LO2r4X1gdDYDAFXNbvyjHI.html
19-08-2020||World||Typhoon adds to southern China’s rain and flooding woes||China suffered a double blow Wednesday of flooding and landslides from unusually heavy seasonal rains and a typhoon that came ashore on its southern coast. Five people were missing in Yunnan province in the southwest after a landslide destroyed two houses, the official People’s Daily newspaper said. In Sichuan province, 21 vehicles parked in a square in Yibin city fell into a hole after the road beneath them collapsed in the middle of the night. No one was injured, according to media reports.Flooding has left more than 200 people dead or missing in China this year and caused USD 25 billion in damage, authorities said last week. Typhoon Higos drenched Hong Kong overnight before making landfall in Zhuhai, a city in Guangdong province, in the morning with maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour, China’s National Meteorological Center said. It weakened to a tropical storm as it moved west toward the neighboring Guangxi region. More than 65,000 people were evacuated, schools were closed and many fishing boats returned to port along the coast, according to Chinese media reports. Power was knocked out in Meizhou city in northeastern Guangdong province on Tuesday night after trees fell onto power lines, the electric company said. The worst of the flooding appeared to be over in Sichuan, where the emergency level was lowered Wednesday morning and the toes of a famous Buddhist statue re-emerged as waters receded, news reports said. It was the first time in at least 70 years that water had reached the foot of the Leshan Giant Buddha, a 71-meter (233-foot) -tall statue carved into the side of a mountain in the eighth century. Emei Mountain, a nearby tourist site, reopened to visitors after being closed for nearly three days. The sprawling Chongqing municipality saw its worst flooding since 1981. Water covered roofs in low-lying areas of the historic town of Ciqikou, which was closed to tourists because of the rains from Tuesday evening. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping visited hard-hit Anhui province, where the 13 sluice gates of the Wagnjiaba dam had been opened, flooding farmland and forests to prevent more extensive damage downriver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-adds-to-southern-china-s-rain-and-flooding-woes/story-D77mpSoOdZjOvnhmqCSA0J.html
19-08-2020||World||Mystery grows over Covid-19 spread via contaminated food packaging||Evidence shows that food is an unlikely route of transmitting the coronavirus across borders, but contaminated items continue to grab the spotlight, deepening the uncertainty over whether the $220 billion cold chain industry could be implicated in the spread of Covid-19.China has repeatedly found traces of the pathogen on packaging and food, raising fears that imported items are linked to recent virus resurgences in Beijing and the port city of Dalian. In the nation’s strongest action since it began testing food items in June, a major Chinese city on Sunday banned imports of frozen meat from coronavirus hotspots.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCold-storage facilities and meat processing plants are ideal environments for the virus to spread, as the pathogen thrives in cold and dry environments. But there has been no concrete evidence the virus can be transmitted through food, and experts remain doubtful that it’s a major threat.“We know that viruses usually can survive being frozen. So that means in theory it’s possible that infection could spread that way,” said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong. “But in reality, it’s a very low risk that that would happen because so many steps would need to be involved.”The virus would need to survive freezing and then defrosting. It would need to get onto someone’s hands and then into their nose or mouth, and still survive. “I don’t think it would be a frequent mode of transmission, but it is possible,” he said.China’s top respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan, who advises Beijing on its Covid-19 response, downplayed the role frozen food can play in transmission. “It is relatively rare to detect the virus from imported frozen food,” he said. “Let’s not exaggerate it.”Guangzhou banAmid a lack of conclusive proof, China is taking precautionary steps, creating major disruptions with its trading partners. The Cold Chain Association of China’s southern coastal city of Guangzhou ordered all member companies to suspend imports of frozen meat and seafood from coronavirus-hit areas.The order was issued after the local government in the nearby city of Shenzhen found the virus on a surface sample of chicken wings imported from Brazil. Hong Kong has also suspended imports from that plant.China has otherwise refrained from wider nationwide moves against imported meat due to the reliance of its population on the food source.New Zealand originally considered the possibility that a new cluster, which suddenly emerged last week after 102 days without a local virus case, could have been linked to a cold-storage plant, as the first person to test positive worked at an Auckland Americold facility.Ruled outBut preliminary findings from environmental testing at the plant have debunked the theory that the route of transmission was through chilled surfaces on materials arriving from overseas, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said Tuesday.“The full report will have the details but it seems clear now that the possibility is being ruled out from that investigation,” he said.A key unanswered question is whether the traces that China has detected on the packaging and surface of frozen foods are still viable and infectious, or whether they’re just dead and harmless vestiges of the pathogen.“What we know publicly and what we’ve seen so far is that yes this virus can survive outside people for up to a few days, depending on the environment,” said Sarah Cahill, senior food standards officer at Codex Alimentarius Commission, the body responsible for developing food standards under the World Health Organization and the United Nations.“But what are we actually detecting when we do these tests?” she said. “Are we just detecting RNA, which just means maybe this virus is no longer viable, or is that virus still an infectious agent?”It is not uncommon for a wide array of viruses, bacteria and parasites to be transmitted through contaminated food. The WHO estimates that almost one in 10 people in the world fall ill after eating contaminated food, leading to 420,000 deaths every year. Salmonella and the norovirus on produce or uncooked meat and seafood can cause symptoms like diarrhea and inflammation in the stomach and intestines.While diarrhea can be one of the symptoms of Covid-19 as well, experts are more focused on the possibility of the virus jumping from surfaces to human respiratory systems when people touch their faces after coming into contact with a contaminated item. Even then, some consider that scenario far-fetched.“Theoretically, it’s possible ,” said Takeshi Kasai, WHO’s regional director for the Western Pacific region, during an online briefing on Tuesday. “But so far our observations or the evidence coming from the past seven months of epidemiology: it is unlikely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-grows-over-covid-19-spread-via-contaminated-food-packaging/story-tkZ24sn6QGWBfkBbA5uXCI.html
19-08-2020||World||US election 2020: Democrats officially nominate Joe Biden for president||US Democrats officially nominated former Vice-President Joe Biden as their nominee for president on the second night of the mostly virtual convention at which two former presidents, two former secretaries of states and his wife, Jill Biden, spoke of him as the kind of unifying leader the nation needed now.“Thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart,” Biden said in brief remarks from home in Delaware, as his family broke into a small celebration. “Thank you all, it means the world to me and my family and I will see you on Thursday.” Also read: Joe Biden reassures India | HT EditorialOn Thursday, Biden is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech.Delegations from states and territories reported their votes from the primaries and caucuses in a virtual roll call.Biden waited 32 years to win the nomination after he first sought it in 1987. He had dropped out then even before the primaries over plagiarism allegations. He tried again in 2008 but pulled out after a poor showing in the first of the nominating contests, the Iowa caucus.Speakers on the second day of the convention included two former presidents — Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton; two former Secretaries of State — John Kerry and Colin Powell, a Republican; and one former defence secretary Chuck Hagel, also a Republican.Clinton, whose participation in the convention had been opposed by some Democrats because of past allegations of sexual harassment, launched a blistering attack on President Donald Trump’s handling of the epidemic. He said the Oval Office should operate at this time like a command centre; “instead, it’s a storm centre. There’s only chaos.”“If you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he’s your man,” Clinton said, adding that the choice before voters in November was between “Trump’s ‘Us vs. Them’ America against Joe Biden’s America, where we all live and work together.”Also read: Kamala Harris seeks to define role of US vice president on Joe Biden’s ticket“We deserve a person with integrity and judgment, someone who is honest and fair, someone who is committed to what is best for the American people,” said Carter, without mentioning Trump. “Joe is that kind of leader, and he is the right person for this moment in our nation’s history.”Secretary Powell, who became the second high-profile Republican to make an appearance at the Democratic convention in after John Kasich, said, “Today, we are a country divided, and we have a president doing everything in his power to make it that way and keep us that way.”Secretary Kerry attacked President Trump’s conduct of foreign relations. “When this president goes overseas, it isn’t a goodwill mission, it’s a blooper reel. He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at.”The former first lady, who headlined the night, closed by talking of the man she has known and how he is someone who lost his wife and daughter to an accident and then a son to brain cancer understood the challenges confronting Americans in these uncertain times, and how he would address them.“I hear it from so many of you, the frustration of parents juggling work while they support their children’s learning—or are afraid that their kids might get sick from school,” she said of life in the shadow of the Covid-19 epidemic. A lifelong school teacher, she spoke from a high school in Delaware.She added, “The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole.”Jill Biden did not mention President Trump at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-democrats-officially-nominate-joe-biden-for-president/story-LP53kWWNy2pqni357gSOgM.html

Meanwhile in Puli Khumri, the capital of northern Baghlan province, a bomb targeted a vehicle belonging to the provincial intelligence department, killing two service members and wounding 11 people, including both military and civilians, said Nazir Najem, the provincial governor’s spokesman.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz said one of the sticky bombs was attached to a police vehicle, while the other was attached to a car belonging to the education ministry. The police were investigating, he said.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said he was not aware of the explosions in Kabul.Meanwhile, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a mortar attack the previous day in Kabul that killed three people, including two government employees, and wounded at least 16, including four children and woman. Tariq Arian, the Interior Ministry’s spokesman, said militants fired a barrage of rockets from two vehicles toward different areas of the city. Earlier, reports said only that there were 10 wounded. The attacks came as Afghans on Tuesday marked their country’s Independence Day. The Islamic State group said it fired 16 mortar shells, targeting the presidential palace, embassies and Afghan government offices in Kabul. Authorities said most of the shells hit residential homes. The violence comes amid new uncertainties over the start of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul political leadership. The government said it would not release the last 320 Taliban prisoners it holds until the insurgents free more captured Afghan soldiers. The decision went against that of a traditional Afghan council held earlier this month — the Loya Jirga — and is likely to further delay intra-Afghan peace talks sought by the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-attacks-in-kabul-north-afghanistan-kill-4-injure-13-report/story-JfZizeaiqCuSqJnmf0hQPP.html

Protesters burned Israeli and American flags, trampled on posters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, and chanted “normalisation is betrayal to Jerusalem and Palestine.” Unlike Palestinian protesters last Friday near the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City who also burned posters of the Emirati crown prince, the Gaza demonstrators stopped short of burning symbols of the UAE — apparently not to antagonise the Gulf Arab country, where tens of thousands of Palestinians work and live.Also read: Telephone service begins between UAE and Israel amid deal The demonstrators in Gaza City also voiced support for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for his rejection of President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, which the Palestinians say unfairly favours Israel. The protest was organised by the militant Hamas group, which rules the Gaza Strip, and other factions. Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, denounced the Israeli-Emirati deal. “Normalisation with the occupation harms us and doesn’t serve us,” he said. “Instead, it serves and promotes the occupation in its projects that target Palestine and the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-in-gaza-rally-against-israel-uae-deal/story-zJg9IfdX1hGpx4MSEWFCdJ.html

You don’t come out of it the same — either better or worse,’‘ Francis said, adding improvised remarks to his planned speech for his weekly public audience.“We must come out better” from the Covid-19 pandemic, the pope said.After the Covid-19 pandemic, the pope said, the world can’t return to normality if normal means social injustice and degradation of the natural environment.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicFrancis said: “How sad it would be if for the Covid-19 vaccine priority is given to the richest.”“It would be sad if this vaccine were to become the property of this nation or another, rather than universal and for all,” the pontiff added, without indicating any particular country.He also said it would be scandalous if all the economic assistance in the works, most of it using public funds, ends up reviving industries that don’t help the poor or the environment.“The pandemic has laid bare the difficult situation of the poor and the great inequality that reigns in the world,’‘ the pope said in his speech. ”And the virus, while it doesn’t make exceptions among persons, has found in its path, devastating, great inequalities and discrimination,” Francis said, adding “and it has increased them.Throughout the pandemic, many poor, who often have jobs that don’t allow them to work from home, have found themselves less able to shelter from possible contagion during stay-at-home strategies enacted by many nations to reduce the contagion rate. Access to the best health care for the poor is often impossible in many parts of the world.Francis said response to the pandemic must be twofold. On one hand, “it’s indispensable to find the cure for such a small but tremendous virus, that brings the entire world to its knees.”On the other hand, “we must treat a great virus, that of social injustice, of inequality of opportunity, of being marginalized and of lack of protection of the weakest,” Francis said.Francis has dedicated much of his papacy to highlighting the plight of those living on life’s margins, saying societies must put them at the center of their attention.Noting how many are eager to return to normality and resume economic activity, Francis voiced caution: “Sure, but this ‘normality’ must not include social injustices and degradation of the environment.”“Today we have an occasion to build something different. For example, we can grow an economy of integral development of the poor and not of welfare,” the pope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-can-t-get-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine-poor-need-help-pope-francis/story-1z4uhC08ogG3XQa3jXeAhI.html

Transgressors will be fined $5 but could face up to three months in jail.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicNepal began to partially ease a nationwide lockdown in June, allowing some local transport to resume, but kept a ban on international and domestic travel in place while the country’s famed peaks have remained closed to climbers.“The running of private and public vehicles is prohibited in the district (Kathmandu)”, the government said in a statement.“No one should organise public or religious gatherings, fairs, celebrations and festivals,” it said, urging the valley’s 4 million residents to observe cultural events at home.Only transport carrying essentials like food items, and security and health workers will be allowed on the streets, the government said.Click here to follow live updates on Covid-19On Tuesday, Health Ministry spokesman Jageswar Gautam said more than 1,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus and seven had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the highest single day spike in cases.The numbers took Nepal’s total cases to 28,257 and the death toll from Covid-19 to 114.Kathmandu Valley, which comprises the capital city and surrounding areas, recorded 205 new cases, a jump of around 10% jump from the previous day.The restrictions come as the Hindu festival season begins this week, with hundreds traditionally participating in gatherings in the country. Some critics say the measures were not enough.“A public health emergency must be declared to fast track measures like taking private hospitals on lease to treat coronavirus patients,” said Gagan Thapa, a former health minister and opposition lawmaker, amid concerns that hospitals could end up overwhelmed.Gautam, the health ministry spokesman, told Reuters on Wednesday there was no shortage of hospital beds, intensive care units, ventilators or testing kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-temporarily-bans-transport-and-gatherings-in-capital-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-TM16dkCGbduqt7DoJYt3eI.html
19-08-2020||World||After Canada’s finance minister steps down, PM Trudeau prorogues parliament||A day after the controversial departure of the country’s finance minister, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his replacement but also suspended all Parliamentary proceedings for a month, a strategy seen by the Opposition as an attempt to prevent further probing into a nearly billion-dollar contract given to a charity with links to Trudeau and his family.Bill Morneau resigned as finance minister on Monday, and on Tuesday, deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland took over his portfolio, making her the first woman to hold this key post. However, Trudeau also prorogued Parliament till a Throne Speech by the country’s Governor-General on September 23, the equivalent of the President’s speech opening Parliament in India. By proroguing Parliament, Trudeau has ensured all activity ceases.In a statement, his office said, “This speech will present the government’s detailed vision for the future.” This could well turn into a vote of no confidence, as one major Opposition party, the Bloc Quebecois has already said it will precipitate such a vote unless Trudeau resigns. Also read: Canadian foreign minister resigns over differences with TrudeauParty leader Yves-François Blanchet reiterated that position to reporters in Ottawa, as he said of the Throne Speech, “If it does not contain what it must contain, he will simply not survive a vote on his speech from the throne.” If the Liberal Party Government does lose that vote, it may mean fresh elections to the House of Commons before the end of 2020, barely a year since Trudeau’s returned to power in October last year, though with a minority mandate.The change in who will be in charge of the finance ministry at a crucial juncture attracted plenty of flak from the Opposition. Pierre Poilievre, finance critic for the principal opposition Conservative Party, said, “We now have a government of corruption, coverup and chaos at a time of a deadly pandemic and the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression.” That point was also reflected in the view of Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, who said in a statement, “Shutting down Parliament in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis, with a planned sitting next week and committees working hard to get answers and solutions for Canadians, is wrong. Canadians shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Mr Trudeau’s scandals.”Trudeau, meanwhile, stressed that a new Throne Speech, which lays out the Government’s agenda, was necessary, since the one “delivered eight months ago made no mention of Covid-19, had no conception of the reality we find ourselves in right now.” He also said his Government will seek to “reset” its “approach” for a “recovery to build back better.”The decision to prorogue Parliament comes in the context of hearings by two Parliamentary panels into the grant of a $912 million contract to WE Charity, which was cancelled after an uproar over its links to Trudeau and his family, including making payments to his mother, wife and brother. Those investigations will be stalled, even as the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner continues with his own probe of Trudeau in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-canada-s-finance-minister-steps-down-pm-trudeau-prorogues-parliament/story-JuX1f5VN1eK7QCB3OGeqdO.html

19-08-2020||World||Series of crashes last night leads to shutdown of Berlin highway||Berlin authorities are investigating whether a series of crashes on a city highway that were allegedly all caused by one man were committed intentionally, the German news agency dpa reported Wednesday.The 30-year-old man who was involved with the crashes Tuesday night may have acted deliberately, dpa reported, adding that the city’s general prosecutor would inform the Berlin justice committee about the case this afternoon.Police and prosecutors have not yet announced a motive for the driver’s actions, but dpa reported that investigators are looking into whether the man acted out of political reasons or whether he was mentally ill.Six people were injured, three of them severely, when the man allegedly drove into several vehicles on Tuesday evening along a stretch of the German capital’s highway. The series of crashes led to a complete closure of one of the main traffic arteries of Berlin.Local media reported that the man later stopped on the highway and put a box on the roof of his car claiming it had explosives inside. Specialists opened the box and found only tools.

But as they strictly abide by health guidelines forced by coronavirus, they are severely limiting the candidates’ travel to in-person events and sharing few details about how Harris will engage with voters.Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general, distinguished herself during the primaries with sharp attacks on Biden’s civil rights record, nearly turning the race upside-down and exposing a possible liability to Biden’s candidacy among liberals, minorities and young people.Now, she’ll attempt to rally those same key constituencies around Biden, starting with the day before he accepts his party’s nomination. Her speech on Wednesday will be a critical opportunity to re-introduce herself to what will be one of the largest audiences she will reach before November. She is expected to share her cross-cultural origin story which echoes that of former President Barack Obama.The daughter of divorced immigrant parents, a University of California-Berkeley biologist from India, and a Stanford economics professor from Jamaica, she grew up a child of the civil rights movement in 1960s Oakland, California. She later attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, DC.That biography has energized key constituency groups, especially Black women. Members of her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority were mainstays on the campaign trail when she was running for president and are expected to mobilize in force to support the new ticket.Harris will also have to navigate her background as a prosecutor after a summer of nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. She was elected district attorney in San Francisco in 2003 and attorney general of California in 2010. After her election to the U.S. Senate in 2017, she earned a reputation for her incisive cross-examination of witness in Senate hearings, in particular Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.She’s already signaling that she’ll bring that prosecutorial style to the campaign.“The case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut,” she said last week as Biden announced her as his running mate.In the week since, she’s proved to be a safe choice, but not a game-changing one. And that’s the best that any presidential candidate can ask for.“I don’t think it matters who the vice presidential candidate is historically,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on MSNBC before Harris was selected. She noted exceptions like “Lyndon Johnson for victory and Sarah Palin for defeat,” but added, “By and large it’s all about the two candidates for president.”Indeed, polls show Harris has made no difference to the vast majority of voters. An ABC/Washington Post poll Monday found 69% said the choice did not make them more or less likely to vote for the Democratic ticket. Only 18%, mostly liberals and African Americans, said Harris made them more likely to vote for Biden, and 11% said they were less likely to vote for the former vice president.Still, she seems to have passed the most important test. Voters see her as just as ready to take over the presidency as current Vice President Mike Pence, with 55% of voters seeing them both as qualified.Christopher Devine of the University of Dayton, and Kyle Kopco, authors of the book “Do Running Mates Matter?” say the choice matters mostly because of what it says about the candidate at the top of the ticket. The pick is the first presidential decision a candidate makes, and this one provides a window into Biden’s judgment and his ideology.“It’s a signal of whether Joe Biden is going to the left or anchoring himself in the center where he’s always stood,” Devine said. “Harris probably nudges him a little to the left. At the very least it’s a signal that he sees the importance of the left to his campaign.”During her 10-month campaign for the presidential nomination, Harris herself struggled to define herself ideologically in a crowded field of candidates. She positioned herself to the left of moderates like Biden, but never ventured as far as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.She briefly soared to second place in the polls after her debate takedown of Biden’s past positions on forced busing to enforce school desegregation and his work with senators who were segregationists.But among the biggest differences with Biden during the primary campaign was her short-lived support for Medicare for All — the latest branding of a single-payer, government-run health care system. She retreated from that position while still a presidential candidate.Her lack of a defined message combined with staff infighting and fundraising struggles led to the demise of her campaign in December, an early exit that likely helped preserve her chances to join the ticket.After Wednesday’s speech, Harris’s next big moment will be her debate against Pence in October, but most of her attacks are sure to be directed to the top of the Republican ticket. And how Trump responds could be more revealing than the attacks themselves.Trump has called her a “mad woman,” the “meanest” senator, a “nasty” woman and “disrespectful” to his Supreme Court picks and even Biden himself.“We’ve seen this with Donald Trump going back to 2016,” Devine said. “His response seems to be more aggressive when it comes to being challenged by women as opposed to men.“Kamala Harris could be that threat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-seeks-to-define-role-of-us-vice-president-on-joe-biden-s-ticket/story-r7LaWCY5PZS74WBT5hQNFN.html

19-08-2020||World||Who is Susan B Anthony pardoned by US President Donald Trump?||In an attempt to win the support of women voters in upcoming elections, US President  Donald Trump on Tuesday pardoned women suffrage movement activist Susan B Anthony who was arrested for voting in 1872. Susan B Anthony was an American social reformer and a prominent anti-slavery rights activist but was best known for her role in the 19th century movement to secure voting rights for women. At the age of 52, she was arrested for voting in the 1872 elections held in Rochester, New York, in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. As America celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment—also known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment—President @realDonaldTrump will officially pardon its namesake.News of the day: https://t.co/DaQTQQYSok pic.twitter.com/8s5VlWqxIfAnthony refused to pay the fine and the authorities took no further action against her. Hundred years ago in  1920, her struggles bore fruit and the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution gave women the right to vote.Anthony was an active participant in the abolitionist movement of the 1840s, temperance movement (against consumption of alcoholic beverages), and a founding member of National Woman Suffrage Association (1869). Trump’s pardon comes amid outcry over postal services disruptions that Democrats say could render people unable to vote if they opt for mail-in voting. As a result of the protest, the United States Postal Service (USPS) decided to suspend the proposed operational changes till after the 2020 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-susan-b-anthony-pardoned-by-us-president-donald-trump/story-r2yDURVjvSelcHVTGHYTFI.html
19-08-2020||World||Explained: What is in-mail voting and the debate around it ahead of US elections 2020||The Democratic Party has nominated Joe Biden as its presidential candidate to take on Republican Donald Trump in the November election. The decision was taken at the ongoing convention of the party.The coronavirus pandemic has posed serious problems ahead of the election, and many are pushing for expanded use of postal ballots as against in-person voting to ensure social distancing and stay safe from the disease which has wreaked havoc in the United States.Trump is opposed to the system claiming it will lead to voter fraud. His party has accused that the practice of postal ballots will lead to rigged election.The case for in-mail voting:With the Trump administration openly trying to undermine mail-in voting this fall, some election officials around the country are hoping to bypass the Postal Service by installing lots of ballot drop boxes in libraries, community centres and other public places.Such boxes have been used with success for several years in states like Oregon, Washington and Colorado that rely largely or entirely on ballots that must be sent in. But their use is being expanded because of the coronavirus outbreak.State or local authorities in places such as Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are pressing for more boxes or drop-off sites that would enable ballots to reach election officials without going through the mail.What is in-mail voting:The process is simply sending a vote by mail. In the US, when the election authorities receive such a request, they send ballot to the address of the voter who wants to exercise this option after vetting the application. The voter (or a group of them) can then sign the envelope, casts it and send the ballot boxes back to authorities.Voting by mail is not new in the United States - nearly 1 in 4 voters cast 2016 presidential ballots that way. Routine methods and the decentralised nature of US elections make it very hard to interfere with mailed ballots, experts say.While mail balloting has its drawbacks, it can help minimise the long lines, faulty voting machines and Covid-19-induced staffing shortages that have plagued some elections this year.What are the hurdles?There are 17 states in the US such as Texas, New York and Louisiana that would need to change their policies to guarantee that everyone who wants to vote by mail in November is able to do that.It will be expensive. The Brennan Centre for Justice estimated the cost of ensuring that vote by mail was available for all voters could be up to $1.4 billion, with postage alone costing up to $600 million.How secure is the process?Election experts say it would be nearly impossible for foreign actors to disrupt an election by mailing out fake ballots.Ballots aren’t counted if they aren’t printed on the proper type of paper and don’t include specific technical markings.States also require voters to sign the outside of their envelope, which they match to a signature on file.Some 29 states and the District of Columbia allow voters to track their ballots to ensure they are received, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fourteen states and DC also allow voters to return their ballots by hand if they don’t trust the mail.Those envelopes are typically opened by a different group of workers than those who scan the ballots. Outside observers are allowed to monitor the process to ensure voter privacy.What about incidents of fraud?As with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare.The conservative Heritage Foundation, which has warned of the risks of mail voting, found 14 cases of attempted mail fraud out of roughly 15.5 million ballots cast in Oregon since that state started conducting elections by mail in 1998.How is President Trump dealing with it?Trump made clear last week that he was blocking $25 billion in emergency aid to the Postal Service, acknowledging he wanted to curtail election mail operations, as well as a Democratic proposal to provide $3.6 billion in additional election money to the states to help process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.Trump criticised postal operations and claimed that universal mail-in ballots would be “a disaster”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-in-mail-voting-and-the-debate-around-it-ahead-of-us-elections-2020/story-xvNXQEDFtGjhSu0Ed3B6wJ.html

Last week, in an interview to an American broadcaster, top US expert Anthony Fauci said that he believes the vaccine should be out by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Fauci said that even half an effective vaccine would be enough to get the pandemic in control by the end of 2021. Here are the key developments in the quest to developing the Covid-19 vaccine:• Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate could be the first to be available to the Indian population if it gets the required clearances by the end of this year. Pune-based vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) has already received a nod from for India’s top drug regulatory body for conducting phase-II and III clinical trials on the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine.• Australia has secured access to a “promising” coronavirus vaccine, prime minister Scott Morrison announced on Tuesday. This comes as Australia recently sealed a deal with Swedish-British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to receive the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Oxford University. Morrison said that country would manufacture it and offer free doses to the entire population.• State-owned Chinese pharmaceutical company SinoPharm said its Covid-19 vaccine will be commercially available by the end of the year. Liu Jingzhen, the chairman of the company, told a Chinese daily that the vaccine would cost less than 1,000 yuan ($140). Jingzhen also said that the vaccine would be administered in two shots in a gap of 28 days.Also read: Mild Covid-19 cases can produce strong T cell response - Study• The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a global pact aimed at providing easy and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccine to countries across the globe.

The programme is aimed at delivering 2 billion doses of effective, approved Covid-19 vaccines by the end of next year.• American biotechnology company Moderna, which is the first company in the United States to conduct a Phase III clinical trial of the potential Covid-19 vaccine, is aiming to enrol 30,000 volunteers for its trial, a CNN report stated.

19-08-2020||World||Donald Trump cancels China talks, raising questions about trade deal||President Donald Trump said he called off last weekend’s trade talks with China, raising questions about the future of a trade deal that is now the most stable point in an increasingly tense relationship.“I canceled talks with China,” Trump said Tuesday in Yuma, Arizona. “I don’t want to talk to China right now.”The phase-one trade deal, which came into force in February, had called for discussions on implementation of the agreement every six months. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was supposed to hold a video conference call with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, but it was postponed indefinitely.While China is making many of the structural changes it promised on issues such as intellectual property protection, its purchases of U.S. goods are well below where they need to be to meet promised targets, and there’s almost no chance they can be fulfilled now with the damage Covid-19 has done to the global economy. A collapse of the deal risks leading to a return of the tit-for-tat tariff war that hurt trade and companies around the world.Addressing whether the U.S. would pull out of the phase-one deal, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens.” Terminating the deal would require a written notification and take effect 60 days later, unless both parties agree on a different date.The talks never made it on to any official public calendar in Washington or Beijing, but the South China Morning Post reported that they were set for last Saturday. Earlier, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that information on high-level talks will be released “in due course.”China Is Buying American But Not Enough to Hit Trade Deal TargetTrump has stepped up pressure on China over everything from democracy in Taiwan and Hong Kong to popular apps WeChat and TikTok as he looks to make up ground in the polls before the November election. One of his main goals with the trade deal was to lower the U.S. deficit with China, but now it’s rising again.Even if China can buy enough soybeans, corn or pork to meet its promises on agriculture, it’s unlikely it can buy enough oil and gas to meet the promises on energy. In addition, the collapse of international travel will hit Chinese demand for new U.S. planes and has stopped hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens from traveling to the U.S. for college or tourism, decimating U.S. services exports.Trump has been stepping up complaints about China, particularly over the spread of the coronavirus, which he regularly calls the “China Virus.”“What China did to the world was unthinkable,” Trump said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-cancels-china-talks-raising-questions-about-trade-deal/story-PgOv82VYx57tQCgpU0oBzI.html
19-08-2020||World||Explainer: World Health Organization’s struggle for a global Covid-19 vaccine plan||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday urged countries to join a global pact aimed at ensuring less wealthy countries have access to Covid-19 vaccines, warning about the risks from so-called “vaccine nationalism.” Here is a look at the WHO’s plan and the approaches by wealthier nations.What is the WHO’s vaccine program?The COVAX global vaccines facility is a program designed to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and distribute it equitably around the world. Its aim is to deliver 2 billion doses of effective, approved Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.Also read: New immunity insights a boost against Covid-19The details of the program are still being hashed out ahead of an Aug. 31 deadline for nations to join. It is led by the WHO, along with the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). COVAX is part of a broader program, called the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, that works to ensure that vaccines, treatments, diagnostic tests and other healthcare resources are broadly available to combat the pandemic.What all wealthier nations are doing? They have focused on securing vaccines for their own citizens, striking deals for the first doses even as data has yet to prove the vaccines to be effective. Governments including United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union have spent tens of billions of dollars on deals with vaccine makers such as Pfizer Inc, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc and others. The United States alone has committed nearly $11 billion for development, testing, manufacture and stockpiling of hundreds of millions of doses. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayRussia and China are also working on vaccines and have already begun vaccinating some of their citizens.What kind of resources are being brought to bear?The ACT Accelerator is financed by a variety of nonprofits and governments.

The signal will be lowered to No. 3 between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., it said in a statement on its website.Most businesses close and public transport becomes limited when No. 8 signal or above is in place. The city is already facing its toughest social distancing restrictions so far due to a flare up of coronavirus cases, with restaurants forced to close at 6 p.m., public gatherings of more than two people banned and school lessons taking place online.Hong Kong canceled pre-market trading in the stock market and morning trading in securities market, including Hong Kong-China stock connect trading, and derivatives market has been delayed, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said in a statement.Under exchange rules, the morning trading session will be canceled if signal No. 8 or above is still hoisted at 9 a.m. Hong Kong time.

Tedros said he sent a letter to the WHO’s 194 member states, urging participation.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe global health agency also raised concerns that the pandemic’s spread was being driven now by younger people, many of whom were unaware they were infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Tedros’ push for nations to join COVAX comes as the European Union, Britain, Switzerland and the United States strike deals with companies testing prospective vaccines. Russia and China are also working on vaccines, and the WHO fears national interests could impede global efforts.“We need to prevent vaccine nationalism,” Tedros told a virtual briefing. “Sharing finite supplies strategically and globally is actually in each country’s national interest.”The European Commission has urged EU states to skirt the WHO-led initiative, citing worries over its cost and speed. More than 21.9 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 772,647​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.‘NOT TWISTING ARMS’So far, the COVAX facility has attracted interest from 92 poorer countries hoping for voluntary donations and 80 wealthier countries, a number little changed from a month ago, that would finance the scheme, the WHO said.Still, some nations are waiting for the Aug. 31 deadline before making a commitment as the facility’s terms are still being finalised, Bruce Aylward, who leads the WHO’s ACT Accelerator initiative to speed supplies of Covid-19 diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, said.Read more: India eyes global front runners in Covid-19 vaccine plan“We are not twisting arms for people to join,” Aylward said. “We’ve had more and more discussions with a broader and broader group of players ... to work through what might be the barriers to collaborating - issues around price, issues around timing, issues around national expectations.”With more than 150 vaccines in development, about two dozen in human studies and a handful in late-stage trials, the WHO said even countries signing bilateral deals boost their odds by joining COVAX.“Which one will be the candidate that will be successful, we don’t know yet,” said Mariangela Simao, a WHO assistant director for drug and vaccine access. “By joining the facility at the same time that you do bilateral deals, you’re actually betting on a larger number of vaccine candidates.”COVAX now covers nine vaccine candidates.The WHO remains worried that infections among younger people are rising globally, putting at risk elderly and sick people in densely populated areas with weak health systems. “The epidemic is changing,” WHO Western Pacific regional director, Takeshi Kasai, said. “People in their 20s, 30s and 40s are increasingly driving the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-blasts-vaccine-nationalism-in-last-ditch-push-against-hoarding/story-tprhBIiJo3CR9TN5KXO7cJ.html

Among them is that he wants to consolidate his own position and authority”.“Considering domestic economic and social tensions, as well as those in the party of the last few years, he will think of ways to divert the attention of the Chinese public, provoking conflict with other countries, for example encouraging anti-American sentiment and the recent clash between China and India”, she said, apparently referring to the clash in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.She also criticised Xi on multiple issues including the constitutional amendment removing the two-term limit for the President paving the way for lifelong tenure, secrecy related to coronavirus casualties and not acting to curb the virus when he came to know of it on January 7 this year.She said Xi forced through the amendment of China’s Constitution to abolish term limits for the President in 2018, giving him the ability to stay in power indefinitely.Cai said that China was moving towards disaster “because people cannot speak the truth.The party central school, where Cai worked is an important ideological institution was headed by Xi before he took over power in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cpc-expels-xi-s-critic-who-accused-him-of-provoking-conflict-with-india-to-divert-attention/story-DEr5fqZIQaruULAzFIkHbK.html

The agency has become the focus of a campaign-season battle over whether it will have enough resources to handle an expected flood of mail-in ballots for this November’s presidential and congressional elections.Also read: Democrats set to retain senate, Republicans to keep HouseThe fight between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats has become a critical political battle that weaves together Trump’s troubled handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the deeply wounded economy.It also highlights newly imposed cuts in Postal Service operations that critics say are aimed at curtailing the agency’s ability to deliver mail-in votes in time for them to be counted this November. That has coincided with Trump’s repeated insistence, without foundation, that expected record levels of mail-in votes by people eager to avoid polling places will lead to widespread fraud in the presidential and congressional elections.Under intense public and political pressure, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that he would withhold some of the operational changes he has begun to impose, like the removal of mailboxes, until after the elections.Negotiations over a far larger coronavirus relief bill are expected to resume after Labor Day between the White House and top congressional Democrats. With Democrats demanding that bargainers piece together a wide-ranging measure, the trimmer package emerging from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the emerging legislation will provide $300 weekly in extra federal payments for unemployed people above the state payments that beneficiaries receive. He said he believes the extra payments would run through 2020.A massive relief bill approved earlier this year provided $600 extra per week, but those payments expired at the end of July. Democrats want to continue the added $600 in payments, but Trump and congressional Republicans have pushed for less.Blunt said the trimmed-down measure would also have money for schools to cope with the coronavirus pandemic and for businesses struggling to stay open and retain employees during a staggering recession that has shuttered many companies.A second GOP Senate aide said the new proposal includes $105 billion for education.That aide said the plan also has $16 billion for virus testing and $29 billion for developing vaccines, manufacturing treatment and other initiatives aimed at conquering a virus that has killed more than 170,000 Americans and infected more than 5 million this year.The bill does not include a renewal of the one-time direct payments of up to $1,200 for taxpayers and dependents that were part of early legislation aimed at providing relief to people as the economy slowed to a near halt.The Democratic-led House approved a $3 trillion relief plan in May, while Senate Republicans offered a $1 trillion package. In negotiations between Democrats and the White House that dissolved in bitterness earlier this month, Democrats dropped their proposal to $2 trillion and asked Republicans to meet them at that halfway point, but that has not happened.The two GOP aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the legislation publicly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-preparing-500-billion-covid-19-relief-proposal/story-NVfwpRrJDUVEexp5Y4AONM.html

President Donald Trump on Jan. 31 barred nearly all non-US citizens from traveling to the United States from China.United Airlines said Tuesday it will increase flights to China to four flights per week from San Francisco to Shanghai starting Sept. 4, while the department said Delta Air Lines was also eligible to go from two-times weekly to four-times weekly.Delta is also going to four flights after it said in June it would operate flights to Shanghai from Seattle and Detroit beginning in July, all via Seoul. On Tuesday, Delta it would add one weekly flight from Detroit and Seattle each to Shanghai, via Seoul, beginning Aug. 24.Also read: Flights under air bubble agreement between India and Canada start Aug 15The US government still hopes China will agree to restore full US flight rights under their bilateral aviation agreement, the Transportation Department has said, adding as China allows additional flights it will respond in kind.The US-China agreement allows both countries to operate more than 100 weekly flights between the two nations.The United States had threatened to bar Chinese passenger flights in June after Beijing did not immediately agree to restore flights by US airlines.In May, the Trump administration said Air China, China Eastern Airlines Corp, China Southern Airlines Co, Hainan Airlines Holding Co and their subsidiaries had to file schedules.Chinese authorities previously agreed to some changes on requirements for US carriers, including allowing temperature checks to be done before flights take off for China, rather than mid-flight as previously discussed, Reuters reported in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-u-s-will-allow-air-carriers-to-double-flights-between-nations/story-vE4LsdkuT2cCIdq219jOON.html

19-08-2020||World||Mali’s president and prime minister held by mutinous troops||Soldiers detained Mali’s president and prime minister Tuesday after surrounding a residence and firing into the air in an apparent coup attempt after several months of demonstrations calling for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s ouster.The soldiers moved freely through the streets of Bamako, making it increasingly clear that they were in control of the capital city. There was no immediate comment from the troops, who hailed from the same military barracks in Kati where an earlier coup originated more than eight years ago.African Union chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat condemned the “forced detention” of Malian leaders and called for their immediate release. He rejected “any attempt at the unconstitutional change of government.”The developments were also condemned by the United States, the United Nations, the regional bloc known as ECOWAS and former colonizer France, which along with a UN peacekeeping mission has worked since 2013 to stabilize the West African nation.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sought “the immediate restoration of constitutional order and rule of law,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.Tuesday’s political upheaval threatened to further jeopardize security in Mali, where the 2012 coup allowed an Islamic insurgency to take hold amid a power vacuum.But news of Keita’s detention was met with celebration throughout the capital by anti-government protesters who first took to the streets back in June to demand that the president step down three years before the end of his final term.The detention was a dramatic change of fortune for Keita, who seven years earlier emerged from a field of more than two dozen candidates to win Mali’s first democratic election post-coup in a landslide with more than 77 percent of the vote.Regional mediators from ECOWAS failed to bridge the impasse between Keita’s government and opposition leaders, creating mounting anxiety about another military-led change of power.Then on Tuesday, soldiers in the garrison town of Kati took weapons from the armory at the barracks and detained senior military officers. Anti-government protesters immediately cheered the soldiers’ actions, some even setting fire to a building that belongs to Mali’s justice minister in the capital.Hours earlier, Prime Minister Boubou Cisse urged the soldiers to put down their arms.“There is no problem whose solution cannot be found through dialogue,” he said in a communique.But the wheels already were in motion — armed men began detaining people in the capital of Bamako too, including the country’s finance minister, Abdoulaye Daffe.Keita, who has tried to meet protesters’ demands through a series of concessions since the demonstrations began, has also enjoyed broad support from France and other Western allies.“The U.S. is opposed to all unconstitutional changes of government whether in the streets or by security forces,” tweeted J. Peter Pham, the State Department’s special envoy for the Sahel region.It was a troubling repeat of the events leading up to the 2012 coup, which unleashed years of chaos in Mali when the ensuing power vacuum allowed Islamic extremists to seize control of northern towns. Ultimately a French-led military operation ousted the jihadists, but they merely regrouped and expanded their reach during Keita’s presidency into central Mali.On March 21, 2012, a similar mutiny erupted at the Kati military camp as rank-and-file soldiers began rioting and then broke into the camp’s armory. After grabbing weapons, they later headed for the seat of government under the leadership of Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo.Sanogo was later forced to hand over power to a civilian transitional government, which then organized the election Keita won.The current president has faced growing criticism of his government’s handling of the Islamic insurgency engulfing the country once praised as a model of democracy in the region. A wave of particularly deadly attacks in the north last year prompted the government to close its most vulnerable outposts as part of a reorganization aimed at stemming the losses.Regional mediators have urged Keita to share power in a unity government, but those overtures were swiftly rejected by opposition leaders who said they would not stop short of Keita’s ouster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mali-s-president-and-prime-minister-held-by-mutinous-troops/story-XK3mslaKuMQYWcWya0G8rI.html
19-08-2020||World||Flu season will be a test run for the US’s biggest-ever vaccine campaign||This fall, the US will need to vaccinate huge numbers of Americans in the middle of a public-health crisis. It will also be a valuable dry run should a coronavirus shot arrive months later.The annual US flu vaccine campaign has been cast into disarray by Covid-19, with people staying away from pharmacies, schools, offices, hospitals and other places where they typically get their shots. But with fears of a flu surge colliding with the coronavirus pandemic, health authorities are looking at how one vaccine effort can inform the other. In Denver, public-health officials are trying to increase the number of adults who get the flu vaccine this year to 65% from 45%. To do it, they’re setting up “strike teams” that can go from school to school giving vaccines, vans that can stop at construction sites and inoculate workers, and doing outreach to hard-to-reach communities.“This whole model that we’re building can then be moved into Covid,” said Judith Shlay a physician and associate director at Denver Public Health.In Baltimore, the city has several vans it sends out to conduct Covid-19 testing, targeting high-risk residents. It will likely use those vehicles for flu vaccines and then Covid-19, City Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said in an interview.“Our flu vaccine distribution will inform a Covid vaccine distribution,” Dzirasa said.The federal government has helped lead development of a vaccine, issuing more than $4 billion in contracts to drugmakers. The money is meant to speed production and cut financial risk for the most promising of the dozens of inoculations in development. President Donald Trump has said a shot could be ready by November, though other experts inside his government predict it will be well into 2021 before most Americans have access to one.So far, federal health authorities have offered little detail about their plans for administering vaccines. The U.S. has said that it will likely rely on the private sector to distribute the shots, and last week extended a contract to health-care supplier McKesson Corp potentially worth more than $300 million. But the government has said almost nothing about who will get the shots first, where they’ll be given, and how to make sure they get to hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities.At least 170,000 people in the US have died of the virus, many of them as a new surge of cases has expanded outside the Northeast to other parts of the country. While new cases have fallen from last month’s daily high of almost 80,000, new outbreaks are being reported in schools and colleges as students return, forcing some to shut days or weeks after opening. This week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans a call with health-care providers to discuss flu vaccination, along with guidance for delivering vaccines during the pandemic and operating “large vaccination clinics held in satellite, temporary, or off-site locations.”In the meantime, local authorities are still awaiting clarity. “We have not heard anything yet,’ Baltimore’s Dzirasa said. The US has been consulting with experts and medical ethicists on Covid-19 vaccine allocation plans. The government plans to work with the existing medical-distribution network to get shots to the public, said a senior Trump administration official, with possible help from the Defense Department.Never Done BeforeThere is no single national US flu vaccination campaign, per se. American and global health authorities pick the flu strains to target, drugmakers manufacture the shots, and they’re given by workplaces, schools, drugstores, local public-health departments, physicians and hospitals.The federal government typically plays a role in financing and promoting the vaccines, but not in physically distributing them. This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has purchased 9 million doses of the adult flu vaccine, compared with 500,000 in a normal year.The scale of the vaccination campaign needed for Covid-19 will be a daunting logistical challenge, said Howard Markel, a physician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Past efforts to vaccinate against pandemic threats have fallen short.“We’ve never vaccinated an entire American population,” he said in an interview.In 1976, after an outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix in New Jersey, the Gerald Ford administration planned a mass vaccination program to prevent a pandemic. “They were held in large gymnasiums and public meeting places,” said Markel, who recalled getting the shot when he was 16. “It was really very much an assembly line.”The vaccination drive was dismantled after several cases of Guillen-Barre syndrome were identified in people who got the shots. A US review of the campaign in 2003 confirmed the increase in cases of the disease, which can cause a form of muscle weakness or temporary paralysis, though the exact biological link between the vaccine and the condition wasn’t established.  In 2009, the H1N1 flu pandemic prompted another effort to quickly produce vaccines. Ultimately, only about 20% of the population got the shot, Markel said.“It is an enormous task, no question about it,” Markel said.Public-health officials will also have to overcome reluctance by some Americans to get a shot. An Aug. 7 Gallup poll found that one-third of people would not get a Covid-19 vaccine when it’s ready, even if it was free. And some Americans have rejected basic public health measures like wearing masks or social distancing, raising more questions about how willing they are to participate in a vaccine campaign.Some vaccine infrastructure already exists. A surge in demand for Covid-19 tests had drugstore chains, states and cities set up sites where people could line up or drive through. And the H1N1 flu pandemic also provided a roadmap for mass vaccination, said CVS Health Corp. Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo.“That was really the spark plug,” Merlo said in an interview this month. The company is in planning sessions with officials for an eventual coronavirus vaccine, Merlo said.A spokesperson for Walgreens, the next-largest US pharmacy chain behind CVS, said both existing testing and immunization infrastructure will support the future delivery of Covid vaccines.Sanofi, the French drugmaker that’s working with GlaxoSmithKline Plc on a coronavirus vaccine, said it’s been in touch with CVS and other drugstores about vaccination plans.“I would suspect that some of the blueprint that we’ve developed for flu immunization will also hopefully be a blueprint for Covid-19 vaccination,” said Elaine O’Hara, Sanofi’s head of vaccines for North America.Denver PlanAt Denver’s public health department, Shlay said she began thinking about how to deliver Covid-19 vaccines back in June.  She knew childhood immunizations had dropped sharply since March, when Covid shut things down, and she thought her agency could build a model to get a Covid-19 vaccine to people who need it.Under a $1 million grant from the CARES Act, the federal stimulus law to respond to the pandemic, her team has begun working on alternative flu vaccination strategies. The strike teams they are developing will be targeted at 84 schools where vaccination rates have slipped. And the agency is working with leaders from the Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American communities to bring flu-shot sites into neighborhoods.Particular outreach will focus on uninsured and unemployed adults — some of the same people are more likely to be hospitalized if they get sick — along with essential workers and people who are homeless.“We are going to try to reach that group that people don’t always think about,” Shlay said.There will be challenges making the switch to Covid-19. Early vaccines are expected to require two shots weeks apart, compared with a single flu dose. Health officials will have to keep careful registries of who has received which shots when, and make sure to reach people when their second doses are due. They’ll also have to handle the logistics of keeping vaccines refrigerated at the proper temperature.“A two-dose Covid vaccine will be much more complicated,” Shlay said. That’s part of the reason Denver health officials are planning now. “Covid has made us do things quicker than we’ve ever done before, and so we figure it out and we do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flu-season-will-be-a-test-run-for-the-us-s-biggest-ever-vaccine-campaign/story-RLXpYYoFrkWYclkrqWnkVL.html

My dad, Mark Anthony Urquiza, should be here today, but he isn’t... My dad was a healthy 65-year-old.” Lifelong Republicans vouch for Joe Biden John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, was among a group of senior Republicans who spoke at the convention about their inability to support Trump in the White House. Kasich said, “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country. That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times.”Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York, said, “I’ve known Donald Trump for most of my political career. So disappointing, and lately so disturbing.” ‘The Rising’ plays, and The Boss approvesDemocrats used Bruce Springsteen’s The Rising as background score for a searing video of Trump’s handling of the many crises of his presidency — caging illegal immigrants, rising racism, the Covid-19 pandemic and the anti-racism protests that followed George Floyd’s killing.Springsteen had written the song after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. The Democratic National Committee said the song highlights the resilience of the American people in overcoming the crises.The Boss, as Springsteen is called, approved. He retweeted a Joe Biden post of the video. “Come on up for #therising,” he added, using a line from the song.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trusting-trump-was-dad-s-only-pre-existing-condition/story-xPvWpLr2JXWfTDLhbP93jM.html
19-08-2020||World||Mauritius arrests Indian captain of Japanese ship that spilled oil||Authorities in Mauritius have arrested the Indian captain of the Japanese ship that ran aground near Mauritius and spilled 1,000 tons of oil on the Indian Ocean island’s protected coastline.Sunil Kumar Nandeshwar, captain of the MV Wakashio and who is from India, was charged with “endangering safe navigation” and is in custody pending a bail hearing next week, Police inspector Sivo Coothen said Tuesday.The ship’s first officer was also charged and is being held, he said.“We are carrying out a full investigation and interviewing all the crew members,” Coothen said.The Wakasio ran aground a coral reef on July 25 and after being pounded by heavy waves for several days the vessel cracked and started leaking oil on August 6. The damaged ship spilled more than 1,000 tonnes of its cargo of 4,000 tons of fuel into the turquoise waters of the Mahebourg Lagoon, one of the island’s most pristine coastal areas.Most of the remaining 3,000 tonnes of fuel was pumped off the ship before it split into two but environmental groups warned that the damage to the surrounding coral reefs could be irreversible.The Wakashio was meant to stay at least 10 miles (16 kilometers) from shore but it ran aground just a mile from the island. Owner Nagashiki Shipping is investigating why the ship went off course and it has sent experts to help clean up the damage. The Mauritius government is seeking compensation from the company.The Mauritius government is under pressure to explain why immediate action wasn’t taken to empty the ship of its fuel before it began to leak. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth earlier blamed bad weather for the slow response.Environmentalists in Mauritius are objecting to plans to pull the bow of the ship — the smaller part of the Wakashio — out to sea and allow it to sink. The larger part of the ship will be dragged off the coral reef where it ran aground and towed away, possibly to India for salvage.“Authorities say they will tow the bow eight nautical miles out to sea and sink it in the waters that are 2,000 feet deep,” said Sunil Dowarkasing, an environmental consultant and former member of parliament in Mauritius.“But that area is where whales give birth and nurse their young,” said Dowarkasing. “The sunken bow could badly affect that critical area. So the environmental impact of that plan should be fully considered.” The Mauritius government has closed off the coastal area of the eastern part of the island, where thousands of civilian volunteers worked for days to try to minimize damage to the Mahebourg lagoon and protected marine wetlands polluted by the spilled fuel.Only officials and hired workers are permitted to work in the coastal area and the waters surrounding the grounded ship.Experts from France, Japan and the United Nations are also involved in the clean-up work.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the UN Development Program has allocated $200,000 to address the immediate impact of the spill.The International Maritime Organization, the UN Environment Program and the UN humanitarian office have deployed an oil spill expert to support the government, Dujarric said. And UN agencies are also supporting the public health response, assessing the risks to communities, providing forensic investigation and legal support, and using U.N. satellite imagery and analysis to help with remote mapping.After the government declared an environmental emergency, thousands of volunteers rushed to the shore to create makeshift oil barriers from tunnels of fabric stuffed with sugar cane leaves and even human hair, with empty plastic bottles tucked in to keep them afloat.The island nation of some 1.3 million people relies heavily on tourism and already had taken a severe hit due to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mauritius-arrests-indian-captain-of-japanese-ship-that-spilled-oil/story-zWEFWA4sFw2SmnuULlXcDP.html

19-08-2020||World||Half of UK’s population enjoy Rishi Sunak’s 50% eat-out discount||Over 35 million meals have so far been served under chancellor Rishi Sunak’s novel scheme that pays 50% of bills up to a maximum of £10 per person on food and non-alcoholic drinks from Monday to Wednesday in August, new figures released on Tuesday show.The ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme, intended to help the struggling hospitality industry and encourage people to return to a Covid-secure sense of normalcy, is offered by over 85,000 restaurants across the UK, including several serving Indian delicacies.A sum of £500 million has been allocated for the scheme that ends on August 31. Restaurants have reported ‘berserk’ business during Mondays to Wednesdays, but lower sales during the weekend.Sunak said: “Today’s figures show that Britain is eating out to help out – with at least 35 million meals served up in the first two weeks alone, that is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part and supporting local jobs in the hospitality sector”.“To build back better we must protect as many jobs as possible, that is why I am urging all registered businesses to make the most of this by claiming back today – it’s free, simple and pays out within 5 working days”, he added.The scheme aims to help protect the jobs of the hospitality industry’s 1.8 million employees by encouraging people to safely return to their local restaurants, cafes and pubs where social-distancing rules allow.Official figures show that nearly 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed, the highest of any sector.The scheme has been widely welcomed, but some doubted its economic logic.Jim Harra, chief executive of revenue and customs, questioned its value for money, writing to Sunak before the scheme was rolled out: “By nature, this is a novel scheme meaning there are also particular value for money risks surrounding the level of potential losses that could arise”.The Guardian called the scheme ‘junk policy’ in an editorial: “As policy…it is glib, gimmicky and, even Mr Sunak admits, a waste of millions of pounds. Junk, then, served up by a politician who should know much better”.“(His) error is in treating the slump in trade as driven by cost, rather than caution. Discounts and VAT cuts…will not lure out those diners who are worried that they may pick up a lethal virus, or that they may be about to lose their job”.“Others will take up the government’s offer by enjoying a slap-up meal at a discount on a Wednesday night rather than at full price on a Friday, thus defeating the entire purpose of the policy”, the editorial added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-uk-s-population-enjoy-rishi-sunak-s-50-eat-out-discount/story-XuBYL1TdHPg6D3G9supYPL.html
19-08-2020||World||Despite US sanctions bid, Iran aims to keep nuclear deal alive until US polls||The fate of a fragile 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers hinges on the result of the US presidential election in November, not a planned US bid this week to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Tehran, said several Iranian officials. When Iran agreed to sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program, Tehran warned that it would no longer stick to the deal if any of the parties sparked a so-called snapback of sanctions at the UN Security Council, a backstop included in the accord in case Iran stopped complying. US President Donald Trump’s administration plans this week to use that snapback provision, even though it quit the deal in 2018 and the move is opposed by the remaining parties to the accord - Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran. But despite Tehran’s declaration five years ago, three senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran’s leadership is determined to remain committed to the nuclear deal, hoping that a victory by Trump’s political rival Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election will salvage the pact. “Right now the decision is to remain in the deal even if Americans make their biggest mistake of triggering the snapback mechanism,” said a senior official, on condition of anonymity, who is involved in the discussions about Iran’s nuclear policy. “We will be still here, but Trump might not be at the White House in a few months,” the official said. Biden has said he would rejoin the nuclear deal, but only if Iran first returned to compliance. The accord was agreed by former US President Barack Obama’s administration, when Biden was vice president. A second Iranian official - a former nuclear negotiator - said Iran was “technically and politically” ready to quit.“But we have to be smart and not to fall in the U.S. trap which wants to push Iran out of the deal,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Enormous Leverage Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has described the next few weeks and months as critical for the nuclear deal. To trigger a return if all UN sanctions on Iran the United States will submit a complaint to the 15-member Security Council about Iran’s non-compliance with the nuclear deal.In response to what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign - a bid to get Iran to negotiate a new deal - Tehran has breached several central limits of the 2015 deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium.But diplomats say the snapback process will be tough and messy as Russia, China and other countries on the Security Council challenge the legality of the US move given Washington itself is no longer complying with what Trump called “worst deal ever” and has imposed strong unilateral sanctions on Iran.A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the US move to spark a return of all UN sanctions would risk “destroying” the nuclear deal, but “it will be a completely contested procedure so the snapback will have no effect, it will not be recognized by others.”The United States argues it can trigger the return of the sanctions because it is still named as a participant to the nuclear deal in a 2015 UN Security Council resolution that enshrines the agreement. A second European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “the overwhelming majority of the international community” believe the United States cannot trigger snapback. Outgoing US Iran envoy Brian Hook said on Tuesday that the nuclear deal, while well intentioned, had failed to deter Iran.“We have put in place enormous leverage for a (Trump) second term to get the kind of outcomes that we’re going to need,” he told a United Against Nuclear Iran think tank event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-us-sanctions-bid-iran-aims-to-keep-nuclear-deal-alive-until-us-polls/story-bs3OKKtGtu45q2TLKukVpO.html
19-08-2020||World||Mali’s President resigns after detention by mutinous soldiers||Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita resigned from his post and dissolved his government and parliament after he was detained by soldiers in a crisis that escalated following weeks of protests.“If elements of the army felt compelled to intervene to bring an end to this, I have no choice but to comply,” Keita, 75, said minutes after midnight Wednesday in an address broadcast on state television. “I don’t want a single drop of blood to be shed.”Tensions have run high in the West African nation since tens of thousands of people started gathering weeks ago to demand that Keita, who’s known as IBK, resign. While the protests started over discontent with his refusal to raise wages for teachers and doctors, they later widened to include criticism over alleged corruption and nepotism within the administration.On Tuesday, rebellious soldiers took Keita to military barracks in Mali’s biggest garrison town of Kati, on the outskirts of the capital, Bamako, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Prime Minister Boubou Cisse was also arrested, one of the people said.Efforts by the Economic Community of West African States to mediate between the government and protesters had so far failed. The opposition demonstrations have been led by Mahmoud Dicko, a conservative, Saudi-trained preacher who’s been a vocal critic of the government for several years.Ecowas condemned the overthrow of the Keita’s “democratically elected government” in a statement emailed hours before the leader’s televised speech, and called for the organization’s forces to be on standby. The bloc also announced sanctions that included closing borders and the suspension of trade.The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, urged Ecowas, the United Nations and other international organizations to join efforts and “oppose the use of force to resolve the political crisis in Mali,” according to a post on his Twitter account.The United Nations also condemned the soldiers’ actions Tuesday and called for “the immediate restoration of constitutional order and rule of law in Mali,” a spokesman for the Secretary-General said in a statement on the organization’s website.Power VacuumThe situation in Mali is reminiscent of the 2012 ouster of Keita’s predecessor, Amadou Toumani Toure, by junior officers angry about the lack of resources needed to fight Tuareg rebels in the north. The subsequent power vacuum was exploited by al-Qaeda-linked Islamist groups who seized control of the north. A French military intervention pushed back the insurgents, but some groups later returned and expanded to carry out attacks on civilians and about 15,000 UN peacekeepers in the country.“The international community will be perturbed by the mutiny,” Alexandre Raymakers, senior Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said in a research note. “France will fear it will worsen the ongoing political crisis, creating a major political vacuum and derail efforts to contain the growing insurgency,” he said before Keita was seized by the soldiers.The government’s inability to quash the Islamist insurgencies, which have claimed thousands of lives, fueled many of the protests against Keita. The leader assumed office on a wave of optimism after 2013 elections, but critics said he didn’t fulfill any of his campaign pledges after his 2018 re-election.(Updates with background, Ecowas threat to deploy force from fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mali-s-president-resigns-after-detention-by-mutinous-soldiers/story-hRACi6DY3d2KoSlzzvCgJO.html
19-08-2020||India||Daily deaths cross 1,000 for the third time in last 10 days||New Delhi: The daily death toll from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India crossed the 1,000-mark for the third time in the last 10 days as the country reported 1,103 new fatalities on Tuesday, highlighting the recent rise in number of daily deaths in the country. Before Tuesday, daily deaths in the country have crossed the 1,000-mark four times – 2,004 fatalities were lodged on June 16; 1,130 deaths registered on July 22; 1,018 deaths on August 9 and 1,010 deaths on August 13. On the first instance (June 16), the cause of the spike in daily deaths was Delhi and Maharashtra reporting a reconciliation of deaths. On the second instance (July 22), the death reconciliation panel in Chennai corrected discrepancy in the city’s Covid-19 numbers by adding 444 deaths to the toll. This means that all actual instances of the daily deaths touching four-digits (if we exclude days when backdated deaths were lodged in the tally) have been reported in the past 10 days. “Country’s current case fatality rate is under 2%, which means fewer Covid-19 patients in India are dying of the disease. The sudden rise in mortality figures on some days does not necessarily mean these are deaths that happened in a single day rather it could also be because of the data backlog sometimes,” explained a government official in the know of things, who did not wish to be identified. The total cases in the country have climbed to 2,763,712 as of Tuesday night. Among these, a total of 53,010 people have died, while 2,034,828 patients have recovered and been discharged. At present, there are 675,874 active cases in the country. India has the third highest number of infections in the world after the United States (5.6 million cases and over 175,000 deaths) and Brazil (3.4 million cases and over 110,000 deaths). However, India’s case fatality ratio – the proportion of confirmed cases that end up dying – is far lower than the other two nations. Around 1.9% of Covid patients in India have succumbed to the disease, while 3.1% cases have resulted in deaths in the US and 3.2% in Brazil. Globally, there have been more than 21 million cases of the coronavirus disease and 773,152 deaths – taking the global CFR to 3.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-deaths-cross-1-000-for-the-third-time-in-last-10-days/story-7KEXzh9fnnqBLWJxLbWDWN.html
19-08-2020||India||GST meet to focus on compensation to states||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council has scheduled two crucial meetings -- on August 27 it will consider a proposal to borrow money from the market to compensate states for their revenue shortfalls, and on September 19 the apex federal body will take up other issues such as resolution of the inverted duty structure, tax on pan masala and more measures for ease of doing business, two officials said.As told by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after the 40th meeting of the council on June 12, the August 27 meeting will be special as it will discuss only one matter how to pay compensation to states at a time when the compensation cess collection has plunged because of weak economic activities due to Covid-19 pandemic, the officials said requesting anonymity.While briefing reporters after the 40th meeting, Sitharaman had said on request of members the Council would meet again in July to discuss only “one-agenda item” -- compensation to states. “Compensation, which has to be given to states, and, if at all, it results into some kind of borrowing, how and who is going to pay for it,” she had said. The meeting was, however, deferred to August, due to some technical reasons, officials said.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco products. The 41st meeting of the Council is to resolve the difference between the Centre and states over the responsibility of the cess liability. While states argue that it is the Centre’s responsibility to pay compensation in time, the Centre cited the GST law where the responsibility lies with the GST Council, the officials said. GST Council is headed by the Union finance minister and finance ministers of states are its members. Usually, the Council’s decisions are unanimous. One of the officials mentioned above said although the GST law assured a 14% increase in annual tax revenue of states, but GST collection in 2020-21 is unlikely see such growth. “There is virtually no money left to pay compensation to states from April 2020, hence market borrowing is one of the solutions, but who will take the guarantee is a big question that needs to be resolved,” he said. The states were paid Rs 1,65,302 crore GST compensation in 2019-20, even as total cess collection for the fiscal year was a mere Rs 95,444 crore. This gap is expected to be larger this year because of pandemic, he said. “Law is very clear, compensation has to be paid from the amount collected through compensation cess and not from the Consolidated Fund of India,” he added. According to a note circulated in the 40th GST Council meeting held on June 12, compensation cess collected in 2017-18 was Rs 62,612 crore, rose to Rs 95,081 crore in 2018-19 and further to Rs 95,444 crore in 2019-20. Compensation paid in 2017-18 was however, less than the total collection at Rs 41,146 crore and Rs 69,275 crore in 2018-19.Officials said it is up to the Council to find a solution, how to augment revenue collection and how to pay the compensation. Theoretically, the options before the Council for meeting the shortfall could be to rationalise tax rates, include more items under the compensation cess or increase the compensation cess, or recommend higher borrowing by states to be repaid by the future collection into the compensation fund, they said. States, particularly ruled by the Opposition parties, however, said that timely payment of full compensation is the responsibility of the Union government. Officials said, the 42nd meeting of the Council on September 19 is generic in nature and may consider revising tax on several items that suffer from inverted duty such as fertilisers, footwears, renewable energy devices, tractors and man-made yarns and fabrics. Inverted duty structure is a situation in which inputs are taxed at a higher rate than finished goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-meet-to-focus-on-compensation-to-states/story-52Hj4zCJP1i4hL1ISZHYqI.html
19-08-2020||India||Cong urges NBSA to regulate TV debates||New Delhi: A Congress delegation on Wednesday urged the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) to strictly enforce a code of conduct to curb the “sensationalist, slanderous and toxic nature” of televised debates and ensure that they do not become a platform to spread acrimony. The delegation, comprising spokespersons Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Jaiveer Shergill, and party secretary Pranav Jha, held a virtual meeting with NBSA chairperson Justice (retd) AK Sikri and other members, and urged them to issue an advisory to all the media houses in this regard. The meeting followed a representation filed by Shergill on August 14 in the wake of the death of his party colleague Rajiv Tyagi, who suffered a heart attack hours after participating in a TV debate on August 12.On behalf of the Congress delegation, Singhvi argued that media houses, journalists, anchors and spokespersons must be held accountable for their actions and conduct. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) holds the authority to ensure compliance with its guidelines and instructions, he said. “The TRP paradigm drives the sensational, slanderous and sardonic debate panels. There is an eminent need for adherence to the code of conduct and need for institutional reform in India with respect to holding of TV debates,” Singhvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-urges-nbsa-to-regulate-tv-debates/story-7puuCJKRmw8x6fevZd9hKN.html
19-08-2020||India||KTR’s role in governance triggers speculation that he may be Telangana’s next CM||The proactive role being played by Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and state industries and information technology minister KT Rama Rao in the Telangana government has triggered fresh speculation that he may take over the mantle from his father K Chandrasekhar Rao, as the chief minister soon. For the last few weeks, KTR, as the chief minister’s son is popularly known, has been addressing official meetings and holding virtual conferences. There have been instances of KTR holding official meetings of other departments as well – like the meeting on Kaleshwaram irrigation project he had held on July 3 – which was attended by senior officials of these departments. What led to the latest speculation about KTR’s role as de facto chief minister was an informal meeting of the council of ministers convened by him in the absence of his father to discuss food processing and logistics at Pragati Bhavan, the camp office of the chief minister last week. Apart from all his cabinet colleagues, the meeting was attended by top bureaucrats including chief secretary Somesh Kumar, government chief advisor Rajiv Sharma, principal secretaries of various departments and Telangana state planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar. Though KTR clarified later that he had held the eight-hour long meeting with all his cabinet colleagues to discuss the food processing and logistics policies “as directed by the chief minister,” it led to a debate as to whether KCR was slowly delegating his powers to his son. Telangana Congress legislature party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka raised objections over KTR heading a cabinet meeting in the absence of the chief minister. “In what capacity and under which rule did KTR chair the cabinet meeting? Was the chief minister not in a position to attend the cabinet meeting?” he asked. Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said there was no clarity as to whether it was a cabinet meeting with a specific agenda and protocol or just an informal meeting of the council of ministers. “If it was not a formal cabinet meeting, it cannot be questioned technically. But politically, it shows KTR’s clout as the chief minister’s son. One wonders whether any other minister – be it finance minister T Harish Rao or health minister Eatala Rajender can call for such informal cabinet meetings,” he said. Unlike his father who is mostly confined to running the government from Pragati Bhavan, KTR has been extensively touring districts to inspect the implementation of government schemes and holding official meetings. He prefers to go to the people and interact with them directly to solve their issues. When the entire northern Telangana region was reeling under heavy floods, the chief minister was confined to his camp office reviewing the situation, while KTR chose to make a whirlwind tour of the affected areas to personally monitor the relief and rehabilitation measures. “Wherever KTR goes, the official machinery in the district goes providing him with all protocol measures though he is only one of the cabinet ministers, because he is the chief minister’s son,” an official in the revenue department said on condition of anonymity. Interestingly, KTR’s visit to the flood-hit areas of Warangal and other parts was covered by the publicity wing of the CMO, rather than his personal public relations team. The official release and the photographs were shared with the media by the CMO, lending credence to the speculations that KTR might be on his way to being the next CM. TRS legislator from Bodhan in Nizamabad district Mohammad Shakeel expressed hope that KTR would be made the chief minister of the state soon. “Young and dynamic minister KT Rama Rao has all the abilities and eligibility to become the CM of the state,” he observed. Nageshwar said there was no surprise if it happened sooner or later. “When KTR was made the TRS working president soon after the December 2018 elections, it was evident that he would succeed KCR. It is only a matter of time that KTR is anointed as the chief minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktr-s-role-in-governance-triggers-speculation-that-he-may-be-telangana-s-next-cm/story-LSmItY54MRJVph7ViZ4ScN.html
19-08-2020||India||Cabinet approves new agency to streamline govt recruitment||New Delhi: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to set up a National Recruitment Agency (NRA), which will conduct a common eligibility test (CET) for all non-gazetted posts including Group B and Group C (non-technical) jobs, setting in motion a major move aimed at streamlining government recruitment.Under the new system, around 25 million aspirants, who appear for separate, multiple examinations to join more than 125,000 government jobs every year, will have to take a single online exam whose score will be valid for a period of three years and will serve as a preliminary screening mark for all eligible posts across various central government agencies.The creation of NRA was first proposed by the government in Union Budget 2020. “The #NationalRecruitmentAgency will prove to be a boon for crores of youngsters. Through the Common Eligibility Test, it will eliminate multiple tests and save precious time as well as resources. This will also be a big boost to transparency,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted soon after Wednesday’s Cabinet announcement. NRA, which will have representatives from the ministry of railways, ministry of finance/department of financial services, the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), has been envisioned as “a specialist body bringing the state of the art technology and best practices to the field of central government recruitment”, according to a press release by the government.“At present, candidates seeking government jobs have to appear for separate examinations conducted by multiple recruiting agencies for various posts, for which similar eligibility conditions have been prescribed. Candidates have to pay fee to multiple recruiting agencies and also have to travel long distances for appearing in various exams,” the release said. “These multiple recruitment examinations are a burden on the candidates, as also on the respective recruitment agencies, involving avoidable/repetitive expenditure, law and order/security related issues and venue related problems. A common eligibility Test would enable these candidates to appear once and apply to any or all of these recruitment agencies for the higher level of examination. This would indeed be a boon to all the candidates,” it added. Officials aware of the matter that under the new CET system, no limit on the numbers of attempts will be imposed on the candidates taking the exam. They added that the test will be conducted for the graduate, higher secondary (12th pass) and the matriculate (10th pass) levels with a common curriculum, and will serve as a screening system based on which candidates can apply for jobs in different government agencies. Based on their CET score, the candidates may have to take additional examinations at the agency level.The government said it will also work towards enhancing examination infrastructure across the country with special focus on 117 aspirational districts. “#CabinetDecision to set up National Recruitment Agency (NRA) to conduct Common Eligibility Test (CET) for preliminary selection to various Government vacancies is a revolutionary reform brought in by visionary intervention of PM @narendramodi,” minister for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh, wrote on Twitter. “This will bring ease of recruitment, ease of selection and thereby ease of living for aspirant candidates. It will provide level playing field, a great boon particularly for economically deprived who cannot afford travelling to multiple centres, youth in far flung areas with difficulty to reach different centres and women candidates who are unable to travel to different cities because of constraints of travel and stay,” he added. “There are more than 20 recruitment agencies in the central government,” department of personnel and training secretary C Chandramouli said at a press conference. “Right now, we are bringing three agencies under the National Recruitment Agency and will eventually bring all of them under it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-likely-to-begin-around-sept-10/story-JYkP6Zi5lk3vVY9iKSzOjP.html
19-08-2020||India||Why SC ordered CBI probe in Sushant case||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of film actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Here are five factors the top court cited while ordering a CBI probe, and the laws and procedures it invoked:1. Maharashtra police yet to launch full investigationThe court noted that the Maharashtra police was only conducting a limited inquiry under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) into the cause of unnatural death of Rajput.Section 174 of CrPC confers powers on police to enquire into suicide death, find out the reason for such death, and submit a report of the same to the district magistrate. The Supreme Court said that an inquiry under Section 174 is limited in scope and cannot be equated to a full-fledged investigation. Mumbai Police has only made the limited inquiry under Section 174 and has not registered a first information report (FIR) into the incident.2. Patna police has jurisdiction to register FIRRajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty argued that Bihar Police does not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter and register an FIR since the incident occurred in Mumbai. The Supreme Court, however, turned this down stating that registration of FIR is mandated when information on cognisable offence is received by the police.“Precedents suggest that at the stage of investigation, it cannot be said that the concerned police station does not have territorial jurisdiction to investigate the case,” the court said in its judgment.Moreover, Rajput’s father, whose complaint was the basis for Bihar police to register an FIR, alleged criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of money. The consequences of the incident would , therefore, arise in Patna as well. “The allegation relating to criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of money which were to be eventually accounted for in Patna (where the Complainant resides), could prima facie indicate the lawful jurisdiction of the Patna police,” the court held.The finding that an FIR by Bihar Police was valid turned out to be crucial because CBI took over the probe based on the request made by Bihar Police.3. Need for independent agency due to conflict between two state governmentsThe apex court noted that there is a conflict between the two state governments in the matter, and though the steps taken by Mumbai Police cannot be faulted, stakeholders have raised allegations of unfair investigation against Mumbai Police.“Because both states are making acrimonious allegations of political interference against each other, the legitimacy of the investigation has come under a cloud. This court (Supreme Court) must strive to ensure that search for the truth is undertaken by an independent agency, not controlled by either of the two state governments,” the judgment said.4. Need to avoid uncertaintyThe court said that CBI has already registered a case and commenced investigation at the instance of the Bihar government. If Mumbai Police also decides to commence probe, then it could add to uncertainty and confusion.“Uncertainty and confusion must be avoided in the event of Mumbai Police also deciding to simultaneously investigate the offence, based on their findings,” the judgment said.5. Justice for Rajput’s father and RheaThe court noted that Rajput was a talented actor in the Mumbai film world and died well before his full potential could be realised. An impartial probe and its outcome will ensure that Rajput’s father and Rhea get justice. Moreover, Rhea herself had called for CBI investigation, the court added. “His family, friends and admirers are keenly waiting the outcome of the investigation so that all the speculations floating around can be put to rest. Therefore a fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour,” the court said.Law invoked by Supreme CourtThe court invoked Article 142 of the Constitution, which confers wide power on the Supreme Court to pass an order for doing “complete justice” in the matter before it. It is invoked to grant reliefs which are beyond the scope of the petition or not sought by the petitioners.The court invoked the Article in this case stating that to ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter, it would be appropriate to exercise the powers conferred by the said Article.Supreme Court’s powers to order a CBI probeAs per Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, CBI can investigate a crime only based on the recommendation of the concerned state which is probing the matter.However, that does not bar constitutional courts (high courts and the Supreme Court) from recommending CBI probe as has been held in a long line of Supreme Court judgments in the past, the court said.‘No power to transfer investigation’Chakraborty had filed the transfer petition under section 406 of CrPC seeking transfer of probe from Bihar to Maharashtra. Section 406 confers powers on the Supreme Court to transfer cases from one high court to another or from a lower court in one state to a lower court in another state.The Supreme Court held that the provision does not grant power to the top court to transfer a matter which is only at the investigation stage from one state to another.“Having considered the contour of the power under Cection 406 CrPC, it must be concluded that only cases and appeals (not investigation) can be transferred,” the court ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-sc-ordered-cbi-probe-in-sushant-case/story-HHek830xe9MmGPA6cwmIDL.html
19-08-2020||India||Another round of India-China talks likely soon||New Delhi: India and China will hold another round of talks on Thursday under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs in an effort to break the impasse along the Line of Control (LAC), people familiar with developments said. The meeting between diplomats of the two sides, to be held via video conference, comes at a time when military talks on reducing tensions along the disputed border have hit a roadblock, and the Indian Army has adopted a tougher line in its efforts to restore status quo ante in eastern Ladakh. This will be the fifth engagement at the diplomatic level since the border standoff emerged into the open in early May, and the Indian side is expected to reiterate its call for China to work sincerely towards complete disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Amid a growing realisation in New Delhi that there is unlikely to be a breakthrough through the talks between the corps commanders, the Indian envoy in Beijing, Vikram Misri, has been tasked to reach out to top Chinese leaders to discuss ways to end the standoff, the people said. Misri met Maj Gen Ci Guowei of the Central Military Commission’s (CMC) office of international military cooperation, and Liu Jianchao, deputy director of the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) central committee’s foreign affairs commission, in Beijing last week. The people said more such meetings were on the cards. There was no official word from either India or China on the WMCC meeting, though the people said it would meet on Thursday afternoon. “We have already said China needs to work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation on the LAC as the future of the bilateral relationship is dependent on the situation along the border. That continues to be our position,” said one of the people cited above. The Indian side has also made it clear that the sanctity of the LAC is non-negotiable, the people added. Five rounds of talks between the corps commanders have failed to break the deadlock due to serious differences in the Finger Area near Pangong Lake and the PLA’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims as Indian territory. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said India had shown “ample commitment and efforts” to end the standoff and much would now depend on China’s response. “It seems to me the WMCC meeting should show some of the results of the efforts by our envoy in Beijing, who has met officials of CPC and CMC. These meetings were also put in the public domain by the Indian side to reflect the sincerity of its efforts through all possible channels,” he said. “There is also a feeling among military experts that the talks at the military level should now stop, as this matter should really be the responsibility of diplomats and the standoff should be addressed through the existing political and diplomatic channels,” he added. “The Chinese are playing things down and saying that they attach importance to our relations and that they want good ties. We should keep an open mind and hope they will start responding meaningfully to India’s efforts,” Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-round-of-india-china-talks-likely-soon/story-dA7JBtNqxNxgCFoV8Y2pMN.html
19-08-2020||India||Govt orders withdrawal of 10k paramilitary forces from J&K||New Delhi: The Union government on Wednesday decided to immediately withdraw 100 companies (around 10,000 personnel) of central paramilitary forces from Jammu and Kashmir after a security review, officials familiar with matter said on condition of anonymity. The central paramilitary forces whose companies were withdrawn on Wednesday are 40 companies of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and 20 each of Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). The ministry of home affairs has asked them to report to their respective locations. Earlier, the MHA withdrew around 82 companies (72 in December 2019 and 10 in May this year) from the valley based on feedback from the forces and intelligence agencies. With the latest decision, around 400 additional companies of paramilitary forces are still deployed in J&K in additional to CRPF’s regular 67 battalions (around 67,000 personnel) and army and J&K police. The officials cited above said the decision was taken because the security situation in the valley has improved and terrorists are on the back foot. The officers added that large number of troops were deployed in the valley for over a year now, but that they now need to rest and also get back to training. The security grid in J&K was strengthened with an additional 600 odd companies (around 60000 troops) being rushed there just ahead of government’s decision to withdraw the special status of J&K and bifurcate it into two union territories on August 5, 2019. These troops were stationed at various locations in different districts and were deployed in law and order duties, counter terror operations as well to keep stone-pelting protestors at bay. Senior officers deployed in the valley have claimed that locals don’t disrupt the counter-terror operations anymore and there is more support from public in general. According to latest government data, the number of stone pelting incidents has drastically reduced this year as compared to 2019 and 2018. In 2018, there were 532 incidents of stone pelting in Kashmir, and there were 389 in 2019 but only 102 such incidents have been reported thus far this year. One officer said that there could be more withdrawal of troops in the coming weeks but enough numbers will be maintained in valley to make sure terrorists and Pakistan doesn’t take advantage. “It’s a welcome step and obviously it means that security situation is well under control,” former RAW Chief A S Dulat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-orders-withdrawal-of-10k-paramilitary-forces-from-j-k/story-faTFsmpqTZKQtMDqOxeUBJ.html

At present there are more than 1.16 crore below poverty line (BPL) and Antyodaya cards holders in the state covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA), as per the state government’s data. The CM’s announcement comes before the bypolls to as many as 27 assembly constituencies, which will decide the fate of the BJP government. The communiqué quoting the CM said, “The poor of the state, who were not getting fair price ration till now, will now get wheat, rice and salt at the rate of Re 1 per kg from September 1. Every month, 5 kg fair price ration per person will be given. Apart from this, 5 kg free ration per person will also be provided to poor families till the month of November. As many as 37 lakh poor beneficiaries will gain from the decision taken by the government.” As per the official information, CM has instructed all the collectors to ensure issuance of eligibility slips to all new beneficiaries and their aadhaar number seeding by August 31, so that they could get ration from September 01.

State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “Why chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan reminds himself of the poor only before elections. It was before the 2018 assembly polls that he talked of labourers of unorganised sector and now ahead of assembly bypolls he has announced food for the 37 lakh beneficiaries. But the fact is neither did his government give benefit to the poor earlier nor does he intend to benefit them now. His announcements are purely vote-politics-driven announcements which are never implemented.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-cm-announces-re-1-per-kg-wheat-rice-and-salt-to-37-lakh-poor-opposition-calls-it-vote-politics/story-lhZxrXYkyyck365JSC3p5O.html
19-08-2020||India||Ahead of Assam polls, AASU-AJYCP takes first step at forming political party||Thirty-five years after the formation of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) took the first step at forming a new political party on Wednesday. Both organisations, which played a crucial role in the six-year anti-foreigner agitation that culminated with the signing of Assam Accord in 1985 and had spearheaded the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) stir in the state, have formed an advisory committee to suggest a way forward. “In view of the continuous betrayals from various ruling parties, the committee has been formed with the aim of securing the future of Assam and Assamese people. The committee will give AASU and AJYCP a roadmap for the future,” said AASU president Dipanka Kumar Nath while addressing a press conference. The 16-member committee comprises former Asom Sahitya Sabha president Nagen Saikia, eminent author Arup Kumar Dutta—both as advisors, and several other renowned personalities like the national award-winning filmmaker Jahnu Barua and former Meghalaya Governor Ranjit Shekhar Mooshahay. Assembly elections are due in Assam in April next year and the new political outfit, once it is formed, would attempt to dislodge the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Asom Gana Parishad (AGP)-Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) combine. “When we were involved in the anti-CAA stir and visited all corners of Assam, people from all walks had urged us to take steps to ensure a bright future for Assam. Formation of the committee is a step in that regard,” said AJYCP president Rana Pratap Baruah. The signing of the Assam Accord in 1985 was expected to detect and deport illegal migrants of Bangladeshi origin staying in Assam as well as seal borders with the neighbouring nation. But 35 years down the line, that hasn’t materialized yet. The Centre’s move to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan through the enactment of CAA was seen as a move that would lead to large scale influx of Bangladeshis to Assam---something which AASU, AJYCP and various other organizations opposed and protested against. “Taking suggestions from the public on how to take the anti-CAA stir forward and securing a bright future for Assam’s indigenous people were reasons for forming the committee. Based on their suggestions, timely and required steps would be taken. We would like to stress that both AASU and AJYCP would remain apolitical,” said AASU’s chief adviser Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya. The decision by AASU and AJYCP, two of the biggest organizations in the state, to test political waters ahead of the assembly elections is seen as significant for the outcome of the polls. “We are forming an anti-BJP alliance and don’t want the division of votes, which could benefit the ruling dispensation. We will ask AASU’s outfit as well to join our camp. It is for them to decide what they want to do,” Congress MLA and leader of opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia said on Tuesday. Opposition Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), who are planning to join hands against the BJP-AGP-BPF combine, is expecting the new outfit to join their camp. “We welcome the creation of a new political party, but AASU must make it clear how it will remain apolitical after forming a party. We hope they don’t join hands with Congress and AIUDF for sake of power. Our government is focused on implementing the Assam Accord and are confident of winning,” said BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami. After signing of the Assam Accord, several AASU leaders like Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and Bhrigu Kumar Phukan who were at the forefront of the agitation against foreigners formed AGP and came to power in 1985 with Mahanta becoming the state’s as well as India’s youngest chief minister. The party came to power again in 1996 with Mahanta at the helm. In the next few years, it lost a sizeable chunk of its vote bank to BJP, the biggest party in the state at present. Incidentally, the incumbent Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal was also a former president of AASU before he moved to AGP and later to BJP. “AASU, as well as AJYCP, need to clearly spell out the reasons for planning to start a political party. Is it to defeat the ruling BJP-led coalition or to uphold regional aspirations?” questioned Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science at Gauhati University. “It seems they are not aware of the strengths of the party in power or have overlooked it. Formation of a political party seems like a face-saving gesture after the anti-CAA stir. When AGP was formed, AASU had completely dissociated itself from the process. But by not doing so this time, the organization may be putting its image at stake,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-assam-polls-aasu-ajycp-takes-first-step-at-forming-political-party/story-ZShQ2gEzBolSP4yuv3sxyH.html

The CCMB revealed the study findings on Wednesday. Both CCMB and IICT are institutions working under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).According to the study, Covid-19 infected individuals release virus not only through nasal and oral routes but also through faeces.“This provides an opportunity to use sewage/wastewater samples to estimate the spread of the infection in a given locality or area. The SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples is non-infectious, thus making sewage samples suitable for epidemiological studies,” a CCMB release said. The team of scientists from CCMB and IICT harvested and processed sewage samples from major sewerage treatment plants (STPs) for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA to estimate the number of potentially infected individuals in the city.The study covered about 80 percent of the STPs.“Since only 40% of Hyderabad’s sewage reaches STPs, this data can be used to extrapolate the overall number of potentially infected people, which turned out to be approximately 6.6 lakhs, that is, around 6.6% of the city’s population. A conservative estimate of active cases shedding the virus may be around 2.6 lakh,” the CCMB release said. Also Read: Emergency authorisation of Covid vaccine could be considered if govt decides: ICMR The cases include symptomatic, asymptomatic, and also recently recovered individuals in a time window of about 35 days. “The findings are posted on preprint server, MedRxiv, which is yet to be peer reviewed”, the CCMB release added. Also Read: Mystery grows over Covid-19 spread via contaminated food packaging“Our finding clearly indicates that a large segment of the affected individuals is asymptomatic and did not need hospitalisation. This is also in agreement with the observation that hospitalisation rush or mortality (rate) is way lower than otherwise expected with such a large infection rate at a given time. It explains why our healthcare system has been able to handle the situation reasonably well during the pandemic,” CCMB director Dr Rakesh Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sars-cov-2-may-have-infected-6-6-lakh-hyderabadis-reveals-a-sewerage-study/story-5t2RmqFOjKuhEZpdvmHw8J.html

The apex court also disposed of approximately 4,300 cases during this period.August 20 will be the 100th working day for the Supreme Court through the video conference facility.The court started hearing cases through video conference on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The top court also issued a circular on March 23 suspending entry of lawyers and litigants to the court premises and directing that only extremely urgent cases would be taken up for hearing through video conferencing during the lockdown period.The summer vacation which is usually seven weeks long was cut short to two weeks this year so as to make up for the reduced number of cases which are being heard through video conference.The hearings in the Supreme Court are conducted through the Vidyo app which can be downloaded on mobile phones and desktop. The platform is hosted on the servers of the National Data Centre of National Informatics Centre.While the judges on the bench join the video conference from the residence of one of the judges or the Supreme Court, the lawyers join from their respective houses or chambers.The number of benches hearing cases through video conference has increased steadily with time and so has the number of cases which are being heard per day. Initially the court used to hear 15 to 20 cases per day with 1 or 2 benches sitting each day. Currently, 5 to 6 benches sit everyday and hear more than 200 cases per day.The number is still less in comparison to normal times when at least 500 to 700 cases are heard by the apex court on a single day alone.The court is expected to resume physical hearing of cases in a limited manner in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-completes-100-days-of-hearing-cases-via-video-conferencing-over-15-000-cases-heard/story-bYRkmnFAwaYI5tcqa839aL.html
19-08-2020||India||Emergency authorisation of Covid vaccine could be considered if govt decides: ICMR||A top ICMR official told a parliamentary panel on Wednesday that phase-two clinical trial of two indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidates have almost been completed and emergency authorisation of a vaccine could be considered if the Centre decides so.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava informed members of the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs that the vaccine candidates developed by Bharat Biotech, Cadila and the Serum Institute of India are at different stages of trial, said an MP present in the meeting.The Covid-19 vaccine candidates coordinated by Bharat Biotech and Cadila are nearing completion of phase-two trails.The one being handled by the Serum Institute of India and developed by Oxford University will enter phase-2 (b) trials this weekend for which 1,700 patients have been identified at 17 centres across the country, the MP said.According to MPs who attended the meeting, when asked how long people will have to live with the pandemic, Bhargava replied that normally the final trial takes about six to nine months but if the governments decides, an emergency authorisation could be considered.Responding to queries by the panel about the saliva test cleared by FDA in the US for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, Bhargava said informed that taking samples from gargled water is already under consideration and further details will be available soon, said another MP who attended the meeting.Members of the parliamentary committee cutting across party lines complemented the ICMR in particular and the medical fraternity in general for their committed role in fighting the pandemic.They appreciated the ICMR for its pioneering role in coordinating the scientific and medical aspects of the battle against Covid-19 and appreciated AIIMS, Delhi, for its effective contribution as a lead mentor for hospitals across the country on various aspects of the pandemic management.The committee members expressed concern over stigmatisation of infected people both by kin and neighbours and noted that those afflicted by Covid-19 and have recovered are not harmful, instead beneficial to the society.About the mental stress among the people due to the pandemic, ICMR agreed to the panel members’ suggestion of reviewing the existing limited set of guidelines relating to management of psychological stress, an MP in the panel said.The apex medical research body also told the committee that it may soon come out with comprehensive revised guidelines so as to help all the concerned to cope with the stress caused by the outbreak of the viral disease. Among various issues raised, the panel members drew the ICMR’s attention to the situation being faced by school children in particular, as with online learning they are required to spend long hours in front of computers and other gadgets which is adversely impacting their eyesight and causing psychological stress.The meeting, chaired by senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma, lasted for over four hours and discussed various aspects of management of the Covid-19 pandemic and also its impact on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector. Secretary, Ministry of MSMEs, Arvind Kumar Sharma also appeared before the panel and briefed it about the impact of pandemic on the sector.Chairman of the parliamentary standing committee Anand Sharma stressed that the sector which contributes 50 per cent of the total exports, 30 per cent of GDP besides employing over 11 crore people was among the worst hit by the pandemic.The Secretary in the Ministry of MSMEs informed the panel that only 9 per cent of the total 6.33 crore MSME units have been shut due to the pandemic and there has been an improvement in capacity utilisation over the last few months. Anand Sharma said the committee would like to present a detailed report on the handling of pandemic to both the Houses of Parliament in the Monsoon Session based on the experiences of various stakeholders and lessons learned which would serve as a useful guide for the future, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emergency-authorisation-of-covid-vaccine-could-be-considered-if-govt-decides-icmr/story-7yoDvUApT7eS0NVd5srIGM.html

19-08-2020||India||Odisha man builds memorial for electrocuted elephant to honour his mother’s word||The death of an elephant in a region where they get electrocuted, run over by speeding trains and trucks, or hunted by poachers is mostly a matter of statistics for state wildlife department, but a 62-year-old tribal man in Keonjhar district was determined not to let it remain just like that.In November 2009, when a tusker from Jyotipur reserve forest stomped towards paddy field near Jali village of Champua block in Keonjhar district on Odisha-Jharkhand border, little did it know about the sagging electric lines. But no sooner did it reach the paddy field of Padmini Naik to chew on the ripening paddy after quenching its thirst at the nearby river, the tusker raised its trunk only to touch the sagging high voltage power lines. Within seconds it fell to the ground as huge amounts of electric current coursed through its body.“My mother was too shocked about the elephant dying on our field as she considered her vehicle of Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth. She asked me to build a memorial for the dead elephant on our paddy field where it died. She was so heartbroken over the death that she did not take food for next 2-3 days,” said Dr Krushna Chandra Naik, son of Padmini.Respecting her mother’s wish, Dr Naik, a retired Odia teacher in a local college in January 2019 erected a 35-feet tall memorial for the dead elephant on the same paddy field and called it “Hathi Minar”.“After the elephant’s death, my mother kept telling me and my younger brother that the pachyderm’s death was a bad omen. The next year my younger brother died in a road accident and a year later, my mother passed away too. The twin tragedies steeled my resolve to build the elephant memorial at any cost,” said the retired teacher.With her mother’s last wish to see a memorial for the elephant uppermost on his mind, Naik started earmarking a portion of his profits from the farm and dipped into his personal savings. Though villagers suffered crop loss to rampaging elephants, they also came forward to help him in construction of the memorial. He donated five acres of land to develop the site into a children’s park and planted 30,000 saplings for a herbal garden.“In January 2019 I opened it to the public where people could come and pay tribute to the fallen elephant. More than 5000 people had gathered at the site for inauguration of the Hati Minar. Since then, people have been flocking to the place,” said Naik. “I hope the memorial makes people aware of the importance of elephants who are facing a massive crisis of habitat.”After the death of the tusker in 2009, there have been numerous incidents of elephants being electrocuted in Keonjhar district, known for iron and manganese mines. In June this year, two elephants — an eight-year-old tusker and a 30-year-old female elephant — were found electrocuted dead in Baitarani reserve forest of the district raising suspicion of poaching.The district, which had 112 elephants in 2002 reported just 40 in 2017 elephant census, mostly due to large-scale mining as the pachyderms deserted the area for neighbouring Dhenkanal district. The destruction of elephant habitats has seen rising human-elephant conflicts over the years. In January this year, a 10-year-old girl in Hariharpur village of the district was trampled to death by a rampaging tusker while she was playing outside her home. In 2019-20, as many as 115 people were killed and 132 injured in 204 human-elephant encounters in Odisha.Noted elephant conservationist Biswajit Mohanty said Padmini Naik deserves a posthumous award for her enormous contribution to elephant conservation awareness for public. “The distressed elephants of Odisha face an uncertain and dangerous future and the safety of our national heritage animal in Odisha is in peril. Once the pride of Odisha, the state has turned into a graveyard for elephants. I hope more and more people would visit the elephant memorial so that they become a little more sympathetic towards the majestic animal,” said Mohanty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-man-builds-memorial-for-electrocuted-elephant-to-honour-his-mother-s-word/story-9KuJGf9lycahpeocodYm3O.html
19-08-2020||India||On maiden visit to Tonk after his rebellion, Pilot wants Congress workers to be rewarded||Former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot on Wednesday said that everyone who had worked to bring the Congress party to power in the state should be involved in the government on the basis of their seniority and merit. On his first visit to his assembly constituency Tonk, after the rebellion in mid-July, Pilot said people who struggled with him for six and a half years should be sufficiently rewarded even as he maintained that he had no attraction for top posts. “When I came here as PCC president six-and-a-half years ago, we were only 21 MLAs. People used to say the Congress cannot rise again because there’s Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan and Narendra Modi in Delhi… People who faced lathis, demonstrated on streets, organised marches and sit-ins, did gheraos and went to districts should be sufficiently rewarded for their contribution and sacrifice according to their seniority and merit,” Pilot said at the Circuit House in Tonk. “I have not asked for any post for myself – I am happy being among my people,” he added. Pilot, along with 18 other Congress MLAs, had camped in Haryana, demanding a change of leadership in the government. Three Independent MLAs had also supported him. The Ashok Gehlot government herded the remaining Congress MLAs in a hotel and removed Pilot, Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena from the council of ministers for the rebellion that had put the government at the risk of being toppled. The stalemate was resolved after the Congress party decided to form a three-member committee to redress issues raised by the Pilot camp. Earlier, Pilot had said at his Jaipur residence that the committee will solve “all issues”. “The Congress president has formed the committee very fast. It will discuss and decide how it wants us to work. Whatever we need to say, we will say on the party platform so that our issues reach the high command through the committee,” Pilot said before leaving for Tonk. He said the road map that the party had decided for Rajasthan would be implemented soon. On the question of whether he would be back in the council of ministers, Pilot said members of the committee will decide who needs to be used where. “The party will decide who should work in the government and who should work in the organization,” said the former president of the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC). “All issues will be discussed with the committee and solutions will come from this committee only,” he added. The Congress leader said he loved being among the people. “People have supported me in every condition so I want to be with them to share their sorrows and pain and to ensure their participation in governance,” he said. Pilot visited Tonk last in April when he had reviewed the management of Covid-19 in the district. He said on the Covid-19 front a lot of work has been done. “We should not become complacent and work more to control the rise of this infection,” he said. The Congress leader received a grand welcome on the way to Tonk, especially in Chaksu, the constituency of Ved Prakash Solanki, who was in the Pilot camp during the political turmoil in the state. Several people turned up to garland Pilot and welcome him. Pilot also received a grand welcome in Tonk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-maiden-visit-to-tonk-after-his-rebellion-pilot-wants-congress-workers-to-be-rewarded/story-3EEiGUxZ9nmEkCB8afuyaI.html

Shobharam, a resident of Bayadipura in Manawar tehsil of Dhar district, was spotted by people at Dhar district headquarters on Tuesday morning when he reached the examination centre-- Bhoj Girls Higher Secondary School-- pedalling the bicycle with his son, a class 10 student, sitting on the frame of the cycle.Shobharam said, “After the lockdown restrictions buses came to a halt. The buses are not operating even now. There was no one to help me at the village, hence I decided to come here on my bicycle. I left from Dhar on Sunday night itself and stayed overnight at Manawar town. I reached Mandu at 4 am on Tuesday and the exam centre at Dhar just 15 minutes before the examination was to begin.” He said he will stay in Dhar till August 24 when his son’s examinations will get over. He has brought food grains and other essential items to cook meals stuffed in a gunny bag which he carried on the bicycle. He said, “Though I am a labourer and not a literate, I have a dream for my son that he becomes an officer. Since there is no teacher and tuition available in the village, my son couldn’t get good marks in three subjects. We came here since my son didn’t want to lose the opportunity to write the exam again and pass it.” Shobharam’s son is supposed to write his exam under MP State Open School Board’s Ruk Jana Nahi scheme under which the students of class 10 and 12 who couldn’t pass the examinations conducted by MP Board of Secondary Education are given another chance to clear the test. But since the re-exam centre was chosen at the district headquarters, the father and the son had to travel more than 100 kilometres.

It’s really inspiring. Since they are supposed to stay here till August 24, we have made an arrangement for their lodging and food and we will also make arrangements for their travel back to their village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-pedals-bicycle-for-105-km-to-take-son-to-exam-centre-he-has-a-dream/story-dxZMZMpV8wR5CBraFvWLcJ.html

Conducted by CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the study said individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 shed virus not only through nasal and oral routes but also through faeces.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage In a joint effort, CCMB and IICT harvested the sewage samples of different sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the city to estimate the number of potentially infected individuals, it said. According to the study, 80 per cent of the STPs revealed nearly two lakh people are shedding viral materials and only 40 per cent of the sewage reach STPs which may indicate that about six lakh people in the city carried or are carrying the virus. “This study, covering about 80 per cent of the STPs in Hyderabad, revealed that there are nearly 2 lakh people who are shedding viral materials. Since only 40 per cent of the sewage reach STPs, this data can be used to extrapolate the overall number of potentially infected people, which turned out to be approximately six lakh, that is, around six per cent of the population, which includes symptomatic, asymptomatic, and also recently recovered individuals in a time window of about 35 days,” the CCMB said. The findings are posted on preprint server MedRxiv, which is yet to be peer reviewed, it added. According to a press release from the Telangana government, as on August 18, there are 95,700 positive cases reported in the state. Director, CCMB, Rakesh Mishra said if such studies are carried out in coordination with civic bodies, it would help identify the hotspots and take necessary measures. “Our finding clearly indicates that a large proportion of the affected individuals are asymptomatic and did not need hospitalisation. This is also in agreement with the observation that hospitalisation rush or mortality is way lower than otherwise expected with such a large infection rates at a given time,” the CCMB director said. “It explains why our healthcare system has been able to handle reasonably well the situation during the pandemic,” he said.

19-08-2020||India||Bengal BJP targets CM Mamata Banerjee with new anti-corruption campaign||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit on Wednesday launched a new campaign against corruption to mount pressure on the ruling Trinamool Congress before the upcoming 2021 assembly elections. The campaign has been named ‘Bengal against corruption’. Though it does not specifically name Mamata Banerjee it is obvious that she is the target because the campaign’s posters and video focus on the words “Satatar Pratik” (symbol of honesty), which TMC had earlier used in election cutouts and billboards carrying Banerjee’s image. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh launched the public helpline (7044070440) which is registered as ‘Durnitir biruddhe Dilip Da’ (Dilip Da against corruption) and an e-mail id (durnitirbiruddhe@amaderdilipda.in). “Anybody can call this number between 10 am and 5 pm on weekdays and let us know about any type of corruption in any part of West Bengal. We will look into it,” said Ghosh. BJP also launched the campaign’s video on YouTube which has been compiled with media reports exposing corruption such as irregularities in distribution of relief after Cyclone Amphan, corruption in mid-day meal in schools and chit fund scams in which several TMC leaders were accused. Ghosh’s voice plays in the background of the video. TMC leaders did not react to the BJP campaign, but the party uploaded on a social media platform, a letter from the Japan-based United Nations World Peace Association (UNWPA) addressed to TMC minister Nirmal Maji. The letter says that UNWPA got to know from its representative that the state government has done a commendable job during the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bjp-targets-cm-mamata-banerjee-with-new-anti-corruption-campaign/story-ZTJfhjZi2hXT1s6VefjltM.html
19-08-2020||India||Ganga surges, flowing above danger mark in Patna, further rise in level likely||After the north Bihar rivers, the Ganga is in spate, crossing the danger level (DL) at Patna and Bhagalpur on Wednesday, inundating a vast stretch of diara areas and low-lying areas in the bordering Saran district.Officials of the water resources department (WRD) have been put on alert following the release of more than 1.25 lakh cusec of water from Bansagar dam in the Sone River. Currently, the Sone is being fed in the range of 47,000 to 53,000 cusec water from Indrapuri barrage in Dehri. Officials said that the water released from Bansagar dam in Madhya Pradesh may take a couple of days to reach Patna. The Sone is a tributary of the Ganga River.The Ganga has crossed the DL (48.60 metre) by 11 cm at the Gandhi Ghat in Patna, 21cm at Hathidan and by 18cm at Kahalgaon. The river may top the DL at Digha and Buxar soon, if the current rising trend is any indication, said a WRD engineer.Alarmed by the situation, WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha undertook an inspection of the Gandhi Ghat and other ghats in Patna and reviewed the department’s preparations to meet any eventuality. The minister, however, ruled out any immediate threat of flooding to Patna from Ganga as the river was flowing about 1.85 metre below the highest flood level (HFL) of 50.52 metres at Gandhi Ghat, registered in 2016.Meanwhile, the rivers of north Bihar like Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Khiroi and Ghaghra continued to flow above the DL at different stretches in Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Khagaria and Siwan districts.“The rivers are exerting tremendous pressure on their respective embankments at several points. WRD engineers are maintaining round the clock vigil and carrying out flood fighting work to protect the embankments,” said an executive engineer engaged in flood protection works.Heavy discharge from Valmikinagar barrage in Gandak has complicated the problems for people in East Champaran, Gopalganj and Saran districts, which are facing floods after the river breached embankments in the concerned districts. Countering the charges of lapses on part of the officials, WRD minister Jha said the breach in embankments on Gandak was due to the unprecedented discharge of water from Valmikinagar barrage from Nepal side.“On July 20, around 4.34 lakh cusec water was released in the river. Heavy rains in Champaran, amounting to 200mm in a day, have added to around 1 lakh cusec water in the already swollen river,” said the minister.The minister said that WRD officials tried to keep the flow of the river within the embankments by putting extra sacks of sands and other materials. “But the water overtopped the reinforced embankment and demolished it at three places in East Champaran and Gopalganj despite the best of flood fighting efforts. WRD staff, however, managed to prevent the breach at more than 100 by resorting to mechanized and manual strengthening of embankments,” said Jha.According to the disaster management department (DMD), flood waters have flushed into five more panchayats, taking the total count of panchayats hit by the floods to 1,317 in 130 blocks of 16 districts. More than 81.67 lakh people have so far been hit by the floods. The current spell of floods has claimed 25 lives across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganga-surges-flowing-above-danger-mark-in-patna-further-rise-in-level-likely/story-3U8Y3z283nlPg8IXWojYQK.html

The CBI, which took over the probe into an FIR registered by the Bihar Police on the basis of a compaint by Rajput’s father KK Singh, is yet to visit the megacity regarding the investigation. It has collected relevant material from the Bihar police and has also spoken to some stakeholders in the case, they said. The Supreme Court on Wednesday handed over the probe to the CBI which has already registered an FIR in the matter.Also read | ‘Truth will remain same, whichever agency investigates’: Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer on SC order “The investigation releated to death of Sushant Singh Rajput is continuing. A CBI team will visit Mumbai in due course for further investigation. Other details cannot be shared at this stage,” CBI Spokesperson RK Gaur said. Rajput, 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14 and since then Mumbai Police was probing the case but was yet to file an FIR in the case. The top court’s verdict came on a plea filed by actress Rhea Chakraborty who sought transfer of an FIR, lodged against her and six others at Patna by Rajput’s father accusing them of abetting the actor’s suicide, to Mumbai.Also read | Nitish claims vindication in Sushant case, says it is about justice, not politics The court noted that while Rajput’s father and the Bihar government have alleged that Mumbai Police is attempting to shield the real culprits under political pressure, the Maharashtra government has strongly refuted it saying Patna Police has no jurisdiction to investigate the crime as the incident has taken place in Mumbai. It said political interference has been alleged against both the states and that has the potential of discrediting the investigation. The legal process must therefore be focused upon revelation of the correct facts through credible and legally acceptable investigation. It must be determined whether the unnatural death was the result of some criminal acts. In order to lend credibility to the investigation and its conclusion, it would be desirable in my view, to specify the authority, which should conduct the investigation in this matter,  the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-cbi-team-to-visit-mumbai-for-probe-into-actor-s-death/story-HnQYGSF2EliiHhLSTxbQ8K.html
19-08-2020||India||Centre withdraws 10,000 soldiers from Kashmir to send a message||A security review last week on Jammu and Kashmir led the government to order the withdrawal of 10,000 troops from the union territory, a move that is seen as part of the Centre’s outreach to the Kashmir valley. The review was ordered by the Home Minister Amit Shah when he was still recuperating in a Gurugram hospital earlier this month.The review, and the withdrawal of about 100 companies of central security forces, comes around the time that the government has spotlighted development activities and appointed senior politician Manoj Sinha as Lieutenant Governor of the centrally-administered territory.An official underscored that the timing of the two developments, one after another, was not a coincidence, but designed to message people that the government was willing to address their concerns.One view has been that far too many security personnel are deployed in the union territory to prevent about 200 hardcore terrorists trained across the border from carrying out strikes.Also Read: New L-G Manoj Sinha fuels hope of political revival in J&KAt last week’s security review, there was some acknowledgement within the security establishment that the forces could do with fewer numbers, particularly given its successes over the last one year in eliminating top terrorist commanders. Security officials have also claimed that there has been some improvement in how the public responds to counter-terror operations.A team of security officers next travelled to Jammu and Kashmir on 15 August to interact with field commanders and lay the groundwork for the troop withdrawal. A few hours before the team landed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi - addressing the nation from Red Fort in Delhi - described the past year as ‘a very important milestone’ for the development journey of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions and spoke about assembly elections in J&K as soon as the election commission completes the delimitation exercise.“It was felt that the kind of force deployed in J&K may be fairly construed to be disproportionate under the existing security situation, which could lead to inconvenience to the local population,” a top police officer who was part of the process told Hindustan Times.Apart from top army commanders, top officers of the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force and other central and forces were part of the review.There was a view that instead of relying too much on check-posts in Srinagar and elsewhere in the valley, the security establishment should step up reliance on technology to target terrorists. Simultaneously, the security forces in the Kashmir valley have also been told to carry out more night domination patrols to restrict movement of terrorists in districts that are counted as terror hotspots such as Kulgam and Anantnag districts in south Kashmir and Baramulla district in the north.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-withdraws-10-000-soldiers-from-kashmir-to-send-a-message/story-dRvpuA9uQuG8gbRS6ae5fP.html

Koshyari, who succeeds Satya Pal Malik, will hold additional charge as the Governor of Goa. Earlier today, Malik left Goa in a special flight from Goa’s Dabolim airport and is expected to take charge as the Governor of Meghalaya succeeding Tathagata Roy. The Governor was sworn in by the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court Dipankar Datta, who also flew down to Goa for the ceremony. Koshyari took oath in Konkani, Goa’s official language reading out from the text and despite some fumbling appeared fairly deft at the language. On his arrival, Koshyari was welcomed to the state by chief minister Pramod Sawant, Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat, chief secretary Parimal Rai. Malik it is believed was transferred out of Goa as his relationship with chief minister Pramod Sawant quickly soured due to his differences with the chief minister on at least three occasions. He also regularly hosted delegations of people and politicians who sought his intervention on various issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-gets-additional-charge-of-goa/story-NDOIJI0zhiXNLFFlaWh0CK.html
19-08-2020||India||Centre withdraws nearly 10,000 security personnel from Jammu and Kashmir||The Centre on Wednesday decided to withdraw 100 companies (around 10,000 personnel) of central paramilitary forces from Jammu and Kashmir after a security review, officials familiar with the development said. They said the decision was taken as a large number of troops were deployed in the valley for more than one and a half years now who needed to be rested. Significantly, the security situation in the valley has improved and terrorists are on the back foot, the officers said. On Wednesday, 40 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and 20 each of the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) were withdrawn by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and were asked to report back to their respective locations. Earlier, the MHA had withdrawn around 82 companies in December last year. The security grid in J-K was strengthened with an additional 600 odd companies (around 60,000 troops) rushed there just ahead of the government’s decision to withdraw the special status of J-K and bifurcate it into two union territories on August 5, 2019. These troops were stationed at various locations from where terrorist incidents, stone pelting incidents were reported. According to the latest government data, stone pelting incidents have drastically reduced this year as compared to 2019 or 2018. In 2018, there were 532 incidents of stone pelting in Kashmir, 389 in 2019 but only 102 such incidents were reported this year so far. Senior officers deployed in the valley have claimed that the locals don’t disrupt the counter-terror operations anymore and there is more support from the public in general. With the latest decision, around 400 additional companies of paramilitary forces are still deployed in J-K in additional to CRPF’s regular 67 battalions (around 67,000 personnel) and army and the J-K police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-withdraws-100-companies-of-security-personnel-from-jammu-and-kashmir/story-PkgP4oIJzXGvQAjCl6LcVO.html
19-08-2020||India||Navy prepared to meet any challenge, says Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday expressed confidence in the Indian Navy’s preparedness to meet any challenge through its proactive deployment of warships and aircrafts, at a time when India and China are locked in a border row in eastern Ladakh. The navy is on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean region (IOR) where scores of ships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the developments along the northern border and its P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircrafts are being used for surveillance of the Ladakh sector and gathering intelligence on Chinese deployments across the Line of Actual Control. Addressing a conference of the navy’s top commanders, Singh complimented the navy personnel for their role in protecting the country’s maritime interests. The navy has stepped up surveillance and activities in the IOR, which, it believes, China will inevitably try to enter in its quest to become a global power, just as it has laid claim to large portions of the disputed South China Sea, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 29.While speaking on the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the defence minister congratulated the navy for carrying out its biggest repatriation effort Operation Samudra Setu, which resulted in more than 4,000 Indians being brought home from different countries. Singh lauded the navy’s role in providing medical aid to countries such as Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar.He said the navy had effectively carried out mission-based deployment to protect India’s maritime interests by deploying warships and aircraft at sensitive locations in the IOR. The navy has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and the choke points in the IOR under its mission-based deployment model and the vessels can be diverted for any mission. Indian warships are deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.During the three-day conference, the commanders will discuss ways to optimise joint planning, tri-service synergy, operational readiness, procurement and functional reorganisation within the navy to enhance efficiency.Deliberations will also cover larger security imperatives in the Indo-Pacific region. The conference comes at a time when self-reliance in the defence sector is a top priority for the government. Several of the 101 defence items in the negative import list, released on August 9, include naval weapons and systems including conventional submarines and ship-borne cruise missiles. The navy will be steering one of the costliest Make in India programmes to build six next-generation submarines in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-prepared-to-meet-any-challenge-says-rajnath/story-TeCcNibacSkm3NJRYI6JiO.html

The US-made ventilators are compact and easy to deploy, and will provide India flexibility in treating patients. In addition to the ventilators, US Agency for International Development (USAID) is funding a package of support that includes warranties and additional supplies and components needed to operate the machines. The first shipment of 100 ventilators was donated by the US government in June. These machines have been deployed to support the care of Covid-19 patients at the eight regional All India Institutes of Medical Sciences. US ambassador Ken Juster said, “We are very pleased to hand over the final tranche of 100 ventilators to India, fulfilling President Trump’s commitment to provide these critically needed supplies to support India’s pandemic response.” USAID is also working with the Indian government to enhance the capacity of health facilities using the ventilators by facilitating setup, orientation, and clinical training for healthcare personnel responsible for operating the machines. USAID’s efforts have strengthened the India’s healthcare system’s readiness and response capacity in several states with a high burden of Covid-19 cases. As of August, a total of three million people in India have directly benefited from USAID support, said a statement from the US embassy. USAID has also trained 40,700 health workers on best practices to integrate Covid-19 prevention and risk mitigation into essential health services, and 46,000 frontline workers on risk communication. It has provided 950 healthcare facilities with support to increase social distancing, infection prevention control, and patient management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-provides-second-shipment-of-100-ventilators-to-india-to-help-fight-covid-19/story-rl0XKQa6ReC8SBGJo3Px8J.html

The decision was taken after a security review by the ministry of home affairs (MHA). The companies of paramilitary personnel to be withdrawn include 40 companies of CRPF and 20 each of the BSF, CISF and SSB from the Kashmir Valley, officials said.The decision was finalised after the MHA reviewed the deployment of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) in the union territory.A total of nearly 100 CAPF companies have been asked to withdraw “immediately” and go back to their base locations in the country from where they were mobilised to the UT after the abrogation of Article 370, in August last year.A CAPF company usually has an operational strength of about 100 security personnel.The home ministry had last withdrawn about 82 CAPF companies from Jammu and Kashmir in December. So after the new MHA order, 182 companies of security forces stand withdrawn now in the Kashmir Valley.According to the MHA order, a total of 40 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and 20 each of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), will be moved out of Jammu and Kashmir by the end of this week.With the latest withdrawal of security personnel, the CRPF will have a strength of about 60 battalions (about 1,000 personnel in each battalion) in the Kashmir Valley apart from very few units of other CAPF staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-decides-to-withdraw-100-companies-of-paramilitary-forces-from-jammu-kashmir/story-Xvu15wrX38253R8XdPOiiP.html

The Tests Per Million too have seen a sharp rise to 23,002,” the ministry said. “It is only by aggressive testing that positive cases can be identified, their contacts tracked and isolated as well as prompt treatment can be ensured through timely medical care.  The sustained level of high testing has played a key role in India’s increasing rate of recovery, widening gap between the recovered and active cases, and also progressively declining fatality rate,” the ministry said. India followed the track of a graded and evolving strategy, steadily strengthening its nationwide network of labs in the public and private sectors.

19-08-2020||India||National Conference calls party leaders’ meeting after HC told none of them in detention||The National Conference has decided to convene a meeting of its senior leaders on Thursday after the local administration informed the Jammu and Kashmir High Court that none of the 16 leaders, that the party claimed were in illegal confinement, were detained and that they were free to move around.In a statement issued Wednesday, the National Conference said it had taken note of the government’s stand in the High Court on the petition filed by party president Faqrooq Abdullah and his son Omar to secure the liberty of its various leaders who have been under illegal house detention.“On a perusal of the reply the party has noticed that the government has unequivocally submitted before the High Court that no leader is under detention and that they are free to move subject to necessary security arrangements,” the statement said.“Now relying fully on the stand of the government before the HC that the members are free to move and expecting no hogwash on part of the government, the party president Farooq Abdullah has invited senior party members including Ali Mohammad Sagar, Abdul Rahim Rather, Mohammad Shafi Uri and Nasir Aslam Wani for a meeting at his residence on 20.8.2020 at 5 pm,” it said.The party also made it clear that it is mindful of the present pandemic and accordingly the meeting with various leaders that have been under detention will be done in batches of four members per meeting. “Needless to add that all standard operating procedures shall be strictly followed by all concerned,” the party statement said.The party is hopeful that the liberty of the members under detention is now absolute and the meeting will be held successfully on the appointed day, it said.The Abdullah father-son duo had filed a bunch of habeas corpus petitions on July 13 seeking their release. A habeas corpus is a writ requiring a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, especially to secure the person’s release unless lawful grounds are shown for their detention.Filing the replies before the High Court earlier this month, senior additional advocate general Bashir Ahmad Dar said the contention of the pleas was “not only surprising but shocking as well” as there were neither any legal proceedings underway nor was it being contemplated.The similarly worded replies, vetted by Inspector General of Police (Kashmir range), however, said in the wake of Constitutional amendments carried out in the Article 370, “it was apprehended that inimical elements may disturb the peace” and the leaders “may provoke them to cause aggravation in the disturbance”.However, no order of detention either under preventive detention law or substantive law was issued against the party leaders, it said, adding, the leaders were free to move with certain precautions “as deemed fit” for their security.The reply said the petitioner being a categorised person has been advised not to visit any vulnerable areas without informing the concerned authorities” and reasoned that it was to ensure proper security.The Abdullahs had filed 16 petitions on July 13 for as many NC leaders contending that they were being held in “brazen violation” of Constitutional guarantees of the right to liberty.The writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution lists NC general secretary Ali Mohammed Sagar, provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani, senior leader Aga Syed Mehmood, party’s chief spokesperson Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi, among the leaders being detained at their residences illegally and wrongfully without serving them grounds of detention. The leaders have been forcibly restricted by police personnel stationed outside their residences for the past 11 months, the pleas claim.Other leaders for whose release the petitions have been filed were Abdul Rahim Rather, Mohammad Khalil Bandh, Irfan Shah and Sahmeema Firdous, Mohammad Shafi Uri, Chaudhary Mohammad Ramzaan, Mubarak Gul, Dr Bashir Veeri, Abdul Majeed Larmi, Basharat Bukhari, Saifudin Bhat Shutru and Mohammad Shafi.The senior Abdullah has filed the habeas corpus petitions for seven leaders while Omar has filed for the remaining nine.Both Abdullahs, who were first taken into preventive custody and then detained under the stringent public safety act for several months since the intervening night of August 4 and 5, hours before Jammu and Kashmir’s special status was revoked by the centre, have pleaded that the detainees be set at liberty.The reply of the home department said the petitioner being protected persons were well within the charter of duties of the administration to ensure their safety and security. “...it is emphatically denied that currently or in the past any detention order is in the force against” the leaders and the administration was functioning “strictly within the parameters of law”.There is no infringement or brazen violation of the law as claimed in the petition. “The respondents have shown utmost respect for the law of the land,” it said and pleaded for dismissal of the petition with costs.The party leadership moved the High Court after the petitions of these detained leaders to the Home Secretary of Union Territory on June 30 seeking removal of restriction on their movement and set them at “absolute liberty” remained unanswered.The party, before moving the High Court, had expressed hope that the legal system will come to the rescue of their colleagues, who have been suffering for no fault ever since the abrogation of provisions of Art 370, Art 35A on August 5, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-conference-calls-party-leaders-meeting-after-hc-told-none-of-them-in-detention/story-nmzjqp58ua7usCtYP5muJO.html
19-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput case: 5 factors behind SC order for CBI probe||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a CBI probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Below is a list of 5 factors that played a role in the court’s decision.1. Maharashtra police yet to investigateThe court noted that the Maharashtra police was only conducting a limited inquiry under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) into the cause of unnatural death of Rajput.Section 174 of CrPC confers powers on police to enquire into death by suicide and submit a report to the district magistrate. The Supreme Court said that an inquiry under section 174 is limited in scope and cannot be equated to a full-fledged investigation. The Mumbai police have not registered an FIR or started investigation into the incident.Also read| ‘Not a Loss’: Sena’s Sanjay Raut after SC hands Sushant Rajput case to CBI2. Patna police has jurisdiction to register FIRRajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty had argued that Bihar police does not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter and register an FIR since the incident occurred in Mumbai. The Supreme Court, however, turned this down stating that registration of an FIR is mandated when information on a cognizable offence is received by the police.“Precedents suggest that at the stage of investigation, it cannot be said that the concerned police station does not have territorial jurisdiction to investigate the case,” the court said in its judgment.Moreover, Rajput’s father, whose complaint was the basis for Bihar police to register an FIR, had alleged a criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of money. The consequences of the incident would, therefore, arise in Patna as well.“The allegation relating to criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of money which were to be eventually accounted for in Patna (where the Complainant resides), could prima facie indicate the lawful jurisdiction of the Patna police,” the court held.The finding that the FIR by Bihar police was valid turned out to be crucial because the CBI had taken over the probe based on the request made by Bihar police.3. Need for an independent agency due to conflict between two state governmentsThe apex court noted that there is a conflict between the two state governments in the matter and though the steps taken by Mumbai police cannot be faulted, stakeholders have raised allegations of unfair investigation against Mumbai police.“Because both states are making acrimonious allegations of political interference against each other, the legitimacy of the investigation has come under a cloud. This Court (Supreme Court) must strive to ensure that search for the truth is undertaken by an independent agency, not controlled by either of the two state governments,” the judgment said.Also read| Sushant Singh Rajput’s family on SC verdict: ‘We love our country more than ever’4. Need to avoid uncertainty due to possible parallel investigationsThe court said that CBI has already registered a case and commenced investigation at the instance of the Bihar government. If Mumbai police also decides to commence probe, then it could add to uncertainty and confusion.“Uncertainty and confusion must be avoided in the event of Mumbai Police also deciding to simultaneously investigate the offence, based on their findings,” the judgment said.5. Justice for Rajput’s father and RheaThe court noted that Rajput was a talented actor in the Mumbai film world who died well before his full potential could be realised. An impartial probe and its outcome will ensure that Rajput’s father and Rhea get justice. Moreover, Rhea herself had called for CBI investigation, the court added.“His family, friends and admirers are keenly waiting the outcome of the investigation so that all the speculations floating around can be put to rest. Therefore a fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour,” the court said.Law invoked by Supreme CourtArticle 142 of the Constitution confers wide power on the Supreme Court to pass an order for doing complete justice in the matter before it. It is invoked to grant reliefs which are beyond the scope of the petition or not sought by the petitioners.The court invoked Article 142 in this case stating that to ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter, it would be appropriate to exercise the powers conferred by the said article.Also Read: ‘Not a Loss’: Sena’s Sanjay Raut after SC hands Sushant Rajput case to CBI Supreme Court’s powers to order CBI probeAs per section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, CBI can investigate a crime only based on the recommendation of the concerned state which is probing the matter. However, that does not bar constitutional courts (i.e high courts and Supreme Court) from recommending CBI probe as has been held in a long line of Supreme Court judgments in the past, the court said.No power to transfer investigation from one state to another in a transfer petitionChakraborty had filed the transfer petition under section 406 of CrPC seeking transfer of probe from Bihar to Maharashtra. Section 406 confers powers on the Supreme Court to transfer cases from one high court to another or from a lower court in one state to a lower court in another state.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s brother-in-law says his family represents aspirations of IndiaThe Supreme Court held that the provision does not grant power to the top court to transfer a matter which is only at the investigation stage from one state to another.“Having considered the contour of the power under section 406 CrPC, it must be concluded that only cases and appeals (not investigation) can be transferred,” the court ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-here-are-the-reasons-why-sc-ordered-cbi-probe/story-FaKw0lnYqXYvVu3spaei4M.html

The dedicated Covid-19 ward was made functional last month.Discrepancies in the duty chart and attendance sheet of doctors, anomalies in their stipulated and actual work duration, to the total absence of faculty members and medical professionals were some of the glaring lapses which the additional secretary, health, Kaushal Kishore referred to in his letter to the PMCH principal and the superintendent on Tuesday.The letter followed a surprise inspection by Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit, to the Covid-19 wards of the hospital on August 14.Also read: Bihar board proposes 30% cut in syllabus, govt refers it to expertsThe letter said the roster duty chart of doctors and nurses was not put on display and there were discrepancies in the name mentioned in duty chart and the attendance sheet. Kishore advised the administrators to ensure that the roster chart was strictly followed. On faculty members’ absence from duty, he asked the principal to review the situation and take action.There were also issues with equipment like portable X-ray and ultrasonography machines for Covid-19 patients, besides arterial blood gas analyser in the intensive care unit. The superintendent could not give a convincing reply when asked about an attendant’s complaint that he had to buy insulin from the market for his patient, the letter said.The government has already asked the hospital authorities to take full responsibility of medical treatment of a Covid-19 patient, including pre-diagnosed ailments (diabetes, cardiac conditions, etc.), while also having a diet chart for patients on each bed.Earlier this month, the health department had directed its Covid care facilities to have dedicated teams of personnel to arrange for medicines required for patients or source them from suppliers rather than asking the attendants to get them.The letter also referred to the fact that the 24x7 “May I Help You” booth was unmanned when Amrit visited the hospital late in the evening. Telephone calls to the hospital’s dedicated helpline number also went unanswered.“We have addressed all concerns which our principal secretary had pointed out during his inspection,” said PMCH superintendent Dr Bimal Karak.“We have made available some drugs for co-morbidity, as prescribed in our SOP (standard operating procedure) for Covid-19 patients, and displayed the list where the attendants sit. We are also making the “May I Help You” booth functional 24x7. We have also requisitioned services of 50 additional ward boys on a contract basis to which the principal secretary has agreed,” he said.On the absence of doctors, Dr Karak said, “Assistant professors have now been deputed in each shift and instructions have been passed on to doctors not to leave their work station till their reliever comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-health-brass-raps-patna-medical-college-hospital-after-docs-on-covid-19-duty-found-absent/story-FmuaDbM7nfcngmvMBwRWQM.html

19-08-2020||India||Bihar board proposes 30% cut in syllabus, govt refers it to experts||On the lines of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which was the first to announce a revised and reduced curriculum for Class 9 to 12, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and several state school boards, the Bihar school examination board (BSEB) has also sent a proposal to the state government for reducing the syllabus in view of the disruption caused by Covid-19 pandemic to education.However, the department of education is yet to take a call on it. It is mulling over the proposal and the matter has been referred to an expert group from the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) and other academicians to decide what could be done to take the load off the students without hurting their prospects for higher and technical education like JEE, NEET, CLAT etc. Also read: Parties see opportunity in Dalit assertion in BiharA large number of students from Bihar take the engineering, medical and other entrance exams for technical courses every year.The CISCE, CBSE and state boards of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and a few other states had earlier announced a reduction in the syllabus by 30 percent to make up for the academic loss amid extraordinary situation due to novel coronavirus pandemic.Additional secretary, department of education, Giriwar Dayal Singh said the board’s proposal for 30 percent reduction in the syllabus had been received and brainstorming by experts was on to work out the mechanism. “The online classes are also on and the effort is aimed at covering 100 percent syllabus of class 10 and 12 boards. However, if the syllabus needs to be reduced, it has to be decided what should be removed without affecting the students’ preparedness for future exams. The experts will work on it,” he added. In Bihar, the schools have been badly affected due to the twin impact of pandemic and floods, which have affected nearly 80-lakh population in 18 districts of the state. Though flood is a recurring feature in the state, it’s impact is felt long after the water recedes due to a trail of destruction, including damaged school buildings, it leaves behind. The internet connectivity is also very slow in rural areas. Due to poverty, there is also a question of affordability when it comes to possessing laptops, computers and smartphones. According to the latest figures by the union ministry of social justice and employment, Bihar has 41.4 percent people living below the poverty line, the highest in the country.With assembly election also due in October-November, this could further impact schools as most of them are used for housing security forces. In 2020, Bihar was the first board to take board exams in February itself.The CBSE has reduced the syllabus but still asked the schools and teachers to explain even those topic, which had been removed so that the students didn’t have problems in understanding the related topics. However, the reduced topics will not be part of the internal assessment and board exams.Singh said the reduction in the syllabus would require meticulous planning and hence the experts had been asked to decide how to go about it. “The proposal is being reviewed,” he added. According to a senior education department official, reducing the syllabus was an uphill task as there were nearly four dozen subjects spread across four streams of science, commerce, social science and humanities, besides several vocational courses. “The forms for board exams are already being filled up but it is a fact that education has been impacted and would continue to be impacted,” he added.The date for filling up forms for intermediate is from August 17-27, while that for matriculation is from August 18-28. The admissions for class 9 and 11 are also on. “Even if the government plans to open schools at a later date, it will be difficult to engage classes and cover syllabus,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-board-proposes-30-cut-in-syllabus-govt-refers-it-to-experts/story-hkEtdFj4ogV0u35bSI570K.html
19-08-2020||India||Section of Goa govt employees protest against state authorities, demand safer workplace||Panaji: A section of Goa government employees gathered at the foyer of the state secretariat to protest against the state authorities for the latter’s callousness about the safety and precautionary measures against the raging the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. They alleged that the state government has refused to put any safety mechanism and precautionary measures in place, despite several requests from the employees raising concerns about risks of the viral infection due to the contagion. “Covid-19 cases are rising by the day. On Wednesday, it came to our notice that at least a dozen Covid-19 cases have been reported from the state secretariat. The state government appears callous about our safety and wellness. We have been requesting the state government to give us some relief such as either close down the secretariat or work with 50% of its strength. We sit in close proximity, which prevents us from maintaining social distancing norms,” alleged Sukarna Pai, an employee of the state revenue department “If the situation persists, many of us will contract SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and gradually the state administration will collapse. The state government needs to introduce preemptive measures. We cannot work from home because many of us don’t have the requisite amenities. At least we can work at 50% of our strength. However, we need clarity about the workflow,” she said. “Besides, many of us have children and senior citizens at home. While several employees have comorbidities such as diabetes, blood pressure, etc.,” she added. Another employee Amol Dangui stressed that the employees were not against the government, but wanted prompt action to ensure their safety. Around 150 state government employees took part in the protest at the state secretariat and a few also called on the chief secretary Parimal Rai to request him to allow either a 50% workforce or staggered work hours. State government employees have largely contributed to Goa’s viral caseload, as many police personnel and healthcare workers, who are at the frontline battling the pandemic, have tested Covid-19 positive, including some staff from the revenue department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/section-of-goa-govt-employees-protest-against-state-authorities-demand-safer-workplace/story-BkOU8RiSHB4wbOyBDVN5EJ.html
19-08-2020||India||We can’t allow Covid-19 pandemic to hold democracy to ransom: Sanjay Jha||The upcoming assembly election in Bihar, which is expected to take place on schedule in October-November, despite the nation-wide raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, is not a game of T20 cricket, but a five-day classical test match to be led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, said Sanjay Jha, state minister for water resources department, and national general secretary of the ruling Janata Dal (United), JD(U). In an interview to HT, Jha spoke about why elections in the state should be held on schedule; the quibbles within the National Democratic Alliance partners such as the JD(U) and the Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP) and how the state government is confident of returning to power, despite the twin challenges such as the unprecedented Covid-19 outbreak and annual flood woes. Excerpts from the interview: Your party is an NDA ally. Yet, there seems to be a lack of cohesion on issues such as the election schedule and earlier about the state government’s stance on bringing back migrant workers during the Covid-19-triggered lockdown restrictions? The LJP has been singling out your party. We are in close and constant communication with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). I can say with confidence that we are clear in our thinking that a sacrosanct democratic exercise such as election is always above political parties and politics. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has the mandate to decide on the poll schedule, and we will abide by its decision. That said, we are equally convinced that holding the election as close to the stipulated schedule will only bolster efforts being made on all fronts at national and global levels to overcome the Covid-19 impact and resume normal functioning of the public from all walks of life. With regard to the perceived differences on the issue of bringing back migrant workers and even students, the situation must be viewed in its extraordinary context. In keeping with the central government directive of lockdown norms, CM Kumar was the first one to respond. In fact, Bihar had the blueprint ready for our stranded people. In one of his first directives immediately after allocating Rs 150 crore from the CM’s Relief Fund to fight the pandemic, he had instructed officials on April 2 to remit Rs 1,000 directly to the bank accounts of stranded Bihari workers. Later, when Delhi and other states allowed massive exodus of migrant people, all arrangements were made such as ensuring trains from all over the country to putting in place a robust testing mechanism, isolation, and quarantine facilities to providing last-mile support to help them return to their native villages. In the case of students, too, our continuing concern has been about their health and well-being, as they were away from their homes. Eventually, we made special arrangements for getting them back home safely. In this backdrop --- and this is a small example --- I wonder why anyone would target us? These are difficult times, as we face the double whammy of Covid-19 and annual flood woes. We would rather focus on our primary dharma of addressing people’s concerns than respond to shallow, meaningless political barbs! What about the LJP’s remarks? Time and again the BJP top brass has stated that the election will be fought under the leadership of CM Kumar and that should end all speculation. Several parties want elections deferred owning to the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, the state is also struggling with the floods. Did the NDA partners hold talks on these issues? There is a global consensus that life needs to go on, and we must learn to live with Covid-19. Haven’t we started opening up the economy? Haven’t we rolled out trains, domestic flights, transport services, and opened markets? We must not allow Covid-19 to hold democracy to ransom. The naysayers and apologists would continue to sulk and sully the state’s pride, as it suits their agenda. The Covid-19 bogey is being raised by the perennial naysayers, who are faced with the fear of the inevitable --- an imminent defeat in the coming assembly elections. Let me also give some more facts because they pertain to my ministry, the water resources department. Floods are not unique to us. Across the globe, millions face this nature’s wrath every year. The issue is not flooding, but its management. Bihar government has been responding to the situation of the overflowing rivers with incredible alacrity. I am pleased to share that our teams have successfully deployed new tools, including Artificial Intelligence and modern early warning systems, in a bid to ensure an effective yet timely response. While flood is a global phenomenon, our ability to respond to the crisis and ensure low fatalities are at par and among the best. Our trenchant critics must have noted that each of the flood-affected families is getting a one-time relief of Rs 6,000 within a week. Apart from the state of economy and jobs, there are two issues that will stand out in the forthcoming elections -- the response to the pandemic and the migrant workers, who returned to the state during the lockdown. Do you think the government has given a good account of these challenges? Our response to the pandemic has been the most comprehensive, innovative, and diligent. Even as many states were struggling about how to respond, the Bihar government on the CM’s instructions set up 52 relief centres across 12 cities in the country that distributed cooked and packed foods to millions of people. We set up a 60-line state helpline, and by end-April, we had ensured affirmative action for over 2.5 million people. At present, third-party credible data showed that the pandemic situation in Bihar is under control. Our case fatality rate (CFR) is 0.5%, which is among the lowest in the country in the context of a state with a similar population and our viral caseload per million is 1,049. Our reaction was careful and judicious as far as the migrant crisis was concerned. Around 35 lakh people returned to Bihar. We were the first state in the country to have done the skill mapping of all the workers and developed a framework for engaging them productively. After mapping the skills and creating a database of workers, we also started to work on deploying them through district-level workers’ advisory centres. We reviewed the Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy to create a more enabling environment in a bid to attract more industries to the state. During the lockdown, 5.43 crore human days of work were created across 4.46 lakh government schemes. The Central government, too, is helping us in this exercise through some interventions including an application developed by Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology. Bihar has a sizeable Muslim population and there is a perception that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, and the proposed National Register for Citizens (NRC) will have a bearing on the election outcome. The AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen) has also thrown its hat in the ring. Will it be an advantage mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in such a scenario? Muslims have been integral to CM Kumar’s politics and governance for all these years. The community has enormous faith in him, and any theory to the contrary is poor imagination and cheap thrills of fantasy. In all his social welfare schemes since 2005, the Muslim community has been an equal beneficiary – as our model of nyay ke saath vikas symbolises. We have stood for inclusive growth, with a special focus on the minorities and backward and extremely-backward classes. CM Kumar’s regime has been free of even a sprinkle of communal tension. In his 15 years’ rule, I can vividly recall, only in one town, we had to impose curfew and that, too, only for a few hours. Isn’t that an achievement, especially in a state with a long history of communal riots? He has also ensured speedy justice for all the victims of past riots. He instituted a special commission to get justice for the victims of Bhagalpur and other riots. What issues and achievements will the state government seek re-election on? The metamorphosis of Bihar: from a state ravaged by crime, plundered by a clique comprising politicians and bureaucrats, punctuated as BIMARU, and punctured by the apathy of the ruling elite, their naked nepotism and favoritism to a state that stands for nyay (justice), vikas (development), and pragati (progress). CM Kumar inherited a plundered legacy of 55 years, and he had to first reckon with addressing the fundamental issues of what I call RASTRA --roti, ashmita (dignity), samanta (equity), tathasta (indifference of governance), roads and adhikar (rights).Our CM is a visionary leader, who thinks ahead of time. He has addressed all these issues on a priority basis. We shall go to voters with facts. At present, 7.39 crore people, or 60% of Bihar’s population, are covered under the state’s food security programme. We issued 23.39 new ration cards during the Covid-19 crisis. CM Kumar was clear that the basic necessities of people must be taken care of. Pucca roads, uninterrupted electricity and piped water reaching all households are among his many achievements. Significantly, we have broken stereotypes. Now, girls ride bicycles, women head panchayats, and availing government services is no longer a drudgery. Prohibition has brought about a qualitative change in family lives. Jeevika is a silent revolution unfolding across our tiny villages, whose reverberations will not be felt unless you see it. The awakening of half of our population, our womenfolk, has taken place during CM Kumar’s rule. Unsurprisingly, women have vouched for and stood by him through successive elections. We are at the threshold of a new era, where Bihar yearns for an exalted identity, affirmation, and equity. And who better to deliver on this other than the one who crafted and steered the phenomenal turnaround, and the new Bihari pride! Our CM, of course! In 2020, we are not into a game of T20, but a classical Test match. The slog overs start now, with our CM as the captain!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-can-t-allow-the-pandemic-to-hold-democracy-to-ransom-sanjay-jha/story-JyviGg5sNwHuqtofiRXs9I.html

19-08-2020||India||GST Council to discuss compensation cess on Aug 27, other issues on Sep 19||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council has scheduled two crucial meetings on August 27 and September 19. On August 27, the Council’s 41st meeting would consider a proposal to borrow money from the market to compensate states for their revenue shortfalls, and on September 19, the apex federal body 42nd meeting would take up other issues such as the resolution of the inverted duty structure, tax on pan masala and more measures for the ease of doing business, two officials said, requesting anonymity. Earlier, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said after the 40th meeting of the Council on June 12 that the August 27 meeting would be special, as it would discuss a single matter. The meeting’s only agenda will be how to pay compensation to states at a time when the compensation cess collection has plunged because of weak economic activities owing to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. While briefing media persons after the 40th meeting, Sitharaman had said on request of members, the Council would meet again in July to discuss a “one-agenda item” --- compensation to states. “Compensation, which has to be given to states, and, if at all, it results in some kind of borrowing, how and who is going to pay for it,” she had said. The meeting was, however, deferred to August, due to some technical reasons, the officials said. At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal, and other tobacco products. The 41st meeting of the Council is to resolve the difference between the Centre and states over the responsibility of the cess liability. While states argue that it is the Centre’s responsibility to pay compensation in time, the latter cited the GST law, where the responsibility lies with the Council, the officials said. The Council is headed by the Union finance minister and finance ministers of states are its members. Usually, the Council’s decisions are unanimous. One of the officials mentioned above said although the GST law assured a 14% increase in annual tax revenue of states, the GST collection in 2020-21 is unlikely to see such growth. “There is virtually no money left to pay compensation to states from April. Market borrowing is one of the solutions, but who will take the guarantee is a big question and that issue needs to be resolved,” he said. The states were paid Rs 1,65,302 crore GST compensation in 2019-20, even as total cess collection for the fiscal year was Rs 95,444 crore. This gap is expected to widen this year because of the pandemic, he said. “Law is very clear, compensation has to be paid from the amount collected through compensation cess and not from the Consolidated Fund of India,” he added. According to a note circulated in the 40th GST Council meeting, compensation cess collected in 2017-18 was Rs 62,612 crore, rose to Rs 95,081 crore in 2018-19, and to Rs 95,444 crore in 2019-20. However, compensation paid in 2017-18 was less than the total collection at Rs 41,146 crore and Rs 69,275 crore in 2018-19. Officials said it is up to the Council to find a solution about ways to augment revenue collection and pay the compensation. Theoretically, the options before the Council for meeting the shortfall could be to rationalise tax rates, include more items under the compensation cess or widen the net, or recommend higher borrowing by states to be repaid by the future collection into the compensation fund, they said. However, states, particularly ruled by the Opposition parties, said that timely payment of full compensation is the responsibility of the Central government. Officials said, the 42nd meeting of the Council on September 19 would be generic in nature and could consider revising tax on several items that suffer from inverted duty such as fertilisers, footwears, renewable energy devices, tractors, man-made yarns, and fabrics. Inverted duty structure is a mechanism, where inputs are taxed at a higher rate than finished goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-to-discuss-compensation-cess-on-aug-27-other-issues-on-sep-19/story-XlXdRZwcM0HaHIL27eiujP.html

It will be created as a specialist agency that will introduce state-of-the-art technology to the field of Central government recruitment. “The Union Cabinet led by PM @narendramodi ji today took a revolutionary decision for the youth of New India. A ‘National Recruitment Agency’ for conducting a Common Eligibility Test (CET) has been approved. The historic move will benefit nearly 2.5 crore aspirants every year!!” Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar tweeted on Wednesday.The Centre has sanctioned funds to the tune of Rs. 1517.57 crore to set up the National Recruitment Agency (NRA). The expenditure will be undertaken over a period of three years. Besides setting up the NRA, additional costs will be incurred for setting up proper examination infrastructure in the nearly 117 districts.Here’s all you need to know about the new government decision:1. Examination centres in rural districts of the country would help students living in far-off areas get access to the entrance examination. Students will benefits in terms of expenditure, effort and safety.2. It will also motivate rural candidates to take the examination and hence increase their chances of getting a Central government job.3. Currently, candidates have to appear in multiple examinations conducted by multiple agencies. Apart from the examination fees, candidates have to spend additionally on travel, boarding, lodging and a lot more. A single examination would reduce the financial burden on candidates to a large extent. 4. Women candidates from rural areas go through a number of hardships in appearing for multiple examinations since they have to arrange transport and also find accommodation in places that are far away. The location of test centres in every district would help such women candidates from rural areas.5. The CET score of the candidate shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of declaration of the result. The best of the valid scores shall be deemed to be the current score of the candidate. 6. There shall be no restriction on the number of attempts made by a candidate to appear in the CET subject to the upper age limit. 7. Relaxation in the upper age limit shall be given to candidates of SC/ST/OBC and other categories according to the existing policy of the government.8. The National Recruitment Agency shall conduct a separate CET each for the three levels of graduation, higher secondary and the Class X board examinations for candidates for those non-technical posts to which recruitment is now carried out by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and by the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS). 9. Based on the screening done at the CET score level, a final selection for recruitment shall be made through separate specialised Tiers (II, III etc) of examination which shall be conducted by the respective recruitment agencies. 10. The curriculum for this test would be common as would be the standard. 11. Candidates will soon have the facility of registering on a common portal and given a choice of examination centres. Based on availability, they would be allotted centres. 12. The NRA will also work towards a stage wherein a candidate can schedule his or her own test at an examination centre of his or her choice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/common-eligibility-test-to-help-2-5-crore-job-aspirants-annually-all-you-need-to-know/story-XMIQ3GkBdSQtfcsk6ZWsFK.html
19-08-2020||India||NEP 2020: CM Adityanath forms task force for implementing education policy||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday formed a 17-member task force to formulate an action plan for effective implementation of the National Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) in the state.Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma was named the chairman and basic education minister Satish Chand Dwivedi the vice chairman of the task force, tweeted the chief minister’s office.Last month, the Union cabinet approved NEP- 2020, paving the way for reforms in schools and the higher education sector in the country.A senior government official said the task force will prepare a road map on implementing NEP effectively in the state so that the state education system improves further and students become more employable.The other task force members include UP State Council of Higher Education chairman Prof Girish Chandra Tripathi, additional chief secretary (ACS) (basic education) Renuka Kumar, ACS (technical education) S Radha Chauhan, ACS (higher education) Monika S Garg and ACS (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla.Former secretary, government of India, Anil Swarup, former CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly, APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) vice chancellor Vinay Kumar Pathak and former director (secondary education) Krishna Mohan Tripathi are also part of the task force.The other members include three Lucknow University professors Arvind Mohan, Nishi Pandey and Abbas Nayar, Uttar Pradesh Sanskrit Sansthan president Vachaspati Mishra and former director (secondary education) VP Khandelwal. Director general education (Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan) Vijay Kiran Anand is the member-secretary.Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said, “The new education policy that was approved by the Modi government will be a game changer. After a gap of about 35 years, the country has come up with a revamped policy that will strengthen the education system. It will encourage students towards vocational education and children to learn the mother tongue.”Expressing his happiness at being made a member of the task force, former CBSE chairman Ashok Ganguly said, “It will have a great impact on UP. We need a plan of action — a short-term plan of two years and a long-term plan of seven years. The pre-schooling pattern in UP is in a haphazard state and learning at the primary level is poor.”He further said: “UP has immense potential to take a lead in implementation of NEP, thus changing the course of school education in the country.”He also felt “massive teacher training” will be required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nep-2020-cm-adityanath-forms-task-force-for-implementing-education-policy/story-vcGM0tagAl7jSqlD2fgvwL.html

The incident took place three days after the head of the family died of Covid-19. According to Kovvur deputy superintendent of police K Rajeshwara Reddy, the deceased were a 50-year old woman, her 25-year-old son and 23-year- old daughter. The woman’s husband (52) died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Rajahmundry in East Godavari district on August 16 and was cremated by the civic authorities the following day. “Preliminary enquiries revealed that the family came to the road-cum-rail bridge on Godavari river at Kovvur in a car at around 1 am and jumped into the river, which has been in full spate due to heavy floods,” Reddy said. The police recovered a note from the car they were travelling in. “Apparently, they were in a state of depression after the death of the head of the family and none of their relatives had called on them,” the DSP said. The bodies were yet to be recovered from the river due to heavy floods. “Investigation is going on,” Reddy said.

The case was filed on the complaint of Sushant’s father, KK Singh, in Patna last month. On August 5, CBI took over the investigation in the case after the Bihar government transferred it to the federal agency.Also read: Nitish claims vindication in Sushant case, says it is about justice, not politicsThe verdict was announced during the hearing of plea filed by Chakraborty seeking transfer of the FIR lodged against her at Patna to Mumbai. The court rejected the petition, saying the Bihar government was competent to give consent to CBI for probing into the Patna FIR.While pronouncing the verdict, the apex court observed that due to the allegations made by the two states (Bihar and Maharashtra) of political interference against each other, it would be in the interest of justice to hand over the case to the CBI.Following this, Chakraborty’s lawyer, Satish Maneshinde, said in a statement that the actress will appear before CBI and face the investigation as she herself had demanded a probe by the federal agency.“Since the court has transferred the investigation to CBI invoking its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, she will appear and face the investigation by the CBI as she has done earlier with the Mumbai Police and the Enforcement Directorate. Rhea maintains that the truth will remain the same whichever agency investigates the case,” Maneshinde said in a statement.Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on June 14 in his apartment in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/truth-will-remain-same-whichever-agency-investigates-rhea-chakraborty-s-lawyer-on-sc-verdict/story-3tp9oOBrE0khCncRXJjgXO.html
19-08-2020||India||Wildlife conservationists demand probe into death of 18 elephants in Odisha||Wildlife conservationists have demanded an investigation into the deaths of 18 elephants in Odisha over the last two years, citing information obtained under the Right To Information (RTI) that suggests they may not have died of anthrax as previously thought.Biswajit Mohanty, a wildlife conservationist who filed an RTI application with Phulnakhara’s Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI), said the information revealed that only two of the tissue samples of the 20 tested positive for the bacterial disease. ADRI found that the deaths of only two elephants in the Hadagada forest range of Keonjhar forest division in May 2018 could be ascribed to anthrax.Mohanty said by citing anthrax as the cause, officials eliminated the need to carry out proper autopsies and investigation for any other cause of death. “The bodies were either cremated or deep burials were carried out on the basis of suspicion of anthrax without even waiting for a preliminary test report,” Mohanty said anthrax has become a convenient reason to cover up foul play or unnatural causes of deaths.Mohanty has now lodged a complaint with Odisha’s chief wildlife warden.Anthrax is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. Cattle, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and elephants can contract the disease when they come in contact with contaminated soil, plants, or water. The disease can also be transmitted from animals to humans.In Odisha, officials have blamed anthrax for the deaths of 20 elephants between April 2017 and June 2020. They include a female elephant, whose carcass was found in Gayalmunda forest in Keonjhar district in 2019.Mohanty wondered how could the state wildlife officials have missed the mysterious absence of anthrax infections among other wildlife species as well as cattle in the area while elephants continued to die. “Unless there is proper and truthful reporting of cause of deaths of elephants, the protection of our national heritage animal in Odisha is seriously imperiled.”Mohanty said elephant carcasses have been cremated or buried after their deaths of suspected anthrax over the last 10 months as well in Rairakhol, Keonjhra, and Angul forest divisions. Their tissue samples were neither sent to ADRI nor to the veterinary college of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, he added.In January, the Union environment ministry revised its standard operating procedures (SOP) on anthrax deaths of wild elephants after a four-year-old elephant was suspected to have died of the disease in Sambalpur district.As per the SOP, the chief wildlife warden has been vested with the overall authority of investigation such deaths under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The SOP had laid down rules for the constitution of a team to oversee the assessment and disposal of elephant carcasses suspected to be infected with anthrax.Wildlife activist Aditya Panda said the RTI documents have raised questions on the wildlife authorities’ attempts of attributing most elephant deaths to anthrax without going through the proper procedure. “It needs to be investigated how these elephants had died. The government owes everyone a clarification,” he said.Chief wildlife warden, HS Upadhyay, said anthrax has very obvious symptoms. “And in all cases, it is certified by local veterinary surgeons. So, the accusation of misreporting is incorrect.”In Odisha, the elephant mortality rate is rising alarmingly. The average deaths annually, which were 33 from 1990 to 2000, increased to 46 from 2000 to 2010. Since 2010, the average has been 78.As many as 463 elephant deaths were recorded from 2000 to 2010. The number grew sharply to 784 from 2010 to 2020. Of the 784 deaths in the last 10 years, 281 (36%) elephants died of unnatural causes. In 160 (20%) cases, the causes of death could not be ascertained primarily because their bodies were highly decomposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-conservationists-demand-probe-into-death-of-18-elephants-in-odisha/story-PbUxTVaWWYeHnzpiKSI0YP.html

Rejecting the charge that the top court’s order was a major setback for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, he said, “It is not a loss; when there is a legal battle such things happen.”Refusing to comment further, Raut did add that creating a question mark on the ability of Mumbai police to probe the Sushant Singh Rajput case was a “conspiracy”. “Until we read the copy of the order we cannot react to it. Once the order is received, either the advocate general or the state DGP will talk about it. Raising questions on the ability of the Mumbai police was a conspiracy. According to me, the Mumbai police carried out the probe effectively. Now, that the SC has given its judgment in the matter, someone who is not in the government should not speak on it,” said Raut.The apex court also asked the Mumbai police to hand over all the evidence collected so far in the case to the CBI. The state of Maharashtra refused the option to challenge the order.Putting a quietus to the ongoing high-decibel political statements for and against the CBI probe, the top court held that Patna Police had not committed illegality in lodging an FIR against Chakraborty and six others on the complaint of Rajput’s father, who has accused them of abetting the suicide of the 34-year-old actor.The verdict came on a plea filed by Chakraborty who had sought transfer of the FIR lodged against her at Patna to Mumbai.“Therefore, while according approval for the ongoing CBI investigation, if any other case is registered on the death of the actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his unnatural death, the CBI is directed to investigate the new case as well. It is ordered accordingly,” the bench said, while invoking the plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-loss-sena-s-sanjay-raut-after-sc-hands-sushant-rajput-case-to-cbi/story-BzZUhXkd2Yv75M0sxJlldJ.html
19-08-2020||India||In absence of Parliament session, social activists start consultation on key policy issues||Several social organisations have come together to discuss key policy issues from education to environment through People’s Parliament in the absence of regular sessions of legislative bodies in the country.Jan Sarokar, a conglomeration of social organisations, has started a virtual consultation this week on 10 themes with over 200 speakers.Launching the initiative, former National Advisory Council member Aruna Roy said that since there has been no Parliament session for the last five months, there has been no parliamentary oversight of the executive either.The monsoon session of Parliament has been delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the secretariats of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha intend to hold the session in September while enforcing social distancing norms. As per Constitutional norms, there cannot be a gap of over six months between two Parliament sessions. Officials said they have until September 23 to hold the session. The budget session ended on March 23, two days before the 68-day national lockdown kicked in. “This (not holding the Parliament session) shocks us as Parliament is a platform to discuss the pandemic at multiple levels,” Roy said.She said that in the absence of the Parliament session, important policy decisions such as an amendment in labour and agriculture laws and the introduction of changes to education and environment policy were being taken without Parliamentary oversight.“There is no accountability of those in power,” she said.In his inaugural speech, former Delhi High Court judge AP Shah, said several countries across the world such as Brazil, Italy and France had held Parliament sessions during the pandemic, providing a voice to the people, but India had failed to do so. “During the 1962 and 1971 wars, Parliament sessions were held. Even a day after the Mumbai attack, Parliament met. If parliamentary standing committees can meet virtually, why can’t Parliament sessions be held,” he said. Shah said Parliament was intended to keep a check on the executive. If Parliament stops working, it “compounds the problem of leadership” as it allows the executive free hand, he said. He also claimed that constitutional institutions have been weakened and the civil society stifled in the recent past.“Our aim should be to revive liberal democratic values of our democracy,” he said.Jignesh Mewani, a Dalit rights activist and an independent MLA in Gujarat assembly, said that as an MLA he was unable to raise important issues that affect the people as the Gujarat assembly session has not been held in the past five months.“I could have raised questions regarding the non-availability of life-saving injections in government-run hospitals in Gujarat and the government could have been made accountable. In the absence of the assembly session, I can’t raise my voice,” he said.Mewani also said that the way changes in labour and agriculture laws have been introduced during the pandemic shows that the government has tried to push an executive agenda without legislative checks and balances.Nikhil Dey of National Campaign for People’s Right to Information said the Janata Parliament was being held to raise people-centric issues during the pandemic and to ensure that the voice of poor and needy reaches the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-absence-of-parliament-session-social-activists-start-consultation-on-key-policy-issues/story-Ngn7W2zJLtFyszOcjhxz2N.html
19-08-2020||India||China’s J-20 fighter jets near India border? State media downplays report||The deployment of China’s most advanced J-20 stealth fighter near the border with India should not be over-interpreted in context of the Sino-India border friction as the tension is de-escalating, Chinese state media has said.The long-range jets’ deployment, which is yet to be confirmed by the People’s Liberation Army Airforce (PLAAF), could be for the aircraft’s long-distance flight practice and part of the warplane’s protocols to adapt to different environment, Global Times, the nationalistic tabloid, said in an article.The article was referring to a news article published in Forbes, which cited satellite imagery to claim that two J-20 fighter aircraft have been deployed by the PLAAF near the India-China border.The J-20 is China’s fourth-generation medium- and long-range fighter aircraft, and it was commissioned into air force combat service in 2018.The aircraft were spotted, some 320 km from the border, at the Hotan airport in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).China’s armed forces have so far not made any announcement about deploying fighter aircraft near the border though it is likely fighter jet squadrons are stationed near the long and disputed border with India.“The J-20 is a long-range heavy fighter jet. So, when deployed in Hotan, it can potentially cover many areas in Central and South Asia,” it said.The nationalistic tabloid, known for its anti-India rhetoric, however, sought to play down the development.The deployment if true is “…likely part of normal training on long distance flight and environment adaptation,” Chinese military aviation expert Fu Qianshao said.China is a large country with many airfields in various terrains and under different climate conditions, and the J-20 needs to fly in more regions to adapt, Fu said.The border tensions have already been de-escalating, and foreign media’s reports could have ulterior motives, the state media article said.Earlier this month, experts had told the tabloid that the Rafale fighter jets were no match for its J-20 stealth fighter jets, days after the first batch of five French-made warplanes landed in Ambala. Chinese experts told state media that the Rafale is only a third-plus generation fighter jet and does not stand much of a chance against a stealth, fourth-generation one like the J-20. Saying that the Rafale is superior to the Su-30 MKI in certain aspects, the acquisition does not yield a significant qualitative change for India, it said. “In some combat performance areas, the Rafale is superior to the Su-30 MKI fighter jets, which are in service in the Indian Air Force in large batches, but it is only about one-fourth of a generation more advanced and does not yield a significant qualitative change,” it said.The J-20 made its maiden flight in 2011 and was first shown to the public at the 11th Airshow China in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, in south China, in November 2016, according to the official news agency, Xinhua.The fighters made their parade debut when the PLA marked its 90th anniversary in July 2017 at Zhurihe military training base in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.In the backdrop of the ongoing border tension, India last week called on China to work jointly for “complete disengagement and de-escalation” on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), saying the future of the bilateral relationship is dependent on the situation along the disputed frontier. Chinese troops are said to have pulled back from Galwan Valley, the scene of the June 15 clash that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties, and some friction points, but the troop withdrawal hasn’t moved forward in the Finger Areas of Pangong Lake, Gogra and Depsang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-j-20-fighter-jets-near-india-border-sate-media-downplays-report/story-bykPwWTFxJO2XmtKfHzZbK.html
19-08-2020||India||Nitish claims vindication in Sushant case, says it is about justice, not politics||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has cited the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput to claim vindication of his government’s stance which led to a confrontation with the Maharashtra government.Kumar also said that the court’s decision also shows that Mumbai Police’s handling of the case including alleged non-cooperation with Bihar Police’s parallel investigation into Sushant’s death was wrong. He also stressed that the court battle over jurisdiction was not about politics but justice for the budding actor, who was found dead in suspicious circumstances at his Bandra flat in Mumbai on June 14.“These things are not about politics, they are about justice. We are focused on providing justice. What was said was not right. Probe will speed up now. Today it was proved that we abided by law in the steps we took,” Nitish Kumar was quoted by news agency ANI as saying.Nitish government had transferred to CBI, a case registered with Bihar Police by Sushant’s family living in Patna against his former girlfriend Rhea Chakarborty, accusing her of mentally harassing the actor, diverting large funds from his account, confinement and abetting his death by suicide among other charges.Several leaders in the Maharashtra government said Nitish Kumar government’s move to transfer the case to CBI was political in nature keeping in mind the pending Bihar assembly elections. The Maharashtra government had also been opposing a parallel probe into Sushant’s death by the Bihar Police.Responding after the SC verdict the Bihar chief minister said that the verdict demonstrated that the alleged attempts by Mumbai Police to block a probe by Bihar Police in the case-- before it was transferred to the CBI-- was wrong.“It was the duty of Bihar Police to probe after a complaint, but they didn’t get cooperation in Mumbai. Behaviour meted out to our IPS officer is known to all. With the SC verdict, it’s clear what happened wasn’t right. Any political comment in this situation isn’t right,” Kumar was quoted as saying by ANI.Suggesting that politics should be kept out of the investigations, Nitish added that the entire country was concerned about Rajput’s mysterious death and the CBI probe offered assurances of justice.“Supreme Court verdict makes it clear that the probe by Bihar Police and the FIR registered here were correct. Not just Sushant Singh Rajput’s family or people of Bihar, the entire country is concerned over the matter. With a CBI probe, people can trust there’ll be justice,” Nitish Kumar said.Also Read: CBI probe in Sushant Singh Rajput’s case: Parth Pawar tweets, ‘Satyamev Jayate’Leaders of Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) coalition that runs the government in the state also insisted that the Supreme Court’s decision should not be viewed from the prism of politics.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who has been very vocal in his opposition to demands for a CBI probe into Sushant’s death earlier said that it is “not right” for him to make any political comment on the order. He insisted that “no one” is above the law in Maharashtra and the justice system in the state is fair to all. He was talking to the news agency.The BJP, however, has taken a broad swipe at the Maharashtra government saying the “hidden hands” interfering in the Mumbai police’s investigation in Rajput’s death will be exposed now that the case is with the CBI.Also Read: ‘Hidden hands will be exposed’: BJP after SC order on Sushant Rajput case There are several theories doing the rounds about Sushant’s death including one claiming he was murdered and another suggesting he was driven to suicide by big cliques in Bollywood that do not let outsiders flourish in an industry that is run like a “family affair” by few big production houses. Suggestions have also been made about involvement of a young influential Mumbai politician in the case. However, Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the son of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has denied having anything to do with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-claims-vindication-after-sc-order-in-sushant-case-says-it-is-about-justice-and-not-politics/story-r3BROejh5FXbVnMt5OfGrL.html

The baby’s parents, Humaira and Tahir, a daily wager, did not have the Rs 500,000 needed for the surgery. As the parents struggled to raise the money, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) stepped in and contacted doctors at Srinagar’s Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences. The doctors suggested an emergency procedure since the surgery was not immediately possible. The procedure cost Rs 55,000. Tahir managed to pay Rs 30,000 while CRPF offered the rest of the amount. The procedure was successful and the baby is stable now.Tahir and Humaira are among thousands of Kashmiris, who have benefitted from CRPF’s Madadgaar initiative, as Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted livelihoods over the last five months.A Madadgaar helpline (14411) is run under special CRPF director general (Kashmir) Zulfiquar Hasan’s command. Under the scheme, all kinds of assistance are provided to Kashmiris across the country. The assistance ranges from issues related to water, electricity and road construction, medical emergencies, and domestic violence, dowry harassment, career, education, sports.The initiative was launched in June 2017. Since its inception, the helpline has received 573,000 calls from Kashmiris in distress. In 98% of cases, help has extended, according to CRPF data.The Madadgaar team attended to 53,333 grievances on a special Covid-19 helpline launched on March 26 a day after the nationwide lockdown was imposed to check pandemic spread. Between March 26 and August 1, the helpline received 50,757 calls. As many as 1,616 distress messages were received through WhatsApp, SMS and on Twitter.CRPF said Madadgaar teams provided over 35,000 food packets to 4,538 Kashmiri and 2,941 migrant labourer families. Over 5,800 calls were received for information on Covid-19 testing and treatment centres. Other calls pertained to information about medical experts and essential services. Another 21,928 calls were received from people seeking information on procedures to return to their homes.CRPF came to migrant worker Mohammad Arif’s rescue when he began his journey from Mumbai to his home in Panjgrain near the Line of Control in Jammu & Kashmir’s Rajouri district in April on a bicycle as his father, Wazir Hussain, suffered a brain stroke. It ensured Arif reaches his destination and helped his father by having him airlifted to Chandigarh for treatment. Arif reached Chandigarh after crossing five states with CRPF’s help. Hussain is stable now.Hasan said the helpline has been working in coordination with CRPF units and other departments across the country to help the people in distress. “Over 4,040 patients suffering from chronic ailments have been provided medicines, haemodialysis, surgeries, blood donations... The Madadgaar Tel Me telemedicine scheme is also in operation to provide consultations to the patients...” said Hasan. “Since we have a presence everywhere in Kashmir, we play a pivotal role in rendering assistance to the locals and mitigate the problems of the common man... The scheme has been very successful and has helped in building a closer and friendly interface with the public.”There was a surge in calls made to Madadgaar helpline after August 5 last year when the Centre divested Jammu & Kashmir of its special status. A large number of calls were received from abroad as well with people wanting to know the well-being of their families and for assistance.CRPF assistant commandant Junaid, a Kashmiri who heads the Madadgaar unit, said since August 5 last year, they have handled 240,000 calls and provided special assistance in 14,446 cases. “We have received over 300 international calls from countries like the UAE, Oman, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the US and the UK etc where Kashmiri families wanted to inquire about the well-being of their kin living in Kashmir and about the situation in general. It has been a challenging period but we have worked tirelessly in extending all possible help.”Ajai Sahni, an internal security expert, said initiatives like Madadgaar may not significantly alter the sentiments of people but they certainly have an impact in building a relationship. “We should not forget that Kashmir is not just Anantnag, Pulwama or Kulgam [where terrorism incidents are mostly reported from]... a larger opinion is not actively hostile if not actively supportive of Indian forces. Maybe none of these is going to have an effect on the hardliners but such programmes definitely help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-crpf-s-helpline-madadgaar-assisted-kashmiris-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-ZWJmx4eXFzJWXZCEllSMtJ.html

The accused fired one round at us when we tried to catch him. Luckily, no one was hurt. We eventually overpowered him,” he said.Two pistols were recovered from the possession of the man, whose identity will be revealed after completion of preliminary questioning, he said.According to the hotel manager, a Mumbai resident booked a room there on Tuesday and was later caught and taken away by the ATS team.Meanwhile, talking to reporters in Gir Somnath district, state BJP leader Gordhan Zadafia said he was informed that the man was sent to eliminate him.“Gujarat Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja has informed me that a sharp shooter has been caught before he could harm me,” said Zadafia, who is on a four-day tour of the Saurashtra region with state BJP chief C R Paatil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-ats-arrests-man-sent-by-chhota-shakeel-to-kill-bjp-leader/story-bDThejfuRqOoja9cD72LcK.html
19-08-2020||India||Babri mosque demolition case in last leg, CBI told to file written reply||The trial in the Babri Masjid demolition case is set to enter its last stage after the Central Bureau of Investigation was asked to submit its written reply in the case by Friday.A special CBI court in Lucknow that completed the recording of statements of all the 32 accused in the 1992 Babri mosque demolition case last month, including senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, among others, has asked the premier investigation agency to file its reply by August 21.The CBI had to file its reply on Tuesday, but its lawyers sought two more days’ time. “The court has ordered the CBI to file its written reply in the Babri Masjid demolition case by Friday (August 21). The central agency had to file its reply on Tuesday but could not do so,” said lawyer Manish Tripathi, who is representing BJP MP from Kaisrganj parliamentary seat in Bahraich district, Brij Bhushan Saran Singh. He is one of the 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. The trial in the Lucknow court is going on in regard to the demolition of the disputed structure in 1992 in pursuance of the two FIRs lodged with the Ayodhya Police.The Supreme Court on July 19 last year had extended by six months the time frame for completing the criminal trial in Ayodhya case and also set a deadline of nine months for the final order. The deadline expired on April 19 this year and the special judge wrote to the apex court on May 6, seeking an extension. The Supreme Court on May 8 issued a new deadline of August 31 with instructions to deliver the judgment by then. However, legal experts are of the opinion that the CBI court will need further extension of about two months to deliver judgment in the case. “Legal documents in the case run into several thousand pages. It is no easy job to document all proceedings in the case. I think the CBI court will need another extension to deliver its judgment,” said lawyer KK Mishra, who is representing senior BJP leader LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, among others, in the CBI court. On April 19, 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered the special judge to conduct a day-to-day trial, concluding it in two years. Calling the demolition of the disputed structure a crime which shook the “secular fabric of the Constitution”, it allowed the CBI plea for restoration of criminal conspiracy charge against the VIP accused. The court had termed the Allahabad high court’s February 12, 2001, verdict dropping conspiracy charges against Advani and others as “erroneous”. Before the 2017 verdict of the apex court, there were two sets of cases relating to the demolition, going on in Lucknow and Rae Bareli. The first case allegedly involving unnamed “kar sevaks” proceeded in a Lucknow court and the second set of cases relating to eight VIPs was being heard in a Rae Bareli court. In April 2017, the Supreme Court transferred the Rae Bareli case to the Special CBI court in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-mosque-demolition-case-in-last-leg-cbi-told-to-file-written-reply/story-NhhCXvhLPWRQFn2gTjkd8K.html

19-08-2020||India||Not right for me to comment on SC’s verdict: Sanjay Raut on Sushant Singh Rajput case||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said that it is “not right” for him to make any political comment on Supreme Court’s latest order in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case.“Supreme Court has given its verdict, it is not right to make political comments. Our state’s justice system has always been one of the best in the country, no one is above law here and to provide justice to all has been the norm,” Raut said while speaking to ANI.“Those in the government who know the law, the Mumbai Police Commissioner or our Advocate General can talk about it, it is not fit for me to comment on the verdict of Supreme Court,” he added.Notably, holding that the FIR registered in Bihar’s Patna over the death of Sushant Singh Rajput was legitimate, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the CBI to investigate the case.The single-judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy also said that the Bihar Government was competent to recommend transferring the case to the CBI.The apex court also asked Mumbai Police to hand over all the evidence collected so far in the case to the CBI. The state of Maharashtra refused the option to challenge the order, Justice Roy said.The CBI has registered an FIR against Rhea Chakraborty and others in connection with the actor’s death after the Centre accepted Bihar Government’s recommendation to transfer the probe in the matter from Patna.An FIR was registered in Patna on a complaint filed by KK Singh, Rajput’s father, under sections related to abetment to suicide. Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-fit-for-me-to-comment-on-sc-s-verdict-sanjay-raut-on-sushant-singh-rajput-case/story-HDsXcL5MBevKNUvwtcmllO.html
19-08-2020||India||As Covid-19 care centres gradually close, Mumbai’s civic body to transfer medical equipment||As the Covid-19 pandemic curve continues to flatten in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is shutting down several Covid Care Centre (CCC) facilities. Medical equipment from these centres will be transferred to civic-run peripheral, maternity hospitals and health posts to plug shortages of devices. When Covid-19 pandemic broke out in Mumbai in March, the BMC started CCC facilities in all civic wards to quarantine high-risk contacts and asymptomatic patients. In June, however, when the curve started plateauing in Mumbai, the BMC was conducting around 4,500 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests every day, and an average 1,100 new Covid-19 cases were reported.With the inclusion of the rapid antigen test, the daily average testing has gone over 7,000 per day, with the civic body conducting more than 10,000 tests on some days. Despite the increase in testing, the number of daily Covid-19 cases has stayed below 1,000 in the city. The positivity rate has come down from 22 percent in July to 19.51 percent in August. Also read: BMC to appoint consultant to curb waterlogging in cityWith the number of Covid-19 cases reducing in Mumbai slums, almost 70 percent CCCs are lying unused. The civic body has therefore gradually started handing over rented lodges, schools, auditoriums, hotels to its owners where these centres were created. Medical equipment like oximeters, glucometer, oxygen cylinders, blood pressure monitors, beds among others from the facilities will be used in the secondary health care facilities. “Annually, peripheral hospitals, dispensaries and health posts have their own demand for medical devices. So, the equipment will be sent to these facilities for future usage,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner.“At present, we aren’t handing over all the equipment. We have to remain prepared in case Mumbai is hit with the second wave of Covid-19 infection.” The BMC has 16 peripheral hospitals, 175 municipal dispensaries, 29 maternity homes with over 200 health posts all across the city. The civic body has spent around Rs 850 crore in the ongoing pandemic including salaries, equipment and construction of CCCs.Nearly Rs 130 crore has been spent on buying essential machines. “Most equipment is being donated by philanthropists which will be used at the secondary health care facilities along with the purchased ones. While the rented ones will be handed over to their owners,” said Kakani. At present, Mumbai has 332 CCC-1 facilities for high-risk contacts with over 48,000-bed capacity. There are a total of 173 CCC-2 facilities for positive asymptomatic patients with over 23,000 beds. Health activists have welcomed the civic body’s decision. Pradeep Patil, a local RTI activist from Bandra who is associated with non-government organisation Jan Kalyan said, “Even though health posts and peripheral hospitals form the backbone of the healthcare system in Mumbai, they lack basic amenities. It will be a great boost for medical infrastructure if the BMC can also shift all additional equipment, like ventilators and x-ray machines, for Covid-19 patients to these centres once the pandemic gets over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-care-centres-gradually-close-mumbai-s-civic-body-to-transfer-medical-equipment/story-56XUjgb3AugTYD8UH5Rj9H.html
19-08-2020||India||BMC to appoint consultant to curb waterlogging in Mumbai||In the aftermath of heavy water logging that Mumbai experienced during the monsoon this year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will appoint a technical consultant who will study reasons for waterlogging in the city, the design of roads and stormwater drains, and provide solutions and technical support.The consultant will be given a list of chronic waterlogging spots, such as Hindamata, Gandhi Market near Matunga, Chembur colony, Andheri subway, for the study.A senior officer of the stormwater drains department said, “We are appointing a consultant for Mumbai to find a permanent solution to waterlogging at problematic spots in the city. This will be an extensive survey, with a special focus on chronic flooding spots and low lying areas. We need to check if a permanent solution can be found, such as deep tunnelling.”Also read: Tablighi Jamaat money laundering case - ED raids at four locations in MumbaiThe officer added, “Despite our efforts, waterlogging was quick to surface across the city this year too.”The BMC will hire a consultant with technical and engineering expertise for stormwater drains along with prior experience in handling such projects.The decision comes on the back of the last four years of allocating and spending dedicated budgets to study and find solutions to curb waterlogging at individual 273 spots across the city. After the monsoon of 2018, the BMC had changed the methodology by micro-planning to deal with flooding.The stormwater drains department was tasked with studying each chronic flooding spot individually and come up with personalised solutions to prevent waterlogging. While this method did not replace the earlier plan of cleaning water entrances, laterals and desilting drains and nullahs, it was expected to curb flooding.On August 4 and 5, Mumbai experienced very heavy rainfall that resulted in severe waterlogging in various parts of the city. It also took several hours of the water to drain out, like in 2019.Subsequently, the BMC pumped out 17,145 million litres of water from the city. This is equivalent to twice the capacity of Tulsi lake - 8,046 million litres, one of the seven lakes that supply water to Mumbai.Waterlogging was reported at 9 prominent locations in the island city, 4 locations in the Eastern Suburbs and 3 locations in the western suburbs. Many areas submerged in two or three feet deep water. In South Mumbai, many locations that had not flooded previously were inundated this year, such as Babulnath, Girgaum Chowpaty, and Nariman Point. However, this can be partly attributed to the heavy rainfall. On August 5, the Colaba weather station recorded 293.8mm of rain in 12 hours (between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm), the highest ever in August since 1974.Out of the 273 water logging spots identified across the city over 2017 and 2018, the BMC said only 69 spots remained to be tackled before the monsoon of 2020. Moreover, 49 other flooding spots out 273 were categorised as localised flooding spots - where waterlogging takes place due to a local and temporary reason such as very heavy rainfall in a short duration combined with high tide, hence they do not face the threat of submerging every monsoon just like chronic flooding spots.The BMC’s budget for 2020-21 declared that during the monsoon of 2020, only 24 waterlogging spots would remain, as the others had been dealt with over the past three years. However, with the outbreak of Covid-19, the civic body lost out on crucial months of March, April, and May for its monsoon-preparedness work and was unable to complete the fixing process of over 40 waterlogging spots this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-to-appoint-consultant-to-curb-waterlogging-in-city/story-LV6zybXXfuD7S3RyzffWcI.html
19-08-2020||India||Pak army chief Gen Bajwa’s apology doesn’t help, gets a royal snub in Saudi kingdom||Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa who started his Saudi Arabia visit on Monday to calm diplomatic strains has returned home after been declined a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Gen Bajwa had to settle for a meeting with the Deputy Defence Minister Sheikh Khalid Bin Salman, also the younger brother of the Crown Prince, as well as Maj Gen Fayyad Al Ruwaili, the kingdom’s chief of general staff, people familiar with the matter in Riyadh and New Delhi.Bajwa is learnt to have conveyed the Imran Khan government’s apology over foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s statement that criticised Saudi Arabia over the reluctance of the Organisation of Islamic Countries to convene a meeting of OIC foreign ministers to discuss Kashmir.But the regret conveyed to Deputy Defence Minister Sheikh Khalid Bin Salman during their meeting on Tuesday, didn’t get Islamabad any further in Riyadh. General Bajwa’s interactions in the kingdom were limited to Saudi’s defence establishment, just as Pakistan military had claimed after news of General Bajwa’s trip was leaked back home.This version was, however, contradicted by Pakistan minister Sheikh Rasheed on Saturday who told a news channel that the army chief was visiting Saudi Arabia to iron out outstanding minor differencesGeneral Bajwa is accompanied on this visit by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt General Faiz Hameed.There has been a buzz in Islamabad that PM Khan was not averse to dropping Qureshi, who crossed the red line with Saudi Arabia when he threatened to call a conference of Islamic countries outside the OIC if it did not call a conference of foreign ministers to discuss the situation in Kashmir.Pakistan has long pressed the Saudi-led OIC to convene a high-level meeting to highlight alleged Indian violations in the part it controls but hasn’t got its way so far.“If you (OIC) cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told local media last week.An Indian diplomat said after India cemented its ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries over the last six years, Pakistan had distanced itself from its projected Arab legacy and moved towards Erdogan’s Ottoman revival. Turkey’s position on Kashmir mirrors Pakistan’s stand.At his meeting in Riyadh, Gen Bajwa is also learnt to have floated a proposal for a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) contact group on Kashmir on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting to be held under Turkey. The OIC contact group on Kashmir, formed in 1994, is a smaller group of OIC foreign ministers.It has already met on June 22 this year to discuss Kashmir when foreign ministers of Azerbaijan, Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey attended the meeting. A diplomat in Delhi said the proposal appeared to be a face-saver for Imran Khan vis-a-vis his Pakistan’s domestic audience.Imran Khan hasn’t commented on Qureshi’s statement so far but over the last one week, there has been an effort to distance PM Khan from Qureshi. Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari was the face of this effort when she publicly criticised the country’s foreign affairs ministry by saying that it had let down both the Kashmiris and PM Khan. The criticism was a sharp contrast to PM Khan telling the National Assembly just weeks earlier that Pakistan’s foreign policy, mostly directed at Kashmir, was the biggest achievement of his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-gen-bajwa-s-saudi-trip-an-apology-snub-and-then-a-new-proposal/story-5wYoIHlJAAJoLS4KsyZ8IP.html

19-08-2020||India||‘Hidden hands will be exposed’: BJP after SC order on Sushant Rajput case||Soon after the Supreme Court confirmed a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, the BJP took an aim at the Maharashtra government on Wednesday, saying that the “hidden hands” interfering in the Mumbai police’s investigation of actor Sushant Singh Rajput will be exposed. The “immature” Parth Pawar, grandnephew of Sharad Pawar, too tweeted soon after the court order. Parth tweeted “Satyamev Jayate (Truth prevails)”, however, he made no mention of the case. A few weeks ago, Parth had written a letter to state home minister Anil Deshmukh demanding a CBI inquiry into the young actor’s death. Parth’s position was at odds with that of the party’s which had expressed confidence in the Mumbai police. The BJP too had demanded a CBI probe. “He is immature. There is no value to what he says. I have 100% trust in the Maharashtra and Mumbai Police. But if anyone wants to make a demand, then nobody can object,” Sharad Pawar had said last week, dismissing the young leader’s demand for a CBI investigation. The BJP blamed the Maharashtra government for the alleged mishandling of the case. “The ‘hidden hands’ that have been interfering in the police investigation will now be exposed. Who were the people who did not allow Mumbai police to investigate the case. Will the state government take the responsibility of ‘forcible goof ups’ by the Mumbai police? Thank you to the Supreme Court. Pub and Party gang which enjoyed illegally, while 15000 plus Mumbaikars died in lockdown! Note- Justice will be done,” Bharatiya Janata Party’s former Mumbai chief Ashish Shelar said in a series of tweets. Noted IPS-officer-turned lawyer YP Singh termed the verdict as a setback for Mumbai police and even the state government. “Doubts were raised over the investigation and conduct of the Mumbai police. To clear all doubts and ensure justice, the SC has rightly handed over the case to the CBI,” he said. The Mumbai police failed to come out clearly and maintain transparency in the investigation by briefing on a regular basis on the findings, he added. The act of quarantining the Bihar SP Vinay Tiwari, said Singh, was immature and could have gone against the state. Shiv Sena leader and transport minister Anil Parab said, “We are yet to receive the copy of the court order. Once we read it thoroughly, we will respond to it in detail, including responding to the allegations of the BJP.”Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the apex court verdict will have far reaching consequences as it has given a new viewpoint to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure code.“Honourable SC judgement has given a new viewpoint to the provisions in CrPC. Now cases will be registered at any place leading to the complications. This will have a larger and far reaching impact on the future inter-state as well as intra-state working as far as the jurisdiction of the police investigation is concerned,” said Sawant.The top court has asked the Mumbai police to hand over the case records and evidence to the CBI. It also asked the Maharashtra government to cooperate and assist in the CBI investigation. The verdict was was based on a plea filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty to transfer an FIR of abetment to suicide registered against her in connection with the death of Suhant Singh Rajput from Patna to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satyamev-jayate-immature-parth-pawar-after-sc-order-in-sushant-case/story-NUBlrgUy0ASWwuvmdwjI9N.html

19-08-2020||India||Don’t need to be Congress president to strengthen it: Rahul in new book||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has indicated that he will not assume the reins of the party in the immediate future and maintained that he stepped down from the post after the 2019 Lok Sabha election debacle to develop a culture of accountability in the organisation, according to a new book.“I’m here, standing by the Congress party and ready to fight for it because I believe in the Congress party. I don’t need to be the Congress president in order to fight for the Congress party or to work on strengthening it,” he said in an interview with US-based authors Pradeep Chibber and Harsh Shah for their book ‘India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next Generation of Political Leaders’.Gandhi was asked by the authors if he would be open in the future to lead the party once again if his colleagues want him back as the Congress president.Gandhi has indicated on many occasions that he is not willing to reconsider his decision and has often referred to his letter to Congress workers on July 3 last year to make his point.He had resigned as the party chief at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25 last year following the party’s drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress managed to win just 52 seats in the 543-member House while the Bharatiya Janata Party returned to power with a bigger majority of 303 seats.At the CWC meeting, Gandhi slammed the veterans for “placing the interests” of their sons above the party, and also mentioned that some leaders had even lost the election from their strongholds even as he criticised a section of the so-called GenNext for hankering for posts.He brought finality to his decision to step down as the party president on July 3 when he tweeted a four-page farewell note listing the reasons why he resigned.In the letter, Gandhi took a dig at his party colleagues for the electoral drubbing the Congress received and spoke about the lack of support to him, saying he had stood completely alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).“I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,” he wrote.Asked by the authors why he resigned from the post, Gandhi said, “The Congress party lost the 2019 elections, under my command. The Congress has to develop a culture of accountability and that begins right at the top. I’m pretty clear in my mind that I am accountable for the 2019 loss and that I had to step down as a consequence.”Asked if his family supported his decision, the former Congress chief said: “We’ve obviously discussed this as a family and I’ve listened to and appreciated my mother and sister’s perspectives. But I feel that the culture of accountability is missing at present in the Congress party and the only way to inject that into the Congress system is by beginning at the top.”To another question on the Gandhi family being the Congress’s biggest asset but also a liability because the BJP keeps bringing back the ‘namdaar versus kamdaar’ issue, he dismissed it just propaganda.“I can give you a list of over a hundred senior RSS–BJP leaders all of whom come from political dynasties. As far as my mother, my sister, and I are concerned, we are driven by ideology. We fundamentally believe in the Congress ideology and will not compromise with our belief just to grab political power. The RSS–BJP that keeps changing like a chameleon in its blind pursuit of power, understands the power of the Gandhi family’s commitment to the Congress ideology. In fact, they fear it, which is why we are the primary targets of their propaganda and systematic disinformation,” he said.Asked what role he envisions for himself and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in the party, Gandhi said, “My sister is an extremely capable person, who has to chart her own political course. I’m happy that she’s working in Uttar Pradesh because I think there’s a huge opportunity for the Congress party to make a strong comeback in the next state elections over there.”To another question, if it easy to convince her to join the politics, the former Congress chief said, “Priyanka and I had spoken about this before and her view was that while her children were growing up and still in school, she wouldn’t be able to do justice to a full-time political career. Now that they’re going to college, she can immerse herself fully and do justice to the role she has agreed to play as a general secretary of the Congress party.”Concluding the interview, when asked how he would like to be remembered after his retirement, Gandhi said, “I’m not too bothered about what people will say about me after I’ve gone. I’m more interested in the here and now and in what I do, what I stand for, who I stand with, and who I can help. Jawaharlal Nehru said that he’d like his ashes to be scattered in the Himalayas. He didn’t even want a memorial in his name. I don’t think he was too bothered about what people were going to say after he was gone. Or whether they would remember him or not. I think he was much more bothered about his actions, while he was still alive! I think that’s a good model to follow.”In the interview, Gandhi also talked about his hobbies, passions, and interests outside the Congress.“I’m passionate about Aikido, a Japanese martial art in which I have a Black Belt. I’m a pilot. I love diving and I’m both a free diver and a scuba divemaster. I enjoy running and cooking. In fact, I can cook you the best omelettes you’ll ever have!”“By nature, I’m a curious person. When I get interested in something, I tend to deep dive into it, to understand its nature. That’s just the way I operate. I will tend to go into detail and build a certain level of competence and understanding in that subject. Amongst the broad sweep of subjects, I’m interested in are Indian philosophy, Buddhism, the history of the Mongols, WWI/WWII history, Middle Eastern history, Pakistani history, and Chinese.”When pointed out that a lot of his critics have said that it seems like he is in politics out of compulsion and not passion, Gandhi said: “I hate labels. Politics is a label…Politics is very important to me, it takes up a lot of my time, but, I have other interests as well. My political approach is built around listening to people and trying to help them achieve what they want to achieve. I go to people who I think need my help and I will raise their issues and try and fight for them. I spend a lot of time thinking about politics and discussing it. I love what I do. I’m passionate about it. I’m certainly not doing what I do out of any compulsion.”Asked about the criticism regarding his frequent vacations, he said: “In India, I live my life surrounded by security men, 24X7. As a consequence, in India, I have very little privacy, other than when I’m in my own home. When I’m out of India, I have more space, more privacy. I enjoy learning from other cultures and I love interacting with people from different parts of the world. I don’t see my trips abroad as vacations. For example, when I’m in the United States and if I visit Berkeley to interact with students over there, I learn from that experience. There are new ideas I’m exposed to; new ways of looking at things. These are extremely enriching experiences and that’s what I enjoy most about travelling abroad.”Gandhi alleged that this perception has been created by the RSS and the BJP as they see him as a threat.“The truth is, I’m up against a formidable RSS–BJP political machine that attacks me 24X7, because it sees me as a threat, because it sees the ideas that I represent as a threat. So it has to paint me as someone who isn’t interested, as someone with no understanding, as someone who only wants to go abroad on vacation. The fact that you are asking me this question, proves that their propaganda is somewhat successful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-need-to-be-congress-president-to-strengthen-it-rahul-in-new-book/story-9K6uFShcKimXeXmUpfUKxI.html

19-08-2020||India||SC allows CBI to probe Sushant Singh Rajput case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to continue with its probe into the case filed against actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family for allegedly abetting the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The case was filed on the complaint of Rajput’s father, KK Singh, in Patna last month. On August 5, CBI took over the probe in the case after the Bihar government transferred it to the federal agency.Chakraborty moved the apex court questioning the lodging of the case against her in Patna and sought its transfer to Mumbai. A single-judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy refused to grant this relief to her and instead agreed that Bihar police will have jurisdiction in the case. “Bihar police was competent to give the consent to CBI [for probe],” it said.The court said contents of the complaint did indicate the Mumbai police does also have jurisdiction. “If any other case or complaint is registered in connection with the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the CBI can register a new case as well and carry out the probe,” it added.Chakraborty’s lawyer, Satish Maneshinde, said the court noted his client has called for a CBI report. “The Hon’ble Supreme Court, after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and the report of the Mumbai police, has observed that it will be the desired justice as Rhea herself called for a CBI investigation. The Hon’ble Supreme Court also observed that due to the allegations made by the two states [Bihar and Maharashtra] of political interference against each other, it would be in the interest of justice to hand over the case to the CBI.”He added Chakraborty will face the CBI investigation as she has done earlier in case of the Mumbai police and the Enforcement Directorate probe. “Rhea maintains that the truth will remain the same which ever agency investigates the case.”Singh, in his complaint, referred to about Rs 15 crore transaction from his son’s bank account and suspected Chakraborty of blackmailing his son and seizing control of his bank documents and credit cards.CBI had informed the court that it will only probe the case registered in Patna. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for CBI, submitted the Maharashtra police had only registered an accidental death report under which they can only conduct an inquiry into the suicide of the actor. The court had reserved judgment in the case on August 11 after hearing the lawyers appearing for Chakraborty, Singh, the Bihar and Maharashtra governments, and CBI.Chakraborty challenged in her petition the Bihar police’s move to register the case against her since Rajput died in Mumbai. The 34-year-old actor’s body was found at his Mumbai home on June 14.Singh’s lawyer argued since his client lives in Patna, it gives the Bihar police the jurisdiction to lodge and investigate the case.Maharashtra linked politics to the lodging of the case in Patna and claimed a news report suggested Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar pressurized the police to register the case. It argued allowing the Bihar police to probe the case will be against the principle of federalism, which allows autonomy to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-cbi-to-probe-sushant-singh-rajput-case/story-z3L2nefKsifFmWkH5CmcoO.html

19-08-2020||India||‘Faceless assessment system will not displace tax officials’: CBDT chairman||Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman PC Mody has assured income-tax officials that the faceless assessment scheme will not result into either a large-scale transfer of taxmen or reduction in existing resources of the income-tax department, two officials said.CBDT chairman, through a virtual meeting with income-tax officials on Tuesday, dispelled doubts in the field formation that the faceless assessment will lead to a reduction in the workforce and a large scale of transfers, the officials present in the meeting said requesting anonymity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 13 announced three key structural tax reforms under the ‘Transparent Taxation - Honouring the Honest’ platform – Faceless Assessment, Faceless Appeal and Taxpayers Charter. While faceless assessment and taxpayers’ charter were formally implemented from Thursday, the faceless appeal will be implemented from September 25. The technology-driven faceless assessment system aims to end overreach by officials and the charter defines the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers.Also read: What is ‘faceless’ tax assessment? All you need to knowThe faceless tax assessment system was first proposed by the prime minister in 2017 and received a mention in the first budget of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, 2019. The system was subsequently launched on October 7, 2019. The system enables a random selection of tax cases through Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, with reduced discretion from for or no human interface with the income-tax department. The objective of faceless assessment is to completely eliminate physical contact between the taxpayer and the taxman to make tax administration objective, transparent and corruption-free. The system works under the National Assessment Centre (NeAC) headquartered in Delhi and eight Regional Assessment Centres (ReACs) located in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.CBDT chairman and its members on Tuesday explained taxmen about the implementation of the faceless assessment system and constitution of NeAC and ReACs including the reallocation and reorganisation of the manpower, the officials said.Mody told officials that the faceless assessment is being implemented with existing manpower preferably at the existing locations. “He sought to dispel all kind of misgivings and misapprehensions which may have been reflecting on the minds of the officers and officials of the department with regard to the national launch of the faceless assessment scheme,” one of the officials said.Mody reiterated that the implementation of the faceless assessment scheme was important to uphold the dignity of the service and, also, to change the narrative of negative public perception into a positive one.He expressed confidence that given the immense talent pool within the income-tax (I-T) department, the officials would definitely rise to the occasion and make the transition to transparent taxation a reality.The CBDT also made a presentation on the newly introduced taxpayers’ charter. “The officers were sensitised about the rights of the taxpayers as enshrined in the charter. It was emphasised that the charter be implemented in letter and spirit,” the official said.Officials said the demand management strategy to be adopted by the I-T department was also discussed in the meeting to identify and clean-up pending demands so that the correct demand, if any, could be made available to the taxpayers.“As a part of cleaning-up of demand, all pending rectifications and appeal effects were to be attended on priority as this was also one of the key factors of a transparent tax administration,” another official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faceless-assessment-system-will-not-displace-tax-officials-cbdt-chairman/story-P0wdz7awBu0QFCa9J2aTeI.html
19-08-2020||India||‘Goa needs him, will launch protest’: Congress as Satya Pal Malik moves out||Less than 24 hours after his transfer orders were signed by the President, Goa Governor Satya Pal Malik packed his bags and jetted off to Shillong, his new home and assignment, on Wednesday. The Congress, however, has sought cancellation of his transfer orders. Malik had pulled up the Pramod Sawant government for the handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the state and publicly reprimanded him for claiming that he (the Governor) was happy with the state’s response. It was one among the series of fallouts Malik had with the chief minister. Malik omitted any reference to CM Sawant in his farewell message to Goa. “I’m glad that I had an opportunity to serve in a beautiful state like Goa. During my tenure in Goa, which was almost 10 months, the experience has been nothing but pleasant. Goa is blessed with natural beauty. The people of Goa are very warm and generous. I have got tremendous love from the people of Goa. Goa has its own unique identity. People have their own way of living. I would love to visit Goa in times ahead and the state of Goa will always be close to my heart,” Malik said. “I wish to convey my best wishes to the people of Goa and pray that the state remains strong with all its solidarity and harmony,” Malik said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, however, belatedly thanked Malik for his services to Goa.“Extended warm send-off to Hon. Governor Shri Satya Pal Malik Ji, on his dep at Dabolim Airport. I thank him for all the support & guidance during his tenure in Goa. I congratulate him for his new assignment in Meghalaya & extend my best wishes to him in all his future endeavours,” CM Sawant tweeted. Digambar Kamat, leader of opposition in the state, was present at the airport to see off the Governor. He said it was unfortunate that Malik was transferred. “He was told to leave when Goa needed him the most. He has made a place in the heart of every Goan. Goa will always hold him in highest esteem. God bless him with health, happiness, peace & long life,” Kamat said. The Congress has demanded that Malik’s transfer orders be cancelled and vowed to organise protests to press for their demand. “The @INCGoa demands @rashtrapatibhvn to CANCEL transfer order of Hon’ble Governor of Goa SatyaPal Malikji. Goa now needs him the most. We will launch protests from 19th August @ 4pm at Azad Maidan demanding cancellation of his transfer order,” State Congress president Girish Chodankar tweeted. The people from the state praised Malik for placing the state’s interest above everything else. “He had been very vocal about spike & mismanagement of coronavirus cases in Goa, Mhadei water crisis, and other stupid actions of Goa govt, infuriating the BJP,” Shruti Chaturvedi, an entrepreneur in Goa, said. “Goa Governor Satyapal Malik could have saved Goa, he always advocated Goa’s Interest above the Government interest, he took stand on #Mhadei #COVID-19 situation in the State and where @DrPramodPSawant failed,” Hrudaynath Shirodkar, an activist, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-needs-him-will-launch-protest-congress-as-satya-pal-malik-moves-out/story-VCw6vUIB7nLq9kKrD3zCbI.html
19-08-2020||India||Vikas Dubey encounter: SC rejects plea against composition of probe panel||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea questioning the appointment of retired Supreme Court judge, justice BS Chauhan, as the head of a three-member judicial commission constituted to probe the encounter killing of gangster Vikas Dubey. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said it is rejecting the plea seeking replacement of justice Chauhan but stated that it is laying down some safeguards regarding the manner in which the commission has to conduct the probe.The petition filed by Mumbai-based lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay questioned the choice of justice Chauhan as the head of the commission, claiming that two relatives of the retired Supreme Court judge were part of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the ruling party in Uttar Pradesh. Placing reliance on an article published on an online news portal, Upadhyay alleged that justice Chauhan’s younger brother Virender Singh is a BJP member of the UP Legislative Council who, along with his son, switched loyalties to BJP last year from the Samajwadi Party. It was on Upadhyay’s petition the Supreme Court had earlier directed the UP government to set up a commission to probe the allegations against Uttar Pradesh police in relation to Dubey’s killing. The commission, which was set up on July 22, has retired Allahabad high court Chief Justice Shashi Kant Agarwal and former UP DGP KL Gupta as its other members During the hearing of the case on August 11, CJI Bobde took exception to Upadhyay’s submissions stating, “We will not allow you to cast aspersions on a former judge of this court based on a newspaper report.” The bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “Is any of Justice Chauhan’s relative connected with the encounter or the enquiry….Is belonging to a political party an illegal act. There are many judges whose fathers or uncles are Members of Parliament. Are they all corrupt?” Upadhyay said, “I am on the independence of inquiry. It will not be fair.” He had also given suggestions on persons who could replace the members in the judicial commission in the event his petition was accepted. Expressing dismay at such allegations being levelled against a former judge of the apex court, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for UP, said, “The allegation is that a former judge of this court is connected to the Government (of Uttar Pradesh). This is highly derogatory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-encounter-sc-rejects-plea-against-composition-of-probe-panel/story-1kNQRcnBMxdrxOYb8gLUYP.html

19-08-2020||India||HC refuses pre-arrest bail to trader booked for claiming fraudulent input tax credit of Rs 63.50 cr||Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a Mumbai-based trader, who is accused of fraudulently claiming the input tax credit (ITC) of Rs 63.50 crore on the materials that were never purchased by his firm and passed on the ITC to a web of firms across the country with whom he had never traded. Justice Sandeep Shinde rejected the pre-arrest bail plea of Ashok Kumar Chandrapal Singh, a partner in M/s. Sheela Sales Corporation. Central Goods and Sales Tax (CGST) authorities have alleged that the firm indulged in circular trading and claimed the ITC between July 2017 and September 2019 on the basis of invoices valued at Rs 352.92 crore, which were issued by M/s. Jai Bajrang Traders, an Uttar Pradesh (UP)-based company. CGST’s investigation has revealed that Singh passed on the ICT to six inter-linked firms, owned by the accused’s close relatives, and those firms, in turn, distributed it among 360 other companies located across the country. Singh and his wife, Sheela, also a partner in the firm, had moved HC for anticipatory bail apprehending arrest in connection with the fraud. It was argued on their behalf that CGST Act, 2017, prescribes a procedure for the tax assessment, even in cases where discrepancies are found in the information furnished in return sheets, and unless a summary assessment or special audit was conducted for determining liability, the prosecution could not be initiated and the couple cannot be arrested. Their counsel also argued that once returns were filed, CGST authorities could, at the most, impose a penalty. HC, however, refused to accept the argument. Justice Shinde perused the CGST file notings and Singh’s statements recorded under provisions of the CGST Act, 2017. CGSTThe judge said prima facie, the accused is complicit in availing ITC of Rs. 63.50 crore without movement of goods on forged invoices in breach of Section 16 of the CGST Act, 2017, which is a cognisable offence. HC primarily took note of the fact that Singh had in his statement admitted that neither his firm had received any goods from M/s. Jai Bajrang Traders, nor had it made any payment to the UP-based firm. “In terms of Section 136 of the CGST Act, 2017, disclosure in the statement is ‘relevant’ for proving any offence under the Act,” said the judge while rejecting Singh’s anticipatory bail plea. “Under these circumstances, the fraudulent ITC claim of Rs. 63.50 crore is a matter of grave concern and requires thorough investigation for which applicant’s (Singh’s) presence is necessary,” the judge said. HC, however, granted bail to Singh’s wife because as a homemaker she was a dormant partner and had no role to play in the financial matters of the partnership firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-trader-booked-for-claiming-fraudulent-input-tax-credit-of-rs-63-50-cr/story-rLnEMd0ufP2X1rZakVo9ZP.html

They have also arrested a businessman for carrying out fake transactions.Odisha GST commissioner Sushil Lohani said GST officials arrested Madhumita Steels Industries Private Limited director Kashmira Kumar Agrawal for allegedly transferring bogus input tax credit of Rs 129 crore to recipients in and the state Odisha through fake invoices worth Rs 712 crore.He said Agrawal had hired middlemen who collected documents, like PAN card, Aadhaar card and photographs, from people in Sundargarh and Sambalpur districts seeking employment, in exchange for money. He, then, allegedly misused the documents to create dummy firms in the name of these people. Agrawal also allegedly transferred huge sums of money to dummy firms. In case of one firm, he had shown to have purchased goods worth Rs 13 crore but had transferred Rs 38 crore through its bank accounts. Agrawal was arrested under section 69 of OGST Act, 2017 for cognizable and non-bailable offence u/s 132(1)(a) and (b) read with section 132(4) of OGST Act. On conviction, he can be imprisoned for up to five years.In other cases, documents showed that Agrawal’s firm despatched tonnes of goods, such as steel and iron items, through scooters, motor cycles, tractors and even cars, raising the suspicion of tax sleuths.The arrested businessman created fake bank accounts in which he transferred huge sums of money. At least Rs 2 crore was seized by the enforcement wing of Odisha GST from some accounts. He used to change his address to Rourkela, Haryana, Tata as well as Sambalpur. Some of the accused involved in the racket were arrested earlier.The detection of GST fraud has come at a time when the state’s collection in the first quarter of 2020-21 fiscal went down by 32.79% compared to the corresponding period of the last fiscal. The total collection in the three months was Rs 1,560.2 crore as against Rs 2,321.39 crore collected during the corresponding period of 2019-20 fiscal.GST, the indirect tax regime rolled out in July 2017, has been plagued by rampant tax evasion with fraudsters using technology to create fake e-way bills and GST returns.Odisha GST officials said at least two cases of major GST frauds have been detected in 2020 apart from the Agrawal case. In January this year, state’s GST enforcement authorities arrested two persons for frauds worth Rs 212 crore through 28 dummy firms in the name of daily wage labourers, private tutor, unemployed youths and homemakers.In March, they busted a fraud in which fake invoices to the tune of Rs 294 were generated by 11 dealers in Bhubaneswar. Two persons were arrested in that case.Last month, the Orissa high court had expressed its concern over increasing trend of GST fraud through non-existent firms and raised questions whether there were certain inherent flaws in the GST system, which is prone to such abuse. Dismissing the bail petition of a person accused of committing GST fraud, HC judge, Justice SK Panigrahi had said fraudsters are taking advantage of the inadequacy of electronic trails of all transactions by employing ingenious methods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-fraud-odisha-tax-officials-bust-rs-712-crore-gst-fraud-arrest-one-person/story-DTt4CknfIUbYvhYNsSf6VI.html
19-08-2020||India||Agree with Rahul that non-Gandhi should be Congress president, Priyanka in new book||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra agreed with her brother, Rahul Gandhi, last year when he said that a non-Gandhi should lead their party, according to a new book.The book, ‘India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next generation of Political Leaders’ written by US academicians Pradeep Chibber and Harsh Shah, also quotes Priyanka Gandhi as having said that the Congress should have its own path.“Perhaps not in the (resignation) letter but elsewhere he has said that none of us should be the president of the party and I am in full agreement with him,” the book quotes Priyanka Gandhi as having said in her interview to the authors. Commenting on it, a senior Congress functionary said, on the condition of anonymity, that “a 15-month old comment of Priyanka Gandhi is being projected as a fresh interview”. The authors had met Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on July 2019 for the interview and they had also spoken to Rahul Gandhi around the same time. Congress leaders recall that Rahul Gandhi had offered his resignation from the president’s post at a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on May 25 last year, taking responsibility for the party’s crushing defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Rahul Gandhi remained firm on his decision and posted a farewell note to his supporters on July 3 last year to put a stamp of finality on his resignation.In the CWC meeting, Rahul Gandhi slammed the veterans for “placing the interests” of their sons above the party, and also mentioned that some leaders had even lost the election from their strongholds even as he criticised a section of the so-called GenNext for hankering for posts.Also Read: Don’t need to be Congress president to strengthen it: Rahul in new bookHe also told the CWC a non-Gandhi should be elected as the new Congress chief. In the same meeting, Priyanka Gandhi, while insisting that only one person could not be held accountable for the poll debacle, had agreed with her brother that a non-Gandhi should become the Congress president.The Congress did try to find a non-Gandhi as its chief but failed to do so.Ahead of another CWC meeting on August 10, its members were divided into five groups to interact with state leaders from five regions of the country and evolve a consensus on the party chief’s name.While Sonia Gandhi was in the group that interacted with the leaders from the eastern region of the country, Rahul Gandhi was in the group for the west. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was part of the group for the north, Manmohan Singh south and Ambika Soni for the northeast.Priyanka Gandhi had outright rejected the demands for her to take over the party.On August 1, at a meeting of Congress general secretaries and in-charge of states to discuss preparations for the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on August 20, Priyanka Gandhi vetoed a suggestion that she assume the leadership role, squarely telling her party that she did not want to be dragged into this. Her move was aimed at firmly spiking an idea that has been supported by several senior Congress leaders over the last few weeks.A section of the Congress, including Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Thiruvananthapuram lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, had backed her for the post of the party president.These developments have surfaced at a time when several members among the party have been demanded that Rahul Gandhi be reinstated as the party president. Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari have also put forward a suggestion that the party should hold internal elections if Rahul Gandhi does not withdraw his resignation. Several ministers, MPs and former chief ministers have urged Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to settle the leadership issues and uncertainty in the Congress party. Priyanka Gandhi’s response came when a party general secretary, in the course of the meeting, suggested that she should come forward and assume the leadership role. She firmly told him and others present to desist from taking her name as her brother’s replacement. “Don’t drag me into this,” she had said.Before the CWC meeting on August 10 last year, senior leader Mukul Wasnik had emerged as one of the frontrunners for the top party post.However, consensus eluded the meeting and finally, the CWC requested Sonia Gandhi to once again accept the responsibility and after Rahul Gandhi turned down repeated demands to withdraw his resignation. She had given up the post in December 2017 when Rahul Gandhi assumed the reins of the party.Initially, Sonia Gandhi refused to accept the request but agreed after repeated pleas by party leaders on the condition that she would stay on interim chief only till the election to choose a full-time president was held.Sonia Gandhi has then said her returning as the party chief would again give a handle to the opponents to attack the Congress on grounds that the Gandhi family was unwilling to give up its hold over the party. Priyanka Gandhi’s remarks created a buzz in Congress circles amid a clamour for Rahul Gandhi to take up the responsibility once again. Leaders such as Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari have suggested that there should be internal elections if Rahul Gandhi refuses to withdraw his resignation. There is also a talk in the party that many leaders, including former chief ministers and MPs, have written to Sonia Gandhi to settle the leadership issue and end the uncertainty at the top.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agree-with-rahul-that-non-gandhi-should-be-congress-president-priyanka-in-new-book/story-t4VoYDYbXUh59rW6bmmE7H.html

19-08-2020||India||Covid centre built by Congress, CPI (M) in Bengal; BJP has a question for TMC||The Congress and the CPI (M) units in Bengal have christened portions of a Covid centre jointly built by them in Kolkata after veteran leaders from both the parties in a sign of growing closeness between the two in the build-up to the state polls next year. Political experts see this as an initiative by the two parties to take their bonhomie a notch higher in a bid to emerge as a third alternative to the ruling Trinamool Congress and the key opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in the 2021 elections. The Covid centre, in the Dum Dum area, has been developed by the two parties and the project was overseen by the local CPI (M) MLA Tanmoy Bhattacharya. The wards will be inaugurated on Wednesday afternoon. While the treatment unit (a liaison cell to help Covid patients get proper treatment and support their families) and the safe home have been named after Shyamal Chakraborty and Sankar Sen, former veterans of the CPI (M) who died recently, the oxygen supply unit has been named after Somen Mitra, veteran Congress leader who passed away on July 30.“The CPI (M) has always shared a cordial relation with the Congress in Dum Dum. This initiative would further boost the friendship,” said Bhattacharya. The BJP took a dig at the new centre saying that first the CPI (M) leaders should get clearance from the government. “They are naming a child who is yet to be born. Will the government give clearance to such centres? The health minister should answer this first,” said Rahul Sinha, national secretary of BJP. The Trinamool too panned it as a “publicity stunt”. “It would have been better had they named the three sections after three stalwarts of three parties – the CPI (M), the Congress and the BJP - because they are all the same. They have done nothing for the people in the past 34 years and now doing some publicity stunts fully aware that such centres mean nothing without government clearance,” said Chandrima Bhattacharjee, minister and senior TMC leader. Mitra, during his tenure as Bengal Congress president, remained a staunch proponent of a Left-Congress tie-up, both while organising a joint movement on the streets and also in the elections. Since going solo and the disastrous results that followed in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the CPI (M) and the Congress are gearing up in the state to put up a united fight in the state polls up ahead, which will likely see a high-octane battle between the TMC and the BJP. The CPI (M) and the Congress’ top leaders in the Assembly - Sujan Chakraborty and Abdul Mannan, respectively - have been frequently seen together over the past few months. A few months ago, the Congress supported the Left in the Rajya Sabha elections to get the CPI (M)’s Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya elected. Political analysts see in the CPI (M)’s overture to the Congress, the CPI (M) Bengal chapter’s keenness in contesting the elections together, even though the Marxist party’s central leadership has repeatedly blocked any formal alliance in Bengal because they fight the Congress in other states, especially Kerala. The two parties, which were once arch-rivals in the state and elsewhere too, are now seeking each other out. This bonhomie began in 2016 when the vote share of both parties started dwindling. While the CPI (M)’s vote share took a nosedive from 30% during the 2011 assembly elections when the TMC ended the 34-year-rule of the Left rule in the state to around 6.3% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls; the Congress’ vote share too has plummeted and has come down to 5.6% in 2019 from 9% in 2011. A senior CPI (M) leader who did not want to be identified said that both parties have realised from the outcome of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections that sticking together is of utmost importance to save the party organisations from the TMC and BJP. “Former West Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra and CPI (M) politburo member Biman Bose had decided that alliance between the two parties would not be just for the sake of elections but to address the grievances of people of Bengal. This initiative would definitely boost the relation,” said Amitabha Chakraborty, a senior Congress leader. But over the past few months the relation between the two parties have soared to new highs with the Left Front leaders going to Bidhan Bhavan, the headquarters of the state Congress committee, to offer tributes to the former West Bengal chief minister and legendary doctor Bidhan Chandra Roy on his birth anniversary. Somen Mitra played a crucial role in forging an electoral understanding of left parties and the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Also Congress MLA Asit Mitra attended Shyamal Chakraborty’s remembrance ceremony at the CPI (M) state office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-centre-built-by-congress-cpi-m-in-bengal-bjp-has-a-question-for-tmc/story-rPLzjd2WTkC84Fqb93modL.html
19-08-2020||India||Delhi wakes up to early morning shootout on Wednesday||The Delhi Police’s special cell team arrested a 19-year-old suspected criminal, the son of gangster Manoj Bakkarwala, after a brief chase and exchange of bullets in outer Delhi’s Prahladpur near Shahbad Dairy in the early hours of Wednesday.The arrested criminal, Ashish Bakkarwala, had been released from Delhi’s Tihar Jail in April as part of the Delhi government’s move to decongest prisons to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He was in jail for committing a murder, senior police officers associated with the early morning operation said.Five bullets were exchanged between the special cell sleuths and Ashish, who suffered a bullet injury in the right leg and has been admitted to a government hospital, where he is being treated. Of the three bullets Ashish fired, one hit the bulletproof vest of a sub-inspector, who escaped unhurt, senior special cell officers said.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said that after being released as part of the prisons’ decongestion move, Ashish attempted to extort two persons for ₹1 crore each and shot at them in outer Delhi’s Bakkarwala near Mundka in May.The gangster father-son duo belongs to the Bakkarwala locality in outer Delhi. The city police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh on Ashish’s arrest.“Ashish was wanted for both cases. On Tuesday, our team received information that he would be coming to Prahladpur area to kill someone. Accordingly, we laid a trap, and around 4am, spotted Ashish riding a scooter. Our team members asked him to surrender. But he opened fire in a bid to flee. Our officers fired in self-defence and one bullet hit Ashish’s right leg. We overpowered him and admitted him to a hospital,” said DCP Yadav.A special cell officer, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said on condition of anonymity that Ashish committed the two serious crimes within an hour on the night of May 17. Around 10pm, Ashish and his associate went to the house of a property dealer in Bakkarwala, fired two shots in the air and threw down a piece of paper asking the property dealer to pay ₹1 crore and threatening him of dire consequences, the officer said, quoting the contents of the first information report registered on the complaint of the property dealer, who is constructing a school in the neighbourhood.Within an hour, the officer said, Ashish went to an under-construction hospital site in the same locality, put a gun to a security guard’s head and asked him to inform the hospital owner to arrange ₹1 crore as “protection money”. Both the cases were registered at the Mundka police station.According to the officer, to avoid arrest, Ashish hid out in Punjab and Haryana and visited Delhi only to extort people for money or commit other crimes.“Ashish entered the world of crime while he was a juvenile. He has been involved in at least six other crimes, including a murder. We are collecting details,” the officer added.Between mid-2000 and 2012, Manoj Bakkarwala ruled Delhi’s crime world and was involved in more than 300 cases of carjacking and vehicle thefts. Manoj, who allegedly started his criminal career in 1998, was first arrested the same year. Manoj has escaped from police custody on at least three occasions and is reportedly on the run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-wakes-up-to-early-morning-shootout-wednesday/story-jJqFmMj8DVRk6s1PPpsM2J.html

The court said that said Bihar government was competent to give consent to CBI for probing into the Patna FIR.A single-judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy pronounced the judgement.The bench held that the contents as disclosed by the FIR registered in Patna indicate that even Mumbai Police has jurisdiction.The apex court had reserved its judgement on Chakraborty’s petition after a hearing on August 11.In her petition, Chakraborty said that the Bihar Police have no jurisdiction in the case and that the actor’s death was being used for political gains ahead of elections in the state. Heightened media attention and sensationalising of the case is another ground on which Chakraborty has sought the transfer of the case to Mumbai.Based on Rajput’s father KK Singh’s complaint that Rhea Chakraborty was responsible for abetment of his son’s suicide, Patna Police registered an FIR on July 25.Singh also alleged that Chakraborty illegally transferred Rs 15 crore from Rajput’s bank account. However, the actor has denied all allegations and maintained that she will cooperate with an investigation launched by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Meanwhile, Singh was quizzed by the ED on his son’s finances on Tuesday.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also registered a case against Chakraborty and three members of her family members.Sushant Singh Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-orders-cbi-investigation-in-sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-case/story-faDVyVENasV2bsp8u1kQ8I.html

In the first instance (June 16), the cause of the spike in daily deaths was Delhi and Maharashtra reporting a reconciliation of deaths. On July 22, the death reconciliation panel in Chennai corrected a discrepancy in the city’s Covid-19 numbers by adding 444 deaths to the toll.This means that all actual instances of the daily deaths touching four-digits (if we exclude days when backdated deaths were added to the tally) have been reported over the past 10 days. This also means that Tuesday’s deaths were the highest single-day deaths reported in the country if we exclude reconciled deaths.The total cases in the country went up to 2,763,712 as of Tuesday night. Among these, 53,010 people have died, while 2,034,828 patients have recovered and been discharged. At present, there are 675,874 active cases in the country.India has the third-highest number of infections in the world after the US (5.6 million cases and over 175,000 deaths) and Brazil (3.4 million cases and over 110,000 deaths). However, India’s case fatality ratio – the proportion of Covid-19 patients who have died of the disease – is far lower than the other two nations. Around 1.9% of the Covid patients in India have succumbed to the disease, compared to 3.1% in the US and 3.2% in Brazil. Globally, there have been over 21 million cases of the disease and 773,152 deaths – taking the global CFR to 3.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-tuesday-covid-19-crosses-1-000-mark-for-third-time-in-10-days/story-5Q0jM5oIUwObm6ARdUpkaN.html

These people assembled around the vendors, did not wear masks and also didn’t bother about social distancing. Besides, spitting on the roads and vegetables kept in the open also aided the spread of Covid-19 infection. These facts emerged in the contact tracing by the health department here. On the basis of inputs given by people about their outings, authorities stationed teams to monitor vendors selling gol-gappas, pakoras, tea and vegetables. Also read: Kashi has railway stations after its three names Kashi, Varanasi, BanarasPeople gathering at such places neither wore masks nor maintained social distancing said a senior official of CMO’s core team. “After random sampling, a vendor and two others tested positive,” he said citing an example of a big paan shop in Swaroop Nagar. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr AK Mishra said many such vendors tested positive in random sampling by the teams in Kanpur. He wrote to the Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC), Food Safety and Drug Authority (FSDA) and DIG/SSP to take effective measures to check the spread of infection. The letter to the DIG/SSP stated that a huge number of people gather around roadside eateries and paan shops, where social distancing was not being maintained. The letter also pointed to the fact that people were turning up without masks. “I have requested for strict action against people who are not wearing masks in public places and not adhering to basic safety norms like keeping distance,” he added. In his letter, the CMO suggested strong monitoring of public places, street vendors, kirana stores, milk, ice cream shops and vegetable markets. The police also stepped up action against people seen without masks. In the last three months, 57,057 people were fined for moving on the road sans mask. As part of a renewed strategy, we are ensuring that people don’t move around in public places without masks. Adhering to basic norms can help people in the current situation when Covid-19 cases are on the rise,” said Preetinder Singh, DIG/SSP (Kanpur). “The police have been asked to monitor gatherings in markets, malls, shops, roads and impose penalties on people showing up without masks. At the same time, no crowding should be allowed at shops and eateries in particular,” he added.

This is the first lake, which is located outside Mumbai and supplies 450 million litres to the city, to overflow. The water stock in the seven lakes is 82% until Tuesday and the current reserve can last around 320 days.However, there is still no clarity over revoking the 20% daily water cut for each household in Mumbai that was announced by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities on August 5 owing to meagre rainfall in the catchment areas. Earlier, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told HT that the civic authorities would re-examine the daily water cut rule, if the stock improved. Upper Vaitarna, Middle Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tansa, Bhatsa, Vihar, and Tulsi are the lakes that supply drinking water to Mumbai. Latest data showed the following water stock in these lakes: Upper Vaitarna (67%), Middle Vaitarna (98.3%), Tansa (89.9%), and Bhatsa (81.03%). The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems. The Vaitarna system supplies to Mumbai and its western suburbs. While the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are located in Mumbai, Thane, and Palghar districts of Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/water-stock-for-mumbai-now-at-82-modak-sagar-lake-overflows/story-BWNh1p9PKFjRmSxHiOHb7I.html
19-08-2020||India||New Ganga law will define cleanliness levels, make polluters pay||The Union government plans to bring a new legislation to keep the Ganga, Hinduism’s holiest river, clean and pollution-free. A draft of the proposed law is currently being vetted by multiple authorities before it will be sent for the Cabinet’s approval, people familiar with the matter said.The government started the Namami Gange campaign to clean the Ganga, one of the world’s most polluted rivers with sewage and industrial waste discharged into it for decades.Millions of Hindus worship the 1,560-mile (2510 km) river. The Ganga basin supports over 400 million of India’s 1.3 billion people.Efforts to rid the river of pollutants go back to 1980s, marked by two successive programmes known as Ganga Action Plans.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Namami Gange Programme in June 2014, when it first took charge, as a project of national importance.The proposed law now being drafted will set down legal obligations to prevent pollution, fix biological and effluent parameters to be maintained at all times at key geographical points and cities through which the river flows, an official said.The eight states of the Ganga basin. where the proposed law will be especially applicable are Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.Cleaning the Ganga is a gargantuan task requiring multiple authorities to coordinate between states and the Centre. It requires massive engineering solutions, including sewerage infrastructure, sewage treatment plants, rural sanitation systems, industrial pollution abatement, river-surface cleaning and re-construction of ghats, or river-front steps.A consortium of Indian Institutes of Technology and international partner nations, including Germany, Israel, European Union and Japan, have helped prepare the main technical plan to clean the Ganga.The proposed law will have a ‘polluters-pay’ approach, which means illegal factories will be shut down -- many have already been closed-- and permitted ones will be required to treat their sewage. Certain types of polluting factories will be banned from discharging any sewage into the river.However, the government is not in favour of imposing a wider “Pigouvian tax” on polluters affecting the Ganga, a second official said. Named after the English economist Arthur Pigou, a Pigouvan tax is a cost imposed on “externalities”, or simply, pollution due to economic activities.The Namami Gange project aims to ensure that no untreated municipal sewage or industrial runoff enters the river. According to a 2010 study by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, treatment plants processed only 45% of the 11 billion litres of sewage generated by 181 cities and towns along the Ganga in that year.“Under the flagship programme of Namami Gange, a total 310 projects to prevent pollution at the cost of Rs 28790.66 crore have been sanctioned so far,” the second official said on condition of anonymity.Nearly 704 industries along the Ganga’s banks were inspected by the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA). Three-fifths of them have been shut down. Nearly 500 massive sewage trapping devices have been installed so far.Of the 29 major nullahs (storm drains) flowing into the river in Varanasi, 27 now have systems to capture waste. The government has stopped pollution fully from Kanpur’s biggest drain, Sisamau, the biggest polluter of the Ganga. Of Kanpur’s 48 drains, eight still have no devices to stop effluents. All drains in Rishikesh and Haridwar have been fitted with anti-pollution systems. In all, 80 drains still need to be plugged.Under the “subject” of water in the Constitution, the Union has extensive powers to bring laws to protect rivers from pollution, according to the second official.The second official said the proposed law would lay down scientific reference limits for the river’s “health”. For instance, it would set the legal limits of BOD or biological oxygen demand load — a key pollution indicator. It would also lay down the minimum necessary flow rate and dissolved oxygen, two key parameters of a flowing river’s health.Kanpur, a large industrial city in Uttar Pradesh, was the biggest pollution generator before the launch of Namami Gange. “The Ganga’s length is almost 1,000 km in Uttar Pradesh, the stretch most polluted. Uttar Pradesh had two stretches that still pollutes the river, apart from five critical pollution points in West Bengal,” said Gyanendra Shukla, former professor of environmental engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. At these places, the dissolved oxygen is below the desired level in the Ganga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-to-bring-new-law-to-keep-ganga-clean/story-XT0sNAofJAyBiUcF6STg8L.html
19-08-2020||India||‘Sangeet Martand’ Pt Jasraj shared decades-old bond with city of Kashi||Legendary classical vocalist and Padma Vibhushan recipient Pt Jasraj shared an old bond with Kashi which spanned over four decades. He visited Varanasi every year since 1973, the year he performed at the Sankatmochan Sangeet Samaroh at the Sankatmochan Temple. This year, he gave an online performance from New Jersey on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti and then during the Sankatmochan Sangeet Samaroh in April.Sankatmochan temple’s chief priest Vishwambhar Nath Mishra said, “With the death of Pt Jasrajji, an era of music has ended. He was indeed the Sangeet Martand (shining as bright as the sun - referring to the Films Division documentary on the maestro titled ‘Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj, in 2000).“His demise is a personal loss for me. We shared over a 47-year-old bond with him. He was a legend and a very generous and great human being. He was blessed with a unique style of singing. His performance used to leave the audience enthralled.” Also read: Kashi has railway stations after its three names Kashi, Varanasi, Banaras“Pt Jasrajji used to stay at the guesthouse of the Sankatmochan Temple during his visit to Kashi. He never stayed in a hotel,” he added.Mishra said that relations with Pt Jasraj’s family will remain strong. He revealed that this year, Pt Jasraj called him up on the phone and insisted on giving an online performance on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti. Seven days later he performed at the Sankatmochan Sangeet Samaroh online. “In 1973, Dr Induja Awasthi, who was a professor at Delhi University, appealed to my father, Veerbhadra Mishra, to invite Pt Jasraj to the Sankatmochan Sangeet festival. Thereafter, Pt Jasraj was invited. My grandfather, Amarnath Mishra, a noted Pakhawaj artist, was very happy to meet Pt Jasraj. Soon, we were sharing family relations with him. Though his performance used to take place on the last day, he used to come on the first day of the Sankatmochan Sangeet Samaroh,” Mishra added. “We are left with innumerable memories of times spent with Pt Jasraj,” Mishra said, adding that “such a legend is born after ages”.He said that Pt Jasraj spread the magic of classical singing across the world. He visited and performed in a large number of countries and also imparted training to a number of pupils, “many of whom are doing well. But his demise has created a void which is impossible to fill. He will remain alive in our memories forever,” Mishra said. Padma Vibhushan and noted vocalist Pt Chhannu Lal Mishra said that the man with the magical voice has left us. Pt Jasraj underwent training in classical singing at the age of 14. He also trained to play the tabla from his brother, Pt Pratap Narayan Mishra. As a radio artist, it was Pratap Narayan who shaped young Jasraj’s musical abilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sangeet-martand-pt-jasraj-shared-decades-old-bond-with-city-of-kashi/story-fG9xlG10ZVrU77AvI0mvjI.html
19-08-2020||India||Parliament monsoon session may start around September 10||The much-awaited monsoon session of Parliament may finally start around September 10, functionaries involved in the discussions told HT. The monsoon session, which usually starts in mid-July, had to be deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic that saw a sweeping federal lockdown from March 25, which continues to affect select sectors such as international travel, schools and Metro trains. According to the functionaries, the session is expected to be short but supported by unprecedented logistics and infrastructure arrangements, including ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in air-conditioning systems to kill or inactivate microorganisms, 10 display screens for live proceedings, earmarked seats for top leaders and special communication cables linking both Houses. The length of the session has not been decided and will depend on the government’s decision to hold the proceedings of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on alternate days or a staggered daily schedule. While Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla are believed to favour a staggered daily schedule as it will help keep the session short and MPs from outside Delhi will spend as little time in the Capital as possible, some ministries prefer alternate days as it will be easier for them to cater to the demand of two Houses. Officials said the government will focus on clearing the ordinances that have been passed in the past four months. The Narendra Modi government has, in recent months, brought in three ordinances to redefine the legal framework of India’s agricultural markets as a part of its Covid-19 response. It amended the Essential Commodities Act, brought a new legislation on contract farming, and changed the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) laws to allow farmers sell their produce freely. At the same time, the Opposition will push for debate on economy, the India-China border conflict and Covid-19 management, to corner the government.

He was inducted into chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s cabinet in July and is expected to get a BJP ticket to contest the by-poll from Dimni.“The minister’s office sought details in writing like names and surnames of the police personnel, their contact numbers and since how long they have been posted...,” said a police officer on condition of anonymity.Dandotia admitted to writing to police stations but insisted it was a routine information gathering on his office’s part.The minister’s office wrote to the police stations last week after he faced a protest at Datterhra village during his tour in the constituency. A group of villagers raised slogans against him and asked him to go back. They also blamed him for pursuing caste politics. Video clips on the protest went viral on social media.Congress leader Madhuaraj Singh accused Dandotia of supporting people on the basis of their castes. “Now, he wants posting of police personnel on the basis of caste to manipulate the byelection results. That is why he has sought to know the credentials of police personnel posted in police stations. This is quite unusual that a minister’s office should write to police stations directly.”Another Congress leader KK Mishra said Dandotia knows he is sure to lose the byelection and his ministerial position given his betrayal with people of the constituency. “Hence, his seeking details of the police personnel is nothing but an act done out of frustration.”Morena police superintendent Anurag Sujaniya refused to comment on the matter.Dandotia insisted as a public representative and minister, it is his right to know about the local police personnel and other government employees. “A minister’s office must have all the details like names, numbers etc. It has nothing to do with any caste politics. The Congress leaders wish to make it a political issue and they are trying to provoke people against me but they cannot succeed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-minister-s-office-asks-for-details-of-police-personnel-opposition-blames-him-for-caste-politics/story-13qGz30bRQcqwUh2s48cFI.html
19-08-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 recoveries cross 2 million; daily recoveries higher than new infections||India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recoveries have crossed the two-million mark, as the number of recovering patients has outnumbered new viral infections, the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) data showed. At present, the number of active Covid-19 cases are less than 25% of the total number of the viral infections reported since January 30. “When we talk about the viral caseload of a particular country, it is always the active cases that are counted. It is never the total number of positive cases,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, MoH&FW. Around 60,000 Covid-19 patients are recovering daily from their viral infection. While around 55,000 new Covid-19 cases are being reported a day.A continuous uptick in average daily recoveries has led to India’s recovery rate at 73.18% and a low case fatality rate (CFR) at 1.92%. Higher number of recoveries and declining fatality has shown that the country’s graded strategy has worked, according to the ministry. “The number of hospitalisation cases has also reduced. A small percentage of Covid-19 patients need to be admitted to hospitals. Most of them recover from their viral infection under home isolation. Few Covid-19 patients are in need of a ventillator support. A majority of those who get admitted make a smooth recovery. However, the problem is by and large with high-risk cases such as senior citizens and those with comorbidities,” said Dr. Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, department of internal medicine, Max Healthcare. The government’s target is to bring down the percentage of Covid-19-related deaths to either 1% or below. “As a result of collaborative and focussed efforts by the Centre and state/UT (Union Territory) governments built on effective implementation of the test, track and treat strategy of the Union government, 30 States/UTs are reporting lower CFR than the national average,” said the ministry in a statement. Aggressive testing leads to early identification and isolation of positive cases. Besides, efficient clinical treatment has ensured the country’s Covid-19 fatality rate is low, said ministry officials. India is testing around 900,000 swab samples daily and three million people have undergone Covid-19 tests since January 23, when Pune’s National Institute of Virology, under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), conducted the first test. “The more you test, the more infected cases you will be able to identify. Initially, the positivity rate may seem to be climbing, but gradually it will come down. It is important to aggressively test so that we capture most of our infected in the early stages of the disease, and isolate them. It will cut the transmission cycle and also bring down deaths and increase recovery rates,” said T Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-recoveries-cross-2-million-daily-recoveries-higher-than-new-infections/story-3Bn8qDcWAht5VnuP4BuzJK.html
19-08-2020||India||Kashi has railway stations after its three names Kashi, Varanasi, Banaras||Manduadih railway station, equipped with modern facilities for passengers as well as physically challenged travellers, will now be known as Banaras railway station.The Union home ministry on Monday approved the renaming of the several-decades-old railway station. North Eastern Railway (Varanasi division) public relations officer Ashok Kumar said, “It is the best station in Varanasi division in terms of facilities. It is equipped with an air-conditioned lounge, world-class retiring room, digital chart facility, a cafeteria and food plaza. Its architecture is unique and looks like an airport.”Kumar said that the station is also equipped with special facilities for differently-abled people. A plan was envisaged for developing it as a satellite station to decrease the pressure on Varanasi Cantt railway station.Also read: Covid-19 test must for UP legislators ahead of assembly session tomorrowFormer union minister of state for railways Manoj Sinha took a keen interest in developing the railway station as one that is equipped with all possible facilities for passengers. Thereafter, the station was completely transformed two years ago. Earlier, it had three platforms but now boasts of eight, and a beautiful building. The transformation took place at an estimated cost of Rs 37 crore.Kumar said that 21 pairs of mail and express trains and five pairs of passenger trains pass through the railway station on normal days. Also, eight pairs of mail express trains and two pairs of passenger trains originate and terminate at the station.An official, who didn’t wish to be quoted, said that before the 2019 general elections, then union minister of state for railways Manoj Sinha wrote a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath urging him to ponder over renaming of Manduadih station as Banaras. During a speech at a programme, in Varanasi in 2019, the chief minister mentioned Sinha’s letter and assured him that he would consider it. But the process could not proceed further due to elections. After the election, the process moved forward.BHU social sciences dean Kaushal Kishore Mishra said, “Kashi is also known as Varanasi and Banaras. In the ancient city, a railway station is named after Kashi. It is known as Kashi railway station. Another station is named after Varanasi - Varanasi Cantt. A railway station named after Banaras was needed for a long time. Now it has happened. It is a good step.”Banaras is well known across the world but not as Manduadih. Therefore, the renaming of the station was the need of the hour, Mishra said and added that it will help attract tourists and promote tourism.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashi-has-railway-stations-after-its-three-names-kashi-varanasi-banaras/story-vYo4HidnQXASlgkVJpd6eJ.html
19-08-2020||India||Guwahati HC asks Centre to respond on drilling gas wells inside Assam biosphere||New Delhi: The Gauhati high court (HC) has sought the response of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and the Central government to a public interest litigation (PIL), challenging the nod granted to Oil India Limited (OIL) authorities on drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations inside and under the jurisdiction of Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts.OIL authorities had said on Monday that the gas and oil spill at its well in Baghjan, which had occurred on May 27 and had impacted a large area of wetland and grasslands, was successfully capped after 83 days. The Baghjan operations have been in the news for the environmental disaster, which could have a long-term impact on local people, animals, and ecology, according to a recent assessment by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) authorities.The petition has challenged the environmental clearance granted to OIL on May 11 to drill inside DSNP. On Tuesday, the HC directed the OIL authorities to file a point-by-point rebuttal to the plea and also asked assistant solicitor-general SC Keyal, who represented the Central government and MoEFCC, to file a response by September 21. “All parties have been issued notices and have been directed to file their response by September 21 on the matter,” said Keyal. The petition cited that OIL had initiated the proposal to drill inside DSNP in 2016 and again in 2019. It alleged that OIL in a bid to escape mandatory public hearings required under environment impact assessment (EIA), notification, 2006, took recourse to an amendment by the Central government on January 16. The amendment had re-categorised all onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration to B2 category project from A category project and, as a result, these projects were exempted from public hearings. “A public hearing is mandatory under law, as per the Supreme Court. OIL authorities cannot exempt themselves from this democratic process,” said Debajit Kumar Das, the advocate, who represented the petitioner. The petition has also sought a blanket ban on further drilling and extraction of oil or other minerals in eco-sensitive and biodiversity-rich areas of Assam.“We are aware of the HC order. We will respond to the order through an affidavit,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL.The WII, which had submitted its report to the MoEFCC in July, also recommended that the approved new wells and exploration in the DSNP landscape should be put on hold until OIL authorities are equipped to handle industrial disasters. The report underlined that the Maguri Motapung wetland and surrounding lowland forests are unique and extremely vulnerable to more oil spill disasters. “The Brahmaputra and Gangetic floodplain landscape is unique in its morphology and fragility, and is responsible for shaping the unique community of plants and animals … the landscape is fragile and is engineered by flooding. The dynamic nature of wetland creates mosaics of habitat, which are in perpetual flux. In India as well as the world over, there are only a handful of Protected Areas (PAs), where this system and unique biodiversity is surviving. Among them, DSNP, Kaziranga and Orang National Park tops the list,” the report said. It pointed out that oil wells in and around DSNP would be detrimental to the unique ecosystem. The landscape is also extremely vulnerable to earthquakes and occasionally large tremors, it warned.Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve harbours tiger, elephant, wild buffalo, leopard, hoolock gibbon, capped langur, slow loris, Ganges River dolphin besides critically endangered bird species such as the Bengal florican, white-winged wood duck, greater adjutant stork, white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture as well as the very rare and endemic black-breasted parrotbill, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guwahati-hc-asks-centre-to-respond-on-drilling-gas-wells-inside-assam-biosphere/story-T94xaRhZcO2IAAHFknwprJ.html
19-08-2020||India||Depression likely to form over Bay of Bengal, will intensify monsoon: IMD||New Delhi: Widespread and heavy rains are expected over different parts of north-west India, including the Western Himalayan region and central India, until Thursday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities said on Wednesday. The monsoon trough is active and lies south of its normal position (from Ganganagar to the Bay of Bengal). It is very likely to be active and near-normal/south of its normal position during the next three-four days, IMD said in its morning bulletin. Delhi received moderate to heavy category rain, measuring between 7.6 millimetres (mm) and 124.4 mm, on Wednesday early morning. “The monsoon trough is active and lies close to its normal position. It is very likely to shift southwards during the next 24 hours and remain active during the next five days. There is a convergence of strong moist southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea over plains of north-west India and Central India at lower levels and likely to continue during the next three-four days,” IMD said in its Wednesday bulletin. A well-marked low-pressure area is lying over the northwest Bay of Bengal. It is very likely to move westwards gradually and concentrate into a depression during next 24 hours. Due to these favourable conditions, widespread rain, with isolated heavy to very heavy spells, is very likely over Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Vidarbha during the next four-five days. Extremely heavy rain is also likely over south-west Odisha on Wednesday; Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on Thursday and Gujarat on Saturday. “Delhi has already recorded 6-7 centimetres (cm) of rainfall on Wednesday. While Gurugram received about 8.6 mm until 8.30 am. Punjab and Haryana are also receiving heavy rains. This is mainly because monsoon trough is located exactly over Delhi. There are strong moisture-laden winds blowing from the Arabian Sea, which are bringing heavy rains to the region. This weather will continue until the end of Thursday. But on August 23 and 24, we are also expecting heavy rains again because a low-pressure area has formed over the Bay of Bengal which will intensify into a depression,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC). Fairly widespread and heavy rain is likely over north-west India, including the Western Himalayan region, until Thursday. Very heavy rain is likely over Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh on Wednesday and Uttarakhand and Punjab on Thursday; western Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday; eastern Rajasthan from Thursday until Saturday; and very heavy rain is likely also over northeastern states, except for Arunachal Pradesh, during the next three-four days, the IMD said. “Depressions are fairly common during monsoon. At least two depressions are formed every July, which bring extensive and heavy rain. This will be the first depression of the season. Depressions bring heavy rain and strong winds. We are expecting extremely heavy rains in Odisha because of the depression until the end of Thursday. Similarly, over Chhattisgarh for the next one-two days; and over MP, Rajasthan, and Gujarat,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD. Monsoon rain over the country since June 1 is 4.4% excess; 25.6% excess over the southern peninsula; 6.9% excess over central India; 5.8% excess over eastern and north-eastern India and 17.9% deficiency over north-west India. There are reports of 16.3% excess rains over the country in August, with 68.1% excess over peninsula India; 35.1% excess over central India; 16.6% deficiency over northwest India and 18.3 deficiency over eastern and north-eastern India as on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rains-expected-over-nw-and-central-india-for-next-2-to-3-days/story-FkjZXg6MkZGZdjkPESOsFP.html

It, however, warned that India being a huge country with a massive population needs to be cautious as a challenge against the coronavirus disease still persists.“This is a bit satisfactory but there is no reason to slacken our guard against coronavirus. We have to be alert and follow containment, surveillance, and testing at the same aggressive pace,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-64-531-fresh-covid-19-cases-taking-tally-close-to-2-8-million/story-FXG4AXxxkeZduphrDDP7SI.html

19-08-2020||India||Why naval commanders’ meet is significant: 5 reasons||India’s top naval commanders will discuss important operational issues during a three-day conference in New Delhi beginning today, amid the ongoing border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh. The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean region (IOR) where scores of warships are ready for any task in the aftermath of the border row. While the Indian Navy is keeping a sharp eye on the IOR, it is also playing a key role in the Ladakh sector. Its P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, imported from the US, are being used for surveillance of the Ladakh sector and gathering intelligence on Chinese deployments across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). Here are five reasons why the conference is significant: • It comes at a time when the navy has stepped up surveillance and activities in the IOR, which, it believes, China will inevitably try to enter in its quest to become a global power, just as it has laid claim to large portions of the disputed South China Sea. • The conference will provide the naval leadership a forum to discuss issues related to operations and the scenario in the IOR where the Chinese navy has been trying to expand its footprint. • India is keeping tabs on China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the Chinese navy doesn’t muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity. • The stage is also set for Australia to be part of the next Malabar naval exercise conducted by India with the United States and Japan. The next edition of Malabar, already delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is set to be held by the end of the year. Australia’s participation could be discussed at the conference. • The conference also comes at a time when self reliance in the defence sector is a top priority for the government. Several of the 101 defence items in the negative import list, released on August 9, include naval weapons and systems, including conventional submarines and ship-borne cruise missiles. The navy will be steering one of the costliest ‘Make in India’ programmes to build six next-generation submarines in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-naval-commanders-meet-is-significant-5-reasons/story-7GmtD6MSiq3H9wrdlFRneO.html
19-08-2020||India||Covid-19 test must for UP legislators ahead of assembly session tomorrow||A coronavirus test appears mandatory for the Uttar Pradesh lawmakers attending the state legislative assembly that is expected to begin its session from tomorrow.Principal secretary, Vidhan Sabha, Pradeep Dubey has sent a letter to all the members informing them about the Covid testing facility provided at all the Vidhayak Niwas and in the Vidhan Bhawan complex. “Before taking part in the proceedings, Covid-19 test is necessary for all the members. I have been asked to convey this,” said Dubey in his letter. Members have also been given the option of getting tested in their district. But the test should be done on or after August 18, read the letter. Testing for staff members and the security personnel was held the last two days in which about two dozen odd people had tested positive.“Members have begun getting tested for Covid-19. Staffers and those functioning from other departments left out on Monday were also tested on Tuesday. We have informed members about the facility of testing available at the Vidhan Bhawan and the Vidhayak Niwas,” said Speaker of state assembly Hridaya Narain Dikshit. The state legislative council has, meanwhile, scheduled tests for all the staffers and members on Wednesday and Thursday now. Meanwhile, veteran Samajwadi Party (SP) MLC Shatrudra Prakash on Tuesday claimed the seating arrangements being made in the chamber sought to lower the dignity of the chair. “This is understood that the seat of the speaker or the chairman cannot be lower than that of any other member,” he pointed out in a letter addressed to Vidhan Parishad chairman Ramesh Yadav. “But as per the special seating arrangements being made, many members will be made to sit in the elevated visitor’s gallery while the chairman will be sitting on the ground floor,” he added. The MLC further said he had earlier written a letter seeking permission for members above 65 years of age to virtually attend the session in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I have not got the reply to the letter yet,” he said. The Vidhan Parishad secretariat has decided to make seating arrangements in a way that members are at a sufficient distance from each other, using up the seats in the visitor’s gallery too. In his letter, Prakash also raised questions over the credibility of the rapid antigen tests that the administration was organising for members and the staff before the commencement of the House. “The rapid test only gives an idea and not the accurate report,” he said citing the example of Delhi and the WHO recommendations. “I, therefore, request you to arrange for a system of more credible and reliable testing,” he demanded. Vidhan Sabha chairman Ramesh Yadav said he had received the letter raising questions over the seating arrangements and rapid tests. “The visitor’s gallery where some members will sit on a greater height is not part of the chamber where proceedings are conducted. And as for tests, we are conducting rapid tests so that we can get results quickly and as accurate as possible and take action accordingly. It is not possible to send samples to labs due to paucity of time,” he stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-test-must-for-up-legislators-ahead-of-assembly-session-tomorrow/story-DNcF6Ryg4Wj8Bd4PJW3mbL.html

A single-judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy will pronounce the judgment at 11am.The apex court had reserved its judgement on the actor’s petition after a hearing on August 11.In her petition, Chakraborty said that the Bihar Police have no jurisdiction in the case and that the actor’s death was being used for political gains ahead of elections in the state. Heightened media attention and sensationalising of the case is another ground on which Chakraborty has sought the transfer of the case to Mumbai.Based on Rajput’s father KK Singh’s complaint that Rhea Chakraborty was responsible for abetment of his son’s suicide, Patna Police registered an FIR on July 25. Singh also alleged that Chakraborty illegally transferred Rs 15 crore from Rajput’s bank account. However, the actor has denied all allegations and maintained that she will cooperate with an investigation launched by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Meanwhile, Singh was quizzed by the ED on his son’s finances on Tuesday.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also registered a case against Chakraborty and three members of her family members.Sushant Singh Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-on-rhea-s-petition-to-transfer-fir-in-sushant-s-death-case-to-mumbai-at-11am/story-t5LfmkdPmQRMt0428GATBJ.html

19-08-2020||India||Upfront NPV payments exempted||The Union environment ministry has exempted firms from upfront payment of net present value (NPV) of the forests diverted for mining until March 31 next year, or up to two months after the Covid-19 pandemic ends, whichever is earlier, officials aware of the matter said on Tuesday.NPV payments are made to compensate for the losses of forests and their ecosystem services because of infrastructure projects. They are in addition to those for compensatory afforestation. NPV payments are used for conservation efforts like mitigating wildlife loss and biodiversity projects, through the Compensatory Afforestation Fund. They are calculated depending on canopy density and quality of forests diverted. Sanjay Kumar, the director-general of forests, said the mines ministry had requested for annualisation of NPV payments, which basically means they would be paid in annual instalments. “We have said that we cannot do it. If they delay, they will have to pay a hefty sum as interest and if they do not, they will not have forest clearances. We understand that this is a critical time when everything was closed during the lockdown. But we cannot defer payment of NPV indefinitely. A call will be taken on the cut off time depending on circumstances.”The mines ministry has requested the environment ministry to annualize the upfront NPV payments because of the economic slowdown associated with the pandemic.Anil Kumar Jain, secretary, mines, declined to comment on why mining corporations are seeking the exemption.In a letter dated August 9 to the principal secretaries of states and Union territories, the environment ministry said it will give mining companies time till March 31, 2021, or up to two months after the Covid-19 pandemic ends, whichever is earlier to make the lump sum payments. The environment ministry has clarified the exemption will be made on condition that an interest of 12% per annum will be levied for delayed payments till then and thereafter.“The matter has been examined in the ministry and it is informed that annualization of NPV may not be feasible as it involves techno-economic analysis of various parameters used for NPV calculation,” said the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said from the time NPV was introduced into the forest clearance process in 2005, specific projects and sectors have been seeking exemptions. “But the larger question here is whether conditions like compensatory afforestation or NPV justify large scale forest diversions for mines, hydropower, highways, railways or ports.”Community Forest Rights-Learning and Advocacy member Tushar Dash said Covid-19 is being used as an excuse to extract all kinds of exemptions from the environment ministry, which it is happily doing. “I saw another guideline by the environment ministry, which has allowed states to continue to keep and utilise unspent compensatory afforestation funds till March 31. The money should be utilised for the welfare of forest dwellers and forests now,” said Dash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upfront-npv-payments-exempted/story-f2PKVluZJH8fg5ScpkTXAP.html
19-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the spread of the coronavirus disease around the world is driven by younger people, those in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, many of whom are not just asymptomatic but also unaware that they are infected. “The epidemic is changing,” Takeshi Kasai, the organisation’s regional director for the Western Pacific said in an online briefing, Reuters reported.WHO’s statement comes at a time when Covid-19 cases around the world appear to be plateauing, perhaps for the first time since April. That was the last time the seven-day average of new cases reported around the world stayed at the same level. It was a long plateau too – it was only in the third week of May that cases started perceptibly rising again, and they continued to till the last week of July. For the past fortnight, though, they have stayed pretty much at the same level (in the 250,000s). All the seven-day averages are from the New York Times database. HT’s Covid-19 data specialist Jamie Mullick wrote about this in an article titled “Coronavirus: Has the third curve flattening begun?” on August 12.Also read: Record 899k Covid-19 tests done on Monday, says health ministryKasai was also quoted as saying that WHO believes the Asia-Pacific has “entered a new phase of the pandemic”. That isn’t evident in the numbers yet.The fact that a large number of the infected are now young has been in evidence for some time. As HT reported in an article on August 11, the virus “disproportionately infects younger people, while it severely affects those who are older”. Based on data till July 31 (by which time India had registered 1.7 million cases), as many as 62% of those infected were below the age of 45 years. A break-up of the 26-44 years age group wasn’t available, but 40% of the people infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 belonged to it; 22% of those infected were younger than 25 years. There’s more according to the unreleased data from the ministry of health and family welfare that was accessed by HT: 26% of those infected were in the 45-60 age group, which means that it is mathematically possible, and quite probable, that 70% of all Covid-19 positive people in India are below the age of 50 years. Only 12% were over the age of 60.Also read: New immunity insights a boost against Covid-19This could explain the higher recovery rates not just in India, but elsewhere in the world too – progressive case fatality rates have declined with every passing month of the pandemic’s run. According to the health ministry data cited above, the proportions are completely inverted when it came to deaths: 50% of those who died from the disease in India were over the age of 60, and another 37% between the ages of 45 and 60 years. Only 13% were below the age of 44 years.Also read: Flu season will be a test run for the US’s biggest-ever vaccine campaignKasai’s comments and the data reflect contrasting behaviours of the old and the young. Early in the pandemic’s run, data established the vulnerability of older people, and many of them responded by opting for self-isolation and taking adequate precautions. They continued to do so even after the first wave of lockdowns. In contrast, young people ventured out soon after the restrictions on movements and activities were eased. This column has previously referred to the second wave in both Spain and France and highlighted how this was being driven largely by young people originally infected by what can only be described as summer fever – and who then went on to be infected by something that was more dangerous, if not to them, then to older members of their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-vkGAb70Bt8bD02MHiZtDAI.html

We are putting in place necessary legal provisions to this effect. MP’s resources are only for the state’s children,” the CM said, in a video clip released to the media.The Congress government led by Kamal Nath, whom Chouhan replaced in March 2020, had announced to reserve 70% of the jobs in the industrial units for locals but no guideline was issued in this regard.In a tweet, the CM said: “From today, the children of Madhya Pradesh will have the first right over the resources of Madhya Pradesh. All government jobs will be reserved only for the children of Madhya Pradesh. Our aim is to involve the local talents in the upliftment of the state”.However, legal experts differed from the views of the chief minister. Chairman of Madhya Pradesh Bar Council Shivendra Upadhyay said, “A complete ban for students of other states will be unconstitutional. The state government can give some concession to the students who are from Madhya Pradesh but debarring students of other states is not legally possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-jobs-to-be-reserved-for-state-residents-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story-BHRbJRv5urRGN1fAf9TqaI.html
19-08-2020||India||Visva Bharati seeks CBI probe into clashes||A day after vandalism forced its closure, Santiniketan’s Visva Bharati university on Tuesday sought a CBI probe into the incident, in which a mob demolished two gates of the university. It also requested the Centre to deploy central paramilitary forces for security at the campus. This comes hours after the university lodged a police complaint against a Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLA and eight others accusing them of participating in the violence.The university named Naresh Bauri, a resident of Bolpur and TMC MLA from the district’s Dubrajpur constituency in the complaint. Other than Bauri, three other TMC leaders were also named as accused, university teachers said. The university on Tuesday night issued a statement alleging that the police did not take any step to stop the vandalism although intimation was sent to the district magistrate, superintendent of police, the state chief secretary, home secretary and personal secretary to the chief minister. “The university will request a CBI inquiry to look into the August 17 incident,” said the statement, adding that the staff members will hold a 12-hour fast on Wednesday as a mark of protest. The university also decided not to open the campus till those accused of the violence are booked by the police, said a statement issued by the university on Monday evening.Amid all this, the vice-chancellor decided not to attend the meeting called by Birbhum district magistrate Moumita Godara Basu on Wednesday to discuss the issue with the university authorities, students, local traders and residents. On Monday, Bauri claimed that he took part in the agitation as a former student of Visva Bharati and not as TMC leader. However, he could not be contacted on Tuesday. The traders also lodged a police complaint against the vice-chancellor. In the statement, Visva Bharati said the allegations were false and they must be withdrawn to make the staff members feel safe. The BJP has accused the TMC of masterminding the vandalism. “This is an example of law and order situation in Bengal. The TMC is trying to establish control over a Central university campus,” said BJP state chief Dilip Ghosh. The VC did not talk to the media on Tuesday as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visva-bharati-seeks-cbi-probe-into-clashes/story-ZpMvhmbYN2BYg4ueBsAFDL.html

According to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, KK Singh was questioned on his son’s finances. Singh filed a complaint with the Bihar Police last month, accusing Rajput’s girlfriend and actor Rhea Chakraborty of abetting his alleged suicide. He also alleged that Chakraborty illegally transferred Rs15 crore from a bank account of Rajput, who was found dead at his Mumbai residence on June 14. Patna police registered an FIR on July 25 based on Singh’s complaint. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has also registered a case against Chakraborty and three of her family members in connection with Rajput’s death. Chakraborty has denied the charges levelled against her and her lawyers have maintained that she would cooperate in the ED probe. The officials cited above said the central agency has already quizzed Chakraborty, her brother Showik, father Indrajit Chakraborty, Rajput’s business managers, chartered accountants, house helps, his friend and flat mate Siddharth Pithani as part of its probe and recorded their statements under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). A few friends of Rajput, who were also his business partners, have also been summoned by the agency for questioning next week, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-quizzes-sushant-singh-rajput-s-father-on-finances/story-9L8vLGy0rNOvjWU5A7r4VN.html

19-08-2020||India||Curbs at rallies, booths likely in first Covid-19 polls||To hold the first set of elections in India in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic — particularly the Bihar assembly polls — the Election Commission of India (ECI) is finalising guidelines with restrictions on public presence at campaign rallies, in door-to-door political outreach, in polling booths, and inside counting halls, to ensure strict social distancing, four officials familiar with the decision-making process told HT. The contours of ECI’s new plan for elections in the “new normal” are being adopted even as political parties have offered varied suggestions to the constitutional body, from deferring polls altogether to holding them in one phase, from reverting to ballot papers to allowing physical (and not just virtual) rallies, and from increasing the limits on poll expenditure by candidates to exempting those expenses incurred while enhancing Covid-19 precautions. State election officials, too, have passed on their inputs to ECI. While elections have taken place in other countries since the pandemic, including in Sri Lanka recently, elections in India have only been confined to polls to the Rajya Sabha and legislative council seats, which involve a limited set of voters. Experts believe that the election paradigm adopted for Bihar will have significant implications for political contests, and have a medium-term impact since other state elections are due in the middle of 2020. ECI, which reviewed suggestions received from political parties on Friday for conducting elections to the 243-member Bihar assembly (its term ends in November) and subsequently held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss a wide-ranging organisational framework, is likely to issue the guidelines over the next three days. Elections to the Samastipur parliamentary constituency and 56 assembly constituencies (across eight states) elsewhere are also scheduled to be held from September, officials familiar with the matter said.“The guidelines will broadly centre around three primary subjects — polling stations, counting halls and public meetings,” said an ECI official who did not wish to be named. “For example, in the counting hall we used to have 14 tables, now we have slashed the number to seven.”Physical ralliesA key area of concern for political parties is rallies, which have traditionally served as a key political tool for mobilising voters and communicating messages by leaders. With the pandemic and the push towards digital campaigning, parties have expressed concern that the direct interface with voters, especially those who lack digital access, will get affected if physical rallies are not allowed.Also read| Covid-19 patients, elderly can vote in elections via postal ballot: All you need to knowThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is part of the ruling dispensation in Bihar, has asked the poll panel to allow physical meetings and rallies in rural and semi-urban areas since voters may not have access to mobile devices and the internet, people familiar with the matter said. In its submission to ECI, the party has said that all party workers, campaigners and leaders must have the Aarogya Setu app downloaded on their phones at all times, and adequate social distancing has to be maintained during roadshows and processions. In case, physical rallies are permitted, the party has suggested having enclosures with limited seating, separate exit and entry points, and use of sanitisers and thermal scanners at all points of entry and exit. Other parties such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and a BJP ally, the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP), too have said that till physical rallies are allowed, elections must not take place. Arguing that digital campaigning and virtual rallies allow the ruling party an upper hand because these cost more money, the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have also demanded public meetings. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage According to the first ECI official quoted above, public meetings may be allowed but strictly monitored. “If a ground has been designated for a public meeting, then the administration will have to ensure that only the number of people who can be admitted keeping social distancing in mind are permitted inside. Circles to mark the appropriate distance should be drawn. The number of riders that can accompany the leader will also be limited.” On the same issue, a second official said, “We are not saying that parties cannot have physical rallies. They will just have to follow all social distancing norms or the rally will be shut down.”Door-to-door campaignThe Congress has also sought permission for house-to-house campaigns, people aware of the details said. In its submission to ECI, the party said, “We are in favour of an election based on face-to-face campaign where the candidate and party workers can meet the voters.”A third EC official said that suggestions such as limiting door-to-door campaigning to a maximum of five people have also been made. “All those doing door-to-door campaigning must give their phone numbers so that if any one tests Covid-19 positive, effective contact tracing can be done,” he said, adding that special arrangements would also have to be made for those living in containment zones.The commission is also considering allowing online submission of nomination forms by candidates to make the process easier, said the first ECI official.Poll expensesAnother area of concern for parties is poll expenses. The BJP has suggested that the limit on expenditure should be increased for the candidates, or alternatively all expenditure which is borne on purchasing equipment to safeguard against Covid-19 be exempted from being charged to the candidates account. There have been other suggestions on how there should be new limits on social media expenditure of parties given the increased reliance on digital medium due to the pandemic. But, as of now, the poll body is not considering imposing additional financial limits on the amount spent by political parties on online campaigning, officials said. “Social media campaigning was always allowed, even before the pandemic. Expenditure limits that exist will apply,” the first official quoted above said. Political parties do not have a limit on the expenditure, but a candidate is allowed to spend a maximum of ₹28 lakh, including all election costs.The commission has already issued directions that the number of electors per polling booth will be limited to a maximum 1,000 compared with 1,600 earlier. A number of auxillary polling stations will be created to accommodate the voters. Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora on June 27 told HT that 36,000 polling stations will be created in Bihar. Other suggestionsThe Congress, the RJD and All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen have also demanded that the commission should revert to using the ballot paper so that voters are not susceptible to the infection while pressing the buttons on the electronic voting machines (EVMs). This demand, officials indicated, is unlikely to be met. The BJP has also sought changes to the model code of conduct to bring into its ambit new methods of campaigning in an election. “The commission should issue a direction that no person in jail custody either due to conviction for commission of any offence or being an under trial prisoners be permitted to participate in the poll campaign in virtual mode,” the party said in a submission to ECI. This is widely seen as a move to ensure that RJD leader Lalu Prasad, currently serving a sentence after being convicted, cannot campaign virtually. There is also an emerging view that bypolls in some states should be postponed even further. HT, on August 14, had reported that the chief secretaries of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat, and the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Kerala, had written to the commission, citing rising Covid-19 cases and heavy rains, to consider deferring the by-polls.“In case of a state like Kerala, where assembly elections are due in April next year, it has been suggested that it does not make sense to hold bypolls,” said a fourth ECI official. The EC on June 17 had decided not to notify the law ministry’s amendment to the Representation of People Act, 1951, that would have allowed those over the age of 65 to use postal ballots. Five key opposition parties, however, had then written to CEC Arora to reconsider the move.Former CEC SY Quraishi said the framework of the ECI seems very ‘sensible’. “These are all good suggestions considering the Covid-19 pandemic,” Quraishi told Hindustan Times. “The EC has been assessing the situation on the ground and has been consistently monitoring how elections have been conducted in other countries as well.”Quraishi added that while deferring by polls is easy, postponement of the Bihar elections would lead to a constitutional crisis. “One or two by polls deferred doesn’t make much of a difference to the functioning of the assembly. However, if assembly elections are deferred, President’s rule will have to be imposed. That can only be done under two circumstances which constitute an emergency — external aggression and internal rebellion.” Quraishi also said that the EC should consider capping expenditure by political parties on campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-at-rallies-booths-likely-in-first-covid-polls/story-N4Vk2KuqqDqKgpClnS87ZN.html

19-08-2020||India||Bengaluru violence: Amid slugfest, 2 Congress corporators summoned||Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued to exchange barbs over riots that took place in the city last week, even as the police continued their investigation. Three people had died in riots that happened in DJ Halli and KG Halli police station limits on August 11 and August 12, following a social media post by the nephew of a Congress legislator.Leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramiah in a series of tweets slammed the government and the ruling party saying that while Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political arm of the Kerala-based radical Muslim outfit Popular Front of India (PFI), Congress, and others were being accused by BJP leaders, it was an effort to mislead and change the course of direction of the investigation. “Their aim seems to somehow make this look like a communal incident and take political advantage even as efforts are on to blame Congress for the same,” the former CM tweeted.Demanding that any investigation must start from failure of intelligence in the police department, he questioned why there was inordinate delay in registering a case against the key accused Naveen by the police. Siddaramiah said that if SDPI or its leaders had done any wrong they should be punished, he said that BJP was using SDPI as a pawn for political reasons and to divide Muslim votes.Responding to Siddaramiah’s barb, large and medium scale industries minister Jagadish Shettar said, “We have to make adequate preparations before taking a decision. All angles are being checked including involvement of SDPI in it.”Deputy CM Lakshman Savadi speaking to reporters in Belgavi said that Congress workers were involved in the Bengaluru violence. “There has been a demand for a ban on SDPI and PFI. We will take a suitable decision after examining all evidence,” Savadi too asserted.The team investigating the riots summoned two Congress corporators Sampat Raj and Abdul Zakir on Tuesday to enquire into their role. Raj , personal assisstant, who is also a former Mayor of the city was detained for further questioning. The probe team has till now detained about 370 people for the riots and nearly 65 FIR’s have been filed in the DJ Halli and KG Halli police stations.The state government on Monday had decided to approach the Karnataka High Court to appoint a claims commissioner to recover the cost of damages from the rioters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b-luru-violence-amid-slugfest-2-congress-corporators-summoned/story-Z02J1xMcuHUUKBqWLbBm6N.html
19-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Supreme Court verdict today on Rhea Chakraborty’s transfer plea||The Supreme Court will pronounce on Wednesday its verdict on a plea by actress Rhea Chakraborty who seeks the transfer of a first information report (FIR) lodged against her by the father of her former boyfriend and late actor Sushant Singh Rajput from Patna to Mumbai. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the investigation of this case from Bihar Police on August 5 and is now pursuing the charge of abetment of the late actor’s suicide against Rhea and her family members. Sushant’s father KK Singh in his complaint mentioned about Rs 15 crore transaction from his son’s accounts and suspected Rhea of blackmailing his son and seizing control of his bank documents and credit cards. A single judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy will deliver the verdict at 11 am. The judgment was reserved on August 11 after the Court heard the lawyers appearing for Rhea, Sushant’s father, Bihar government, Maharashtra government and CBI. The keenly awaited verdict will decide whether the FIR being investigated by CBI against Rhea, her parents, brother, and two associates can continue or the same should be transferred to Mumbai Police. Rhea stated in her petition that Bihar Police could not have registered the FIR on July 25 against her and her family as the incident (of Sushant’s death) took place in Mumbai. The 34-year old actor’s body was found lying in his Bandra flat on June 14.Also read: Mumbai police receive forensic audit report of Sushant Singh Rajput’s bank accounts The Bihar Police and KK Singh’s lawyer claimed that the late actor, being unmarried, his father will stand to acquire his finances being the legal heir and hence the consequences of his death will affect his father, whose place of residence is Patna. This will give Bihar Police the jurisdiction to lodge and investigate the offence. The CBI maintained that the only FIR in relation to late actor’s death is the one being probed by it as the Mumbai Police is only inquiring into the cause of his death based on an accidental death report. For its part, the Mumbai Police has submitted its entire investigation records to the Court in a sealed cover. The state even alleged politics behind the lodging of FIR at Patna claiming that a news report suggested chief minister Nitish Kumar to have pressurized the police to register the case. Also read: Rhea Chakraborty’s financial transactions clear, nothing incriminating, says her lawyerAmid the legal tangle involved in this case, heightened media attention and sensationalizing of the case has been another ground for Rhea to demand transfer of the case to Mumbai. In her last submission to the Court, Rhea said that the Court could use its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to order a CBI probe but allowing the same based on transfer of the case from Patna to Mumbai will be “without jurisdiction and contrary to law”. Incidentally, soon after Sushant’s death, Rhea tweeted demanding CBI probe and tagged Union Home Minister Amit Shah on her tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-today-on-rhea-s-transfer-plea/story-tRBQGtnTN4MPoePKMNiD4L.html
19-08-2020||India||A rush to save remains of an Egyptian woman from rainwater in Jaipur||: As heavy rain washed away low-lying shanties and submerged cars in Jaipur last Friday, the staff at the historic Albert Hall museum was busy in a different rescue operation. As water started filling the museum, housekeeping officials and guards hopped the stairs to the museum’s basement to get to a 2,400-year-old Egyptian mummy encased in a glass chamber.Standing in waist-deep water and using the lights from mobile phones and torches, the staff broke the glass and carried the mummy to a drier area of the museum. “The ancient mummy is our most delicate antique and since a display in 2016, it has been extremely popular with local and international visitors,” said Rakesh Cholak, the museum superintendent.“With timely intervention, we saved it from the slush and water that badly affected almost 17,000 artefacts in our store and display areas,” he said.Jaipur received 132mm of rainfall on Friday. The rainwater, which inundated streets, entered the museum’s windows and corridors starting from its Moti Dungari Road side, and submerged several historical items such as Japanese pottery, ancient statues, Buddhist paintings, photographs, brassware, arms and armour, and wooden art, among others.According to officials of Albert Hall museum, the mummy , Tutu, a female member of a priest’s family, dates back to Egypt’s Ptolemaic era (322 BC to 30 BC). It was found in the Akhmin area of the ancient city of Panopolis in Egypt more than 300 years ago. This mummy, one of only six in India, was gifted by the Museum of Cairo for an exhibition in Jaipur organised by then king of Jaipur state Sawai Ishwar Singh in 1887. In 2011, three experts from Egyptian Ministry of Culture came to conserve the mummy and concluded that the mummy’s skeleton was in very good condition after conducting sterilisation all the items to wipe out microbes.“The mummy is invaluable,” said Cholak. While the mummy was saved, the rainwater left its mark on the coffin, and accompanying paraphernalia of about 200 items, such as Pharaonic idols and lockets, the superintendent said.Besides artefacts, thousands of documents and files were drenched, and have been strewn around the floors of the museum for drying, officials said. “We have put up huge fans and halogen lights and kept the documents out for drying,” said Cholak, adding that the exact assessment of the damage and restoration may take months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-rush-to-save-remains-of-an-egyptian-woman-from-rainwater-in-jaipur/story-xYCI9gldt0hRYiasw0bVTM.html
19-08-2020||India||NCAP programme: Covid-19 pandemic disrupts clean air action plans||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Independence Day that a clean air programme will be implemented on mission mode in 100 cities soon.But the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) has advanced little since last year, when it was launched.City level action plans of around 102 cities had been approved by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to meet the NCAP target of 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) concentrations over 2017 annual concentration.This year, CPCB has been directing state governments in writing about implementing the action plans immediately. For example, CPCB issued a direction to West Bengal government on June 26 under section 31A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 (power to issue directions to any authority) to implement the city action plan and submit a financial layout of each action within 30 days and a progress report on a quarterly basis to CPCB.With the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdown and financial slowdown, NCAP is staring at an uphill task of ensuring that various sectors like industry, thermal power plants and transportation manage to reduce emissions by switching to cleaner processes and fuels.“We have already directed the state governments to implement the action plans. Timelines have been given to them and we have sought regular review. The 2024 deadline to achieve the NCAP target remains,” said Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB.Clean air efforts in million-plus cities got a shot in the arm with an allocation of Rs 4,400 crore for 2020-21 (union budget), up from Rs 460 crore for air pollution abatement last year.Apart from giving a financial boost to large cities implementing the national clean air programme, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said state utilities will be advised to close down old thermal power plants that do not meet the emission standards.“The pollution levels in Delhi in the past 2 to 3 years have been coming down. Clean air is very high up on our agenda it also does not mean that clean air can be achieved by stifling development. A part of it has already been rolled out and the rest of it will be rolled out soon. There is a huge commitment in terms of funds to achieve targets,” said RP Gupta, secretary, ministry of environment.Experts said ministry should have clear indicators of whether they are on track to achieve NCAP targets otherwise we could be left with dirtier air as industries look to bounce back from the economic impacts of covid 19.Some of the important measures that are to be taken by the Centre under NCAP include setting up a web-based system for monitoring of compliance with NCAP targets; a comprehensive regional plan to be formulated by incorporating inputs from regional source apportionment studies, such as a regional plan for the Indo-Gangetic plain region; compliance by all thermal power plants with to the emission norms by December 2022 and as per the action plan prescribed in the direction of December 2017, issued under the EPA, 1986; switch over to gaseous fuels in industries, including small and medium enterprises by December 2022; enforcement of new and stringent sulphur dioxide (SO2)/ oxides of nitrogen (NOx) / PM2.5 standards for industries using solid fuels by 2020; strict enforcement of standards in all industries; mandatory waste segregation at source and state level air pollution action plan, among others.“The NCAP targets have to be met by 2024. It has to be taken very seriously. Covid-19 has in fact helped in achieving the target. The 15th Finance Commission has announced Rs 4,400 crores which is mainly meant for state pollution control boards and urban local bodies. We need performance-based indicators for multiple sectors like transport, industry etc. For example, the industry sector will need strategies to scale up clean energy transition and high-level emission control systems. We need a policy for that. I don’t think it can be addressed only through city action plans,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.“Most sectors will deal with economic reconstruction now. So there should be alignment of sectoral budget with the NCAP goals. The government will also need a compliance and deterrence policy to ensure targets are met otherwise we will face a larger pollution problem in future,” added RoyChowdhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncap-programme-pandemic-disrupts-clean-air-action-plans/story-B4UBMEPHELBMBXIMFaae0M.html

The navy has been on an operational alert in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) where scores of warships are ready in the aftermath of the border row that triggered a brutal brawl in the Galvan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese dead on June 15.The navy has stepped up surveillance and activities in the IOR, which, it believes, China will inevitably try to enter in its quest to become a global power, just as it has laid claim to large portions of the disputed South China Sea, as reported by Hindustan Times on July 29. The commanders’ conference, to be chaired by navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, assumes greater significance against the backdrop of recent events along India’s northern borders as well as the unprecedented challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, a navy spokesperson said. “It would provide the higher naval leadership a forum to discuss conduct of operations, sustenance and maintenance of assets, procurement, infrastructure development and human resource management issues within the ambit of the new normal established by the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. Defence minister Rajnath Singh will address the navy brass on the opening day of the conference. “A commanders’ conference is important at any time, but this one might especially look at various matters that the navy’s commanders would carefully consider in the backdrop of China’s growing belligerent attitude,” said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd). The commanders will also discuss ways to optimise joint planning, tri-service synergy, operational readiness and functional reorganisation within the navy to enhance efficiency, the spokesperson said. The deliberations will also cover larger security imperatives in the Indo-Pacific region, he said. The navy has positioned warships along critical sea lanes of communications and choke points in the IOR under its mission-based deployment model and the vessels can be diverted for any mission. Indian warships have been deployed from as far as the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait and northern Bay of Bengal to the southeast coast of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-navy-officials-set-for-3-day-conference/story-vzWE9hejYeqjy1g6R72a8O.html

It’s a leap over previous years. But the Jal Jeevan mission to provide every rural household with water supply, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in his 2019 Independence speech, needs to expand at a quicker rate to meet its 2024 deadline, an HT analysis based on government data shows.Over 120 million households lack access to clean water near their homes, the highest in the world, according to UN-Water.Contaminated water causes diseases such as diarrhoea, the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, according to researchers Subitha Lakshminarayanan and Ramakrishnan Jayalakshmy of Puduchery’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Indira Gandhi Medical College.India has 189 million rural households, according to the official data. Till August 16, cumulatively over a four-year period, 51 million households, or 27% of the total, were provided with tap water connection under the joint Centre-state Jal Jeevan mission, data analysed by HT shows.This also means authorities must provide water connection to another 138 million households, or 73% remaining, by 2024. Piped drinking water to rural households is one of the critical components for achieving universal access to safe drinking water in the country.In 2018, just 18.2% of rural households had piped water supply. By 2019, this translated to an improvement of 9 percentage points. But the federally set deadline of 2024 – by which all households must be connected – means the current rate of expansion will need to go up to meet the completion date.The Gajendra Shekhawat-led Jal Shakti ministry oversees the implementation of the rural household water mission. According to him, his ministry and states utilised the Covid-19 lockdown period to hold video-conferences to prepare for state plans for this year and year ahead. “Lockdown was an opportunity,” Shekhawat said.A 2018 Comptroller and Auditor General performance audit said the programme was meant to provide at least 35% of rural households with piped water supply by 2017, and 80% households by 2020.Water is a state subject but the Union government provides a major share of funding. The Jal Jeevan rural households programme is worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Of this, the Centre’s share is about Rs 2.2 lakh crore.The Union budget had allotted Rs 10001 crore in 2019-20 for the national rural drinking water mission. In 2020-21, Rs 11500 crore was provided.The Jal Jeevan mission in its earlier avatar was the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) under the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance-II (UPA-II) government.“There has been a huge gap between the government’s stated objectives and actual delivery in the rural drinking water scheme,” said Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.Till 2018-19, expenditure as a proportion of funds available under the rural drinking water programme had been steadily decreasing, according to Accountability Initiative, a think-tank tracking government policies.In FY 2014-15, 84% of available funds were spent. This fell to 72% in FY 2017-18. In FY 2018-19, only 65% of the total funds available for NRDWM were spent. In 2014-15, 0.6% of total government funding was allocated to the rural piped drinking water project, which dropped to 0.2% in 2018-19. Funding got an 80% boost in the next year when the National Democratic Alliance government took it up as a mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20mn-rural-houses-got-tap-water-in-2019-total-at-51mn/story-7lSTBoOwq4WcCCwOGTWjtL.html
19-08-2020||India||BJP lashes out at Congress over social media hate speech row||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravi Shankar Prasad on Tuesday launched an attack on the Congress over a row involving hate speech on the social media website, even as the opposition party wrote to the firm’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to say the company may be “a willing participant in thwarting the rights and values”.The BJP said that people whose political base has “shrunk like anything” seek to dominate discourse on these platforms and asserted that everybody regardless of their ideology got the right to air their views on the website. Prasad said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi believed that any organisation that did not work to his liking was acting under the pressure of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).A political slugfest between the Congress and the BJP began after a report in The Wall Street Journal claimed that Facebook ignored its hate speech rules when it came to posts by politicians of the ruling party.The Congress on Tuesday wrote to Zuckerberg, saying the social media company may be “a willing participant in thwarting the rights and values” India’s founding leaders had sacrificed their lives for, and called for an investigation of the report that claimed its Indian staff was soft in handling hate speech by BJP politicians.BJP leaders launched an angry riposte, saying the Congress and its leadership had been reduced to irrelevance and the demand showed a desire to muzzle free speech.The WSJ report cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders and claimed the company’s senior India policy executive Ankhi Das intervened in internal content review processes to stop a ban on BJP’s Telangana lawmaker Raja Singh, whose posts targeted the Muslim community. It said Das told staff members that punishing violations by BJP politicians would damage the company’s business prospects in India.Sharing the letter written by the Congress to the Facebook founder on Twitter, former party president Rahul Gandhi said: “We cannot allow any manipulation of our hard-earned democracy through bias, fake news and hate speech. As exposed by WSJ, Facebook’s involvement in peddling fake and hate news needs to be questioned by all Indians.”The Congress has been up in arms against the government and Facebook over the WSJ report. KC Venugopal, the Congress general secretary (organisation), kept up the party’s attack in the letter to Zuckerberg, in which he wrote that the social company provided the BJP with “favourable treatment on election-related issues”. He called it a “damning and serious allegation” that Facebook was interfering in India’s electoral democracy.The Congress asked Zuckerberg to start a high-level inquiry on the Facebook India leadership team and their operations. It suggested the appointment of a new team to lead the India operations until the inquiry is completed.HT reached out to Facebook for a comment, but it had no immediate response.The BJP hit out at the Congress over its demand for a Facebook inquiry.Union information technology minister and senior BJP leader Prasad said people whose political base had “shrunk like anything” seek to dominate discourse on social media platforms, and asserted that everyone, regardless of his or her ideology, has the right to air their views.“If the platform is public, then every Indian regardless of his ideology and commitment has got the right to convey his view. It is a hard fact we need to know that people whose political base has shrunk seek to dominate discourse on these platforms,” Prasad said.Amit Malviya, the BJP’s national IT in-charge, said: “Congress party, faced with electoral irrelevance, and rejection at the hustings, wants to pin blame on everyone else except its uninspiring and unworthy leadership.”“Facebook is just another addition to their ‘save the Gandhis’ campaign. The Left-Congress ecosystem wants unfettered control over freedom of speech and hence, in a last roll of the dice, are now trying to muzzle platforms which have empowered ordinary citizens and made their opinions valuable. A vibrant, participative democracy is inimical to their political agenda.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-lashes-out-at-cong-over-social-media-hate-speech-row/story-nj88qZvX5M7qOJGhbK7kPI.html

Improvements in the cardio-metabolic parameters, however, waned once integrated care was stopped after a year, which suggests the need for continued support for blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, said the study, which was published on Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The Integrating Depression and Diabetes Treatment (Independent) study compared integrated care with standard care in 404 diabetes patients in Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, and Visakhapatnam with moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms over a two-year period and found major improvements in the group receiving the integrated approach. The improvements were most pronounced in patients with the worst parameters at the start of the study.Also read| Covid-19 may be the cause behind rise in childhood type 1 diabetes: StudyAround one in five people (19.7%) with diabetes have depression in India, compared to 15.1% people in the general population. “There is a bidirectional relationship between depression and diabetes, as chronic diseases like diabetes can lead to depression, and vice versa. Depression can cause stress-induced diabetes and also impact a person’s ability to manage self-care, leading to complications,” said principal investigator of the project from India, Dr Viswanathan Mohan, chairman, Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Specialties Centre and director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. Since there are not enough psychiatrists in India to treat everyone with depression symptoms, which range from feeling low, tiredness and in suicidal ideation, the study used care coordinators to screen people with diabetes for signs of depression. Also read: Covid-19 fears forcing many to give vital treatments a miss“Diabetes educators, dietitians, health workers or any graduate can be trained as non-physician care coordinators to screen for depression, and provide counselling for mild cases and refer people with suicidal ideation to psychiatrists for remote management. With the help of decision-support software, care coordinators helped lower symptoms of depression and several metabolic parameters, such as blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol profiles of patients and lowered risk of complications such as heart disease, eye disease (retinopathy), kidney failure and amputations,” said Dr Mohan.The low-cost model is accessible and scalable and can be applied in underresourced settings everywhere in the world, he said. “The CARRS (Center for Cardio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia) study on diabetes management showed in 2018 that low-cost software used by a non-physician care coordinators can optimise treatment and lower complications in diabetes improving blood glucose-control and lower blood pressure and ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol at no added cost. We added depression to the mix and found it improved outcomes under supervision,” said co-investigator Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor of endocrinology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. In India, close to 70 million people have diabetes and another 40 million are insulin-resistant, which is a precursor to diabetes. More than four in five diabetics on medication in India do not have their blood glucose under control, according to Dr Mohan’s DiabCare India study 2011. Neuropathy was the most common complication (41.4%); other complications were: Foot (32.7%), eye (19.7%), cardiovascular (6.8%) ,and nephropathy (6.2%), with the number of diabetic complications increasing with mean duration of disease. “Too often, mental health is overlooked due to fragmented care, stigma of psychiatric illnesses, and shortages of mental health professions,” said first author Dr Mohammed Ali, associate professor of Global Health and Epidemiology at Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treating-diabetes-integrated-care-helps-improve-patients-mental-health-finds-study/story-rzRJXkeBCopRG4JxJbhFrM.html
19-08-2020||India||BJP, Congress lock horns over Supreme Court judgment on PM Cares||Bolstered by a Supreme Court decision that money collected by the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM Cares) fund need not be transferred to the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday launched a fresh broadside against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of trying to weaken the fight against Covid-19.A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan held on Tuesday that the establishment of the PM Cares Fund in March had been necessitated by Covid-19 and the requirement of financial resources to deal with the pandemic, and that the court cannot object to it.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, said the PM Cares Fund was a registered public fund headed by the prime minister and it has been created to tackle Covid-like emergencies. Attacking the Congress, Prasad alluded to allegations that when Manmohan Singh was prime minister, money was given to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, which is a family foundation. “The foundation has also got support from China. The RGF even recommended that Indian markets be opened for Chinese products,” he added.“We have completed six years today and are in the seventh year. We work honestly and no one has been able to cast any aspersion that is backed by facts. Some people merely keep saying things, that is another matter. The Modi government works honestly and this reflects in the PM Cares Fund,” said Prasad.He alleged that Rahul Gandhi had tried to weaken the country’s unity in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. When the nation saluted those at the front-lines of the fight against the coronavirus disease, Gandhi mocked them, Prasaid claimed. When the lockdown was imposed, he questioned it.“I regret to say in view of the conduct of Rahul Gandhi right from day one he never spared any opportunity to weaken the national resolve in the fight against corona,” Prasad said.He said the PM Cares Fund was a transparent fund, out of which Rs 2,000 crore had been sanctioned for procuring ventilators alone. As many as 50,000 ventilators were provided to take care of the emergency needs of patients, the highest since Independence. Around Rs 1,000 crore was given to states for the welfare of migrant workers and Rs 100 crore for vaccine development, the minister said.Responding to a question, Prasad said there would be an audit of the PM Cares Fund. Every detail is on the website and the country will be informed of each detail, he said.BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda also hailed the Supreme Court verdict.“The verdict by Supreme Court on PM Cares is a resounding blow to the nefarious designs of Rahul Gandhi & his band of ‘rent a cause’ activists. It shows that the truth shines despite the ill intent and malicious efforts of the Congress party and its associates,” Nadda said on Twitter.He wrote in another tweet: “Rahul Gandhi’s rants have been repeatedly dismissed by the common man who has overwhelmingly contributed to PM Cares. With the highest court also pronouncing its verdict, will Rahul & his ‘rent a cause’ activist army mend their ways or embarrass themselves further?” The Congress expressed disappointment over the verdict. Its chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the Supreme Court let go an opportunity to bring transparency to the fund. “The judgment is a body blow to transparency and accountability of government to people. It marks a sad letter day for responsibility and answerability of rulers to the electorate and remind them that they are not ‘Monarchs’ but ‘servants of the people’,” he tweeted. “SC scrupulously believed that ‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’. Today, the court, in a departure from that tradition, passed up an opportunity to demand answers on the PM Cares Fund that seeks public money but plays by its own opaque & murky rules,” Surjewala wrote in another tweet. At a virtual press conference, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the ruling was a jolt to all the people who were seeking transparency. “This is not Narendra Modi’s money. This is not Narendra Modi’s individual fund; this is the Prime Minister’s fund, meant for the people, who demand transparency. The people want to know -- where did you get the money from, where have you spent it?” he said. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Monday tweeted “PM CARES for Right To Improbity,” tagging a news report which alleged that the Prime Minister’s Office had denied an RTI application seeking information on the fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cong-lock-horns-over-sc-judgment-on-pm-cares/story-vjW4r0ivmkVgCS5du52ohM.html

India has conducted 3,09,41,264 Covid-19 tests till date since the first swab sample was tested on January 23. There has been a three-fold increase in Covid-19 tests conducted since a month ago, when 10 million samples had been tested. “A new peak of 8.99 lakh Covid-19 tests was done in the last 24 hours. Even with such a high level of testing, the positivity has remained low at 8.81% compared to the weekly national average of 8.84%,” said a statement by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW). Also read: New immunity insights a boost against Covid-19Aggressive testing leads to early identification and isolation of Covid-19 positive cases. The case fatality rate (CFR) is brought down through aggressive testing and efficient clinical treatment.A continuous increase in average daily recoveries has led to India’s recovery rate -- the patients who have a recovered as a proportion of those who tested positive -- touching 73.18%, and a case fatality rate of 1.92%, shows health ministry data. About 30 states have CFR, deaths from the disease as a proportion of the case tally, below the national average.“The current CFR, both in terms of daily or weekly average, has reduced to under 2%, but our aim is to bring down country’s CFR to 1% or below. If you look at last five days figures then the number of new cases as well deaths have seen a decline even though for a pandemic situation in a country as large as India past five days decline is not really that big a deal. However, it’s an encouraging trend,” said Union health secretary.Rajesh Bhushan. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage From 64,000 new cases reported on August 13, the number dropped to 55,000 on Monday; and as opposed to 1,007 deaths reported on August 13, the country recorded 876 deaths on Monday.The number of laboratories approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for diagnosing Covid-19 has also seen a steady increase, experts said.From a single laboratory, ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, on January 23, to 160 labs on March 23, India has consistently expanded its lab network. At present, the country has 1,476 approved laboratories, including 971 and 505 government and private facilities, respectively.“Each day laboratories are being added to the network of Covid-19 testing facilities from across India. Now, we are doing up to 800,000 Covid-19 tests in a day and it is a significant achievement in such a short span of time. Besides laboratories in ICMR’s network, Covid-19 tests are being done in other government and privately-run facilities that are showing good results,” said an ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified.Also read: Flu season will be a test run for the US’s biggest-ever vaccine campaignThe key focus areas that will help further consolidate the gains in terms of curtailing a surge in Covid-19 cases are preventive measures such as wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, adhering to hand hygiene and cough etiquette; strengthening the containment and surveillance strategy in terms of testing and contact tracing, and clinical management that would require timely access to ambulance services for transporting severely sick patients and increasing the number of hospital beds.“We have got reassuring trends in terms of recovery and mortality rate and testing numbers, and it seems like we have got hold over pandemic control but the need is to not get lax and make an effort towards consolidating gains,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog. “There is still a large number of susceptible population in the country; therefore, the challenge to fight the disease effectively is still very much there,” he added. On post Covid-19 recovery complications, Paul said it wasn’t an alarming situation, and the medical fraternity was monitoring it closely.“It is a new virus and post Covid-19 complications such as respiratory distress, fibrosis and immunological symptoms in children, is a new dimension of the disease that is being seen. We are studying it; and it is an ongoing learning process. However, there’s no need to be dangerously alarmed at this stage,” Paul added.Many states such as West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha are making use of Covid-19 survivors as volunteers.“These volunteers are being used for generating community awareness about the disease; promote help-seeking behaviour so that treatment is sought in time and supply food and other essentials among patients in hospitals, and also help healthcare workers on ground,” said Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-899k-tests-done-on-monday-health-ministry/story-9UNfc7H6PbSSUDbM5m1ilK.html
19-08-2020||India||Results of Covid-19 vaccines’ trial to take a few weeks, says VK Paul||India will have to wait a few weeks for the initial results of Phase I/II human trials being conducted on two indigenous vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as the stage is set for more advanced trials on a third option, VK Paul, who chairs one of the national task forces on Covid-19 management,said on Tuesday.The two candidates that are in phase I/II human trials are drug maker Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Bharat Biotech received the central drugs controller’s approval to conduct human trials on June 29, and Zydus Cadila on July 2.“It will take a few weeks for the results of the 2 indigenous anti-Covid-19 vaccines that are currently in phase I/II human trials in India,” Paul, who is member (health) at Niti Aayog, the government’s policy think tank, said at a Covid-19 related health briefing on Tuesday.Also read: New immunity insights a boost against Covid-19“The antibody titer needs to be evaluated, and other reactions that are seen in this phase, which we will get to know in a couple of weeks. After that regulatory pathways will be decided and accordingly clearances sought from the regulatory body,” Paul said.Antibody titer is a test that measures the amount of antibodies within a person’s blood to assess the strength of the body’s immune response to a disease.The government is closely tracking the progress of the candidates being tested by Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila amid a global race against time to find a vaccine for the coronavirus disease, which has claimed in excess if 778,000 lives worldwide since it broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Also read: Flu season will be a test run for the US’s biggest-ever vaccine campaignPaul also said Serum Institute of India will begin the phase 3 human trials in a day or two in India on the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca. Pune-based Serum Institute has struck a production and clinical trials deal with AstraZeneca for the AZD1222 vaccine, which has until now been tested in the most number of people -- 1,077 -- among the close to 200 vaccine options being tested across the world.“Results for the one in Phase 3 trial will take longer as Phase 3 trial usually takes longer. It’s not appropriate to comment on a specific time line but it will be a few weeks longer than the phase I/II trials. Phase I/II could take 3-4 or even six weeks to show results. So just hold on, it will take time… it is about waiting and watching as it is a scientific process that takes its own time. Only after one stage is reached and crossed that we can talk about the next stage. As of today as things stand, we are on right track and let’s wait for those milestones to be met,” Paul added.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Paul said that once the indigenous vaccines or for that matter any other vaccine reaches the stage of availability, the government will be ready with a procurement and distribution plan.“The plan will be based on how to make the vaccine accessible in terms of supply chain based on the vaccine’s characteristic -- whether it would require a single dose or multiple doses or would need cold chain to be maintained for storage among other things,” he said.The national expert group on Covid-19 vaccine met prominent domestic vaccine producers on Monday to help chalk out a plan. As reported by HT on Tuesday, the expert group asked the manufacturers to come up with a roadmap in the next three days on production capacity, pricing, and the kind of support they expect from the government.“We have requested them to provide more clear-cut data; information on their individual capacities and how these capacities will pan out with time. How they can ramp up these capacities from where they are today to where they could be. This is a dialogue in motion, and we will have updates from them in this process of dialogue. We can assure you India has huge capacity; in fact, we were pleasantly surprised to find out how much capacity we have within the country,” Paul said.Pricing of the vaccine will be a key factor. “We did request them to indicate what possible prices could be. Pricing perhaps being very complex because some of these vaccines are at an early stage; some insights into where the price range would be, but this information will be refined as we would move along. There is no firm information that we can share today but yes we are asking what kind of a price range we are looking at for the vaccine from individual vaccine manufacturers.”“A word of caution: please don’t assume any vaccines that is going for trial will be successful. We want it to succeed; we want these three and many others to succeed but it keep in mind that it is not always 100% success as we develop any vaccines. Keep your fingers crossed,” he said.Experts also say that a vaccine will be instrumental in preventing the spread of infection in the long run.“A vaccine will be needed to check the disease spread but we don’t know when an effective vaccine be available for use even though all our efforts are being directed towards making it happen as soon as possible. A good vaccine is the most cost-effective way of preventing a disease,” said Dr Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, KGMU (King George’s Medical University), Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh).Total Covid-19 deaths: 778,506Participants for Oxford vaccine Phase I/II trials: 1077________________________________________||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/results-of-vaccines-trial-to-take-a-few-weeks-paul/story-JSXGeKHtLhtkbIYlSRD6HK.html
19-08-2020||India||New immunity insights a boost against Covid-19||Does getting Covid-19 once give the patient immunity to the disease? If so, how long does it last? Is the immunity robust enough to fend off the pathogen even in a highly contagious space? And, does the level of protection vary depending on how strong or mild the infection was?At least four studies over the past few weeks have offered deeper insights into these crucial questions about how the body’s immune system responds to the Sars-Cov2 once it has been infected by and cleansed of it.The studies, to answer the questions above in order, indicate that -- yes, a person once infected may be immune to reinfection; this protection may last for at least 3-6 months; the immune system is likely remember the virus to offer protection in a highly infectious situation; and the level of protection may be strong even if the infection was mild.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThese answers are crucial because they will determine if vaccines will work to bring about a collective immunity that will stay long enough to return the world to the pre-pandemic period. Research suggests the pathogen behaves in a manner similar to other viruses, allowing the human body to identify it, fight it, and remember it, irrespective of the nature and intensity of the illness.The first indication of this was in a study published on July 24 by researchers from Wuhan, who followed the first of 349 people to be infected and develop symptoms in the central Chinese city where the virus was discovered. “Our data indicates sustained humoral immunity in recovered patients who suffer from symptomatic Covid-19, suggesting prolonged immunity... titers (antibody levels) stabilised at relatively high levels over the six months observation period,” said the researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan. Also read: Flu season will be a test run for the US’s biggest-ever vaccine campaignThe second was submitted to the journal Cell on August 11 by researchers from Sweden, Denmark and the UK, who – in an analysis of samples from people in European hot spot areas – showed that people “exhibited robust memory T-cell responses months after infection, even in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies specific for Sars-CoV-2”. This, they added, indicated “a previously unanticipated degree of population-level immunity against Covid-19”.The third came on August 14, in a study by University of Washington and Seattle’s Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center. It found that having antibodies (they had likely recovered from a previous disease) protected three crewmembers while the virus infected 104 of 122 people on a fishing vessel over an 18-day voyage. “This suggests that neutralising antibodies are a correlate of protection for Sars-CoV-2,” Alexander Greninger, the assistant director of UW Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratory told HT on Sunday.The latest was reported on August 15, offering a second confirmation: people with mild symptoms had memory cells that could recognise the virus later. “We found that recovered individuals developed Sars-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralising plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B- and T-cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months...” said researchers from University of Washington’s department of immunology. Also read: Health department to use 3500 kits for testing industrial workersIn this study, the researchers tested 15 people who had Covid-19, once between the first 20 days since they had the disease and for a second time around 86 days later, when the researchers found stable levels of B and T memory cells. T- and B-cells and antibodies are among the two main features of the complex immune system. While antibodies bind to viruses and neutralise them, T-cells and B-cells are responsible for producing antibodies, creating “helper” cells, and turning into killer proteins that gobble up any cell that is infected. Once an infection is beaten, 90% of T-cells and B-cells die off, while the remaining linger on as memory cells that can quickly multiply into antibodies, helper cells and killer cells.While they are yet to be peer-reviewed, the first, second and fourth papers establish that the immune defences behave like they should with the Sars-Cov-2, while the second offers the closest sign yet that these may be enough to prevent a subsequent infection. UW professor Greninger, however, added that more studies with bigger groups may be needed to conclusively determine that antibodies can prevent reinfection. Experts said that in addition to these studies, circumstantial evidence from China, where the outbreak first began around 9 months ago, too points to long-lasting immunity.“Immunity must be quite long because China is not reporting reinfection cases. They admitted the problem in December but there are signs that it may have started in August. So the people who got infected in this time do not appear to be getting it for a second time,” said T Jacob John, the former head of virology department at Christian Medical College, Vellore. John added that he believes that “both kinds of antibodies – binding as well as neutralising” need to be studied, and that T memory cell levels are expected to stay on for long. The ability for the immune system to succeed against the virus and remember it for future encounters is crucial since there have been past viruses that interfere with the very defences of the human body. The virus that causes measles, for instances, has the ability to wipe out memory cells and make people vulnerable to infections they have had in the past. The dengue virus is known to cause a complication in which binding antibodies are not enough to neutralise it, leading to a situation where it can lead to severe infection. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) goes straight for the immune system.Researchers involved in the above studies said this success of the immune system is crucial for vaccines to work. “The development of vaccines against Sars-CoV2 would be greatly facilitated by the identification of immunological correlates of protection in humans,” the researchers involved in the fishing vessel outbreak study noted, before elaborating their findings that showed that antibodies correlated with protection from infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-immunity-insights-a-boost-against-covid-19/story-JLR9su387u7kxq2Yqj6hJJ.html

Chakraborty, in her petition to the apex court, had sought the transfer of case from Patna to Mumbai jurisdiction. The judgement will be given by a bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy at 11 am. Accusing Rhea of abetting his son’s suicide, KK Singh, Rajput’s father, filed an FIR in Patna on June 25 against her, her parents (including mother Sandhya Chakraborty), Showik, Rajput’s manager Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi and unknown persons accusing them of cheating and abetting his son’s death. Singh has also alleged financial irregularities and siphoning off Rs 15 crore in his son’s bank account in one year to an unknown person’s account, who is not known or connected to the late actor. Also read| Rhea Chakraborty’s financial transactions clear, nothing incriminating: LawyerChallenging the jurisdiction of the Bihar police in the matter, Rhea in her petition, had sought the transfer of case from Patna to Mumbai stating that the alleged crime took place in Mumbai and the power to look into the matter was with the Mumbai police. CBI took over the probe on August 5 on a request by the Bihar police.The 34 -year-old Bollywood actor was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The Mumbai police found the cause of death to be “asphyxia due to hanging” and filed an accidental death report (ADR), but is yet to register an FIR in connection with the death.Rajput’s death sparked a tussle between Maharashtra and Bihar police, with both authorities running to secure power to investigate the case, with the former arguing that Bihar completely lacks jurisdiction in the matter.Amid the legal tangle involved in this case, heightened media attention and sensationalizing of the case has been another ground for Rhea to demand transfer of the case to Mumbai. In her last submission to the Court, Rhea said that the Court could use its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to order a CBI probe but allowing the same based on transfer of the case from Patna to Mumbai will be “without jurisdiction and contrary to law”.

Additional civil witnesses are being asked to depose before the Court of Inquiry. Concurrently, DNA samples have been collected from Rajouri under the aegis of JKP and sent for matching with the terrorists killed on July 18, 2020,” he saidHe said the army is committed to ethical conduct of all counter terrorist operations.“Cases where doubts are raised are investigated under due process as per the law of the land. Since the case is under investigation, further details will be shared periodically, as appropriate without affecting due legal process.”Bodies of the three men killed in Shopian were buried in Baramulla after being listed as unidentified.Three families from Rajouri who had reported their sons missing from the night of July 17 have alleged that they had been killed Amshipora village in Shopian in a fake encounter and passed off as terrorists.Last week, a J&K police team from Shopian led by a deputy superintendent of police had collected DNA samples from the families of the missing men in Rajouri. All three were related to each other and, according to their family members, had gone to Shopian to work in apple orchards. They hired a room in a Shopian village close to a Rashtriya Rifles camp before they went missing, the families have said.After the purported encounter in an orchard, the bodies couldn’t be identified and the men were described by the army. as militants. Weeks after, when three families from Rajouri filed a missing report, and identified the pictures of the men who were killed, the police began investigating the case.

19-08-2020||India||Jal Jeevan: 51 million rural households now have tap water, according to govt data||Nearly 51 million rural households have now got tap-water connections, of which 20 million were added in the past year. It’s a leap over previous years. But the Jal Jeevan mission to provide every rural household with water supply, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in his 2019 Independence speech, needs to expand at a quicker rate to meet its 2024 deadline, an HT analysis based on government data shows.Over 120 million households lack access to clean water near their homes, the highest in the world, according to UN-Water.Contaminated water causes diseases such as diarrhoea, the third leading cause of childhood mortality in India, according to researchers Subitha Lakshminarayanan and Ramakrishnan Jayalakshmy of Puduchery’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Indira Gandhi Medical College. India has 189 million rural households, according to the official data. Till August 16, cumulatively over a four-year period, 51 million households, or 27% of the total, were provided with tap water connection under the joint Centre-state Jal Jeevan mission, data analysed by HT shows.This also means authorities must provide water connection to another 138 million households, or 73% remaining, by 2024. Piped drinking water to rural households is one of the critical components for achieving universal access to safe drinking water in the country.In 2018, just 18.2% of rural households had piped water supply. By 2019, this translated to an improvement of 9 percentage points. But the federally set deadline of 2024 – by which all households must be connected – means the current rate of expansion will need to go up to meet the completion date.The Gajendra Shekhawat-led Jal Shakti ministry oversees the implementation of the rural household water mission. According to him, his ministry and states utilised the Covid-19 lockdown period to hold video-conferences to prepare for state plans for this year and year ahead. “Lockdown was an opportunity,” Shekhawat said.A 2018 Comptroller and Auditor General performance audit said the programme was meant to provide at least 35% of rural households with piped water supply by 2017, and 80% households by 2020.Water is a state subject but the Union government provides a major share of funding. The Jal Jeevan rural households programme is worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Of this, the Centre’s share is about Rs 2.2 lakh crore.The Union budget had allotted Rs 10001 crore in 2019-20 for the national rural drinking water mission. In 2020-21, Rs 11500 crore was provided.The Jal Jeevan mission in its earlier avatar was the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) under the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance-II (UPA-II) government.“There has been a huge gap between the government’s stated objectives and actual delivery in the rural drinking water scheme,” said Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.Till 2018-19, expenditure as a proportion of funds available under the rural drinking water programme had been steadily decreasing, according to Accountability Initiative, a think-tank tracking government policies.In FY 2014-15, 84% of available funds were spent. This fell to 72% in FY 2017-18. In FY 2018-19, only 65% of the total funds available for NRDWM were spent. In 2014-15, 0.6% of total government funding was allocated to the rural piped drinking water project, which dropped to 0.2% in 2018-19. Funding got an 80% boost in the next year when the National Democratic Alliance government took it up as a mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jal-jeevan-51-million-rural-households-now-have-tap-water-according-to-govt-data/story-JepJ70SGthLh66bOkuO3bJ.html
19-08-2020||India||Restoring growth to boosting health infra: Charting India’s goals||On August 15, 2022, India will complete 75 years of Independence. Speaking from the Red Fort last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi listed a set of targets he wanted to be achieved by then. “By the 75th year of Independence, farmers’ income should double, every poor [person] should get a pucca house, every family should get electricity connection and every village should have optical fibre network and broadband connectivity besides the facility of long distance education”, Modi said. The unforeseen events in the run-up to completion of 73 years of independence today give a good reason to revisit the goals we want to achieve by August 15, 2022. The year 2020 has one of unprecedented disruption and challenges. The Indian economy, which was already in a deceleration phase, has entered contraction mode due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Given this scenario, India’s priority has to be revive growth. This is crucial to sustaining welfare schemes and expanding crucial infrastructure. Our health infrastructure, at least in most places, has been found to be wanting in dealing with the pandemic’s public health challenge. This means we need to look at questions beyond affordability when it comes to health care. India lost soldiers in a border clash with China at the Line of Actual Control after four decades. This has brought to fore the need for military preparedness to deal with all eventualities. Successfully meeting each of these challenges will require a focused policy intervention, and ambitious, yet pragmatic targets. The Indian economy will suffer a contraction in 2020-21. Most estimates suggest that the contraction will be at least 5% on an annual basis. The World Bank, in its Global Economic Prospects released in June, projected that the Indian economy would contract by 3.2% this fiscal. GDP growth is expected to reach 3.1% in the following fiscal, the Bank said. This means that India’s income levels will not even return to 2019-20 levels by 2021-22. The government must do all it can to prevent this from happening. It also needs to make sure that the stimulus to push growth does not sacrifice long term interests of the economy for short term gains. The most important metric on this count will be the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure. This number was 14% in 2015-16 and 2016-17. It started coming down with deceleration in growth rates. The Budget Estimates for 2020-21 put the share of capital expenditure at 13.5%. This number is unlikely to be realised, as a revenue shortfall will make it difficult for the government to even fulfil its basic commitments such as salaries, pensions and interest payments. Capital spending is likely to take a back seat in this situation. It will be a huge sentiment boost for the economy,however, if the government announced a gradual ramping up of capital expenditure to take it share in total spending well beyond 2015-16 levels by 2021-22. The Covid-19 pandemic has raised questions about India’s health infrastructure. This merits a recalibration of our health policy focus from affordability – the Modi government announced a health insurance scheme for 100 million poor families in 2018 – to expansion. India has the dubious distinction of being a laggard in government spending on health among its peer group. State governments spend much more on health than the Centre. A Mint article by Surbhi Bhatia and Sneha Alexander shows that the Centre’s spending on health in 2019-20 was just 0.32% of GDP, while the states spent 0.9%. Can the Centre give a massive boost to health spending and pledge to spend more than the states by 2021-22? The arrival of Rafale fighter jets from France was greeted with a lot of enthusiasm last month. In today’s age, ensuring access to cutting edge technology and new equipment is absolutely necessary to keep our armed forces prepared to deal with all eventualities. Budget figures show that a lot needs to be done here. Defence spending as a percentage of GDP has remained stagnant at slightly above 2% over the last few years. Less than a fourth of India’s defence spending is allocated towards capital outlays. We now spend more on defence pensions than capital outlay on defence services. While the importance of decent pensions to retired defence personnel cannot be overemphasized, the fact that we spend more on them than boosting future capabilities of our armed forces, underlines the need to invest more in the future. To be sure, things have changed in the recent past. Additional defence procurements have been ordered after the clash with Chinese soldiers. The government has also announced an ambitious import substitution programme. Can the government pledge to spend significantly more on capital outlay in defence than on pensions by the time India completes 75 years of independence?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restoring-growth-to-boosting-health-infra-charting-india-s-goals/story-t0V3xxyxCtGT4K2nLw4XDN.html
19-08-2020||Editorials||Step back from parochialism | HT Editorial||Madhya Pradesh (MP) chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced that all government jobs in the state would, henceforth, be reserved only for the “children” of MP, and relevant laws would be framed for this purpose. He has also added that MP’s “children” will have the first right over the state’s resources. His predecessor, Kamal Nath, promised that 70% of the jobs in industrial units would be reserved for locals. But MP is, of course, not unique in this regard. From Haryana to Gujarat, from Maharashtra to Karnataka, across Indian states, there is either a policy framework which reserves educational seats and/or jobs for locals or there is a strong political push in that direction. The fact that this cry — jobs for locals — has become a widespread refrain is understandable. There is a severe crisis of unemployment, and both public and private sector jobs have either shrunk or not grown at the pace required to meet the demands of India’s growing workforce. Instead of addressing structural economic issues, which can generate employment, political formations (across the spectrum) take the easy way out by framing the issue as one between insiders and outsiders. A nativist sentiment is built up, and citizens are told that they would have had jobs, but for the fact that those from outside the state have cornered the benefits. The solution then offered is simple — reservation. Desperate for hope, voters tend to see this as a panacea and fall for a promise that will do little to address the real and complex issue of joblessness.This competitive populism across states is also dangerous. A key constitutional tenet is equality of opportunity and non-discrimination — this push towards policy-based parochialism flouts it. Another key tenet is the freedom to move across the country, and the freedom to reside and settle anywhere and practise any profession — the measures adopted by various states will hamper those rights. An important principle that the Constitution strives to inculcate among citizens is fraternity —and this is possible only when there is engagement between citizens from different parts of the country, which such policies will only discourage. There is a real jobs crisis. But states turning insular will not solve that crisis, and, instead, create other challenges for national integration. Evolve a consensus across parties and states and refrain from this form of dangerous populism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/step-back-from-parochialism/story-NMZCTTXHaAOlCfT1QhELkJ.html
