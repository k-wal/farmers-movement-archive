But, there are also some worrying and dark aspects to our social milieu. While most of us are justifiably proud of our past, many of our compatriots are in a precarious position today, their distress exacerbated by the pandemic, their future uncertain. Let me narrate the story of Deepak Brahma, from Kokrajhar district in Assam. Due to the lack of employment opportunities in his native village, he went to Gujarat where he toiled to support his family. Covid-19 took his job away. Like many other migrant workers, he decided to return home to his village. As a daily wage earner, he had no savings since he had used everything he earned to sustain himself and his family. His family raised money by selling household items to enable him to return. After getting home, Brahma and others like him found that they were shunned in their villages. With no work and no money, and treated as possible carriers of the infection, they were treated as outcasts. When hunger overwhelmed Brahma and his family, he sold his newborn daughter for ~45,000 to feed his other two children for a while. But his misfortunes did not end there. A local NGO got wind of this and the matter finally came to the attention of the police. Brahma, the middleman and the buyer were packed off to jail. Impoverished and desperate, Brahma now faces a long and tough legal battle. Brahma’s story is similar to so many others across India, hardly an encouraging thought as the Republic enters its 74th year.It is staggering how quickly we forget the pain and suffering of others. Just a few months ago, our media was full of news about millions of migrant workers trudging home on the highways under the scorching sun after they lost their jobs in the cities. Hungry, thirsty, their soles cracked and bleeding, they marched on, clutching their meagre possessions and their children in the hope of finding some succour at home. Those going home included the elderly, the sick and pregnant women, a sight which was heart-rending and, for many of us, an appalling indictment of a system which had failed them. Most of us have only heard about the Partition of 1947. The outward migration when Covid-19 struck seemed like a replay of those terrible days.Mahatma Gandhi used to refer to these people as daridra-narayan (penniless gods). These are the people for whom Gandhi propounded the concept of Ram Rajya. This concept drove the spirit behind our freedom struggle. But what has happened to it today?Did governments at the Centre and states remain silent spectators during the calamity visited upon us by Covid-19? Not at all. During this period, coffers were opened and, as a result, there was no news of mass starvation despite enormous unemployment. Based on data, our sister publication Mint has done a comparative study. It found that under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana, ~2,000 per month, as an advance quarterly instalment, was deposited into the accounts of millions of people. Free foodgrains were also distributed during this period. However, the same study also found that the urban poor were better off than rural communities. Those in rural areas were more deprived despite free foodgrains and the deposits of ~500 in the Jan Dhan accounts of women.In another survey, it was found that during the lockdown, people’s income decreased by 84%. When reporters from Hindustan reached a segment of these citizens, they came across a myriad of problems faced by those in the lower-middle and middle-income groups. Decreased income meant that their savings were depleted since these had to be used for daily expenses. The biggest problem for this class was that their sense of pride and dignity stopped them from standing in queues for free foodgrains. They hesitated from applying for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), leaving them little choice but to use up their own limited funds. So, it is little wonder that those who went home to their villages now have no option but to return to the cities, which closed their gates to them in their moment of need. Three years ago, IndiaSpend analysed government data which showed that about 70% of farmer families are forced to spend more than they earn. Today, they have to spend twice what they earn. This means they are trapped in an endless cycle of debt. The only industry, if it can be called that, which is thriving, is money lending since it has upped its interest rates in the post-Covid-19 period. With the situation being so dire for so many of our fellow citizens, can we really call ourselves truly independent?But there is faint glimmer at the end of the dark tunnel. Just before we celebrated Independence Day, a survey found that 58% of Indians believe that we will overcome this economic crisis. History shows us that those who do not lose heart, those who never give up will eventually overcome all the vicissitudes that life throws up. And that should give us some hope.

16-08-2020||City||Two snatchers arrested from Punjabi Bagh||New Delhi: Two brothers, who were wanted for being on a snatching spree for over a month, were arrested from west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh early Saturday morning, nearly three hours after they snatched a cellphone from a Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector in Paschim Vihar, almost five kilometres away from the place they were caught, the police said. The police’s facial recognition system helped identify the suspects, they said.Senior police officers said teams from at least six police districts were looking for the two as they were allegedly frequently committed street crimes, mostly stealing high-end bikes, and using them to snatch cellphones. Interrogations of the two brothers – Rahul,28, and Vipin, 23 — have revealed they had committed more than two dozen snatchings across six districts in the last fortnight. The brothers mostly preferred to steal white bikes, police officers said, earning them the “white bike gang” moniker.On the eve of Independence Day, when thousand of Delhi Police and paramilitary security personnel were fanning across the city, assistant-sub-inspector (ASI) Himmat Singh’s cellphone was snatched around 11pm, while he was riding his scooter in Paschim Vihar. The two were caught three hours later, the police said.A police officer associated with the team that arrested the duo said that on July 31, Rahul and Vipin stole a white bike from Lajpat Nagar area and went on a snatching spree, targeting areas such as Mukarba Chowk, Burari bypass, Sarita Vihar, Pitampura, Peeragarhi Chowk, Paschim Vihar, Rajouri Garden, Vikaspuri, Keshav Puram, Janakpuri, Punjabi Bagh and Shalimar Bagh.“They were mostly active along Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Najafgarh Road and Rohtak Road,” said the officer.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the two brothers were arrested by the Rajouri Garden police, who had been looking for them since July 3, when they snatched a woman’s bag, which contained Rs. 10,000, five ATM cards, and her driving license, from Subhash Nagar area. The two also allegedly committed a similar snatching on a man in the neighbourhood a week later.The police scanned CCTV cameras of the routes that the suspects took after the two crimes and prepared their route trails. Their faces were caught on camera while they were allegedly stealing a motorcycle in Netaji Subhash Place area, the officer cited above said.“Their images were run on our facial recognition system that identified them by scanning the database of criminals arrested. Their residential address was of Mangolpuri. Our probe hit a road block when a police team went to Mangolpuri and found that the suspects had shifted somewhere else,” said the officer.The team activated their criminal intelligence network and learnt that the suspects’ new address was in Avankita near Rohini. The matter came to light August 14, and a team in plain clothes went there to nab them.While the police personnel were waiting for the two brothers to return, they were informed that the duo had snatched an ASI’s cellphone in Paschim Vihar. The team split in two groups – one stayed at the suspect’s home while another laid a trap near Punjabi Bagh drain, the usual route that the suspects took to return home. Around 2 am, the team spotted and caught them with the ASI’s stolen phone, bike, one pistol and a knife, the officer added.“Vipin is previously involved in 12 cases while Rahul has 11 previous cases. One of them is a parole jumper. They have disclosed their involvement in more than 25 snatchings committed in last 15 days on a white bike in six districts of Delhi. They used to sell stolen mobile phones to one Akbar living in Budh Vihar. We are looking for Akbar,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-snatchers-arrested-from-punjabi-bagh/story-IhemBAMxrHnQFlCxs0lhMP.html

Thane-based NGO Samarth Bharat Vyaspeth launched an application ‘Recycled Earth’ on Saturday, through which residents can put up a demand for collection of dry waste. The NGO has been collecting dry waste since 2018, however, residents had to approach the Thane Municipal Corporation’s helpline or call the NGO to get their collection picked up. Now they can use the app to get the work done, free of cost. At present, around 235 societies give their dry waste to the NGO on a weekly or monthly basis. Around 100 tonnes of dry waste is collected annually in Thane. This waste is collected and recycled by the NGO.Bhatu Sawant, secretary of Samarth Bharat Vyaspeeth, said, “We have started the mobile application Recycled Earth so that more people can join this initiative. People can submit their request on this app. Using their location, we can reach the spot and collect the garbage. People will also get the location of our worker when he or she will be on the way to collect dry waste.”The NGO has roped in rag-pickers to help in the collection drive, and in doing so, is providing employment through the initiative. They have eight women who are working to segregate the waste, and soon, they will increase their staff. Nine Marathi film celebrities from Thane have already joined hands with this group to promote the concept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-residents-can-now-use-app-for-free-collection-of-dry-waste/story-MrwuZk36aWgsqd6nMDImCI.html

16-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records less than 100 cases for 19th consecutive days||On Sunday, for the 19th consecutive day, Gurugram reported less than 100 new cases of Covid-19, recording just 78 new positives. Gurugram’s total number of reported infections, as on August 16, now stands at 10,263 cases, of which just seven percent (694 patients) are classified as ‘active’. The number of active cases are up slightly up from a week ago, on August 9, when the district had 663 cases. At the time, Gurugram’s total reported infections stood at 9,714, indicating an average growth of 78 cases per day over the past seven days. The week prior, between August 2 and August 9, the district saw an average of 67 new cases of Covid-19 every day. Health department officials, however, said that the test-positivity rate of the district remains below the recommended threshold of five percent, indicating that the situation is under control.“Our daily growth rate is still under one percent, and there is no cause for alarm,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s (IDSP) district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gurugram. State health department data showed that the district’s daily growth rate was 0.9 percent, which is the lowest in Haryana.Gurugram’s daily test-posivity rate — or ratio of new positives to new samples tested — stood at 3.5% on Sunday, which is within the World Health Organisation’s recommended positivity rate of 5 percent or less. “We have sustained a TPR of below five percent for at least three weeks now,” Sharma said.Of the current tally of 694 active cases, 84 patients are currently hospitalised, while the majority (573 people) are under home isolation. This is up slightly from 553 people under home isolation a week ago. Another 25 patients (down from 73 on August 9) are under observation at district Covid centre centres.Gurugram on Sunday also recorded 86 new recoveries (up from 65 the previous day), taking the district’s cumulative recovery rate to 92 percent (from 91 percent a week ago). The district recorded no new deaths on Sunday. The mortality rate in the district, thus far, is 1.2 percent (down from 1.34 percent a week ago), with 130 people succumbing to the virus so far.Gurugram on Sunday also collected 1,307 new samples for testing, down from 2314 samples collected on Saturday. Of these, 338 samples were taken by private labs for RT-PCR tests, while the majority of remaining samples were for RT-PCR and antigen tests by the health department.The doubling-rate stands at 84 days (the same as it was on August 9), while active cases make up seven percent of the reported case load (same as last week).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-less-than-100-cases-for-19th-consecutive-days/story-6qgotJfVt3L0UjXOtR46VJ.html
16-08-2020||Gurugram||Minister unveils plans for 100-acre biodiversity park in Manesar||Forest and tourism minister Kanwar Pal on Sunday unveiled plans to build a 100-acre biodiversity park in Manesar’s Kasan village. He also kick-started a plantation drive at an earmarked site on the foothills of the Aravallis. Forest department officials said that the project would be modelled along the lines of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram with a focus on planting native tree and plant varieties.Talking about the project, Pal said, “The park will come up with the support and involvement of the local community, particularly since panchayat land is being utilised. This will help in restoring the green cover in the area, raising the groundwater level, and also in generating income for the local community.” The minister on Sunday also met with the sarpanches of the local villages in the area to discuss their involvement in the project.Officials in the forest department added that proposed location has been chosen due to its strategic placement in the Aravalli foothills, which have largely been denuded due to human activities over several recent decades. “We now need to protect and revive such landscapes. The drainage pattern here is also suitable for forming waterbodies, which is also part of the proposal,” said Jai Kumar, district forest officer, Gururgam.The upcoming park in Kasan is among three that were initially proposed last year, the other two being in Damdama and Kukrola villages. Hindustan Times had first reported the development on August 20, 2019. At the time, Vijay Dhasmana, an ecologist who helmed the restoration of Aravalli Biodiversity Park, had said, ““If conservation is the administration’s aim, then that’s a good thing. Areas like Damdama and Kasan have some of the last traces of Aravalli wilderness in the region and need to be conserved.”However, Dhasmana had also cautioned that the administration must look holistically at the nature of Aravalli forests, instead of stopping short at simply planting native trees. “For example, it’s easy to plant ‘native’ varieties such as neem or chudail paapdi, but that won’t really bring back the native forests. The authorities will need to commit to bringing back the ecology of, say, dhau forests or babool forests, which have been lost from the area. That was the idea behind Aravalli Biodiversity Park,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/minister-unveils-plans-for-100-acre-biodiversity-park-in-manesar/story-hqRAUaz6HttgvMKIfJtW6L.html
16-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s testing slows down as positivity dips||The rate of testing for Covid-19 in Gurugram has slowed over the past three weeks, shows district health department data. In late June and through early July, the total number of tests conducted each week showed large jumps, increasing by as much as 40 to 50 percent (when compared as a moving, seven-day aggregate). However, since late July, tests have been increasing by only as much as 11 to 16 percent each week, the data shows. Health department officials confirmed that this was indeed the case, but clarified that there is presently no immediate need to further ramp up testing. With over 130,000 samples tested for Covid-19 so far, the extent of testing in Gurugram has is 93,000 tests per million population, the highest in the state. This is up from about 90,000 tests per million about a week ago. Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gurugram, also pointed out that district’s weekly test positivty rate -- defined as the ratio of positive cases to tests conducted -- has been under 5 percent for close to four weeks now. “The positivity rate is an adequate measure for whether we are testing enough. Scaling up testing is only necessary to keep up with continued spread of the virus. At this point, we believe that transmission itself has been curbed, and testing resources are finite, so we have to use them judiciously,” Prakash said, adding that testing for Gurugram also be reduced, if resources need to be diverted to areas of the state in greater need, once the daily positivity rate dips below three percent. “So even though the rate of testing has slowed down somewhat, in absolute numbers we are still conducting more tests, week on week. Earlier into the outbreak, we had to increase testing by as much as 50 percent before the TPR showed a decline. But now, positivity rate has continued to decrease despite the slowdown. That is the most hopeful indicator that we are out of the woods,” pointed out Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram. Prakash also added that Gurugram’s test per million were significantly higher than those of neighbouring Faridabad, which has the highest reported caseload of infections in Haryana, but has tested not more than 55,000 people per million population. Meanwhile, at a state level, only 32,300 tests per million population have been conducted. “Our tests per million are three times as much as the state’s, and close to four times the national average,” Prakash said.Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president, research and policy, Public Health Foundation of India, said that the reduction in testing is understandable given the dip in TPR. “I think we are seeing a natural progression of the epidemic -- which has only been slowed down by the lockdown. Transmission of the virus has continued despite curbs, as shown by serological studies from Delhi and Mumbai, where as many as 23 percent of the sampled population has been exposed to the virus,” he said. “Gurugram, being an extension of Delhi, would likely have a similar proportion of population infected, and this may have reached a natural threshold after which the virus has slowed down.” He however clarified that this hypothesis required supporting evidence, which is yet to emerge.BOX:Total tests // Weekly increase in tests // Weekly percentage increase in tests // Weekly new cases // Weekly test positivity ratesAugust 9 - August 15: 132879 (+14699 // 12.5%) | New cases: 551 | TPR = 3.7%August 2 - August 8: 118180 (+14362 // 11%) | New cases: 468 | TPR = 3.2%July 26 - August 1: 103818 (+13833 // 16%) | New cases: 675 | TPR = 4.8%July 19 - July 25: 89985 (+15265 // 20%) | New cases: 897| TPR = 6%July 12 - July 18: 74720 (+16,411 // 28%) | New cases: 846 | TPR = 5%July 5 - July 11: 58309 (+19,488 // 50%) | New cases: 919 | TPR = 5%June 27 - July 4: 38821 (+10,974 // 39%) | New cases: 759 | TPR = 7%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-testing-slows-down-as-positivity-dips/story-nBDo81IYxgzbCNWIGEFSvL.html

16-08-2020||Gurugram||High Court issues direction to file forensic report in inmate’s death||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has asked the prison department to file the forensic report in the case involving the custodial death of an inmate inside Bhondsi jail premises. In a notice, issued on August 11, the prison department has asked to submit the report to the court in the next hearing on September 18.Last year in January, 28-year-old Akhilesh, convicted for robbery and murder, was found dead in Bhondsi jail premises. “The deceased was involved in a murder and robbery case and was arrested from Darbaripur village in Gurugram on July 28, 2012 for his alleged involvement in robbery. He was given life sentence by a sessions court on September 3, 2013 and since then he was lodged in Bhondsi jail,” said Ambika Yadav, advocate for Akhilesh’s mother, the petitioner in the case. Yadav added on January 8, 2019 around 8pm, Akhilesh’s mother, Satan Devi,70, received a call from the jail authorities saying her son was found dead “under mysterious circumstances.”Vipul Sachdeva, lawyer of the petitioner, said jail authorities had told Akhilesh’s family that he died of a heart attack, however, the autopsy report revealed a different cause. “The autopsy report clearly mentioned that various brownish/black pellets were found in the stomach of the deceased. The jail authorities were questioned regarding their level of security and caution with which prisoners are handled. The instance of the free flow of drugs and mobile phones have become a common practice in Bhondsi jail,” he said.Devi along with other family members had approached various authorities and officers to investigate her son’s death inside the jail premises, but to no avail, Sachdeva added.Despite several attempts, the Bhondsi jail superintendent could not be reached for comment.Last month, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Bhondsi jail was arrested for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards to inmates over the last two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/high-court-issues-direction-to-file-forensic-report-in-inmate-s-death/story-d62SIzdnIK9mFkTwR1WwFL.html

The project will cost over ₹200 crore and take two years to complete, from the day construction commences,” said Sharma.He further said that the stadium’s rooftop would be fitted with solar panels from which the entire complex will derive its electricity.Once constructed, the Wazirabad sports complex will be the city’s third full-fledged stadium after the Tau Devi Lal sports complex near Rajiv Chowk and Nehru stadium on Old Railway Road.Sharma said that for each of the sports in the proposed complex, different size of space will be reserved for erecting stands or seating arrangements for crowds as well as for reserving parking spaces.The announcement of a sports stadium in Wazirabad was made as early as June 2016 by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. In 2017, the civic body procured 12 acres of land from Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on a 99-year lease for the project.Till May last year, a proposal for constructing a ₹130-crore archery range and multi-purpose indoor sports complex was planned. However, following a meeting between Yashpal Yadav, the then MCG commissioner and V Umashankar, then chief executive officer of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), it was decided that a recreational sports complex on the lines of Azad Maidan and Shivaji Park in Mumbai was more feasible.The two officials realised that the ₹20-crore recreational sports complex did not need the hiring of any expert coaches and could simply be a space where a ground for football, a jogging-running track for athletes, a skating rink, indoor badminton and a basketball court could be reserved and utilized by all citizens without any need of supervision or expertise. However, with both officials getting transferred soon after, the proposal never came to fruition.On Tuesday, the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) had asked various civic bodies across the state, including MCG, for an update on the progress of projects announced by the CM, following which MCG officials expedited their work on the new plan for the Wazirabad sports stadium, said an official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mcg-set-to-construct-200-crore-sports-complex-in-wazirabad/story-Skpr6LlWrkQx9cBNJPfFDI.html

A group of 16 year olds, collected ₹14.98 lakh that was used to help women self-help groups make masks, arrange personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and N95 masks for Covid warriors, and also help underprivileged students.“Our group, Project Samvedna, was formed when the floods hit Maharashtra in 2019. At that time, we were able to help 650 families with rations, clothes, medicines, books and other relief materials,” said Aditya Bhargava, a resident of Kandivli.Bhargava and his friends from the Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS) decided to come together again when the pandemic struck the city.From April to June, they discussed ideas via video-conferencing, reached out to family and friends, created a website, made a video, and raised a request on a crowdfunding platform.“We had a lot of ideas, but we narrowed them down to three issues where we could do our best in terms of funding and logistics,” said Anushree Mishra, a member of Project Samvedna.Soon, with the help of the NGO Indian Development Foundation (IDF), the team provided 700 PPE kits and 3,000 N-95 masks to four hospitals in the city. They also provided 20 hands-free sanitiser units to 20 bal gurukuls in Mumbai and donated ₹1.20 lakhs to supply sanitary napkins to school-going girls.Dr Narayan Iyer, chief executive officer at IDF, said, “The team enabled around 100 women to make masks that were sold later. We took forward their project and are looking to scaling it up.”Kamya Parekh, a member of Project Samvedna, said that it was a “fulfilling experience” to work with her friends. “All of us knew we had to do something to help society. It was a lot of hard work, but it was a very fulfilling experience,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-city-teens-help-raise-14-98-lakh-to-fight-pandemic/story-mQISsyyCwnh2QsXdubblnJ.html

16-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar complete 150,000 tests each, focus on reducing fatality rate||Even as Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar rose to the third and fourth place, respectively, of districts with the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, both have also managed to raise the number of tests to 150,000 each tests till August 15. While Ghaziabad has completed about 211 tests per million (tpm) per day, Gautam Budh Nagar (GB Nagar) 450 tpm per day. On a global scale, the World Health Organization had put a minimum of 140 tpm per day. Ghaziabad discovered its first case on March 5 and GB Nagar followed three days later.According to the figures of the state control room, Ghaziabad surpassed Gautam Budh Nagar and stood at the third spot in the list of districts in UP having highest number of total Covid-19 cases. The figure for Ghaziabad stood at 6451 while that for Gautam Budh Nagar stood at 6408 till August 15. The Ghaziabad district lagged behind Lucknow (16656 cases) and Kanpur City (9969 cases) till August 15. “The cases have increased but it is result of increase in sampling/testing and surveillance activities. Till August 15 we completed 151,826 of total testing,” said Dr. NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad district. With a population of 4.4 million, this would translate to around 34,506 tpm, which is higher than the national figure of 21,989 tpm.Presently, the district is conducting about 3000-3500 tests per day and its testing will be further bolstered by new RT-PCR laboratory which was inaugurated on August 15. On the other hand, the officials of the Gautam Budh Nagar district said that they have also completed 151,314 tests till August 15. With a population of nearly 2 million, the district has a tpm figure of 75,657. However, these figures denote samples tested and not individuals.“Our daily testing is ranging from 2500 to 4000 tests per day and will continue with higher number of testing. More importantly we have a very low fatality rate of 0.67% which is lower than Centre’s standard of 1%. We plan to reduce it further. With the lower fatality rate, the district is very likely to figure among the top districts across the country having a very low fatality rate,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. “Our prime focus is on reducing the deaths. This is being done through early detection, early referral and treatment besides surveillance and door-to-door surveys.”Senthil Pandian C, IAS, the UP government appointed nodal officer for the Ghaziabad district, said, “Although the number of cases will rise with increased testing, we have put in focussed surveillance strategy to detect cases and continuously lower the cases of infection. If undetected, there is high possibility that the infected person may spread infection further. The testing will continue and cases will come to light. We have identified 10 areas of Indirapuram, Kavi Nagar, Modinagar, Loni and Sahibabad among others where there is high number of cases but extensive surveillance is done to detect cases. The idea is to detect all suspected cases by taking up several rounds of surveys.”“Early testing and detection become vital to prevent deaths. We roped in this strategy and there was considerable reduction in fatalities in the months of July and August. We also took a decision to stop referrals to Meerut. It was also directed that L2 wing should come up at the same premises at our L3 hospital (Santosh Medical). This will result in immediate shifting and save time in transporting patients. We also roped in usage of high flow nasal cannula during treatment of patients having complaints of breathlessness and respiratory issues,” he added. According to the latest official figures, 30 of 67 deaths have taken place at hospitals in Ghaziabad while 33 have taken place in Meerut and two each in hospitals of Noida and Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-gautam-budh-nagar-complete-150-000-tests-each-focus-on-reducing-fatality-rate/story-iM5rgA0WheBaiJgI6GOzoI.html

16-08-2020||City||Two persons arrested in Sudeeksha Bhati’s death case; suspects modified bike to evade arrest||Bulandshahr police on Sunday arrested two persons in connection with the death of 19-year-old Sudeeksha Bhati last week. Deepak Solanki, 28, a construction contractor and a resident of Gulaothi, was allegedly riding a motorcycle and mason 50-year-old Raju from Bulandshahr dehat was riding pillion when the accident took place on Chirora Road in Aurangabad on August 10. They were arrested soon after relatives of Sudeeksha identified them. Although the family had earlier claimed that motorcyclists had harassed Sudeeksha and that had led to the accident, the Bulandshahr four-member special investigation team (SIT) probe found that the accident was due to speeding. Sudeeksha was pursuing an undergraduate course in entrepreneurship from Babson College, Massachusetts, USA on ₹3.80 crore scholarship. Her death had sparked a political storm with parties questioning the law and order situation in the state.Police said that two days after the accident, the suspects had modified the motorcycle when they learnt that the police was on the look out for Royal Enfield motorcycles. On Sunday, police recovered their motorcycle too. Santosh Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, at a press conference on Sunday said that the police had scanned multiple CCTV footage and established that the accident took place at around 8.44 am. “Police scanned 12 CCTV cameras and found Sudeeksha and her cousin travelling on a motorcycle at 8:25 am. The same camera captured Solanki on an Enfield at 8.17 am on the same route and picked up Raju from near Arif Hospital and later, Sudeeksha’s motorcycle crossed them,” he said. “The two motorcycles were moving in the same direction and covered 10.5 kilometres in nine minutes on a busy road which showed that both were speeding,” he said. Later, the Enfield motorcycle overtook Sudeeksha following which the accident took place.“Solanki said that a tempo traveller ahead of him had applied a sudden brake forcing him to brake suddenly too causing the motorcycle on which Sudeeksha was to collide with them near Bhavsi bridge. Seeing the accident and the injured, Solanki said he fled the spot due to fear,” said the SSP. With news that police was looking for Royal Enfield motorcycles, he went on make changes to the vehicle . “On August 12, I went to a local mechanic and got the wheels, silencer, and number plate changed. I also laminated the motorcycle with white stickers to disguise the identity,” he allegedly told police. Subhash Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Aurangabad police station, said, “We have seized the motorcycle. The suspects had modified its number plate, silencer, indicator, etc. We have also seized these parts of motorcycle and ₹1400 from Deepak and ₹300 from Raju.”Solanki was constructing a banquet hall near Khanpur road and he was on the way there when the accident took place, said police. The two were produced before the magistrate and sent to jail, said the SHO.On Sudeeksha’s father Jitendra Bhati’s complaint, the police had registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (death due to negligence), among others.Jitendra Bhati said that he was satisfied with the police investigation. “My brother and his son identified the suspects. We demand the government to make an institution on Sudeeksha’s name so that local girls can get inspiration to study and do good in their lives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-persons-arrested-in-sudeeksha-bhati-s-death-case-suspects-modified-bike-to-evade-arrest/story-WG1aR0DsP0sBITwRr8TF4K.html

16-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra jail Covid case tally touches 1,000||The number of Covid-19 cases reported among inmates lodged across jails in Maharashtra crossed the 1,000-mark on Friday and now stands at 1,007, which include six deaths and 814 recoveries. As on Friday, 26,308 inmates were lodged across 45 jails in Maharashtra.The six deaths were reported from Pune’s Yerawada Central Prison, Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Central jail and prisons in Dhule and Amravati.Nagpur Central Prison has recorded the maximum number (219) of Covid-19 cases. Prison officials have, however, claimed that all the 219 inmates have recovered from the infection. Jail authorities at Nagpur prison have conducted 616 Covid-19 tests among its inmates.Arthur Road jail, which is one of the most overcrowded prisons in the state, and houses several gangsters, terror suspects and high-profile economic offenders, reported 182 cases of Covid-19 among its inmates, while 46 jail officials also tested positive for the virus. The jail was also the first in Maharashtra where the case was detected, after a 45-year-old inmate tested positive on May 5 at Sir JJ Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment for a paralytic attack.Sangli and Akola district prisons have reported 145 and 99 Covid-19 cases, respectively.According to officials, of the 6,177 tests conducted across all central, district and open jails in the state, 781 were by Arthur Road jail, which houses more than 2,500 undertrials, against its capacity of 800.After Arthur Road and Nagpur jails, the most number of tests were conducted at Akola (569), Aurangabad (517) and Yerawada prisons (506).However, eight prisons – Sawantwadi district jail, Sindhudurg district jail, Yerawada open jail, Nanded district jail, Nandurbar district jail, Washim district jail, Bhusawal sub-jail, Morshi open jail and Nashik Borstal School – have not conducted any Covid-19 tests, said authorities.Among the jail staffers, the state prisons department has conducted a total of 1,560 tests, of which 293 results have come positive. No deaths have been reported, and 268 staffers have recovered.Prison officials claimed that they are regularly screening prisoners and those who develop any symptoms are sent for Covid-19 tests.A total of 10,476 inmates have either been released on bail or parole since March 25 to prevent overcrowding, as the total capacity of in jails across the state is only 23,217, said authorities. “All possible efforts to decongest prisons are being taken, but some of them are still overcrowded. Also, bail is granted by a court and not the prison authorities,” said Sunil Ramanand, additional director general (prisons). “The most important thing to notice here is that we have been able to successfully contain the Covid-related deaths in prisons,” Ramanand added. According to Madhurima Dhanuka, programme head, prisons reforms programme, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), though decongestion is an important step to control the spread of the virus in jails, it is not a complete solution. “Healthcare services to prisoners, ensuring social distancing norms among them and sanitisation are important issues that should be looked into by the jail authorities,” she said. Dhanuka further added that prison-wise monitoring, both internally and externally, is very important. “This can be done through the board of visitors (BoV) or by forming a nodal committee in every prison, which can ensure the compliance of all the safety guidelines for the prisoners. The committee can monitor the effectiveness of the preparedness of the prison authority to ensure the effective response to Covid-19,” she added. According to Dhanuka, many restrictions are imposed by the prison department, which undermine the rights of the inmates. The nodal authorities need to ensure that the rights of the prisoners are not unduly restricted or suppressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-jail-covid-case-tally-touches-1-000/story-egaKeKC3mCPcYrZfmkVFJL.html
16-08-2020||Kolkata||Raj Bhavan under surveillance, claims Bengal governor||Raj Bhavan has been placed under surveillance “undermining the sanctity” of the institution, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar alleged on Sunday, a development that could plunge his already strained ties with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to newer depths.Making the startling claim, Dhankhar, who has often crossed swords with the TMC government over a host of issues in the past one year, also alleged lawlessness was prevailing across the state, drawing sharp reactions from Banerjee’s party, which said that such acts of surveillance are the domain of his “bosses from Gujarat”.“I would like to tell you all that the Raj Bhavan is under surveillance. It undermines the sanctity of the Raj Bhavan. I will do everything to protect its sanctity,” Dhankhar told a press conference.“I have initiated a very serious, critical probe into it. Sanctity of Raj Bhavan’s functioning has to be kept intact,” he said.Without elaborating on what kind of surveillance Raj Bhavan had been put under, Dhankhar said, “As constitutional act, I will not, will never suffer any surveillance of any nature whatsoever. Those who have done it, must pay the price according to rule of law. My internal inquiry will be completed soon enough,” he said. The governor also spoke about confidential documents getting leaked.There was no word from the government on Dhankhar’s claim.However, Trinamool Congress MP and spokesperson Mahua Moitra hit out at the governor over the claims.“Uncleji now claims he and Raj Bhawan premises (are) under surveillance. Believe me, that’s something your bosses from Gujarat do better than anyone else -any of us would be novices at it,” she said on Twitter.Expressing “pain” at Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet colleagues not attending the customary At Home hosted at Raj Bhavan, the governor’s official residence, on Independence Day, Dhankhar said that less than 35 distinguished guests had been invited keeping in mind the Covid-19 outbreak.“It has been very painful for me... I was constantly interacting with the state government through the chief minister, was impressing upon her consistently that the programme will be held totally and strictly following the COVID protocol and keeping the number to bare minimum.“It would have been befitting for the occasion, it would have been a good tribute to our freedom fighters’ sacrifice if the chief minister and members of the executive invited (had attended); it has set a bad precedent,” he said.The chief minister had met the governor at Raj Bhavan on Saturday morning after attending the official Independence Day event but did not attend the At Home.Refuting Dhankhar, Moitra shared a document on Twitter, stating that 96 people were invited to the Raj Bhavan.“Uncle- please at least share the whole truth...Honble CM visited you at Raj Bhavan before your tea party & spent an hour with you. Dont think milling in a crowd at a tea party is wise for either her or you in the midst of Covid 19,” she tweeted.Referring to some of his many face-offs with the Mamata Banerjee government since he took over as the governor of West Bengal a year ago, including those at the state Assembly, during his visits to universities and the Constitution Day function, he said, these were not the signs of democracy or freedom.Dhankhar said he had found the gates to the Assembly locked during a scheduled visit. Likewise, the chamber of the vice-chancellor was under lock and key during his visit to a university of which he is the ex-officio chancellor, he said.On the Constitution Day, he was sixth in queue to address the Assembly, the governor said.“I pray to almighty that good sense prevails, Constitution is respected,” he said, adding, “15th August was another painful day for me, political violence and killing was noticed over unfurling of the national flag.” A BJP worker was killed allegedly by TMC supporters at Khanakul in Hooghly district following a tiff over unfurling the tricolour at the same spot.“We are in a state of lawlessness, already situation is alarmingly worrisome,” the governor said.He said as the governor he has a constitutional right to know about the happenings in the state and that it is the duty of the chief minister to make information available to him.Dhankhar said there have been five editions of Bengal Global Business Summit, but his questions on how much investment was promised and how much was actually delivered, and about jobs created have not elicited any response from the government. He said his advice to the civil administration and police to act as public and not political servants and conduct themselves in accordance with law and neutrally, has gone unheeded.“It is my commitment to the people of West Bengal, I will do everything possible to ensure that democracy in the state flourishes, and democracy will flourish only if there is rule of law,” he said.Dhankhar alleged that the police administration is acting in a manner which is “seriously compromising” the activities of political opponents of the ruling party.He said that even MPs and MLAs were being slapped with criminal cases and “threatened in a manner that will shake anyone”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/raj-bhavan-under-surveillance-claims-bengal-governor/story-xIqLs9vC1OlWvFaRP1PBRM.html
16-08-2020||Mumbai||Non-Covid OPDs at civic-run hospitals witness low footfall||Despite restarting out-patient departments (OPD) for non-Covid patients at BYL Nair and King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospitals, as the pandemic curve continues to flatten in the city, footfall has fallen below 80% as compared to pre-Covid days.Civic officials have attributed the drop in patients to the fear of contracting the novel coronavirus infection at civic-run hospitals.“Another reason for lesser footfall is restrictions on local train services since major civic hospitals get patients from far-off areas like Vasai and Virar. We have also witnessed that residents prefer local private clinics over civic hospitals,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.With many recovered Covid-19 patients complaining of lung fibrosis, diabetes, hypertension and breathlessness, KEM Hospital will start its post-Covid OPD by August 19 for such patients, said a health officer from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Cardiologists, pulmonologists and diabetologists among other specialists will attend to patients at the OPD.Before the Covid outbreak, 1,500-bed KEM Hospital recorded 7,000 OPD patients daily, while Nair Hospital received over 4,000 patients. After Covid-19 struck, the hospitals had to close down their OPD services to avoid any possible spread of the infection to non-Covid patients. After five months, the hospitals opened their OPDs in the first week of August. Dr Shailesh Mohite, dean of Nair Hospital, said, “Considering our hospital was a dedicated Covid care hospital, people are still scared to come here for non-Covid diagnosis. We are receiving 20% of the total footfall we used to receive pre-Covid.”Similarly, KEM Hospital has witnessed a 70% decline in patient footfall, said dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh.Meanwhile, Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital, which is a partially-converted Covid-19 hospital, has been receiving the most number of non-Covid patients in their OPD. For the last two months, the hospital has been running two separate OPDs — a fever clinic for suspected Covid-19 patients and a general OPD. Till the first week of July, they were receiving around 200 patients daily; the number has shot up to more than 1,000 this month.“As people are scared to visit other major hospitals, all of them are coming to our hospital for diagnosis. We have kept over 250 beds for non-Covid patients,” said Dr Pinakin Gujjar, hospital dean.Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital, is set to start its non-Covid OPD by the next weekend. “All civic-run hospitals will have two OPDs – one for suspected Covid-19 patients and the other for general patients. Their entry and exit points will be different. Hospitals have been instructed about the required changes to be maintained until this pandemic gets over,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/non-covid-opds-at-civic-run-hospitals-witness-low-footfall/story-WQKdU7AHzPQURxTOPACrMO.html
16-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC set to handle spread of Covid-19 in high-rises||With the change in the trend, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expecting more Covid-19 cases from high-rises and buildings, than from slums. As the staggered unlock began in phases from June 5, as part of Mission Begin Again, the Covid-19 infection began to spread from slums to high-rises. BMC attributed it to more interaction between residents of high-rises and buildings with the rest of the city, as they ventured out more, with the opening of both essential and non-essential shops, and workers and house helps returning to work. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in BMC, in-charge of the civic health department, said, “We expect more cases to come from high-rises now.” According to Kakani, during lockdown in April and May, when cases in slums were on the rise, its residents are likely to have developed a certain level of immunity to the virus, in comparison to residents of high-rises who did not go out at all. Kakani said, “Slums have smaller homes, and their residents interact more with their ecosystem. Once a slum ecosystem is contaminated after some of its residents test positive, due to high level of community interaction, other residents of the slum are likely to develop some immunity. However, so far, residents of high-rises were indoors. As they begin to venture out more, they will be exposed to the virus for the first time.” On Sunday, Mumbai reported 1,010 new Covid-19 cases, and 47 new deaths. The total number of cases has gone up to 128,726, and the deaths are 7,133. There are 17,825 active cases in the city. The case fatality rate is 5.5%, and recovery rate is 80%. BMC is also mulling reopening gymnasiums in the city within the next few weeks. However, swimming pools will remain closed. Kakani said, “The chances of transmitting infection through use of a swimming pool are high. It will get difficult to contain the spread.” On June 5, BMC allowed opening shops on alternate sides of the road every alternate days. On August 5, BMC allowed malls and supermarkets to reopen, and shops on both side to remain open. The figures released by BMC show most wards with a high number of buildings have a higher growth rate. D ward comprising Malabar Hill, Pedder Road, Walkeshwar, Kemps Corner and Mahalaxmi areas has the highest growth rate at 1.4%, against Mumbai’s overall average of 0.82%. Similarly, all suburban wards corresponding to the areas of Kandivli, Borivli, Malad, Goregaon, Mulund have growth rates higher than Mumbai’s average. G North ward, which covers Dharavi, Dadar, and Shivaji Park, is among the 10 wards shortlisted by BMC on Friday as high focus areas, even though the cases in Dharavi have drastically gone down. This is owing to a higher growth rate in the buildings of Dadar and Shivaji Park, Kakani said. G North ward has a growth rate of 0.73%. Dharavi on Sunday reported five new cases, taking the total to 2,668. There are 80 active Covid-19 cases in Dharavi. Dadar reported 33 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the total to 2,208, and 466 active Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-set-to-handle-spread-of-covid-19-in-high-rises/story-wzBqgBX4xF6sWr1wx38cuI.html

Later, they tested positive of Covid-19 in rapid antigen test and were immediately admitted to the Covid-19 ward of the hospital. As per sources in the hospital, their oxygen saturation has fallen below 80% and considering the age, both have been kept under artificial breathing support system called CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure). It is a form of an airway pressure ventilation which supports breathing. “They have been kept in ICU but we haven’t intubated them as yet. Considering their age and pre-condition health issues like diabetes and hypertension, we have to be extra careful while treating them,” said a doctor from the hospital. They are kept under Dr Jalil Parker who refused to make any statement citing patient confidentiality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/veteran-actor-dilip-kumar-s-brothers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-BGHUETAx71GmRB8E1fAa8I.html

(I) am overwhelmed. (We) will now set up oxygen test centres in 30,000 villages. Commitments still pouring in. (With that) we will set it up in more villages. Thank u (you) donors. We will train village youth n (and) give them oximeters,” Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.“This will help us in saving lives by detecting drop in oxygen levels in time,” he tweeted.Oximeters help in measuring the oxygen level and are found to be extremely useful for coronavirus patients who in many cases battle breathlessness due to drop in oxygen level.Arvind Kejriwal had on Saturday appealed to the public, members of the civil society and party workers across the nation to donate pulse oximeters to the AAP so it can set up ‘oxygen testing centres’ in rural India to reduce the number of covid deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-to-set-up-oxygen-test-centres-in-villages-kejriwal/story-2a5Z0CRcPTfBoUbVH602ZK.html

The other three storeys are residential. “We received a call about fire in the air-conditioning of the clinic in the basement at 11.07am. We sent two fire tenders initially,” said Chandraprakash Singh, sub-officer of DFS, who led the operation.“When we reached there, we found the basement up in flames and smoke having engulfed the upper floors. While two staffers of the clinic managed to escape, we had to enter the basement to rescue an elderly woman,” said Singh.The blaze spread quickly after a wooden cabin in the basement caught fire, said Singh.At the same time, the firefighters noticed two women and two girls of a family stranded in the balcony of the top floor. “They couldn’t escape either through the staircase or the terrace due to the dense smoke in the building’s common area. So, we accessed the terrace by climbing the adjacent building,” said the fire officer.The four women on the top floor were safely rescued in the operation that lasted 90 minutes and required five fire tenders, said the officer, adding that a leading fireman, Surender, suffered cuts to his hand in the operation.“He has received stitches and is out of danger,” he said.The police are still investigating the circumstances of the blaze.

16-08-2020||Mumbai||Vasai civic body waives permission fees for Ganpati pandals||The Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) on Saturday waived off a ₹4,500 fee required for permission and fire brigade charges for Ganpati pandals in Vasai-Virar after Nallasopara MLA Kshitij Thakur appealed to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to waive the same in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the rules, Ganpati mandals have to take permission from the local police, fire brigade and the civic body to install a pandal. Even with Ganeshotsav festival hardly a few days away, mandals have not been able to collect enough donations for the 10-day festival. “In view of this, I requested the CM to waive off the permission and processing fees on humanitarian grounds,” said Thakur.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ganeshotsav will have to be celebrated in a subdued manner and after taking all the necessary precautionary measures. The volunteers have not been able to venture out to collect donation, and as a result, they are running short on money. “With much fewer people expected to venture out for the festival, it will be even more difficult for them,” said Thakur.All the municipal corporations have released a set of details to be followed by the mandals and the devotees for Ganeshotsav celebrations. It also includes capping the size Ganpati idols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vasai-civic-body-waives-permission-fees-for-ganpati-pandals/story-JaFFVwR1nonuCzq1EkHysN.html
16-08-2020||Mumbai||Ensure social distancing is followed in revamp plan: Dharavii locals to state||A group of residents from Dharavi has written to the state government, seeking clarification on the redevelopment plan in India’s largest slums amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The residents’ group, People’s Responsible Organisation of United Dharavi (Proud) has demanded that their apartments be constructed taking into consideration the social distancing norms. Dharavi has reported more than 2,600 cases of Covid-19 since April. The residents have also sought a clarification on the percentage of buildable land being offered for the rehabilitation of the locals, who are majorly slum-dwellers. When asked on the issue, state housing minister Jitendra Awhad said, “We are of the opinion that now is the best time to go ahead with the redevelopment but all the concerns of all stakeholders will be looked into before the revamp. We are, however, yet to decide if the contract will be given to the same company which won the bid earlier or to go for re-bidding. We are taking a legal opinion on it and will take a decision soon.” Residents have claimed that social distancing and issues of density have become even more important after the outbreak of Covid-19 and have insisted that the slum dwellers be made aware of the plans being drafted by the state government. Hariram Dilliwala, general secretary of Proud, said, “We are still struggling to overcome the Covid-19 outbreak and are also trying to figure out how we can ensure better social distancing if something like this happens again at Dharavi. Hence, the government has to ensure that we are not thrown into vertical slums in the name of redevelopment. There should not be a scenario wherein we have 14-15 apartments on one floor, as social distancing is an important factor now.” Proud has sought clarity on the usage of common spaces. “We have written to the state government and sought clarity on what is the internal layout of our approved apartments is in relation to the number of apartments on each floor and the number of people who will use the building’s common spaces, to ensure social distancing norms. Also, we need clarity on how tall the buildings will be and the number of residents who will use common lifts etc. The government should give us all such details,” said Dilliwala, a resident of Dharavi from the past 40 years. Another resident, Radhakrishnan Perumal, said that the locals have appointed an architect to represent their concerns. “We do not mind the company the government appoints for our redevelopment, but we want to see what our future locality will look like. We have appointed an architect, who will represent us. We cannot afford the architect’s fees and hence the services by him will be taken from the potential developer,” said Perumal. According to Ameer Chand, the architect appointed by Proud, focus should be on ensuring that Dharavi does not become a “claustrophobic vertical slum”. “Enforcing redevelopment on the basis of improper plans is of no use. The new normal [social distancing norms] needs a new approach. Careful and detailed planning will ensure that the current horizontal density or congestion within the slum clusters of Dharavi is not getting translated into a claustrophobic vertical slum,” he said, adding that state needs to transparently give out the rehabilitation details of the project. “The government must specify the percentage of land they will allocate for the residents of Dharavi. It is also extremely unfair to not let the residents see their to-be-redeveloped house plans beforehand. Mere carpet areas should not be the benchmark for deciding liveability,” said Chand. Successive governments have been planning the redevelopment of 535-acre land in Dharavi since the 1980’s, but nothing has been materialised so far. In 2018, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) was set up to implement the ₹22,000-crore Dharavi Redevelopment Project, which aims to transform India’s largest slum pocket, located on prime land in the heart of Mumbai, into a plush township by offering 350 square feet homes to slum dwellers post redevelopment. The same year in November, bids were floated and won by Sec Link Technology Corporation (STC), backed by the royal family of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, the firm was not given the project after an alleged ‘technical glitch’ occurred, when the Devendra Fadnavis-government acquired 45-acre railway land adjacent to the area. The railway land was not mentioned in the original tender and the government was of the opinion that the tender to the UAE firm should be cancelled and the bids be re-floated. So far, no call has been taken on the redevelopment project, even though STC has threatened to move the high court against the government if the project is taken away from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ensure-social-distancing-is-followed-in-revamp-plan-dharavii-locals-to-state/story-8xdmIIwyqlxsLDjpbydlgL.html

16-08-2020||Mumbai||Taxi drivers struggle to earn their living||City’s transport operations have taken a major hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, and taxi, autorickshaw and app-based cab drivers have faced the most hardship during this period.Public transport services were suspended in the city after the announcement of the nationwide lockdown on March 23. Later on June 6, certain services resumed with restrictions under the state government’s Mission Begin Again. As part of the relaxation, black and yellow taxis, autorickshaws and app-based cabs services are presently allowed to operate only for emergency travel along with a restriction on number of passengers. Meanwhile, due to the complete suspension of autorickshaw, taxi and private cabs for almost three months and the slow business after the relaxations, drivers continue to face a deepening financial crisis. When Hindustan Times spoke to drivers in the city, they said they were struggling to survive. Dharamveer Gupta, a 30-year-old Santacruz resident, has been driving an autorickshaw for the past five years. However, Gupta, along with his family, had to leave Mumbai on May 22 and take a shramik special train to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh, after facing severe financial crisis due to the suspension of autorickshaw services in the city. “The situation was not easy at all. Even to board shramik trains, we had to wait for over six hours in a queue outside the station but could not board the train,” said Gupta. Gupta arrived back in Mumbai on June 10, but he has been struggling to repay vehicle loans and earn a living. “There are no passengers. We are waiting for hours in order to get a single passenger. The day’s earning is hardly ₹300 as opposed around ₹1,000 that we used to make before. Banks are also troubling us to repay our loans. The condition is really bad and there has been no relief from the government,” he said. Another autorickshaw driver, Pankaj Tej Bahadur, 40, was lucky to leave the city a day before the nationwide lockdown was imposed, but he hasn’t returned to the city since then. Singh, who is currently in Azamgarh, has exhausted all his savings and wants to return to Mumbai soon. “People had started discussing that there will be a countrywide lockdown. I did not have any money saved, so I decided to leave on March 22. I was lucky that I did not have to face what a lot of migrant workers faced. I did odd jobs in my village and also did farming. My savings are exhausted now. I will return to Mumbai soon, but I’m not able to get a railway ticket,” said Singh. Mahindra Nath Chaurasiya, 50, has been driving a black and yellow taxi in the city from 1996. He said, “The business of black and yellow taxis depend on the opening of garments, fruits and vegetable markets. Everything is mostly closed, and it is nearly impossible to get passengers. I have not seen anything like this before. The cost of compressed natural gas (CNG) has also increased in the city, which makes it more difficult for drivers.” The condition of mobile application-based cab drivers is the same. Vijay M, who works with a mobile application-based cab aggregator service, has stopped logging in. “The condition is tough for mobile app-based cab drivers. I started driving cabs as I enjoy driving, but now sustaining in the business is quite difficult. I had logged in after the cab services resumed and did not get a single passenger for hours. This is the situation of almost all the drivers. The ones who do opt for rides mostly visit hospitals, which is an added safety concern,” said Vijay. Autorickshaw and taxi unions in the city have stated that many drivers survived on free food distributed by non-government organisations during lockdown. “The drivers who stayed back in the city found it extremely difficult to manage three meals a day. Many drivers survived on free food that was distributed. Majority of the drivers had no money saved with them as they generally send it to their hometowns,” said KK Tiwari, leader of Swabhiman Mumbai Taxi and Rickshaw Union. Taxi and auto unions have demanded waiver of vehicle loans for drivers as well as monetary relief for the period of lockdown but, they said, they have not got any response from the government. “There has been no response from the government to provide monetary relief to drivers. We are aware that drivers are facing financial crisis and have approached the government for waiving vehicle loans. We will be sending another reminder to the government next week,” said AL Quadros, leader of Mumbai Taximen’s union. Transport department officials have stated that discussions with unions are going on. “We have met the unions along with regional transport officers and are deciding different measures that can be undertaken for road transport and the drivers,” said an official from the department, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/taxi-drivers-struggle-to-earn-their-living/story-fLUrJIM4jMoBTZOapPMLlN.html

Starting August 5, BMC imposed a 20% water cut in the city, owing to the meagre rainfall in the catchment areas. When asked about withdrawing the water cut, Chahal said, “We will certainly re-examine this.” The seven lakes that supply water to Mumbai have a total of 75.96% useful water content as on Sunday morning, up from the 60.17% useful water content as of Thursday morning, and 50.53% last Sunday morning. By this time in 2019, the lakes had 93.69% useful water content. The present useful water content of 10,99,445 million litres (ML) will be sufficient to supply water to Mumbai for at least seven months or more.On August 5, when the 20% water cut was imposed, the seven lakes had 37.36% useful water content or 5,39,307 million litres of water, as opposed to the same time in 2019, when the lakes had the lakes had 89.96% useful water content.Sachin Sawant, Congress spokesperson tweeted on Sunday morning: “On my request, BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, assured that Mumbai’s water cut will be withdrawn, and water supply will be restored [to previous quantity].” On August 14, Sawant had urged BMC to withdraw the water cut due to the nearing festival season, and Ganesh festival.BMC supplies 3,850 million litres per day (MLD), against a demand of 4,200 MLD. After the 20% water cut, BMC has been supplying 3,080 MLD to Mumbai.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems – the Vaitarna system which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-review-20-water-cut-in-city-bmc-chief/story-MLAjqpjeFcBQLqnS39LdOO.html

His three unidentified accomplices are at large.In his complaint to the Daresi police, Manpreet Singh of Guru Nanak Nagar stated that on July 10 the accused lured his father Joginder Singh, who runs a grocery store, into investing Rs 25 lakh in a Ponzi scheme. On July 17, Sham Lal called his father from an unknown number, claiming that he was arrested by the CIA staff of the Chandigarh Police and he will also be arrested if they failed to pay them Rs 6 lakh. To arrange the money, his father had to sell his car, Singh alleged. Later, Sham Lal’s accomplice posed as a policeman and collected the money. But, finding something amiss, Singh followed the “cop” and noticed that he went to Sham Lal’s house in Kabir Nagar. Therefore, he filed a police complaint. ASI Om Parkash, who is investigating the case, said a case under Sections 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against the accused at the Daresi police station.

16-08-2020||Mumbai||FYJC minority quota merit list out; arts cut-offs rise||Several prominent minority colleges in the city have declared the first merit list for admissions under the minority quota for first-year junior college (FYJC) on Saturday. Arts seemed to be a popular stream among top scorers this year as colleges recorded a considerably high cut-off for the stream as compared to science and commerce. At St Xavier’s College in Fort, the cut off for art stream for Christian minority students went up from 84% in 2019 to 85% this year. The cut-off for science at the college saw a marginal dip as compared to 2019. At Bandra’s St Andrews College, the cut-off for arts went up from 75.8% in 2019 to 78.8% this year. Even the science stream cut-off at the college increased substantially from 74.4% last year to 80.4% this year. The commerce stream cut-off, however, saw a marginal dip of less than 1%. “One can see that the demand for arts has increased amongst top scorers. This has been the case over the last few years. We are, however, surprised to see an increase in the science stream and a marginal dip in the commerce stream which was known to be popular for several years,” said Marie Fernandes, principal, St Andrews College. Many other minority colleges will declare their first merit list for the minority quota in the coming days. Mithibai College in Vile Parle will declare its first list for the Gujarati quota on today (August 17). This year, there will be a zero-contact admission process for FYJC, considering the current Covid-19 situation. As a result, admissions under various quotas like management, in-house and minority are to be completed at the junior college level by August 22. Officials in the state education department said that to make the process of zero round (quota admissions) simple, student data has been shared with junior colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-minority-quota-merit-list-out-arts-cut-offs-rise/story-5mrLl4xi4BphaJZ4ajT1jM.html
16-08-2020||City||Palghar lynching case: 9 juveniles get bail||The Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) Bhiwandi on Friday granted bail to nine of the 11 tribals, accused in the Palghar lynching case, after the state criminal investigation department (CID) failed to file the final report within the stipulated 90 days.The parents of the nine minors, through their lawyer, sought bail for them on the ground that the CID had no evidence against them, hence the minors were in illegal detention. The CID was unable to gather any evidence against the minors in the lynching and subsequent mob violence case. Hence, the presiding officer of the JJB granted them bail. On April 16, Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushilgiri Maharaj, 35, and Nilesh Telgade, 30, were killed when a mob of locals attacked them at Gadhchinchale, approximately 140 kilometres from Mumbai. The trio was on their way to Surat and Telgade had been driving the car. Five police personnel were also injured in the attack. According to CID, the lynching was caused by rumours that were circulated using Whatsapp, which warned against a group of organ and child traffickers passing through the area. The gathered mob had mistaken the two travellers and their driver to be the traffickers.Earlier last week,10 accused, against whom the charge sheet was not filed within the stipulated 90 days, were granted default bail by the Dahanu sessions court. They will be released on a personal surety bond of ₹30,000 each, and are likely to walk out of prison this week.The state CID took over the probe from the Kasa police and had arrested 11 minors, aged between 12 to 17 years. Nine of them were arrested on April 18, while two others were nabbed a few weeks later. They were all sent to the Bhiwandi Children Remand Home by the Dahanu court. The CID had strong evidence against two minors and had filed a final report against them with the JJB on August 7. Earlier, the Dahanu court judicial magistrate MV Jawale had granted default bail to the 28 accused, as the CID is yet to collect evidence against them. “We had the right to apply for default bail, as it was a clear case of illegal detention and all the accused were in judicial custody. They were lodged in Thane, Taloja, Palghar, Boisar and Wada jails, for more than 90 days,” said Amrut Adhikari, counsel for the accused. “However, only 10 accused will be released on bail as the other 18 accused are named in the third charge sheet, which includes names of 47 accused, filed by the CID on August 6,” said Adhikari. So far 226 witnesses have been examined and 808 suspects were detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-case-9-juveniles-get-bail/story-HL0UzI9KVErPNfzjVxVkVO.html
16-08-2020||Gurugram||HSIIDC submits plan to auction plots in Manesar to reimburse claims||The Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation ( HSIIDC) has submitted a plan in the Supreme Court for settlement of third party claims and development of land in Manesar. This, officials said, will pave the way for setting claims of over 3,500 home buyers and plot owners, who were stuck after the Supreme Court vested the ownership of land with the government agency instead of the builders from whom they had purchased the property. The Supreme Court in March, 2018 had scrapped the acquisition of land by Haryana government and subsequent land deals of around 700 acres carried out by developers, but it had vested ownership of the land with HSIIDC and HSVP. Subsequently, around 3,600 buyers had submitted claims for refunds or possession of flats and plots to the HSIIDC. To resolve the claims of these buyers, the industrial agency on August 14 submitted plans whereby it has said that allottees seeking refund of their money shall be reimbursed within three months from the date permission is given by enforcement directorate, which is investigating this matter. The authority also stated in the affidavit submitted to the court that the sites, which don’t have third party claims, would be put on auction by September 30. “The auction purchaser will be given shortest possible time to develop the project and handover possession to allottees,” it said. The plan said the properties which fall vacant after payment of refunds will be put on auction and an average price will be discovered at which the rest of the buyers will be offered properties. In case of land, which is vacant but has third party claims, the claims will be settled after approval from enforcement directorate. In lands which have construction, site shall be auctioned and new developer shall be asked to offer developed plots to claimants seeking possession. The unlicensed land shall be planned, developed and sold in phase wise manner. Priya Sardhana, general manager, HSIIDC, Manesar said that their objective is to settle the claims of the buyers at the earliest. “We are trying our best to ensure that claims of the buyers are settled and they get their money or properties,” she said. The homebuyers, however, said they were not impressed by the proposal submitted by the authority as there was no timeline/deadline for the development and possession handover which could would mean another cycle of endless wait once construction starts.“HSIIDC wants to offer homes at current market price, which could be double or triple the price committed to by the builder ten years ago. Buyers bought their floors for Rs 30-35 lakhs, but under the new scheme it might cost them up to Rs 60 lakhs. We are not happy with this proposal and the authorities need to come out with a plan that is buyer friendly instead of trying to profit at their cost,” said Naresh Jindal, president, ABW Manesar Allottee Welfare Society.The acquisition notice of around 700 acres of land was issued by Haryana government in 2004. The land deals were carried out between 2004 and 2007 but these were challenged by land owners in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsiidc-submits-plan-to-auction-plots-in-manesar-to-reimburse-claims/story-FqUaQZLsCiKhdeqZuHvBwM.html

16-08-2020||Chandigarh||Land pooling policy amendment to speed up acquisition process in Mohali||To speed up the land acquisition process, the Punjab government has decided to give additional land as compensation to those giving up their property voluntarily for development projects, with a notification likely from the Punjab housing and urban development department soon. To make the land pooling policy (LPP) more attractive, the Punjab cabinet earlier approved amendments in rules related to the residential sector, extending it to the industrial sector under the jurisdiction of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). The move comes as GMADA gears up to acquire 1,680 acres of land in the first phase of developing the Aerotropolis estate. The policy change is also expected to facilitate the development of the industrial estate in Sectors 101 and 103 in Mohali. What land owners will getAccording to the amendment, 1,000 square yards of developed residential plots and 200 sq yards of commercial plots, excluding parking, will be given instead of cash compensation for every 1 acre of land acquired from land owners for the upcoming Aerotropolis Residential Estate. Owners will get 1,100 sq yards of industrial plots and 200 sq yards of developed commercial plot, excluding parking, for 1 acre of land. The validity of the ‘sahuliyat certificate’, also given to land owners opting for LPP and to provide benefits to them during purchase of equivalent value of land, will be counted from the date of which the plot is alloted to them.Stamp duty exemptionEarlier, the validity was for two years from the date of announcement of award. The certificate exempts owners from stamp duty and other benefits whey they buy agricultural land with the sale proceeds from the developed plots that they get under land pooling.The move is in response to land owners’ demands that the validity be applicable from the date on which they get physical possession of the plots on the grounds that land value can be assessed only when the basic infrastructure is in place. GMADA has acquired 4,484 acres of land from 2001 to 2017. Of this, 2145 acres has been acquired till date through LPP which was introduced in Punjab in 2008 and amended from time to time. The rationale behind introducing LPP was to reduce financial burden on GMADA, as the acquisition of land through cash compensation mode was fraught with the risk of enhancement of compensation by the courts apart from being a cumbersome and time consuming process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/land-pooling-policy-amendment-to-speed-up-acquisition-process-in-mohali/story-iqEb3LSrkAgDza5CjZiQ7M.html

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said FIRs through this medium will be registered within 24 hours, and complainants will be informed through e-mail and text message, adding that the cases will be registered automatically without any questions.The police chief added that this will reduce the grievances of the public who sometimes had to run from pillar to post to get their FIRs registered in such matters. In the last nine months, about 100 FIRs were registered under this scheme after receiving complaints via e-mails.In matrimonial disputes and fraud cases, FIRs will be registered only after preliminary inquiry to ascertain the facts, as is the current practice.However, if such complaints are still pending and no FIRs were lodged, complainants can send an e-mail.The e-mail must include the complainant’s name, father’s or husband’s name, address, email address, mobile number, place, date and time of the incident, and details of the accused (if any).The police had first launched the scheme on November 5, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-re-launch-hassle-free-fir-scheme-for-theft-snatching-cases/story-IbfKoHeEMLs9Ni4Vn15vaJ.html

Residents have placed branches around the road, while police have placed barricades. But, still it can cause a mishap due to poor visibility in rain or at night. Calls to authorities have gone in vain,” said Swadesh Talwar, president of the Sector 44-B RWA.Stating that it was a result of poor maintenance by contractors, president of the Sector 44-D RWA, VK Nirmal said, “There has been no maintenance or carpeting work for two years. When repairs are done, engineers are never present to oversee it, leaving poor workmanship ignored.”Administrator of a city-based cycling group, Cyclegiri, Akshit Passi said cycle tracks across the city were riddled with potholes, even the one right next to the Children’s Traffic Park in Sector 23. “When the administration is promoting cycling, it also needs to keep the cycle tracks in a good condition,” he said.Aware of the cave-in, area councillor Ravinder Kaur Gujral said he will visit the spot on Monday and ensure that it was repaired properly.While the cycle tracks are constructed and maintained by the engineering wing of the UT administration, this patch of land comes under the municipal corporation’s purview. A senior MC official said the repair was delayed due to Independence Day celebrations on Saturday, but the road will be fixed on Monday. “We haven’t examined this patch of road yet. But, some cycle tracks are built above pipelines. A leak there can cause the road to crumble,” said an official in the engineering department, not wishing to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gaping-hole-in-chandigarh-s-sector-34-44-cycle-track-invitation-to-tragedy/story-sPSpRsktPbDuR2tssuI9PI.html

So far around 200 pilgrims undertook the pilgrimage,” said an official of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board.The Vaishno Devi pilgrimage was stopped on March 18 as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In the first week, there shall be a cap of 2,000 pilgrims each day, of which 1,900 would be from Jammu and Kashmir and the remaining 100 from outside.“The situation will be reviewed thereafter and a decision will be taken accordingly. Only the pilgrims who have registered themselves online are being allowed to undertake the pilgrimage,” said Ramesh Kumar, CEO of the board.The pilgrims are required to install the Aarogya Setu App on their mobile phones before proceeding for the yatra. It will be mandatory for them to wear masks.Children below 10 years, pregnant women, persons with comorbidities and those above 60 years have been advised to avoid religious places for the time being.Kumar said that the yatra is being allowed to move in a unidirectional manner. “The pilgrims are directed to use traditional routes— from Katra to Bhawan via Banganga, Adhkuwari and Sanjichhat—to reach the shrine and Himkoti route-Tarakote Marg for their return journey,” he said.The pilgrims, coming from red zones, and outside Jammu and Kashmir would have to undergo Covid-19 test and only those pilgrims with negative reports will be allowed to move towards Bhawan.“Ponies, pithus and palkis will not be allowed to ply on the tracks, initially,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vaishno-devi-yatra-resumes-after-five-month-long-suspension/story-0dx0G70brpuqIQRhphNQrM.html

16-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: UGC’s decision on exams not a prudent move||Punjab chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh’s recent letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the directions of the University Grants Commission to its colleges and universities to complete the final examinations for exit classes by September 30 raises some valid points.The CM has said holding the exams will not be a wise move as Covid-19 cases could be peaking at that time, exposing the youngsters to risk of infections.Even if it does not postpone the dates, the UGC could explore options such as online tests – though this will not serve the interests of students from financially backward families – or grades based on assessments and previous performance.Postal services for delivery of question papers in open book mode and collection of answer sheets could be another avenue, a logistical nightmare by the looks of it, but possible if networks used by distance learning to mail lessons to students are tapped. This will take time and planning, but as the exit classes are a crucial stage in a student’s life, efforts should be made to complete the processes as quickly as possible. With the Joint Entrance Exams (advanced as well as main) and The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) scheduled for September, one will have to see how the logistics will be worked out by the National Testing Agency. Perhaps the UGC can take a cue from them.This is going to be an acid test for colleges and universities – smart thinking and planning will definitely help going forward. TEST CASEShould UGC roll back its decision on final exams by Sept 30?Is the UGC’s decision to complete final examinations for exit classes in colleges and universities by September 30 a prudent move?

That is our wish and that has been the vision of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.”Following a brief celebration at kashag, Sangay attended the district-level celebration of the Independence Day at the police ground, Dharamshala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/recognise-tibet-as-buffer-zone-between-india-china-sangay/story-grt617SyJs0MSA2SZ7FhRO.html
16-08-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Dhoni, the swashbuckler who led from The Front||A young wicketkeeper-batsman stood rather shyly amid a row of players being introduced to the chief guest on the opening day of a match of the JP Atray Memorial Cricket Tournament in Chandigarh in September 2004. His countenance and demeanour reflected a deferential attitude, that of one eager to learn. As luck would have it, at the end of that match, when he was to receive the man of the match award for having blasted several sixes and fours while hitting a tornado like century, the announcer forgot his name. Being a bit more aware of players on the fringes of the Indian cricket team, I whispered into the elderly gentleman’s ear, “Mahendra Singh Dhoni”.The fact that Dhoni shone like a beacon and blazed a glittering trail of success which had few parallels in the years to come is well known. But what is perhaps little known is the human being behind the megastar persona which was visible to all. By recounting a couple of other encounters that I had with ‘Mahi’, I will try to give some insight.On the sidelines of an IPL match several years later, I had occasion to visit Dhoni in his room along with the wide eyed kids of a colleague, who wanted pictures with him. Having obliged the youngsters with his trademark nonchalance, Dhoni returned to watching Lord Hanuman’s animated story on television, which is what he had been doing before we had barged in. The sheer childlike joy with which he lapped up the details of the delightful film, as we sat watching it with him, was clearly reflective of his utterly uncomplicated mindset.An even more telling encounter took place in October 2007, when Dhoni led India to an eight run victory over the mighty Australians in a One Day International at the picturesque Sector 16 Stadium in Chandigarh. I was to facilitate the press conference with the captain and the man of the match, and I rushed onto the ground to meet the skipper at the conclusion of the proceedings. “Come, MS, we will go this way!” I said, and began to escort him towards the hall, while simultaneously asking a team official: “Where’s the man of the match?” Dhoni could see the lighter side of the matter and knew that I had missed the announcement. “Sir, I did all the hard work and now you are asking about the man of the match!”Needless to say, I grinned sheepishly to realise that “Captain Marvellous” was also the player of the match! Many a chuckle followed, as we made our way to the presser.Dhoni’s greatest asset was his ability to control his emotions, as he himself put it many a time during the course of his captaincy stint for India. His cool as a cucumber visage would seldom be replaced by a worried look. Even when India did well or when he himself sparkled with the bat or gloves, he would never demonstrate uncontrollable glee. A substantial smile which swept across the breadth of his handsome face would be his only celebratory gesture. So level headed was he that even when he was hitting ferocious sixes early in his career, he knew the value of playing a long innings. He even began to try, at one point in his career, to score 16 runs with singles off his first 16 deliveries that he faced in ODIs. Only then would he pull out the sledgehammer blows, including the inimitable ‘helicopter shot’ which he had patented and perfected, much to the chagrin of bowlers.His technique as a keeper was not a purist’s delight but he never missed catches or stumpings. And his unorthodox manner at the batting crease meant that bowlers could never quite figure out his next move. Dhoni’s greatest moment came in the 2011 World Cup final when he led a star-studded team from the front and hit that memorable TV perfect six out of the Wankhede Stadium.So much had India fallen in love with Dhoni that his tragic run out in the World Cup semi final last year at Manchester broke our hearts. He will be sorely missed, but what will remain with us forever is his super coolness, nonpareil. vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-dhoni-the-swashbuckler-who-led-from-the-front/story-YFuyigUWrQfM4Ko2u4RKyM.html

These are proving particularly dangerous for commuters on two-wheelers and many of them could be seen slipping and falling. Jatin Singla, a resident of Sham Nagar, said, “On Friday, I was going to Chaura Bazar with my father who was sitting pillion. As we reached the bridge, I lost control of the bike and my father fell. Fortunately, I was going slowly and he did not suffer serious injuries. I think the municipal corporation is waiting for a tragedy to occur before swinging into action.” Kanwarjatinder Singh Bajwa, a resident of Deep Nagar, also had a similar grouse to share. He complained that the potholed and broken roads are adding to traffic jams. “The construction of the bride connecting old city to Ferozepur Road that began in 2016 is still awaiting completion and now the remaining ramp has also been damaged, further adding to the commuters’ miseries,” Bajwa said. Traffic expert Rahul Verma said accumulation of rainwater is the reason behind the potholes. “We face such issues every year as roads gets damaged due to the accumulation of water on the ramps around Jagraon Bridge. Proper drainage of rainwater is the only solution. I have spoken with the official concerned and it has been assured that the potholes will be filled soon,” Verma said. Apprised of the issue, superintending engineer (SE) Rahul Gagneja and mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the potholes will be filled soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jagraon-bridge-potholed-ramp-connecting-ferozepur-road-to-old-city-adding-to-residents-woes/story-83Ilzp4caGljO5ovJHudSM.html

After the discrepancy emerged, Sandhu has sought an explanation from the officials who had sought an additional Rs 44 lakh for the project on pretext of a design change. Confirming this, Sandhu said the officials have been asked to explain how the difference Rs 77 lakh arose. The mayor had faced sharp criticism recently when contractors of a construction company had halted work due to non-clearance of bills. The mayor had appointed two engineering students, one from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College and another from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to submit the report on the estimated cost on the project. As per the report, the project could have been completed at a cost of Rs 1.73 crore. As per sources, many of the MC officials who had sought approval for the additional Rs 44 lakh have been transferred. JAGRAON BRIDGE PROJECT: In July 2016, one side of the flyover was closed by railway authorities as it was declared unsafe for movement of vehicles. For two years, the project remained in limbo as railways refused to pool money for the construction. Finally, the Ludhiana MC handed over Rs 24.30 crore to the railway authorities. In 2018, construction of the bridge began. The deadline was June 30, 2019, which was then extended to December 2019. The MC took over the work in December end and attempts were made to complete it by March 2020. However, the lockdown was imposed the deadline for the project was pushed to June. That deadline was also missed and it was promised to be thrown open for commuter on August 15. Now, the civic authorities are claiming that the work will be completed by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/77-lakh-discrepancy-in-jagroan-bridge-project-ludhiana-mayor-serves-show-cause-notices-to-mc-officials/story-wjzkggHN9yf1WHVBeEgJMK.html
16-08-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University postpones senate elections, Goyal group cries foul||In view of the rising Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh, Panjab University has deferred the senate elections, scheduled to start on August 24, by two months. Vice-chancellor Raj Kumar’s order, announced by registrar Karamjeet Singh on Saturday, comes eight days before the elections of faculties from where six members are elected to the 91-member senate, the apex governing body of PU.The term of the present senate will end on October 31. Earlier, the varsity had consulted the UT administration over conducting the senate polls. “Consequent upon the advice conveyed by the adviser to the administrator, Chandigarh administration, the vice-chancellor in exercise of powers conferred under regulation 12.2, Chapter II-B, PU calendar volume-1, 2007, has postponed for the time being the dates of election of all constituencies with immediate effect for two months or till the MHA Covid-19 pandemic guidelines are revised and permission granted by the Chandigarh administration, whichever is earlier,” states the order issues by the university.PU’s senate election is headed for a two-cornered contest between the Goyal alliance, led by Ashok Goyal and Navdeep Goyal, and the BJP-DAV alliance. Both alliances had differing stances on the conduct of senate polls and had also written to PU chancellor Venkaiah Naidu about it.While the BJP-DAV alliance was pushing for the polls to be deferred, the Goyal side stood firm on holding them as per schedule.Senator Navdeep Goyal said, “They were losing and that is why wanted the polls to be postponed. They want to buy more time. We are working on our future strategy and have written to the vice-chancellor to share the basis of postponing the polls.”“All stakeholders should have been involved before taking a decision. I appeal to the university authorities to review their call and conduct the elections while following proper precautions. The democratic process must not be stalled,” said senator Rajat Sandhir, who is aligned with the Goyal group.On the other hand, senator Subhash Sharma, who leads the BJP group, said, “Nothing is more important than human life. Some of our fellows are senior citizens and do not want to vote amid the pandemic. We are happy with the postponement of elections. Now, everyone will get a fair chance to vote.”Senator Rabindra Nath Sharma said, “Except the registered graduate constituency, there seems to be no rationale in deferring the election of other constituencies. This has certainly dampened the democratic sentiment and process. The decision must be reviewed keeping in mind the democratic ethos and history of the university.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-postpones-senate-elections-goyal-group-cries-foul/story-GKJ7MFoAIkSxjfRXICxqDK.html
16-08-2020||Chandigarh||Mohali: Dilapidated roads leave residents of Sectors 76 to 80 a harried lot||The condition of roads in Sectors 76 to 80, Mohali, have gone from bad to worse as they are hardly motorable and full of potholes and uncovered manholes. In addition to certain engineering flaw, persistent neglect of authorities towards re-carpeting the roads after digging them for underground drainage work has added to the residents’ woes. Waterlogging caused by often-choked road gullies is another reason for residents’ disappointment. Even mild rainfall causes water to stagnate on the roads, making them slippery. The worst effected is dividing road of Sector 79 and 80, where multiple potholes can be seen. MP Singh, president of residents welfare and development committee, Sector 79, said the RWA has written to officials asking for roads to be repaired, but no action has been taken so far. It is not an isolated case, as condition of almost all roads in these sectors, especially interconnecting roads, are pitiable. “We have been pursuing the authorities for the past two years. Although it has been around four months since the tender for the work was floated, nothing has been done on ground so far,” said Sucha Singh Kalaur, president of plot allotment and development welfare committee, Sectors 76 to 80. Davinder Singh, chief engineer of GMADA, said, “We have already prepared the estimate for maintenance of the roads and hopefully, the work will begin in two weeks. Also, most of the time it is the negligent attitude of residents causing damage to roads, especially during the construction of houses, as they use the road to keep building material such like gravel and sand which ultimately chokes the road gullies”. Highlighting the resentment among residents, Major Singh, senior vice president of plot allotment and development welfare committee, Sectors 76 to 80, said, “Driving on these bumpy roads without slipping is not easy. Even after paying such hefty road tax, all roads are potholed and have uneven surfaces. It seems that the work was carried out halfheartedly.” The residents said that after repairing the water pipelines, no one cares to repair the roads that were dug up for repair and when officials were asked about the pits lying open around the water supply pipelines, an official on condition of anonymity said. “The pits have been left open for testing after the repair. We will fill them once we check the water leakage.” However, residents claim that the pits have been left open for many months and all such repairs are done in patches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-dilapidated-roads-leave-residents-of-sectors-76-to-80-a-harried-lot/story-ortCYliWREVD2OKRu3uLdP.html
16-08-2020||Chandigarh||Roundabout: ‘Our revels now are ended’||Condolences have come in from all over the country on the passing away of theatre doyen and art connoisseur Ebrahim Alkazi (18 October 1925 – 4 August 2020). However, what touched the heart was a Facebook post by Kumara Varma, who was schooled in theatre direction at the National School of Drama (NSD) and spent a lifetime in Chandigarh doing memorable plays and later heading the department of Indian theatre at Panjab University. Posting a black and white portrait of Alkazi, Varma quotes Shakespeare from The Tempest: “Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and, Are melted into air, into thin air.”Now settled in his home state of Kerala at Trichur, Varma says: “These are the lines that came to my mind when the news of Alkazi’s passing away came and one says with humble pride that whatever one learned was from him. He shaped modern Indian theatre and it was he who set the tradition of translating plays written in different regional languages all over the country and staging them in Hindustani. His repertoire was thus truly pan-Indian”.Legend of TughlaqWith this we come to the spectacular production of Girish Karnad’s Tughlaq, which was originally written in Kannada and translated for Alkazi by yet another brilliant director-musician of modern Indian theatre, late BV Karanth. Karnad was to say thus of Alkazi: “His fundamental contribution was to devise a methodology of theatre training which has continued after him, and to create a body of actors and directors which transformed the notion of theatre at the grassroots.” Interestingly, Alkazi first assigned Om Shivpuri to take up Tughlaq as a student production. Karnad was acknowledge that it was immaterial that these were only student productions: “Doors that we, in our vernaculars did not even know existed, had begun to open.” Karnad, who sourced his plays from myth and history, wrote Tughlaq in 1964, based on the maverick life of the 14th century Sultan of Delhi, Mohammad Bin Tughlaq.Alkazi as the founding director of NSD from 1962 to 1977, in those 15 years, directed to perfection many plays, yet his three definitive works to be staged in the backdrop of Delhi’s Purana Qila were Andha Yug, Razia Sultan and Tughlaq. The last which he first staged in 1962 is counted as one of the best productions the country saw in modern times is because it brought together some of the best talents of the country: Alkazi, Karanth, Karnad and of course the famous actor Manohar Singh, the Himachal boy who was groomed by his teacher to be one of the best actors on stage. Manohar was the first and only choice of Alkazi, who said: “Manohar had the aristocracy of spirit, nobility of soul and complete humility in understanding and enacting a role.” Varma, who played the junior guard recalls, “The play had passed from history into legend while it was still being enacted. Artiste Kamal Tewari recalling the magnificent and unparalleled performance of Manohar Singh, says: “I was included in the production playing one of the conspiring Ameers and I remember the slap Manohar Singh gave me sent me hurling some six feet away”. Veteran actor Rani Balbir Kaur adds, “I travelled a number of times till the play was active to see it and each time it was a great experience. What dialogue delivery by Manohar Singh! I first met Kumara Varma there playing the young guard to whom Manohar renders the famous speech ‘Umangon bhari umar hai, Khwab dekhne ki umar, Saare aalam ko jeetne ki umar’ (It is your age of exaltation, The time to indulge in dreams, The time to conquer the whole world)’.”Flash forward to 1980sIt was in the mid-1980s during a meeting with actor Meeta Vashisht, who one knows from her Chandigarh theatre days, at the NSD hostel. One got talking about Tughlaq. Meeta recounted that the boy students would down beer, strip off most of their clothing and recite the dialogues of Tughlaq till late at night. Not surprising for that’s how it was and is in boys’ hostels. The young ones were giving an irreverent tribute but a tribute nevertheless. At the same time they were practising dialogue delivery at its best. Yes, and as a friendly neighbourhood journalist one had the privilege of spending a few evenings with Manohar Singh who would pick up the play and recite some of the dialogues. I earned his wrath when I once dosed off a little in the middle of the renderings and he told me to get up, fix myself a drink, and carried on reciting. Such was the magic of Tughlaq, a political play that was written on the faultline of Nehruvian socialism, yet in such a manner that it reached out in its multilayered delineation to one and all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-our-revels-now-have-ended/story-eIo3uGkt9E0VvN9cb0uwKL.html

The association, which has more than 140 members across the state with prominent colleges and its principals, held a meeting on Saturday in this regard and sought cancellation of CET exams due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in rural areas of the state. “The admission process to private universities and out-of-state colleges has already started, but the private colleges affiliated to state universities are still waiting to start the admission process for its professional courses. Our demand is that CET exams should be cancelled for this academic year. If the state government has cancelled final-year exams giving students’ safety as the reason, then they should also shoulder the responsibility of safety of more than five lakh students who will appear for CET exams. Admission should be given on the basis of the Class 12 marks of the student this year,” said Ramdas Zol, president of the association. The results of the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams were declared late this year on July 16. Kailas Jadhav, a professor who is also fighting for this issue, alleges, “The real benefit in conducting the CET exams is for the private class’ owners as students prepare for these exams for months and private classes charge a high fee for it. So, if CET exam is cancelled, then, students will not join such classes and also seek a refund of their fees. So, all efforts are being taken to somehow conduct this exam, which is very risky for the lives of many students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/private-institutes-demand-cancellation-of-cet-exams-this-year/story-icJmcYbl7z4wNNbbFsWJUI.html

16-08-2020||City||Kinnow growers, traders worried over labour post-harvesting||Bathinda With uncertainty looming large over the availability of trained migrant workers for the kinnow season that starts from November, farmers say traders are hesitant to finalise a contract for wholesale purchase. A bumper crop is expected this time. Harvesting is done by farm workers from districts of Punjab and from Sriganganagar in Rajasthan, but the real worry for industry is labour of sorting, grading, waxing and packaging. For this, fruit growers in Abohar, the hub for kinnow cultivation in India, mostly rely upon workers from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh and workers from Gujarat and Bihar. The kinnow industry employs around 8,000 such workers. State award winning kinnow farmer Arvind Setia said workers from Azamgarh are experts in harvesting fruits like apple and kinnow, and each year they gather at Delhi’s Azadpur mandi, before proceeding for kinnow harvesting.“Workers come from Delhi to Abohar in trains. This season, planning has been hit due to pandemic restrictions. As overall climatic conditions remain friendly, we hope for a good yield. An organised plan is needed for workers’ safe movement to Abohar,” said Setia.Punjab leads the country in the cultivation of kinnow, with the Abohar belt of Fazilka district alone contributing up to 60% to the state’s total production. The fruit is cultivated on nearly 33,000 hectare in Punjab. Last season, the Abohar belt produced more than 5 lakh tonne of kinnow.Kinnow harvesting begins during Chhat Puja to meet the demand for unripe fruits in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and few other states. “As Chhat Puja this year will fall after November 15, we have time to start harvesting. Accommodating the large population of migrant workers amid covid threat is a challenge. Workers who come must be tested for covid-19,” said another farmer.Shivam Setia, a trader, says, “The grading machine sorts kinnows according to different sizes, but the process greatly requires human intervention. Maintaining social distancing at machines that are small in size and in places, where this equipment is installed will be a challenge.”Punjab Agri Export Corporation (PAEC) general manager Ranbir Singh said the state government was working on providing logistic support for kinnow growers. “PAEC has five common facilitation centres in Fazilka and Muktsar districts, whereas washing, grading and waxing will be done at 75 paise/kg. We will also provide packaging on demand-based orders from farmers. A newly-established facility in Abohar is equipped with a state-of-the-art features to process harvested kinnow. The plant has a capacity to handle 15-tonne fruit in an hour,” he added.A second-generation orchardist Sagar Kumar said taking service of PAEC would cause additional financial burden on farmers because as per the existing practice, from harvesting to packaging, it came as a contract with private firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kinnow-growers-traders-worried-over-labour-post-harvesting/story-awzF8aYaVcMaIiEXhT14yH.html

He added that party would not be cowed down by such repressive tactics. “We will continue to agitate to ensure justice is meted out to the victims of the hooch tragedy.”Sukhbir also questioned the double standards of the Congress government on protests. He alleged that while no action was taken against Congress leaders and workers when they held any protest, the government went out of its way to target Akali workers. Former deputy CM added that junior officers were being targeted, while former Tarn Taran SSP Dhruv Dahiya who did not take action against the liquor mafia despite complaints has been rewarded with a plum posting. Sukhbir added that besides action against liquor mafia and Congressmen who were running the racket, strict action must also be taken against distilleries from where denatured spirit was released to the mafia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/repression-can-t-stop-our-protests-against-liquor-mafia-sukhbir/story-a4Dpzuy1B7EBdaZHjJOyTJ.html

The syndicate is the highest decision-making body of a varsity, and the meeting will be held online. With the university yet to take a call on findings of inquiry reports related to allegations of corruption, nepotism and misuse of funds during 2007-2017, the state higher education department had given repeated directions to the varsity to hold a syndicate meeting at the earliest. The delay in holding the meeting has delayed action against officials and employees indicted in these reports. A varsity official said they are under immense pressure from state government to decide and fix responsibility in these inquiry reports. The last syndicate meeting, in which administrative issues were taken up, was held on August 21, 2019, under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor (V-C) professor BS Ghuman. The varsity has circulated a 250-odd page agenda for the meeting, prominently including discussions to decide key inquiry reports pending for the past two years. “The point related to inquiry reports has been prominently listed. It has been specifically mentioned that these reports were opened in the last meeting in 2019. Detailed discussion will be carried to finally decide on these reports. Among other agendas are promotions of teachers, approvals for recent appointments and other administrative decisions,” an official said.Punjab higher education secretary Rahul Bhandari, who is also a member of syndicate, said the agenda will be thoroughly discussed and taken to logical conclusion.“In addition, discussion will be carried out on administrative matters for the betterment of the financial situation of the university,” he said. The V-C could not be contacted.14 PROBES ORDERED IN APR 2017Following the resignation of former V-C Dr Jaspal Singh in March 2017, the then secretary of higher education, Anurag Verma, was appointed the officiating V-C. Verma had received complaints on irregularities in the university’s functioning from 2007 to 2017. These included allegations of nepotism, corruption, and bungling of funds in the examination branch, among other issues.On the basis of these complaints, Verma had ordered 14 internal inquiries in April 2017. The sealed reports of these inquiries were handed over to incumbent V-C prof Ghuman in December 2017. The V-C had formed a two-member committee, comprising former IAS officer Jagjit Puri and former IPS officer VK Kapoor, to investigate these internal inquiry reports. The panel had submitted its sealed findings to the university in July 2018, but no action has resulted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-a-year-punjabi-varsity-syndicate-meets-today-to-decide-on-inquiry-reports/story-M1pZEz3DOarWoN5LpC6o0H.html
16-08-2020||Pune||Rohit Pawar seeks reopening of temples in Maharashtra||Rohit Pawar, a legislator from Jamkhed in Ahmednagar and grandnephew of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar, has demanded the state government to reopen temples across Maharashtra. Rohit on Sunday said that many livelihoods are dependent on these temples, which have been closed since March 22 after the lockdown was announced to contain the spread of Covid-19. “I think that temples and religious places should be opened. There are many people whose livelihoods are dependent on these religious places. I will, therefore, follow-up on this issue,” tweeted Rohit in a response to another tweet by citizen who cited how traders in Tuljapur had been facing difficulties due to closure of the temple there. Despite growing demand, the state government has taken a call not to reopen religious places in light of the prevailing Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra, which accounts for almost 24 per cent of the overall positive cases with 41 per cent fatalities in India. Maharashtra’s coronavirus case tally increased to 5,84,754 on Saturday and the death toll due to the pandemic rose to 19,749, the state health department said.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that Rohit Pawar, being a public representative, has responded to a demand made by the common citizens. “As public representative, one has to listen and respond to what people feel and demand. The government on the other hand has to look into every aspect, including the safety of people during a situation like this,” said Malik. When asked about NCP’s stand on the issue, Malik said, if there is demand from people, the party will accordingly take a stand. “After all, we are here to serve the people.” Earlier this week, the government informed Bombay High Court that temples cannot be opened. The Bombay High Court division bench, comprising justices SJ Kathawalla and Madhav Jamdar was hearing on petitions by Ankit Jain and a Jain temple trust. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also previously demanded reopening of temples in the state, a move Shiv Sena termed as “dual stand” saying that the Centre had decided to cancel Amarnath Yatra while the party’s state unit had been seeking reopening of religious places. A section of the Shiv Sena also has asked for opening up of religious places. Anand Dave, spokesperson of the party and member of Akhil Bharatiya Brahmin Mahasangh met home minister Anil Deshmukh last week and demanded reopening of temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/rohit-pawar-seeks-reopening-of-temples-in-maharashtra/story-MhVluCPo2frzm1e4XK2waP.html

16-08-2020||Pune||Father donates a portion of his liver to daughter, saves her life||A father donated 300 grams of his liver to save his 5-year old daughter’s life at the Jupiter hospital, Baner on Friday. The Pune region has seen only 21 organ donors in 2020, compared to 63 in the same duration last year. A 10-hour long liver transplant surgery conducted by an experienced team of surgeons helped Shubhra, who was suffering from a liver disease since birth. Before the surgery, a Covid-19 test was conducted on both father and daughter who tested negative. “Shubra was suffering from biliary atresia, a condition in which there is a failure of development of bile ducts in the liver at birth. The children suffering from this condition develop jaundice. She underwent a corrective procedure at birth known as Kasai’s procedure, said Dr Kalpesh Patil, a paediatric surgeon. Kasai’s procedure is performed for children suffering from biliary atresia if diagnosed within three months of birth. However, 80 per cent of children need a liver transplant in the future. In biliary atresia, there is a failure of development of the bile ducts of the liver. During Kasai’s procedure, the diseased bile ducts are removed and the intestines are joined directly to the liver. “Around 30 per cent of children will need transplant for biliary atresia before one year of age and 80 per cent children with biliary atresia will need a transplant by 20 years of age,” said Dr Gaurav Chaubal, who headed the team of doctors during the surgery. “The liver transplantation in children is often very challenging as they have very small blood vessels which need to be connected to the new liver and the operation is technically challenging,” added Dr Chaubal. Shubra’s father donated a part of his liver to his child. All necessary testing and diagnostic procedures were carried out and the transplant was performed on July 4. The transplanted liver began working straight away. At the end of the surgery, the recipient was stable and shifted out to the intensive care unit for further care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/father-donates-a-portion-of-his-liver-to-daughter-saves-her-life/story-T5km3FJ21xXU1OK16PK3ZJ.html

16-08-2020||Chandigarh||HP police ask govt to sack teachers involved in POCSO cases||To ensure safety of children, the Himachal Pradesh police have recommended that the state government sack teachers who have cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act registered against them. According to government data, about nine teachers involved in POCSO cases in various schools across the state had been suspended in 2019. Even as director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu, a 1989 batch Indian Police Service officer, had accorded top priority to safety of women and children when he joined office in May, the government had announced a slew of measures for protection of children against sexual crime in schools. A proposal to install close circuit cameras in classes fell through halfway though police in the last two months took various initiatives to generate awareness of crimes against women. Services of teachers involved in sexual offences against children should be terminated at the earliest. If not acted upon promptly, these perpetrators can find more opportunities to prey on young students, Kundu said.He had also introduced a new register, 26, in police stations to track crimes against women and children. The police also stressed on the need for routine meetings between the DGP and additional chief secretary, social justice and women’s empowerment to chalk out joint action plans and strategies to curb such crimes.Monthly meetings between the deputy inspector general of police (crime) and director, women and child development to coordinate issues between the two departments were also suggested. “They would act as nodal officers for their departments to take forward the joint annual action plan and take other necessary steps to address crimes against women and children,” added Kundu . Other proposals included involving anganwadi workers and women police workers to flag such crimes as a study had highlighted that in the majority of such cases perpetrators were known to the victim or were family members or relatives. The study revealed that financial empowerment had not impacted crimes against women as last year 358 cases of rape were registered in the state where 50% were abusers within the family. What was more astonishing was that the studies revealed that 300 abusers were acquaintances of the victims. It was also learnt that an increasing number of cybercrime cases were being reported against women and married women were more likely to be victims of crimes, especially domestic violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-police-ask-govt-to-sack-teachers-involved-in-pocso-cases/story-eON3GKN3uCzjRLT1r0i5IJ.html

16-08-2020||Bangalore||Completely ban corporate funding of elections: S M Krishna||Veteran politician and former External Affairs Minister S M Krishna has called for a “complete and total” ban on corporate funding of polls, saying there is a need to end political corruption and cleanse the electoral system in the country.The root of administrative corruption lies in political corruption, and the root of political corruption lies in electoral corruption, said Krishna, who has seen electoral politics from close quarters for over five decades. “We first need to cleanse the electoral system. The process is going on here and there. There have been some reforms which are just in the initial stages”, the former Karnataka Chief Minister told PTI.“But I am happy that there is no political corruption at the top in the Centre. There is not a single allegation of corruption or nepotism. The Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) himself is absolutely and impeccably clean and honest. This is a very big positive development”, he said.“Slowly, things will fall in its place. A situation will arise where people will choose candidates on the basis of the performance of the party in the government and in the opposition”, the former Maharashtra Governor said.Krishna, who joined BJP over three years ago after more than 45 years’ association with the Congress, said electoral reforms need to pick up pace and we must think of bringing in public funding of elections and a complete and total ban on private funding, which means funding from corporate companies. “It is a long way to go, but I am confident that we will have clean politics. If we have to see the emergence of clean politics, electoral reforms are a must.Unless money power is eradicated, there cannot be clean politics. My emphasis is for the eradication of money power, which is the first step we have to take”, he said.Secondly, appealing for votes on communal and caste basis during elections must become a penal offence, the 88-year-old leader added.Asked if he thought there should be a retirement age for politicians, Krishna said politics is not a government job to fix retirement age.With age comes maturity, knowledge and experience, the BJP leader said, adding, Morarji Desai became Prime Minister at the age of 81, and he did a fantastic job.“Suppose, hypothetically speaking, if he (Desai) had retired at the age of 60 of 65, then the country would have been deprived of such a sagacious leadership”, Krishna said.Atal Behari Vajpayee became Prime Minister at the age of 74, and he did a fantastic job. L K Advani became Home Minister at the age of 71 and he did a wonderful job, he said.“But at the same time, it is also essential...that the youngsters must be given opportunity”.There should be a blend of age and youth; maturity and initial starters. Elders should not be totally discarded, but their knowledge and experience must be utilised to groom the younger generation, Krishna said.“It is like what we say in Kannada; ‘Old Roots and New Leaves”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/completely-ban-corporate-funding-of-elections-s-m-krishna/story-y2oFeCgJLN1krBqBkk4LtN.html

16-08-2020||Mumbai||Sanjay Raut takes dig at Centre with Russian Covid-19 vaccine example||In a dig at the Narendra Modi government over its push for self-reliance, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said Russia gave the first lesson to the world on being ‘Aatmanirbhar’ by introducing a Covid-19 vaccine while India has just been preaching about it.Lauding Russia for the vaccine, Raut, in his weekly column ‘Rokhtokh’ in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, said this was a sign of being a superpower, and added that Indian politicians will not follow Russia’s example as a model since “they are in love with America”.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageRussian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday announced that his country has developed the world’s first vaccine against Covid-19 that works “quite effectively” and forms a “stable immunity” against the deadly disease, as he disclosed that one of his daughters has already been vaccinated.“When there was a movement across the globe to prove the Russian vaccine as illegal, Putin used the vaccine as a trial on his daughter and created self-confidence in his own country,” Raut said.“Russia gave the first lesson of being ‘Aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) to the world. We are just preaching about being ‘Aatmanirbhar’,” the executive editor of ‘Saamana’ said.Noting that Ram temple trust head Mahant Nritya Gopal Das has tested positive for coronavirus, Raut sought to know if Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who shook hands with Das during the temple’s ground-breaking function in Ayodhya (on August 5), will quarantine himself.Former President Pranab Mukherjee, who has tested positive of coronavirus, is in a critical condition and ministers and bureaucrats in the Modi government have also tested positive for the viral infection, he pointed out.“Delhi (the national capital) was never under such terror like it is now due to the coronavirus. There was fear of Modi and (Home Minister Amit) Shah earlier, but the fear of corona is more than that,” he said.The Rajya Sabha member claimed Delhi has “come to a standstill” and that this is serious.“The official unemployment figure has been put at 14 crore. But those running the country have no work. Political workers have become lazy because there are no political agitations. Opposition parties have become cold,” he said.There are no political meetings or functions in Delhi now. Even the Independence Day function preparations weren’t there. “Like in Mumbai, there is fear of coronavirus everywhere in Delhi,” he said.

He had not covered his face with the mask. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat came in contact with the Mahant. PM Modi held the hand of Nritya Gopal Das with reverence. So will our PM will also be quarantined,” the editorial in the Saamna questioned?“At present, Amit Shah is also in solitude after contracting the infection. Even former president Pranab Mukherjee has been tested positive for the virus and his health is also in a worrisome state. At present, all cabinet members, bureaucrats, parliament members are vulnerable to falling prey to the lethal infection. Even during riots and war, Delhi was not so frightened as it is today. The city seems to be a bit more scared now. Although the fear of PM Modi and Shah was already mongering, but the trepidation fear of coronavirus is more appalling.”On August 5, Nritya Gopal Das was the part of the Ram Mandir bhoomi pujan in Ayodhya and shared the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and a few others.This landmark event was attended by 175 guests who were invited by the trust headed by Nritya Gopal Das.Apart from heavy security arrangements, Covid-19 protocols and social distancing norms were abided by the people present at the gala event.Due to the coronavirus outbreak, no chief ministers except Yogi Adityanath was invited for the groundbreaking ceremony.Notably, Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik had sought invitation for Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray stating that the late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackery was at the forefront in insisting and wanted the Ram temple built.Sarnaik had also stated that Uddhav had repeatedly taken a lead in the demand for the Ram Mandir and hence should be invited for the ‘bhoomi pujan.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-questions-quarantine-rules-for-pm-modi-after-ram-temple-trust-head-tests-covid-19-positive/story-aQL9YRPbfk87Ym4lqpFLHJ.html
16-08-2020||Patna||Chirag Paswan stops short of withdrawing support to Nitish, but hints at more action||Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan on Saturday hardened his stance against the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar but stopped short of announcing the much speculated withdrawal of support to the ruling dispensation in the state.Paswan, who was addressing workers at the state party headquarters here after unfurling the tricolor on Independence Day, however, hinted that some action on the withdrawal of support was likely in the near future as he was planning to convene a meeting of the LJP parliamentary board.Party sources said that Chirag in his rousing speech debunked speculations of his breaking ranks with the BJP-led NDA stressing that LJP’s loyalty to Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “deeper” than that of JD(U) helmed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.The Jamui MP, who is on his first tour of Bihar in several months, arrived here on Friday evening and is expected to stay for the next two-three days, party sources said here.Paswan, who took over last year as the national president of the party founded by his father and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, underscored that LJP has been consistent and steadfast in its support to the NDA government at the Centre on various issues unlike the JD(U) which had been equivocal on matters like abrogation of Article 370 and more recently, the CAA-NPR-NRC debate.Defending his attacks on the Bihar government on issues ranging from corruption, law and order, economic development and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the LJP chief pointed out that Kumars bid to seek re-election for a fourth consecutive term on the basis of a 15 years versus 15 years narrative was deeply flawed.He pointed out that Kumar was trying to equate Lalu Prasads RJD with lawlessness and bad governance not taking account of the fact that he was sharing power with the latter till not more than three years ago.He also asserted that unlike LJP, which joined the NDA in 2014 expressing full faith in the leadership of Narendra Modi, Kumar had thrown a fit when his then Gujarat counterpart emerged as a potential prime ministerial candidate, snapped years old ties with BJP and gravitated towards the opposition camp.Paswan iterated that it was beyond doubt that Bihar lagged behind most states on development parameters notwithstanding Kumars claim that the state has turned the corner in 15 years of his rule.He asked the LJP rank and file to continue going to the people with the truth, no matter how harsh it may be and claimed that economic advancement witnessed in the state in the last few years was due to the Centres bounty.The LJP chiefs run-in with the government in the state began in March this year when he embarked on a ‘Bihar First Bihari First’ campaign which was viewed with suspicion by the JD(U).Relationship between the two parties had taken a nosedive in the subsequent months with the LJP chief taking potshots at the JD(U) government over its handling of Covid-19, the migrants crisis that followed the lockdown and the insistence on holding assembly elections, scheduled in October-November, on time despite the raging pandemic.Paswan has repeatedly stated that his party was supporting but not a part of the government in the state an allusion to the LJP having no representation in the states council of ministers after his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras got elected to the Lok Sabha.Kumars reported reluctance to part with a number of seats for the LJP that was commensurate with its performance in the Lok Sabha polls last year is also said to have riled Paswan.LJP had contested six seats in the state in the Lok Sabha polls and had won all. The JD(U) had fought 17 and had won all but one.In the 243-strong assembly, the LJP has only two MLAs.An announcement of withdrawal of support by LJP will not reduce the government in Bihar to a minority though it could be a poor reflection on the NDA in the state which stood rock solid in the general elections a year ago, decimated the opposition and appears invincible in the face of a divided opposition.Intriguingly, the BJP has been maintaining a telling silence over the squabble among its two alliance partners in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/chirag-paswan-stops-short-of-withdrawing-support-to-nitish-but-hints-at-more-action/story-097ol9JqYmnm73eNCBAOlO.html

16-08-2020||Mumbai||KEM, Nair hospitals of Mumbai get nod for phase 2-3 Oxford vaccine trials||The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) granted approval to two civic-run hospitals in Mumbai — King Edward Memorial (KEM), Parel, and BYL Nair Hospitals, Mumbai Central — for phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of Oxford-AstraZeneca, a promising vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). By August-end, the trial on 320 volunteers between the age group of 20 and 50 years will begin. At present, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is looking for volunteers to participate in the trial. A total of 10 medical institutes have been selected for the pan-India vaccine trial, of which two are from Mumbai. According to sources, BJ Medical College in Pune has also been selected for clinical trials. The two Mumbai hospitals are waiting for a final nod from the state’s ethical committee to begin the trial. “Each of the two hospitals will perform the trial on a group of 160 volunteers. These individuals have to be healthy, without any severe premedical ailments. They shouldn’t be on any immunosuppressants or undergoing other lifetime treatment,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.All volunteers will be tested for Covid-19 through rapid antigen test (RAT). Also, they will be examined for Covid-19 antibodies to check if they were ever exposed to the infection in the past and recovered. “The trial will include volunteers from all strata of society in various age groups. This will include people residing both in slums and non-slums,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM.Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume, and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZenecam have partnered to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been named as Covidshield in India. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Oxford vaccine candidate is on in the United Kingdom, Phase 3 in Brazil and Phase 1 and 2 in South Africa.“Phase 1 of the trial was completed in July in UK, which has received a promising response. This will be the phase 2 and 3 trial of the vaccine. After the completion of phase 2 trial, reports will be submitted to the Data Safety Monitoring Board, then to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization for stage 3 of the trial,” said Dr Deshmukh.In the earlier trials, volunteers who were injected with two doses of the vaccine induced a strong immune response. It provoked a T-cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the coronavirus) response within 14 days of vaccination, and an antibody response within 28 days. The study was published in the science journal, Lancet.“It is a proud moment for us as Mumbai is the only city where civic-run hospitals have been given permission to run the trial. In other cities, only government-run hospitals have been granted the opportunity,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kem-nair-hospitals-get-nod-for-phase-2-3-oxford-vaccine-trials/story-rRumGlhRVMP0NqvaJZK5HM.html

Of the 322 fatalities reported on Saturday, 226 deaths were from the past 48 hours, 53 from past week and remaining from the period before it. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stood at 3.38%.State’s recovery rate dropped below 70%, standing at 69.82%, from 70.77 on Thursday, as 6,844 more patients recovered on Saturday, taking the total number of recovered patients to 408,286. The active patients in the state are 156,409. State has 10,44,974 people under home quarantine, while 37, 524 are institutionally quarantined.Maharashtra conducted 66,429 tests in the past 24 hours and found 12,614 positive at a positivity rate of 18.98%. In some of the districts and civic bodies like Malegaon, Solapur, Kolhapur, Jalgaon, a sudden spike in cases was witnessed after a drop for a few weeks. A few experts termed it as a second wave. “It is a second wave, as the antibodies developed against the virus decrease and end in about four months. In some areas like Dharavi, more than 50% patients have found antibodies developed against viruses, but those may not remain for long. Rise in cases in some parts of the state is an indication of a second wave in some parts of the state,” said Neeraj Hatekar, Mumbai University economist, who has been studying the trend on a daily basis.Dr Amol Annadate, who was closely associated with administration in Malegaon in Nashik said that the relapse of rising number of cases may be called as the next stage. “The rise in the number of cases in Malegaon and other cities that had witnessed drop in the case earlier is because of the complacency. This can be called as next stage or even second wave. There is no social distancing or other norms of self-hygiene followed, leading to a rise in cases,” he said.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the 11-member task force, constituted by the state for the clinical management of critical patients, said the peak is owing to the aggressive and ramped up testing in the state. “State is at its peak and there could be a modulating pattern for the next few days in infections. I would not say it is a second wave, but we should be very careful to avoid any such wave. We can arrive at a specific conclusion about the peak only if the pattern sustains for a couple of weeks,” he said. Thackeray said on Saturday in an online interaction with an organisation of doctors that the state is planning a 500-bed hospital in Mumbai for immunology and virology research and similar hospitals in all the districts. He said that the state is also using satellite-based telemedicine technology to treat patients in remote areas of the state. He said that government authorities have been asked to not be complacent with the drop in the cases as it could lead to the second wave. “After relaxations from the lockdown, there have been sudden spike in the cases again. US recently saw 97,000 new cases after they open schools. I do not want it to happen here. I have been telling the authorities, including in Mumbai, to keep a vigilant eye to ensure that there is no second wave in the state,” he said. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the rise in Covid-19 cases in rural areas was a cause for concern. “The rise in cases is because of the migrants coming back from cities like Mumbai,” he said. Tope has also warned private doctors with action if they did not come forward to offer their services. As part of the Mission Begin Again, the state government is expected to roll out more relaxations from the ongoing lockdown curbs. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said in Chandrapur on Saturday that the state government was positive on allowing inter-district state transport services and a formal decision is expected to be taken next week. He said that the state government is also positive about allowing coaching classes to operate by following standard operating procedure. The minister said that the state government was also positive about resumption of local train services for Mumbai. Wadettwiar on Saturday said, “In our meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and attended by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar recently, we have discussed resuming inter-district ST buses. Honourable chief minister is positive about it. We may issue a formal notification and the norms to follow including the number of passengers. The decision is expected next week. Similarly, for the convenience of students from ordinary families who do not have online education easily available, we are considering allowing operations of coaching classes. They too will have to follow the SOP on the lines of one for the gymnasium,” he said. The minister said that it is being also considered if the schools in the rural areas can be opened.Wadettiwar had said on Friday that the state government has taken the decision of allowing gymnasiums to operate by following social-distancing norms. He said that the decision has been taken by the state government and the notification in this respect is expected to be issued in a couple of days. The announcement had come after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded for reopening of gymnasiums with immediate effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-tally-rises-to-584-754-state-wary-of-2nd-wave/story-dK8N6NbP9889LodDpPzlwM.html

The department officials said that they are personally appearing before court in cases where stay had been granted to apprise it of the ground situation. In the last six months, large-scale demolition drives have been carried out across the city. “The department teams have carried out surveys in unauthorised areas as well as licensed colonies and a demolition plan has been prepared. Sealing will also be carried out in cases of violations of building plan rules,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram, adding that it has also been decided that CM Window complaints lodged by residents with enforcement wing have also been divided areawise and these will resolved based on the area in which demolition drives are carried out. Around 100 such complaints have been lodged by city residents and these pertain to building plan violations, maintenance and similar such issues, said officials. “It has been observed that a large number of violations have been carried out on small plots of 60 sq yard, which were meant for underprivileged section. Large building of five to six storeys have come up and these would now be on our radar so that future violations don’t happen,” said Bhath, adding that the department officials are now personally appearing in cases to explain the actual ground situation in the courts. In last six months, the department has carried out over 50 demolition drives in unauthorised colonies, licensed private colonies to check mushrooming of illegal constructions and violations. However, the efforts made by DTCP were being offset by the continuous registration of small plots in controlled areas of the district in violation of rules, which promoted unauthorised colonization, said officials of the department. However, with the recent ban on registeries and action against revenue officials it is being expected that flow of such registries will be curbed. “The government plans to introduce a foolproof process of registration and this will definitely help in controlling unauthorised registries of small plots,” said Bhath.In last one year, it is estimated that more than 100 illegal colonies have come up in the city due to illegal colonization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-to-carry-out-demolition-drive-from-monday-in-residential-colonies/story-Q7zXB5IViEgQYXTXsypTtN.html
16-08-2020||Delhi||Schools won’t reopen till Covid is beaten: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said schools in the national Capital will not reopen until the Covid-19 situation is completely under control. The CM made the announcement in his address during the Delhi government’s Independence Day celebrations, which were curtailed this year due to the pandemic and were held at the Secretariat at ITO instead of the Chhatrasal Stadium. Addressing cabinet ministers, legislators, officials and the seven corona warriors, who were special invitees at the Delhi government’s Independence Day function, the chief minister talked about the ‘Delhi Model’ and emphasised how aggressive testing, home isolation and plasma therapy were the game-changers in the Capital’s fight against Covid-19.“In June, many people had started leaving Delhi because Covid-19 had spread widely in the city. But in just a few weeks, the two crore people of Delhi controlled the situation with their resolve, hard work and dedication. Though the situation is much better than two months ago, we still have a long way to go. We have not won the battle yet,” Kejriwal said during his Independence Day speech. He thanked all stakeholders, including the Central government, the corona warriors and various organisations.“When I meet parents, they all request only one thing—that schools should not reopen yet. We care for your children as much as you do. I want to assure all parents that we will not reopen schools in Delhi until we are fully convinced (about the city’s Covid-19 situation),” Kejriwal said.Unlike previous years when the Delhi government’s independence day function was held at the Chhatrasal Stadium, this time, owing to the pandemic, it was organised at the Delhi secretariat at ITO. Fewer people were invited due to restriction on large gatherings. The chief minister also announced that from next week the Delhi government will start sending oxygen concentrators to the homes of Covid-19 patients even if they have recovered from the disease. “These days we are hearing about cases where a Covid-19 patient tests negative, is declared recovered and is discharged from the hospital. But, within hours or a day or two, suddenly the person’s oxygen concentration decreases and the person dies. To prevent this, from next week we will be sending oxygen concentrators to all those who need it,” he said. Kejriwal had on June 22 announced the same while launching the scheme of distributing pulse oximeters to all Covid-19 patients under home isolation. Officials said while distribution of pulse oximeters has started, the oxygen concentrator drive could not take off in full swing due to some “technical issues”. While adding that the subsidies on water, electricity and bus rides for women will continue, he also talked about reviving the economy by consulting with traders and entrepreneurs.He also highlighted how the Delhi government managed to reduce air pollution, an annual crisis in Delhi during the winter months, and deaths caused by dengue and other mosquito borne diseases during the monsoon. The CM announced re-launching of Delhi government’s ‘10 Hafte-10 Baje-10 Minute’ (10 weeks-10’O clock-10 minutes) programme to check cases of dengue and other monsoon diseases. The drive was first launched in September last year. The campaign, Kejriwal said will be launched again from the first week of September during which people would be encouraged to inspect their homes for stagnant water to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. Before his formal speech, Kejriwal shared a video message in which he urged people to take three pledges. “First, today take the pledge that neither will you give nor accept bribe. Second, pledge against pollution. Do not contribute to pollution - be it air, water or land. Third, keep your city and environment clean. Do not litter,” he said. Talking about the many firsts which the Capital has seen during the pandemic, Kejriwal said Delhi was the first to introduce the home isolation model in India which further helped in scaling up testing. Another first was starting the plasma therapy through which more than 750 people have recovered, he said.“The Delhi government is the first government in the country to have reduced the price of diesel by Rs 8 straightaway. I think this will also affect the inflation rate and help push the economy forward… Our’s is also the only government to announce an assistance of Rs 1 crore on the death of a Corona warrior. There is no monetary value attached to the lives of the people, they are invaluable to their families, but this gave the Corona warriors assurance that there is a government that takes care of them, and if they are working for the people of the country by risking their lives, the government is also working for them,” the chief minister said. During the ceremony, the government honoured seven people which included an assistant superintendent and three head warders. The corona warriors included additional district magistrate (Central) Rajeev Singh Parihar, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital’s senior medical officer Hirdesh Kumar, LNJP Hospital’s nursing officer Sonu, police constable Pradeep Chauhan, CATS ambulance driver Tej Bahadur, Civil Defence volunteer Dina Nath Yadav and municipal sanitation worker Ashok Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/schools-won-t-reopen-till-covid-is-beaten-kejriwal/story-zjD9G9PsrSVykiA7HsGspN.html

16-08-2020||Pune||Parth Pawar attends get-together at uncle’s residence in Baramati, maintains silence over next move||Upset over Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar’s public reprimand by calling him “immature”, his grandnephew Parth on Saturday visited Baramati for a “get-together” that lasted for several hours. Till late evening, the Pawar scion was at uncle Shrinivas Patil’s Baramati residence where his mother Sunetra Pawar and aunt Sharmila were also present. Parth’s father and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar were absent although he was in Pune earlier in the day to attend an Independence Day function. Both Parth and his father Ajit have maintained studied silence even as several other NCP leaders downplayed the episode saying “it’s just a family matter”. Messages and calls to Parth Pawar did not evoke any response. In the afternoon, a member of the family said, “Matter will end within two days” while Parth’s another paternal aunt Vijaya Patil earlier said that Parth is upset though he will forget everything in a few days.“Parth is young and sensitive. However, he will forget everything. After all Sharad Pawar is his grandfather,” Patil said in Kolhapur, indicating that all is well within Pawar family. Vijaya Patil is Ajit’s elder sister while Shrinivas is younger brother. Parth is reportedly unhappy with the way NCP chief publicly ticked him off over his demand for CBI probe into Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case, a clear deviation from the party line. Rejecting Parth’s demand, senior Pawar had said his grandnephew is “immature” and his views are “not worth a penny”. After rebuke from senior Pawar, Parth has been meeting family members for the past three days. Late on Friday evening, Parth met Ajit Pawar’s cousin Abhijit Pawar at latter’s bungalow in Baner while on Thursday, he visited Silver Oak, Sharad Pawar’s residence in south Mumbai. At Silver Oak, Parth could not meet senior Pawar though he had over two-hour long discussion with paternal aunt Supriya Sule. Reacting over Parth being upset, senior party leader Praful said the entire issue is not as important as being “portrayed” by the media. “Since Sharad Pawar has already spoken, the matter is over,” said Patel. Another NCP leader and Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Parth is my friend and I am confident he will not take any other step. This is not at all a big issue.” This is not the first time that there have been indications of rift within the Pawar family. Earlier, when NCP chief was reluctant to offer a party ticket to Parth to contest the Lok Sabha polls, the Pawar scion forced his grandfather to reverse decision. After the assembly polls last year, Ajit Pawar had defied party line and joined hands with BJP to become deputy chief minister in Devendra Fadnavis government that lasted for three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/parth-attends-get-together-at-uncle-s-residence-in-baramati-maintains-silence-over-next-move/story-Ng7v7nhEMPYK3ZeFyDRHnN.html
16-08-2020||Pune||Flyers slurp immunity booster drinks at Pune airport||After domestic flights have resumed operations, there has been an upward rise in flyers preferring immunity booster drinks from our traditional kitchens, including haldi doodh (turmeric milk), kadha, soup, rasam and all types of tea. These drinks are believed to improve immunity and are now in high demand as Covid-19 pandemic has hit the world. Pune airport is known for its affordable drinks including tea for just Rs 10 and with the drinks priced at just Rs 50 per glass, for both economic or business class, flyers now prefer to drink these immunity boosters. Most of these drinks have been introduced for the first time after the domestic flights started operating since May 25 this year after being under lockdown for two months. Pune airport has a dedicated lounge, ‘Earth Lounge’ for flyers located inside the airport premises. Ranjan Swain, unit manager for the lounge said, “We have started certain immunity booster drinks after certain passengers enquired about it and now the demand is good. Although, air traffic has gone down substantially and so has the number of passengers. However, with those limited passengers we have had a good response to these drinks. The most popular beverages earlier were tea or coffee which has now been replaced with turmeric milk, kadha, soup, rasam and all types of tea.” Swain also added that social distancing norms and sanitizers at all points are kept for easy access at the lounge. The alcohol counter which is another favourite beverage for flyers at all airports usually has been shut for now as per government orders. In view of Covid-19, people prefer these ‘immunity boosters’ as opposed to the always favourite tea and coffee, these drinks are not being chosen by flyers in huge numbers. Javed Shaikh, a frequent flyer said, “There are some great immunity boosting items on the menu and they are really tasty too. I really appreciate their efforts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/flyers-slurp-immunity-booster-drinks-at-pune-airport/story-JcQgCNbGUYKRUvqFaL69YN.html
16-08-2020||Pune||Increased screen time hurting children’s eyes||City doctors are warning parents of the dangers of increased screen time on their children’s eyes due to online classes and restrictions on outdoor sports due to the Covid pandemic. The screen exposure time which was earlier close to about 30 minutes to two hours has now been extended to about seven to eight hours. Doctors have warned that this could lead to children getting spectacles due to constant exposure, while kids have already started complaining about refractive errors, redness, dryness, itchiness and sore eyes. Dr Sanjay Patil, ophthalmologist, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, said that there is a 30 per cent increase in children visiting him with complaints like excessive strain on eyes or tiredness. “Patients have complained about dryness or itching in eyes, or tired eyes too. Locked up inside homes and online classes running for hours, homework and other assignments are taking a heavy toll on kids and their eyes,” said Patil. Dr Mangesh Lingayat, head of paediatrics department, Noble hospital, said, “I have observed that kids come complaining about UV complications and upon further inspection, we get to know that they need spectacles. These are accidental findings.” Dr Hemant Todkar, consultant ophthalmologist, Apollo Spectra Hospital, said that he has till now attended around 120 cases since June and two out of every ten cases are related to eyes. “Due to the constant rubbing of eyes, the cornea of children may become thin and result in progressive permanent loss of vision. Moreover, rubbing puts added pressure on the eyes owing to which refractive error that is astigmatism occurs. Astigmatism is a blurred vision caused by an unusually shaped cornea and one will require spectacles. These children are given lubricants or artificial tears to avoid itchiness, dryness of the cornea, and permanent changes in corneal structure,” said Todkar. Dr Tushar Parikh, consultant, paediatrics and neonatology, Motherhood Hospital, said, “People of all ages blink far less often when concentrating on a screen. Prolonged periods of watching the screen and spending more time indoors have been associated with the development of near-sightedness (myopia). Activities on the ground are not only important from the physical fitness point, but also from eye health. Also, environmental light helps in retina development.” Advice on eye protection -Good nutrition that includes food rich in vitamins C and E, zinc, lutein, zeaxanthin, and omega-3 fatty acids, proper sleep, and reducing electronic gadget exposure of children from the age group of 0-17 for two-and-a-half hours every day. -Limit screen time and stick to it. Keep a gap of an hour between the end of the screen and sleep. This will help you get a sound sleep. · Dim the screens of all devices, which should limit the amount of the blue light coming through. Try not to use devices in the darkroom. · Using your electronic devices outdoors can be even more harmful because the UV radiation from the sun reflects from your smartphone or tablet screen directly onto your face, doubling the impact of dangerous light radiation. · Encourage your child to engage more in outdoor sports. · Make sure the screen is positioned so that your child looks slightly down at it, not up. And adjust the lighting to eliminate glare on the screen. · Make sure you get your child’s eyes examined by an ophthalmologist. All children should undergo routine eye check-up at 1 year and another at preschool at 4 to 5 years. -Allow children to pursue hobbies of their choices instead of accessing electronic gadgets. Educate children regarding the ill-effects of continuous exposure to the blue light emitted from the gadgets. Exercise · Establish screen-free zones. No smartphone usage for anyone in the family, in the car, or while dining. Parents should make sure that children do not use mobile or any other devices while having meals. Opt for a digital detox and take time free from electronic gadgets. · 20-20-20 rule: When using a computer or other screens, make sure after 20 minutes look away to more than 20 ft distance for more than 20 seconds.

Pawar took a review of the rural parts of Pune district on Friday when elected members raised concerns about the increasing cases in their areas. Minister Dilip Walse-Patil, Datta Bharne, MP Supriya Sule and Amol Kolhe sought more focus in rural areas as these areas do not have enough medical facilities like urban areas. During the meeting, Pawar instructed the civic body to purchase 50,000 rapid antigen kits for more testing. He even instructed the administration to bring maximum private hospitals in rural areas under the Mahatma Phule Jan Aarogya scheme. These tests kits will be only for rural areas as 1 lakh kits had already been purchased by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the city region. “We have started the rapid antigen kit procurement process under the district plan and kits will be purchased very soon as instructed by the guardian minister. I spoke to Sudhakar Shinde who is the state director of the Mahatma Phule Scheme and have requested him to bring 52 private hospitals from Pune rural under the ambit of the scheme,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. As a special case, within the next two-three days, these 52 hospitals will come under the ambit of the state health scheme and citizens will not need to pay bills for Covid treatment. As per Pune divisional commissioner, rural areas in Pune are likely to witness a surge in virus cases by next month. Rao said, “The situation is becoming alarming in rural areas and complaints started coming in that patients are not getting admission at some hospitals. Considering these complaints, the Pune city administration is launching a central hospital allotment system in rural areas.”Capacity building of ventilators and beds in rural areaPune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has said that the administration is building the health infrastructure in Pune rural area. “We got 50 ventilators from the Tata trust and of it, 26 are functional in rural areas,” he said. The guardian minister has allowed MLAs and MLCs to use their development funds to purchase medical equipment. The equipment purchased under this scheme has be utilised in the MLA’s assembly constituency only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/50k-rapid-antigen-kits-for-rural-areas-of-pune-district-after-rise-in-cases/story-vTWUPHBjLqrS4aiSd2BS9L.html
16-08-2020||World||Netanyahu says UAE deal signals end to ‘land for peace’||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that a deal to establish full diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates proves that Israel doesn’t need to retreat from occupied land sought by the Palestinians in order to achieve peace and normalization with Arab states.Israel and the UAE announced Thursday they were establishing full diplomatic relations in a U.S.-brokered deal that required Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has insisted the annexation plans are only on “temporary hold” at the request of the United States.The UAE, like most of the Arab world, long rejected official diplomatic ties with Israel, saying recognition should only come in return for concessions in peace talks. Its accord with Israel breaks that long-held tenet and could usher in agreements with other Arab states, undermining an Arab consensus that was a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.“According to the Palestinians, and to many others in the world who agreed with them, peace can’t be reached without conceding to the Palestinians’ demands, including uprooting settlements, dividing Jerusalem and withdrawal to 1967 lines,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. “No more. This concept of ‘peace through withdrawal and weakness’ has passed from the world.”The Palestinians want the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for their hoped-for state, and peacemaking with them since the 1990s has been based on withdrawal from those lands to make way for a Palestinian homeland. Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Mideast war, although it withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005.But what has been a wall of Arab support for the Palestinians and their demands has begun to crack in recent years, in large part because of the shared enmity of Israel and other Arab states toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region.The Palestinians bristled at Netanyahu’s remarks.“Peace should be established on the basis of the Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital. This is the Arab and international consensus and anything else has no value,” said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.Netanyahu also reiterated Sunday his interpretation of the UAE deal: that annexation was only being suspended and that it was still on the table, so long as it was done in coordination with Washington. UAE officials have indicated that the deal means annexation has been shelved entirely.After President Donald Trump released his Mideast plan earlier this year, which was favorable to Israel, Netanyahu said he would forge ahead with annexing parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu backed away from moving forward with annexation last month in the face of fierce international opposition and misgivings by White House officials.But Netanyahu, who has seen his popularity plummet over his handling of the coronavirus crisis, has faced searing criticism from settler leaders and their representatives in parliament over the annexation backtrack, and he has tried to reassure them that he remains committed to the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-says-uae-deal-signals-end-to-land-for-peace/story-brjiZeUDctQgozYkQdcpsL.html
16-08-2020||World||White House’s Meadows says he accepts Kamala Harris eligible for VP||White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Sunday he accepts that Sen. Kamala Harris is eligible to serve as vice president, rejecting a false and racist conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump had promoted.“Sure,” said Meadows, when asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” whether he acknowledges the fact that she meets the constitutional requirements to be president or vice president. “And I think the president spoke to this yesterday. This is not something that we’re going to pursue.”Trump twice this past week declined to say whether he believed she met the requirements when asked about social media claims that the California senator and former presidential candidate couldn’t serve in the White House because her parents were immigrants to the United States.Trump initially said Thursday that he had just heard the claim and had “no idea if that’s right,” but that the charge was serious and he would look into it. Pressed again Saturday to accept her eligibility, Trump demurred, saying at a news conference at his New Jersey golf club that it didn’t bother him but he had “not got into it in great detail.”Harris is without question eligible for the office.Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California, making her a natural-born U.S. citizen and eligible to be president if Biden were unable to serve a full term. Her father, an economist from Jamaica, and her mother, a cancer researcher from India, met at the University of California, Berkeley, as graduate students.The Constitution requires a vice president to meet the eligibility requirements to be president. That includes being a natural-born U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old and a resident in the U.S. for at least 14 years — all criteria that Harris fulfills.When asked about Trump’s promotion of the conspiracy theory about her, Harris said in an interview released Sunday that she and Biden fully expect Trump and his campaign to engage in “lies” and “deception” in a bid to beat Democrats in the Nov. 3 election.“They’re going to engage in an attempt to distract from the real issues that are impacting the American people,” she told TheGrio. “And I expect that they will engage in dirty tactics. And this is going to be a knockdown, drag-out. And we’re ready.”Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket. Trump in past years indulged in the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born abroad. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.Jason Miller, a Trump campaign adviser, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that the campaign would not be promoting the conspiracy theory.“This is something that the media brings up to him in his press conferences or interview formats,” he said. “It’s not something that anyone in our campaign is talking about.”“It’s case closed. End of story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-s-meadows-says-he-accepts-kamala-harris-eligible-for-vp/story-D1kbUOLx1e3M1tganFSBhK.html
16-08-2020||World||At least 18 shot, with 4 dead, across Cincinnati, say police||At least 18 people were shot, including four killed, as gunfire erupted in several places around the city overnight, authorities said Sunday.Officers responded just after 12:30 am Sunday to the Avondale neighborhood and found 21-year-old Antonio Blair with gunshot wounds, police said in a statement. He was taken to University Hospital and died there, they said. Three other gunshot victims were also taken to the hospital.At about 2:15 am, officers responded to a report of gunfire in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood where 10 people were shot, police said. One died at the scene and another at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center; they were identified in a statement as 34-year-old Robert Rogers and 30-year-old Jaquiez Grant.Three people were shot at about midnight Saturday in the Walnut Hills neighbourhood, about a block away from the Harriet Beecher Stowe house, police said.News outlets reported the shootings took place within 60 to 90 minutes of each other, but Assistant Police Chief Paul Neudigate told reporters that they “seem to be separate independent incidents but horrific and tragic.”Police didn’t immediately provide details about the fourth fatal shooting but confirmed that it occurred on the city’s West End, where television news reports indicated that one person was shot later Sunday morning and was pronounced dead at the scene.No suspect information was immediately available in any of the cases.“One extremely violent night in the city of Cincinnati. Looking at possibly 17 victims, up to four that could be fatal at this time. Why? That’s going to be the question,” Neudigate had said before the fourth shooting was announced.Cincinnati’s police chief later Sunday called the level of violence “unacceptable.”“I am calling on all citizens of this great city to say enough is enough! We must not sit by silently and say we can’t do anything to end gun violence,” Chief Eliot Isaac said in a statement. “We all have a moral obligation to stop the violence and stop the killing in our communities.”Police said the department would shift officers from other assignments to beef up the number of uniformed officers in the affected communities and would call on federal prosecutors and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “to focus on repeat shooters and aggressively bring illegal gun charges.”Mayor John Cranley called it “senseless gun violence that ruined lives and will cause immeasurable suffering” at a time the city was facing “unprecedented circumstances and challenges” in fighting crime during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the city has seen an uptick as people gather in private homes and public places when the bars close.“Guns are far too prevalent at these gatherings. Please do not attend gatherings because you could end up as an innocent victim,” he said in a statement.He stressed, however, that those firing were responsible for the shootings — which he called “attempted or actual murder” — and vowed to bring them to justice.“I am also calling on everyone to help put an end this culture of resolving personal disputes with guns as well as to reduce the far too prevalent availability of illegal guns on our streets,” he said. “The very sad reality is people are getting in trouble when they have nowhere to go and nothing to do.”In July, the Enquirer reported that the city had experienced a rise in shootings and homicides from gun violence during the first half of the year as compared to the same time period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-at-least-18-shot-with-4-dead-across-cincinnati/story-Q3BzhKTZMBoAG85q0IlWjJ.html
16-08-2020||World||Telephone service begins between UAE and Israel amid deal||Telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel began working Sunday as the two countries opened diplomatic ties.Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and cellular phones.Officials in Israel and the UAE did not immediately acknowledge the lines had begun working. They declined to immediately answer questions from the AP.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would play saying calls to the +972 country code could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, though these too were often interrupted. Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phone numbers, which the UAE could call.Also Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, like the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced Thursday they are establishing full diplomatic relations in a U.S.-brokered deal that required Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians.The historic deal delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/telephone-service-begins-between-uae-and-israel-amid-deal/story-iEx6DpZVt53gkk5dPbXWQP.html
16-08-2020||World||Trump says he is considering pardon for leaker Edward Snowden||US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is considering a pardon for Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency contractor - now living in Russia - whose spectacular leaks shook the US intelligence community in 2013.The Republican president’s comments followed an interview, Trump gave to the New York Post this week in which he said of Snowden that “there are a lot of people that think that he is not being treated fairly” by US law enforcement. “I’m going to start looking at it,” Trump told reporters about a possible pardon, speaking at a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club.US authorities for years have wanted Snowden returned to the United States to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.Snowden fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia after he leaked a trove of secret files in 2013 to news organizations that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the NSA.Snowden’s Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told RIA news agency the United States should not simply pardon him, but should drop all possible prosecutions against Snowden as he had not committed any crimes.“He was acting not only in the interest of the American citizens, but in the interest of all the humankind,” Kucherena said. Trump’s softening stance toward Snowden represents a sharp reversal. Shortly after the leaks, Trump expressed hostility toward Snowden, calling him “a spy who should be executed.”Trump said on Saturday he thinks Americans on both the political left and the right are divided on Snowden.“It seems to be a split decision,” Trump told reporters. “Many people think he should be somehow treated differently. And other people think he did very bad things.”Domestic spyingSome civil libertarians have praised Snowden for revealing the extraordinary scope of America’s digital espionage operations including domestic spying programs that senior US officials had publicly insisted did not exist.But such a move would horrify many in the US intelligence community, some of whose most important secrets were exposed. Trump has harshly criticized past leaders of the US intelligence community and FBI, and on Thursday took aim at the bureau’s current director Christopher Wray, his own appointee.The US Justice Department filed a lawsuit last September against Snowden, arguing that the memoir he published last year, “Permanent Record,” violated non-disclosure agreements.The Justice Department said Snowden published the book without submitting it to intelligence agencies for review, adding that speeches given by Snowden also violated nondisclosure agreements.Trump’s use of his executive clemency powers including pardons has often benefited allies and well-connected political figures.Last month he commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election to boost Trump’s candidacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-is-considering-pardon-for-leaker-edward-snowden/story-W4YnBYOXMoHR4lAi11r4EM.html

The company wasn’t identified.“We’ll really engage with Saudi scientists and the Saudi Health Ministry,” Dmitriev said. “We believe that Saudi will be a very strong partner for our joint work on the Sputnik V vaccine.”Earlier this month Russia approved a coronavirus shot before crucial tests have shown it’s safe and effective. The plan is to begin mass inoculation soon. A local association of multinational pharmaceutical companies has called the rushed regulatory approval risky.Russia also shared its data with the UAE and is expecting to start its trials there later in August, Dmitriev said. Additionally, it plans to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines and Brazil as well as at home, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-saudi-arabia-will-test-controversial-coronavirus-vaccine/story-y6WUmiwDhP4AJhv9QqwqaL.html
16-08-2020||World||US watchdog clears emergency use of new saliva test for faster detection of Covid-19||The US health watchdog has authorised the emergency use of a new and expensive saliva based laboratory diagnostic test for Covid-19 that could be a game changer in the diagnosis of the infection as it will enable rapid testing amongst more people easily.Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drugs Administration Commissioner, said the new saliva test would increase efficiency and avoid shortage of crucial test components like reagents.“Providing this type of flexibility for processing saliva samples to test for Covid-19 infection is groundbreaking in terms of efficiency and avoiding shortages of crucial test components like reagents,” he said in a statement.The agency has previously authorised four other tests that use saliva for sampling, but these yielded varying results. Authorisation of the new test occurs amid ongoing disarray over Covid-19 testing.The US has been plagued by an inconsistent strategy for detecting the virus, thanks in part to persistent shortages and the use of a variety of different tests that have sometimes yielded unreliable results.The new method called SalivaDirect is being further validated as a test for asymptomatic individuals through a programme that tests players and staff from the National Basketball Association (NBA).SalivaDirect is simpler, less expensive and less invasive than the traditional method for such testing known as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabbing.Results so far have found that SalivaDirect is highly sensitive and yields similar outcomes as NP swabbing. With the FDA’s emergency use authorisation, the testing method is immediately available to other diagnostic laboratories that want to start using the new test, which can be scaled up quickly for use across the nation and, perhaps, beyond — in the coming weeks, researchers said.A key component of SalivaDirect, the researchers note, is that the method has been validated with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors.This flexibility enables continued testing if some vendors encounter supply chain issues as experienced early in the pandemic.“This is a huge step forward to make testing more accessible,” said Chantal Vogels, a Yale postdoctoral fellow, who led the laboratory development and validation along with Doug Brackney, an adjunct assistant clinical professor.“This started off as an idea in our lab soon after we found saliva to be a promising sample type of the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and now it has the potential to be used on a large scale to help protect public health. We are delighted to make this contribution to the fight against coronavirus,” he said. Development of SalivaDirect as a means of rapidly expanding SARS-CoV-2 testing was spearheaded this spring by Nathan Grubaugh and Anne Wyllie, assistant professor and associate research scientist, respectively, at Yale School of Public Health.After finding saliva to be a promising sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, they wanted to improve the method further.“With saliva being quick and easy to collect, we realised it could be a game-changer in Covid-19 diagnostics,” said Wyllie.With testing urgently needed, the Yale team was determined to decrease both testing times and costs, to make testing widely accessible.“Wide-spread testing is critical for our control efforts. We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents and we expect that labs will only charge about USD 10 per sample. If cheap alternatives like SalivaDirect can be implemented across the country, we may finally get a handle on this pandemic, even before a vaccine,” said Grubaugh.Grubaugh and Wyllie said that they are not seeking to commercialise the method rather want the simplified testing method to help those most in need.Testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been a major stumbling block in the fight against the pandemic, with long delays and shortages of testing.Some experts have said that up to 4 million tests are needed per day and SalivaDirect provides one pathway toward that goal, the researchers said.“Using SalivaDirect, our lab can double our testing capacity,” said Professor Chen Liu, chair of Yale Pathology, who oversaw the clinical validation of the study. Globally, coronavirus has infected 20,950,402 people while the disease has killed so far 760,213 others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-watchdog-clears-emergency-use-of-new-saliva-test-for-faster-detection-of-covid-19/story-XfsDIZZtch4iv4LiJS1exH.html
16-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Italy produces 10% less garbage during lockdown||Italy produced 10% less garbage during its coronavirus lockdown, but environmentalists warn that increased reliance on disposable masks and packaging is imperiling efforts to curb single-use plastics that end up in oceans and seas.Italian researchers estimate that during the peak months of Italy’s lockdown in March and April, urban waste production fell by 500,000 tons. That decrease is enabling dumps in Italy — where trash collection in major cities has often become a hot-button political issue — to absorb the 300,000 tons of extra waste from protective masks and gloves estimated to be used this year, according to the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research.“Substantially, the figures will balance each other by the end of this year,” Valeria Frittelloni, the institute’s head of waste management and circular economy, told The Associated Press.But the pandemic dealt a blow to efforts to move away from single-use plastics in many places where they were just beginning to become mainstream. UN, Greenpeace, Italy’s Marevivo environmental organization and other such groups are warning that continued reliance on single-use plastics will pose longer-term risks to the environment.That’s particularly true for a country with a long coastline along the Mediterranean Sea, which is plagued by the tiny bits of broken-down plastic known as microplastics.“We don’t have an estimate yet of how much of those objects were dumped in the environment, but what is sure is that all those that have been abandoned sooner or later will reach the sea,” said Giuseppe Ungherese, head of anti-pollution campaigns at Greenpeace Italy.After years of reducing reliance on products like plastic bags and cutlery, in line with European Union directives, Italy saw a huge spike in plastic use during the coronavirus emergency. The Italian National Consortium for the Collection and Recycling of Plastic Packages said the increase in online shopping and its related packaging led to an 8% increase in plastic waste, even within an overall decrease in garbage production.Keiron Roberts, an environmental research fellow at the University of Portsmouth in England, said other countries saw similar demand for plastics and cardboard as a result of the so-called Amazon effect — referring to a surge in reliance on the internet retailer as people holed up to abide by stay-at-home orders. But he concurred that within Europe, Italy was in a particularly vulnerable spot.“Because you are surrounded by coastline, you just need to have some rain events that will wash these masks into the sewage system or into the rivers and the waterways and they will eventually make their ways into the ocean,” he said.“There’s no area of the Mediterranean now where plastic hasn’t impacted,” he added.Italy’s National Center for Research reported in 2018 that the presence of microplastics on surface seawater off Italy’s coasts was comparable to levels found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the collection of ocean debris that spans part of that ocean.Globally, the UN Environment Program has warned that the increased use of single-use plastics in protective equipment could lead to uncontrolled dumping and add to marine pollution, and it has urged countries to develop adequate disposal plans. The UN Trade body, UNCTAD, estimates that worldwide global sales of face masks alone will reach $166 billion this year, up from $800 million in 2019.Even before the Covid-19 crisis, only a quarter of Italy’s waste was recycled, with an estimated 53 kilotons of plastics leaking into the Mediterranean each year, according to the environmental group WWF.“Plastics and global warming are the main threats, and we need to act now to prevent our planet and sea from transforming into a hostile and unlivable environment,” said Greenpeace’s Ungherese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italy-produces-10-less-garbage-during-lockdown/story-LlmH9bw1q2Jy2kgLyNuNrM.html

Jun Kwang-hoon, a controversial pastor and an outspoken government critic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe health ministry said it will file a complaint against Jun later on Sunday, accusing him of violating self-isolation rules by participating in a rally on Saturday and “obstructing” epidemiological investigation by failing to submit a full list of church members for testing and tracing. Thousands of demonstrators took to the street on the Aug. 15 liberation day on Tuesday, protesting against President Moon Jae-in’s policies and defying a ban on rallies in the capital.The surge in Covid-19 cases prompted authorities on Sunday to reimpose tighter social distancing curbs, and President Moon warned of “stern and strong measures” against “some churches”, calling their behaviour an “unforgivable act that threatens public lives.” Jun’s church did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters seeking comment. Another Christian sect, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, was at the centre of the country’s largest outbreak of Covid-19 infections in February. The secretive group was linked to 36% of South Korea’s total cases, and on Aug.1, South Korean authorities arrested its founder, Lee Man-hee, for allegedly hiding crucial information from contact-tracers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-accuses-religious-sect-leader-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-2CjUcEaFCDPWUZNyzWFfNN.html
16-08-2020||World||Joe Biden says he will stand with India as it confronts ‘new threats’||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, on Saturday pledged closer ties with India and a better deal for Indian Americans in a short, policy-laden Independence Day message. He will stand with India in confronting “new threats its faces in its own region and along its own border”, he said.Kamala Harris, his running mate, struck a personal note. She spoke of her visits to “Madras” (as Chennai was called then), stories she heard from her grandfather of heroes of Indian independence and her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris’s efforts to instill in her “a love of good Idli”.Biden’s campaign had earlier in the day issued an expansive agenda on relations with India and the welfare of Indian Americans if he wins in November. The Biden administration will not allow China to threaten its neighbours with “impunity” and will have “no tolerance” for cross-border terrorism.Biden built on it in a pre-recorded message played at a virtual outreach to the Indian American community to celebrate Indian Independence Day. Recalling his leading efforts to ratify the civil nuclear deal in 2008 as a senator, he said he had held then that if India and the United States “became closer friends and partners, the world would be a safer place”“If elected president, I will continue to believe it,” he went on to say and added that he will “continue what I have long called for — including standing with India in confronting new threats it faces n its own region and along its border.”The former vice-president covered an entire range of issues for cooperation in the future, such as trade, climate change and public health. And also have “honest conversations on all issues as friends”, which is diplomatese for discussing disagreements and difficult issues.Biden spoke disapprovingly of rising hate crimes and crackdown on legal immigration in recent years — “the sudden and harmful actions on H-1B, which for decades made America stronger and brought our nations closer”.The expansive agenda, address by Biden and Harris, and the participation of senior members of the campaign -former deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken, former National Security Adviser to former vice-president Biden Jake Sullivan, speechwriter Vinay Reddy and Seema Sadanandan - was part of the campaign efforts to woo the 1.2 million Indian American voters who can help in closely fought swing states. Former US ambassador to India Rich Verma and former assistant secretary of state Nisha Biswal also participated in the discussions,Harris spoke largely in personal terms. She spoke of her grandfather P V Gopalan and grandmother Rajam, and the values that her mother Shyamala Gopalan learnt from them — “if you see injustice in the world you have an obligation to do something about it”.Growing up, Gopalan would take Harris and her sister Maya Harris to “what was then called Madras” so that they could understand where she came from and what was their ancestry. “And, of course, she wanted to instill in us a love of good Idli,” said the presumptive vice-presidential nominee.Harris has faced criticism among some Indian Americans — and a section of Indians — for not embracing her Indianness enough, and for projecting herself more Black. She wrote in her autobiography that she and her sister were raised by their mother to be “confident, proud black women”. On Saturday, Harris may have checked a few boxes for her critics as she spoke also of stories her grandfather told her about the heroes who were responsible India’s independence. “He would explain to us that it was on us to pick up where they left off,” she said, adding, “those lessons are a big reason why I am who I am today.”Blinken, who is expected a top portfolio in a Biden administration such as secretary of state or national security adviser, took the vice-president’s pledge of closer ties with India further and suggested that cooperation between the two countries should “extend even beyond the region to the world as large”.Blinken went to say the Biden administration will support a larger role for India in international institutions — including a permanent seat in a reformed UN security council. The US first extent support for India’s claim to a permanent during President Barack Obama’s first visit to India in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-he-will-stand-with-india-as-it-confronts-new-threats/story-tgVqo7xkJBiABMs5eDoYYI.html
16-08-2020||World||US: Sindhi community holds protest against enforced disappearances in Pakistan||Members of the Sindhi community organised a protest outside Pakistani ambassador’s house here in solidarity with families of the victims of enforced disappearances in Pakistan. The protesters on Friday chanted slogans for the freedom of victims of enforced disappearances in Sindh. They held placards with pictures of victims of enforced disappearances, according to a statement issued by Sindhi Foundation which organised the protest. Present in the protest were Sindhi, Baloch and Pakhtoon leaders, besides people from Gilgit Baltistan. The protesters demanded the release of all victims of enforced disappearances, especially teacher and scholar Sarang Joyo who was abducted from his house in Karachi on Tuesday. “I want to appreciate efforts of my sisters Aqsa Dayo, Shazia Chandio, Shabana Junejo, Sohni Joyo, Sindhu Joyo, Sorath Lohar and Sasui Lohar who have inspired all of us by leading the protests against victims of enforced disappearances for past many months,” said Sufi Laghari, executive director of Sindhi Foundation. He also appreciated the initiative taken by Sindhi Inam and said it is his struggle that has inspired “all of us to come out and protest against the enforced disappearances”. Laghari also mentioned that Taj Joyo, a Sindhi poet and writer who is father of Sarang Joyo has rejected to receive Presidential Performance Award from Pakistan. The protesters demanded an end to all enforced disappearances in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sindhi-community-holds-protest-against-enforced-disappearances-in-pakistan/story-w5GFJJQLi0xV12yQJfrDoJ.html

16-08-2020||World||US, South Korea to begin scaled-down drills amid Covid-19 spike||The United States and South Korea will begin their annual joint military exercises this week, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Sunday. But a spreading coronavirus outbreak has apparently forced the allies to scale back an already low-key training program mainly involving computer-simulated war scenarios.The drills from Tuesday to Aug. 28 could still irk North Korea, which portrays the allies’ training as invasion rehearsals and has threatened to abandon stalled nuclear talks if Washington persists with what it perceives as “hostile policies” toward Pyongyang.The exercises also come at a delicate time after President Donald Trump openly complained about the costs of maintaining 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea to protect against North Korean threats. The allies have so far failed to sign a new cost-sharing agreement after the last one expired at the end of 2019.The drills involve so-called combined command post training, which is focused on computerized simulations aimed at preparing the two militaries for various battle scenarios, such as a surprise North Korean attack.The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify how many troops will participate. But it’s clear the size would be smaller than the summer drills of previous years, which often involved tens of thousands of troops on both sides, and combined computer simulations with field training. This time, the coronavirus pandemic has limited the number of US troops who could be brought in from abroad.The US and South Korean militaries had canceled their springtime drills following a Covid-19 outbreak in the southern city of Daegu and nearby towns that was stabilized by April.But South Korea is now dealing with a virus resurgence in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan region, home to half of the country’s 51 million people. It forced US Forces Korea to designate the capital and surrounding areas off-limits to personnel who don’t live there. The 279 new cases South Korea reported on Sunday are the highest daily jump since early March.There have been around 150 Covid-19 infections among US troops stationed in South Korea since February, which prompted Gyeonggi Province near Seoul last month to openly call for the cancellation of the August drills. Gyeonggi includes the city of Pyeongtaek, the site of US military headquarters.The allies have downsized much of their combined training activity after Trump unilaterally suspended large-scale field training with South Korea after his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018. Trump then seemed to adopt North Korea’s traditional view of such drills, criticizing them as a “provocative” drain of money.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered since the collapse of Trump’s second meeting with Kim in February last year in Vietnam, where the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The North reacted to last year’s summertime drills by ramping up its short-range missile tests and unleashing verbal vitriol toward South Korea, which had lobbied hard to revive nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-south-korea-to-begin-scaled-down-drills-amid-covid-19-spike/story-MNJrmapVobhGdhdON8mLoN.html

In an interview with American news broadcaster PBS, Fauci said it shouldn’t take later than the start of the next year to get the vaccine. Fauci added that even half an effective vaccine would be good enough to bring the world back to normalcy within a year.Although President Donald Trump has said a vaccine may be ready by election day on November 3, Fauci is of the opinion that it may take until well into 2021 for shots to reach the general public.Also read: Covid-19 - Victoria extends state of emergency as deaths top 300On the Russian vaccine candidate, the expert said that just because there is a vaccine does not mean it should be administered to the public. “You need to be looking if a vaccine is safe and effective,” he told the PBS.Russia’s decision to approve a coronavirus shot before crucial tests have raised questions over its safety and efficacy, raising worries that politics will trump public health in the quest for a vaccine against the deadly contagion.Russia, however, has dismissed concerns about the vaccine, describing it as Western jealousy. President Vladimir Putin had vouched for its efficacy and said that one of his daughters has already been given the shot and felt better afterwards.The country plans to start mass inoculations as soon as October. Experts believe Moscow’s plan could put pressure on other governments to rush ahead of regulators and skip key steps in order to push a vaccine out in the market, putting public health at risk.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-top-us-expert-fauci-believes-half-an-effective-vaccine-enough-to-control-crisis/story-24gSi8ZAVl2IKv0nhhSE1O.html

Some had taken the bus from their homes across town to join white students from the affluent hillside neighborhoods in Berkeley, California. A pensive Harris sits on the floor, dutifully looking ahead, a child in the center of an experiment in racial integration.Also read: Kamala Harris recounts childhood India visits, long walks with grandfather“That’s how it started. There’s no question!” Harris, 55, texted back to Aaron Peskin, the former classmate who is now a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.Fifty years after she was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley’s public schools, Harris is now the first Black woman and first Asian American woman named to a major party presidential ticket.From her earliest years, Harris’ path toward the second-highest office in the United States has tracked the nation’s struggle for racial equality. The start-and-stop progress and sometimes messy debate have shaped her life, from an upbringing by immigrant parents, a childhood among civil rights activists, a career at the helm of a flawed criminal justice system and her rapid ascent to the top of Democratic politics.Those experiences forged a politician who is unafraid to buck the political powers that be, but also charts a cautious course through policy debates. As a senator and candidate, she’s emerged as a leader who knows the power of tough questioning and a viral moment, and also the weight of her role as a voice for women of color.“She’s the right thing at the right time in this country,” said Peskin. “She understands how complicated life is, and what the promises of America are.”Also read: American weekly magazine apologizes for op-ed questioning Harris eligibilityHarris’s political rise, while fast, has not been without criticism and setbacks.She’s been criticized for shifting policy positions.

Some progressive Democrats, meanwhile, view her work as a prosecutor skeptically, questioning her use of policies they say are discriminatory.Her own presidential bid, announced before 20,000 people in her hometown of Oakland, California, flamed out before primary season voting began. She struggled to raise money and present a clear vision.Now she’s back in an election she calls the most consequential of her lifetime.“My mother Shyamala raised my sister Maya and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching,” Harris said Wednesday in her first speech after Biden announced his selection. “She’d tell us: Don’t sit around and complain about things.

The state reported 279 new cases and 16 deaths, the health department said. Eleven of the cases were linked to aged-care facilities, facing a major crisis amid the spread of the virus.Andrews warned against complacency as infection numbers slowed. The Stage 4 lockdown was working and infection numbers were heading in the right direction, he said. While he was cautiously optimistic, he said Victorians didn’t have “the luxury of backing off.”Local media reported Melburnians were out in droves on Saturday to take advantage of good weather despite the strict restrictions, which include a curfew in Melbourne.“They speak to a strategy that is working,” Andrews said. “At the same time, no one day necessarily guarantees the outcome, that is a long hard slog. This is an endurance race, it is not a sprint in any way.”The state reported 372 cases on Friday and 303 on Saturday as new infections continue trending down after hitting a daily record of 725 infections on August 5. Victoria reported 14 deaths on Friday and four on Saturday. Its total number of Covid-19 fatalities is 309.Australia’s second-most populous state is approaching almost six months of being in a state of emergency after first declaring it on March 16 to combat the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-victoria-extends-state-of-emergency-as-deaths-top-300/story-p8kYhqIGWgVL2C0XiU3g3N.html

Harris, 55, who is the first black to be selected as a vice-presidential candidate of a major party, took a trip down the memory lane, mentioning her “long walks” in Madras (now Chennai) with her grandfather who would tell her about the “heroes” responsible for the birth of the world’s largest democracy.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, 77, scripted history by selecting Harris, an Indian-American and an African-American, as his running mate in the presidential election on November 3.Born to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, California senator Harris, if elected, would be second in line of succession after Biden.“Today on August 15, 2020. I stand before you as the first candidate for vice president of the United States of South Asian descent,” Harris said in her address organised by Indians for Biden National Council.Joined by Biden, she greeted Indian Americans on the occasion of India’s Independence Day.“To the people of India and to Indian Americans all across the US, I want to wish you a happy Indian Independence Day. On August 15, 1947, men and women all over India rejoiced in the declaration of the independence of the country of India,” Harris said during the virtual inaugural meet of the council.Harris was born on October 20 in 1964, at Oakland in California. Her mother Shyamala Gopalan migrated to the US from Tamil Nadu in India, while her father, Donald J Harris, moved to the US from Jamaica. “When my mother, Shyamala stepped off the plane in California as a 19-year- old, she didn’t have much in the way of belongings. But she carried with her lessons from back home, including ones she learned from her parents, my grandmother Rajan, and her father, my grandfather P V Gopalan. They taught her that when you see injustice in the world, you have an obligation to do something about it,” Harris said.“Which is what inspired my mother to march and shout on the streets of Oakland, at the height of the civil rights movement, a movement where leaders including Dr Martin Luther King Jr, were themselves inspired by the non-violent activism of Mahatma Gandhi,” she said.Harris said it was during those protests that her mother met her father. The rest, as they say, is history, she said.“Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry. And of course, she always wanted to instil in us, a love of good idli,” Harris said.“In Madras I would go on long walks with my grandfather, who at that point was retired. We would take morning walks where I’d hold his hand and he would tell me about the heroes who are responsible for the birth of the world’s biggest democracy. He would explain that it’s on us to pick up where they left off. Those lessons are a big reason why I am who I am today,” Harris said explaining the deep influence of the Indian heritage on her. “Our community is bound together by so much more than our shared history and culture,” she said. The reason there is a kinship between everyone who are a product of the South Asian diaspora, no matter how diverse our backgrounds may be, “is because we also share a set of values: values forged by overcoming colonial past, not only in one nation but in two”, Harris said.“Values like tolerance pluralism, and diversity and reflecting on the past 73 years it’s remarkable how much progress, people have made in the fight for justice. And should be proud. But we wouldn’t be if we didn’t commit ourselves to building an even better future. So, I hope you celebrate today, and then tomorrow, I hope you join me in getting to work,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-stand-before-you-as-first-candidate-for-us-vice-president-of-south-asian-descent-kamala-harris/story-DfVZsmTPSjz7yLxRmK2wGI.html

AstraZeneca is among those working on Covid-19 vaccine candidates now in development around the world.Mexico’s government also has said it is considering other options for bringing a vaccine quickly to its population, the second-largest in Latin America.Also read| Covid-19 vaccine trial likely to conclude by Nov, production may start in early 2021: AstraZenecaAstraZeneca will be able to produce between 30 and 35 million vaccines per month, Martha Delgado, a Mexican deputy foreign minister, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The vaccine could require two doses to be effective, Delgado said. “If we need 200 million, we’re going to be vaccinating for a long time,” Delgado added. Last-stage so-called Phase III trials are expected to conclude by November or December, after which AstraZeneca will seek government approvals if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective. If that goes smoothly, Delgado estimated the first vaccines in Mexico could be administered in April. Mexico’s death toll of 55,908 stands as the world’s third highest, behind the United States and Brazil. Latin America’s 6 million cases and more than 237,000 deaths make it the world’s hardest-hit region.To ensure all Mexicans have access to a vaccine, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s government is in talks with other pharmaceutical laboratories in different stages of developing a vaccine.“Astra’s production isn’t going to be enough for Mexico. We need to supplement that with a couple of more vaccines,” Delgado said.Mexico’s government has completed memorandums of understanding with French drugmaker Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit and Chinese companies CanSino Biologics Inc and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd.CanSino and Walvax are interested in producing a vaccine in Mexico for delivery to the Latin American market.Mexico’s health authorities are evaluating the Phase I and II clinical trials of those four companies and will determine the viability of Phase III studies in Mexico in the coming weeks, Delgado said. The earlier phase trials represent an initial test of a vaccine’s safety and effectiveness among small numbers of subjects.To save time, Mexico’s federal health regulator COFEPRIS will start analyzing AstraZeneca’s completed studies and accelerate approvals if Phase III is successful.“This is the country’s strategy to diversify our possibilities of having access to the vaccine as soon as possible ... and obviously at an affordable cost for the country,” Delgado said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-needs-200-million-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-shots-could-start-in-april/story-bV0e2Jup8yCX6Q2vmKk1JJ.html
16-08-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, flu shot makers see record US production||Global influenza vaccine makers have produced a record number of doses for the coming flu season, as authorities try to ease the burden on hospitals ahead of an expected Covid-19 resurgence.In the US, pharmaceutical companies plan to make around 196 million doses to serve the population of 330 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is up from 175 million last year, an 11 percent increase. Major pharmacy chain CVS, which administers flu vaccines without prescription, is ordering 18 million doses, double the amount in 2019.Vaccine maker Seqirus plans to increase production by roughly 15 percent in the US -- from 52 million to 60 million doses, as does Sanofi -- from 70 to 80 million.“There’s been a huge demand from our customers from the healthcare system,” Sanofi’s Michael Greenberg, regional medical head for vaccines in North America, told AFP.Sanofi, Seqirus and GSK are the three biggest companies in the market. GSK did not respond to a request for its vaccine production plans.Sanofi shipped its first batches on July 22, three weeks earlier than in 2019.The CDC estimates flu killed between 24,000 and 62,000 last year.Widespread flu vaccination could thus help free up hospital beds, a vital public health measure to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I’m really worried about the autumn,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University, told AFP.Gostin recently wrote an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for a flu vaccine offensive, including potentially mandatory vaccines at schools.“People aren’t thinking about flu, they’re thinking about Covid,” he said.Americans are already among the most vaccinated peoples against the flu in the world: vaccination is recommended from the age of six months. Other countries, such as France, recommend it to people at risk of complications, including those 65 and older.As a result, 63 percent of children and 45 percent of adults were vaccinated in 2018-2019. In the over-65 age bracket, the figure was 68 percent.But this year, Americans might have to look at new places to receive their shots.“It’s going to be hard for people to get their flu vaccinations because they usually get it at work or at school, but many workplaces and many schools are closed,” said Gostin. Silver lining?Every year the World Health Organization and national health authorities select in February and March the four strains of influenza virus most likely to be in circulation the following winter in the northern hemisphere.Hundreds of millions of eggs -- the traditional medium for incubating viruses before inactivating them and making them into vaccines -- are delivered to laboratories, with production continuing through the spring, until syringes are filled in summer.In the United States, Sanofi carries out these processes in two factories in the states of Pennsylvania and New York. The same factories could produce a future vaccine against the coronavirus -- but for now there is no competition between the two, said Greenberg. At any rate, Washington has also given the company $2 billion to expand its production capacity.“There are no concerns for supply now,” said Dave Ross, vice president of commercial operations in North America for Seqirus, adding that the firm was working with partners to ensure adequate vial and syringe production for future Covid-19 vaccines.There are some causes for optimism. Public health practices like social distancing and mask wearing put in place to stem the coronavirus should also reduce the spread of other respiratory illnesses including the flu.“All of those things hopefully will pay dividends and there’ll be less flu around,” said Henry Bernstein, a pediatrics professor at the Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine who is on a committee advising the CDC on immunization practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-flu-shot-makers-see-record-us-production/story-3ZlHZZlW1AtJuctlStEFwK.html

16-08-2020||World||US President Donald Trump’s younger brother Robert Trump dies at 71||President Donald Trump’s younger brother, Robert Trump, a businessman known for an even keel that seemed almost incompatible with the family name, died Saturday night after being hospitalised in New York, the president said in a statement. He was 71.The president visited his brother at a New York City hospital on Friday after White House officials said he had become seriously ill.It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,” Donald Trump said in a statement. “He was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.” The youngest of the Trump siblings remained close to the 74-year-old president and, as recently as June, filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Trump family that unsuccessfully sought to stop publication of a tell-all book by the president’s niece, Mary.Robert Trump had reportedly been hospitalised in the intensive care unit for several days that same month.Both longtime businessmen, Robert and Donald had strikingly different personalities. Donald Trump once described his younger brother as “much quieter and easygoing than I am,” and “the only guy in my life whom I ever call ‘honey.’” Robert Trump began his career on Wall Street working in corporate finance but later joined the family business, managing real estate holdings as a top executive in the Trump Organization.“When he worked in the Trump Organization, he was known as the nice Trump,” Gwenda Blair, a Trump family biographer, told The Associated Press. “Robert was the one people would try to get to intervene if there was a problem.” Robert Stewart Trump was born in 1948, the youngest of New York City real estate developer Fred Trump’s five children.The president, two years older than Robert, admittedly bullied his brother in their younger years, even as he praised his loyalty and laid-back demeanor.“I think it must be hard to have me for a brother but he’s never said anything about it and we’re very close,” Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 bestseller “The Art of the Deal.”“Robert gets along with almost everyone,” he added, “which is great for me since I sometimes have to be the bad guy.” In the 1980s, Donald Trump tapped Robert Trump to oversee an Atlantic City casino project, calling him the perfect fit for the job. When it cannibalised his other casinos, though, “he pointed the finger of blame at Robert,” said Blair, author of “The Trumps: Three Generations that Built an Empire.” “When the slot machines jammed the opening weekend at the Taj Mahal, he very specifically and furiously denounced Robert, and Robert walked out and never worked for his brother again,” Blair said.A Boston University graduate, Robert Trump later managed the Brooklyn portion of father Fred Trump’s real estate empire, which was eventually sold.Once a regular boldface name in Manhattan’s social pages, Robert Trump had kept a lower profile in recent years. “He was not a newsmaker,” Blair said.Before divorcing his first wife, Blaine Trump, more than a decade ago, Robert Trump had been active on Manhattan’s Upper East Side charity circuit.He avoided the limelight during his elder brother’s presidency, having retired to the Hudson Valley. But he described himself as a big supporter of the White House run in a 2016 interview with the New York Post.“I support Donald one thousand percent,” Robert Trump said.In early March of 2020, he married his longtime girlfriend, Ann Marie Pallan.The eldest Trump sibling and Mary’s father, Fred Trump Jr., struggled with alcoholism and died in 1981 at the age of 43. The president’s surviving siblings include Elizabeth Trump Grau and Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal appeals judge.Authors Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher described Robert Trump as soft spoken but cerebral in “Trump Revealed: The Definitive Biography of the 45th President”: “He lacked Donald’s charismatic showmanship, and he was happy to leave the bravado to his brother, but he could show flashes of Trump temper.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-s-younger-brother-robert-trump-dies-at-71/story-O8wIyHPFjfRNond9yb6z8N.html
16-08-2020||World||WHO team to assist South Africa in reinforcing Covid-19 response||A World Health Organisation (WHO) surge team will assist South Africa in bolstering its national Covid-19 response, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said.The team comprises 43 members and 16 arrived in the country on Friday.Over the last three weeks, the number of new confirmed cases in South Africa has dropped from a peak of over 12,000 a day to an average over the past week of around 5,000 a day. The recovery rate has increased from 48 per cent to 80 per cent.“We have received queries on why there would be a need for the (WHO) surge team if we are past the surge,” Mkhize said.“I would like to emphasise for our people that we are not past anything: we are still the country with the fifth highest positive cases in the world,” the minister said.South Africa, at present, has the world’s fifth largest virus caseload with over 5,79,000 confirmed cases and has reported more than 11,000 deaths, according to the tally by the Johns Hopkins University.Mkhize said apart from the impact on the health system that the coronavirus has had, “we are still faced with the devastation it has caused in our social lives, our well-being, the economy and the environment”.“With the threat of resurgence remaining very real, we would not want to repeat recent history witnessed in some countries and allow a second surge to wreak even further destruction,” he said.The WHO team will be looking at the South African situation “with fresh eyes and may be able to identify blind spots or offer a perspective we might not have considered”, the health minister said.Citing the WHO’s assistance to the country with earlier outbreaks of cholera and listeriosis, Mkhize said South Africa has a proud record of partnership with the organisation.The WHO had provided invaluable guidance during the FIFA 2010 World Cup, which coincided with the global H1N1 outbreak and threatened to scupper the football spectacle that was hosted for the first time on the African continent in 2010, he said.“Whilst the WHO name was well known and trusted, it was usually not part of everyday civilian conversation - now (because of the Covid-19 pandemic) the WHO is part of our work language, our dinner conversations, our social media banter, and a lot of arguments,” Mkhize said.“What I am most proud of is that the WHO has remained committed to all nations despite some being critical and even withdrawing sorely needed funding and resources,” the minister said. On Saturday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the National State of Disaster, which was declared in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, has been extended till September 15 in South Africa. The government, however, has lowered the nationwide lockdown to Level-2 of its five-level strategic approach to deal with the pandemic to allow economic activity to resume in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-to-assist-south-africa-in-reinforcing-covid-19-response/story-doxY8YDcajWS9yWFfov1HP.html
16-08-2020||World||American weekly magazine apologizes for op-ed questioning Harris eligibility||Newsweek has apologized for an op-ed that questioned Sen. Kamala Harris’ US citizenship and her eligibility to be Joe Biden’s running mate, a false and racist conspiracy theory which President Donald Trump has not dismissed.“This op-ed is being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize,” read Newsweek’s editor’s note on Friday, which replaced the magazine’s earlier detailed defense of the op-ed.“We entirely failed to anticipate the ways in which the essay would be interpreted, distorted and weaponized,” read the apology, signed by Josh Hammer, opinion editor, and Nancy Cooper, global editor in chief. But they ended the note by saying that the op-ed would remain on the site, with their note attached.The op-ed was written by John Eastman, a conservative attorney who argues that the US Constitution doesn’t grant birthright citizenship. Eastman sowed doubt about Harris’ eligibility based on her parents’ immigration status. Harris’ mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica.Newsweek earlier defended the piece, arguing that Eastman “was focusing on a long-standing, somewhat arcane legal debate” about the 14th Amendment and not trying to “ignite a racist conspiracy theory around Kamala Harris’ candidacy.”But the theory is false. Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements. The question is not even considered complex, according to constitutional lawyers.Trump built his political career on questioning a political opponent’s legitimacy. He was a high-profile force behind the “birther movement” — the lie that questioned whether President Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, was eligible to serve. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.Asked about the matter at the White House on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious.”Trump was asked to revisit the topic during a news conference on Saturday. He refused to say whether he believes the California-born senator does or doesn’t meet the constitutional requirements of the office he holds.“I have nothing to do with it. I read something about it,” Trump said. He added: “It’s not something that bothers me. ... It’s not something that we will be pursuing.” Asked point blank if Harris is eligible, Trump replied: “I just told you. I have not got into it in great detail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-weekly-magazine-apologizes-for-op-ed-questioning-harris-eligibility/story-K6q9C59rZTfT10hTIz3keN.html

The disease has claimed more than 766,000 lives so far.Putin’s announcement on Tuesday about the vaccine was met with caution from scientists and the World Health Organization who said it still needed a rigorous safety review.“The first batch of the novel coronavirus vaccine developed by the Gamaleya research institute has been produced,” the health ministry said on Saturday. The vaccine is called Sputnik V.With more than 915,000 infections, Russia’s caseload is fourth in the world after the United States, Brazil and India.Meanwhile, a projection by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the pandemic could claim 2,00,000 lives in the US by September 5.California on Friday became the first US state to surpass 600,000 cases and the Midwest saw several record one-day rises as some states struggled to contain the pandemic even as a few welcomed students back to school campuses.Also, thousands of British tourists beat a hasty retreat from France, packing out planes, trains and ferries to return to the UK by the early hours of Saturday morning to avoid a mandatory 14-day quarantine at home.Many British travellers in the country opted to cut short their vacations to meet the Saturday 4am deadline that had been announced the night before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-produces-first-batch-of-itscovid-19-vaccine/story-vlrYefDpWrDxcr3WvuYvQL.html
16-08-2020||World||Thousands in Belarus rally where protester died||Thousands of demonstrators in Belarus gathered on Saturday at the spot in the capital where a protester died in clashes with police, calling for President Alexander Lukashenko to resign after 26 years in power.It was the seventh consecutive day of large protests against the results of the August 9 presidential election in which election officials say Lukashenko won a sixth term in office.Despite harsh police action against the protesters, including the detention of some 7,000 people, the demonstrations have swelled into the largest and most sustained protest wave since Lukashenko took power in 1994.Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the protests in a call on Saturday, the first publicly known direct contact between the two leaders since the election. “It is important that these problems are not used by destructive forces aimed at causing injury to the cooperation of the two countries in the framework of the union state,” the Kremlin said.Russia and Belarus reached an agreement in 1997 about closer ties between the neighbouring ex-Soviet countries in a union stopping short of a full merger, although that has collided with recent disputes between the countries and Luksashenko’s suspicions that Putin’s government wants to absorb Belarus.A funeral was held on Saturday for Alexander Taraikovsky, a 34-year-old protester who died on Monday in the capital of Minsk under disputed circumstances. Belarusian police said he died when an explosive device he intended to throw at police blew up in his hand.But his partner, Elena German, said that when she saw his body in a morgue on Friday, his hands showed no damage and he had a perforation in his chest that she believes is a bullet wound.About 5,000 demonstrators gathered on Saturday in the area where Taraikovsky died. There were no immediate reports of detentions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-belarus-rally-where-protester-died/story-1MXDprzsTko3p40W6efR8N.html
16-08-2020||World||I have more Indians than she has: Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump attacked Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Friday, claiming that he has more support from Indian-origin voters than Joe Biden’s running mate.On his opponent Biden for the November 3 race, Trump said “no one will be safe in Biden’s America”, adding that California Senator Harris is a “step worse”.According to an ANI report, Trump said, “If Joe Biden would become the president, he will immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America and probably Kamala (Harris) is a step worse. She is of Indian heritage. I have more Indians than she has.”Trump took a sharp aim at Harris as being hostile towards police, suggesting that she and Biden were at the centre of “a left-wing war on cops”.He continued to criticise Biden, saying, “This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect... No one will be safe in Biden’s America.”He was speaking to members of New York City’s Police Benevolent Association (NYC PBA), which on Friday endorsed the US president’s re-election campaign.Speaking on the occasion, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani slammed Harris’ prosecutorial record, claiming that when she was attorney general, “she prosecuted little people but wouldn’t prosecute big people”.Biden, meanwhile, levelled fierce criticism at Trump, with his campaign saying the US president has resorted to “abhorrent” lies about Harris’ eligibility to be vice-president.“I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements,” Trump had said on Thursday, citing a controversial news article that questions the immigration status of Harris’ parents at the time of her birth.Trump “has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart,” Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-have-more-indians-than-she-has-donald-trump/story-9wtupt986wZmC5vb9016LO.html

16-08-2020||India||Uttarakhand woman accused of blackmailing BJP MLA says he raped her||The Uttarakhand woman accused of blackmailing and trying to extort Rs 5 crore from BJP MLA from Almora’s Dwarahat constituency, Mahesh Singh Negi, has lodged a police complaint accusing Negi of raping her at different hotels in Nepal, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The woman lodged the complaint in Dehradun to deputy inspector general, Dehradun, Arun Mohan Joshi, and marked the same to the station house officer of Nehru Colony where an extortion case against her was registered on a complaint filed by Negi’s wife on August 14. HT has a copy of the five-page complaint lodged by the woman. The woman’s complaint states that she first came in contact with Negi in 2016 as both used to live in the same neighbourhood. “That time my mother used to remain sick and the doctor had advised her to take steam for which I was going to take her to a hospital. But Negi came to know about it and asked me not to visit the hospital as he has a steam machine in his home only. Believing him, I took my mother to his house for the same and one day, he called me outside the room on the pretext of having a selfie and then forcibly grabbed me,” said the woman. She further alleged in her complaint that Negi raped her again in a hotel in Mussoorie a few days before her marriage.She further stated that she kept mum and got married on the scheduled date fearing Negi’s clout. She claims Negi again called her and pressured her to come to her parent’s home in Almora. “Due to this pressure and threats, I then came to my parent’s home after a few weeks. He then asked me not to go back to my in-laws and forced me to lodge a false complaint of dowry harassment against my husband and in-laws. When my husband asked the reason behind it, I narrated my ordeal to him, following which he ended all relations with me,” said the complaint. Further in the complaint, she alleged that Negi then raped her on various occasions by taking her to hotels in Delhi, Nepal, Himachal Pradesh, Nainital, Almora and even to his friend’s farmhouse in Haldwani. She then got pregnant, she alleged. “When I informed him about my pregnancy, he assured me that he would give his name to the child and take care of me. He even accompanied me for medical examinations in a Dehradun hospital before my delivery on May 18 this year,” she says in her complaint.She alleges that she got a DNA test conducted after delivering a girl, which revealed that her husband was not the father. “After that, I informed Negi about it but he refused to accept her as his daughter,” said the woman. She accuses Negi’s wife Rita Negi of offering her Rs 25 lakh for ‘forgetting the incident’ and says she “won’t back-off and want her daughter to have her rights”. The woman claims that she was framed by Negi’s family in a false extortion case.She is now demanding a DNA test to confirm if Negi is indeed the father of her child. She also wants to fight him legally.“I also request the police to provide protection to me and my family as Negi could harm us,” she said. Superintendent of police, Dehradun (city) Shweta Chaubey said, “The complaint has been given to DIG but is yet to be received by us. Once we get it, appropriate action would be taken on it.” Meanwhile, when contacted, MLA Mahesh Singh Negi refuted the allegations of the woman and termed it a conspiracy by the Opposition to malign his image. “She has submitted the false complaint after getting booked in an extortion case. The Opposition Congress is using her to malign my image with false accusations. Investigations in the extortion case will reveal everything,” said Negi. The Congress, however, said it has nothing to do with the woman or her allegations. “We have nothing to do with the incident. The woman is taking action on her own. But having said that, the allegations have been made against a ruling party MLA, which is a serious matter. If Negi is innocent then why is he not agreeing to the DNA test,” said Congress party vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-woman-accused-of-blackmailing-bjp-mla-says-he-raped-her/story-Q96Sb8qExmvaeliW1YB0pI.html

However, the gatherings were smaller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/religious-places-re-open-in-jammu-and-kashmir/story-XbUou6c0wFow1QJFNV6UKI.html
16-08-2020||India||23 arrested from Goa rave party||PANAJI: The Goa Police busted a ‘rave’ party at Firangpani Villas, a hotel in Vagator, late Saturday night seizing narcotics worth Rs 9 lakh and arresting 23 persons, including foreigners, following a tip-off. “We received information that a party was being organised on the intervening night of August 15-16. Immediately three teams of the Crime Branch raided the premises and detained over 20 persons. Upon thorough search, narcotics drugs — cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy tablets and charas — were detected in sizable quantities and worth over Rs9 lakh. Three of the accused are foreigner women,” the Goa Police said in a statement. The police booked the organisers under the NDPS Act and also for endangering public safety by organising the party during the pandemic. The party was organised by foreigners, according to the police. During the first weekend of August, an ‘underground’ party organised by well-connected persons on private property came to light after a brawl that started at the party spilled onto the streets, prompting the police to book the organisers. Tourism in Goa has taken a huge hit on account of the pandemic and brought the party scene to a halt, which has gone underground, on a smaller scale. Tourists, too, have begun to return since the state was reopened, but in limited numbers and that too mainly those who are willing to drive down for fear of contracting the virus while travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-arrested-from-goa-rave-party/story-QP1JkznkDju30TlV6ffyfN.html
16-08-2020||India||Places of worship reopen after five months in Kashmir||Some prominent religious places including shrines opened in Kashmir on Sunday for prayers after they were closed for over five months to contain the spread of novel coronavirus.People offered daily prayers in some shrines and mosques of the Valley but took precautions like maintaining social distance and wearing masks. Though small mosques in the mohallas and interior areas had already opened sparsely in the last few weeks but for the first time in the past five months people offered congregational prayers in prominent shrines like Dastigeer Sahib in Old City. People also said that they visited Khankah-e-Moula shrine on the banks of Jhelum.“We offered congregational prayer for the first time since mid-March in the afternoon today. Alhamdulillah all SOPs were followed. People gave good response and took precautions,” said Syed Khalid Geelani, Sajadah Nasheen (one of the caretakers) of Dastigeer Sahib Shrine.People were upbeat. “Everybody is aware of the importance of precautions during this pandemic. Though we used to offer prayers in our local mosques for the last few weeks but opening of these shrines fills us with hope and gives us solace,” said Bilal Ahmad, a resident of Old City.However not every mosque opened today. Kashmir’s biggest mosque Jamia Masjid in Nawhatta was still closed. “In coming couple of days the mosque will be opened after a cleanliness drive,” said a caretaker of the mosque. Some urged fellow citizens not to indulge in ‘blind fatalism’. “Blessed are we that these places have opened. I am so happy. But at the same time people should continue to take precautions. Their opening does not mean that the pandemic is over. People should continue to wear masks, take their own prayer rugs to the mosques, avoid handshakes, use sanitizers and maintain social distancing. Only then they should leave it to God,” said Yaqoob Ahmad, an Imam of a local mosque in Srinagar.Officials also urged people not to lower guard. “Community response holds the key to fighting Pandemic. Glad to see observance of SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) as religious places opened today after 5 months. Hopeful about industry, business & transport to follow the pursuit,” wrote Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Shahid Chaudhary on twitter.On August 4, the govt announced to re-open all religious places and places of worship from August 16 but detailed Covid-19 SOPs to be followed like no large gatherings and no touching of statues.In the run up to the August 16 opening, the district administration has reached out to managing committees of places of worship of all faiths and held meetings with over 3000 religious heads to sensitise them about do’s and don’ts to prevent spread of COVID-19.The total Covid-19 cases in Jammu and Kashmir have crossed 28,000 mark with over 21,000 of them in Kashmir alone. 527 people have died due to the pandemic – 486 of them in Kashmir valley.Markets to reopen againThe officials said that from Monday markets will reopen and public transport services will resume operations as per a regulated schedule in Srinagar.In an order issued here the District Magistrate Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary has lifted restrictions on business and transport operations allowing a regulated resumption.The Jammu and Kashmir administration had re-imposed lockdown restrictions in Srinagar from July 13 and rest of the valley from July 27 as the Corona cases had shown an increase.

16-08-2020||India||Joe Biden pledges closer ties with India, fairer H-1B norms||WashingtonJoe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, on Saturday pledged closer ties with India and a better deal for Indian Americans in a short, policy-laden Independence Day message. He will stand with India in confronting “new threats its faces in its own region and along its own border”, he said.Kamala Harris, his running mate, struck a personal note. She spoke of her visits to “Madras” (as Chennai was called then), stories she heard from her grandfather of heroes of Indian independence and her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris’s efforts to instill in her “a love of good Idli”.Biden’s campaign had earlier in the day issued an expansive agenda on relations with India and the welfare of Indian Americans if he wins in November. The Biden administration will not allow China to threaten its neighbors with “impunity” and will have “no tolerance” for cross-border terrorism.Biden built on it n a pre-recorded message played at a virtual outreach to the Indian American community to celebrate Indian Independence Day. Recalling his leading efforts to ratify the civil nuclear deal in 2008 as a senator, he said he had held then that if India and the United States “became closer friends and partners the world would be a safer place”“If elected president, I will continue to believe it,” he went onto says and added that he will “continue what I have long called for — including standing with India in confronting new threats it faces n its own region and along its border.”The former vice-president covered an entire range of issues for cooperation in the future over the next few minutes, such as trade, climate change and public health. And also have “honest conversations on all issues as friends”, which is diplomatese for discussing disagreements and difficult issues.Biden spoke disapprovingly of rising hate crimes and crackdown on legal immigration in recent years — “the sudden and harmful actions on H-1B, which for decades made America stronger and brought our nations closer”.The expansive agenda, address by Biden and Harris, and the participation of senior members of the campaign former deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken, former National Security Adviser to former vice-president Biden Jake Sullivan, speechwriter Vinay Reddy and Seema Sadanandan was part of the campaign efforts to woo 1.2 million Indian American voters who can help in closely fought swing states. Former US ambassador to India Rich Verma and former assistant secretary of state Nisha Biswal also participated in he discussions,Harris spoke largely in personal terms. She spoke of her grandfather P V Gopalan and grandmother Rajam, and the values that her mother Shyamala Gopalan learnt from them — “if you see injustice in the world you have an obligation to do something about it”.Growing up, Gopalan would take Harris and her sister Maya Harris to “what was then called Madras” so that they could understand where she came from what was their ancestry. “And, of course, she wanted to instill in us a love of good Idli,” said the presumptive vice-presidential nominee.Harris has faced criticism among some Indian Americans — and a section of Indians — for not embracing her Indian-ness enough, and for projecting herself more Black. She wrote in her autobiography she and her sister were raised by their mother to be “confident, proud black women”. On Saturday, Harris may have checked a few boxes for her critics as she spoke also of stories her grandfather told her about the heroes who were responsible India’s independence. “He would explain to us that it was on us to pick up where they left off,” she said, adding, “those lessons are a big reason why I am who I am today.”Blinken, who is expected a top portfolio in a Biden administration such as secretary of state or national security adviser, took the vice-president’s pledge of closer ties with India further and suggested that cooperation between the two countries should “extend even beyond the region to the world as large”.Blinken went to say the Biden administration will support a larger role for India in international institutions — including a permanent seat in a reformed UN security council. The US first extent support for India’s claim to a permanent during President Barack Obama’s first visit to India in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-pledges-closer-ties-with-india-fairer-h-1b-norms/story-RGj8CQ8elaksr55guhpThO.html
16-08-2020||India||Nothing disturbing in the clauses of draft EIA 2020: RP Gupta||New Delhi: The environment ministry has been swamped by nearly 200,000 objections to and comments on the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification of 2020, but doesn’t intend to hold further discussion on the concerns raised in the feedback it received. RP Gupta, secretary in the environment ministry, said the priority for the ministry is both EIA notification and a notification on monitoring and compliance of projects with environmental clearance conditions, which is being drafted. Edited excerpts from an interview:How will you read so many comments on draft EIA 2020 and how will the responses be incorporated in the final draft?We have formed a committee to sort out all the mails. They are sorting issuesm not looking at each mail. Almost 95% of the 17 to 18 lakh emails we have got are repetitive mails.Why do you think there was such a massive public and political outcry against draft EIA 2020? What is so disturbing or contentious about the clauses?I don’t think there is anything disturbing in the clauses. You are right about political issues. Maybe it has nothing to do with an environmental agenda, but more to do with a political agenda.Why does the environment ministry see draft EIA 2020 as an important regulation?We must see it in an overall context rather than looking at it in isolation. We are a country that takes a lot of time in issuing environmental clearances. We have very poor enforcement and monitoring of projects. No amount of scrutiny can substitute for the monitoring. You can scrutinize a project for 5 to 6 years and delay it but if you don’t monitor it, then it will remain environmentally unfriendly. We need to switch this equation. We should be quick in giving clearances. There should be very strict and regular monitoring and we should come down heavily on non-compliance. This notification is only the first part. We are developing a monitoring mechanism, which will be the second part.By taking more time, it increases project time and cost and we force industry to construct without obtaining clearances. To discourage violations, the best way is to ensure fast tracking of clearances.But the draft is talking about regularizing these violations.Post-facto scenario happens when someone has started a project without taking prior approval, which is the norm. So if an industry is in violation, what is the punishment? Will it have to be closed down and cannot be appraised? There is nothing in law which says you will not appraise it on merit. After appraisal, if you find a project cannot be approved then you close it down. If it can be approved, approval will be effective from the date we give approval. For the past period which is a violation, a penalty is to be imposed as per law.Why have you exempted so many projects from public hearing in the draft?It’s been 14 years since EIA 2006 was introduced, we have to use the experience gathered to further rationalise the clearance process. Every project doesn’t need to come for public hearing for environmental clearance. A small project or industry need not come {for a hearing} unless they are very polluting. These projects will still have to meet the air and water norms laid down. Let’s focus on bigger projects now.Will there be any space for discussion on draft EIA 2020?Concerns will be considered on merit. There is no requirement for discussion. That will open another Pandora’s Box. Then nothing will happen in future. Everything can be stifled.When can we expect a notification on monitoring of projects?Soon. Statutory clauses are being worked out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-disturbing-in-the-clauses-of-draft-eia-2020-rp-gupta/story-Xx76kMgX5ExoowBcrhFYCL.html

16-08-2020||India||Dispose of cases in timely manner: Top court to panel||Murali KrishnanNew Delhi The Supreme Court has urged the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to ensure timely disposal of cases before it after the top court’s attention was drawn to a matter adjourned by the NCDRC for nearly a year. The apex court did not pass any concrete directions to the NCDRC, leaving it to the administrative authority of the president of the body, justice (retd.) RK Agrawal to ensure that allocation of work and disposal of cases take place in a streamlined manner.“We consider it proper and appropriate to request the president of the NCDRC to look into the grievance and to take an institutional decision on the administrative side,” a division bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud said on Friday.The NCDRC is a body established under the Consumer Protection Act to hear consumer complaints. It hears appeals against various State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions. The NCDRC, as per the Consumer Protection Act of 2019, is also empowered to hear cases directly if the value of the good or services involved is more than Rs 10 crore. Appeals against decisions of NCDRC go to the Supreme Court.The top court was on Friday hearing one such appeal filed by an Uttar Pradesh-based jewellery retailer, LM Jewellers, against an order passed by NCDRC on February 28, 2020 adjourning a complaint filed by it to January 5, 2021. The petitioner submitted that the adjournment of the case for nearly a year defeats the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act which is to ensure speedy resolution of consumer cases.The petitioner’s counsel, Nikhil Jain, contended that such orders were being passed by the NCDRC as a matter of routine and a pattern had emerged of granting long adjournments. He pointed out another case in which the NCDRC, on February 26, 2020, adjourned the hearing of a case to March 3, 2021, when a request for adjournment was made on the grounds that the arguing counsel was unwell.The Supreme Court noted that the functioning of various tribunals has been hampered by lack of adequate infrastructure and judges, prompting such tribunals to order long adjournments.“This court is cognizant of the fact that several tribunals suffer from a lack of adequate infrastructure including of judges to discharge adjudicatory functions. Hence, the presiding judges allocate dates on the basis of a realistic assessment of when cases can be disposed of when they are listed for final disposal,” the bench, which also comprised justice KM Joseph, observed.But it allowed the petitioner to raise the issue before the president of NCDRC so that appropriate steps can be taken to ensure speedy disposal of cases. “This is an issue on which it is only proper and appropriate that this court (Supreme Court) should defer to the administrative authority of the president of the NCDRC to ensure that the allocation of work and disposal of cases takes place in a streamlined manner,” the Supreme Court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispose-of-cases-in-timely-manner-top-court-to-panel/story-uqJf5mJgF6my0tNcerMU0H.html

16-08-2020||India||2 men held for rape, murder of UP girl||LUCKNOW/ LAKHIMPUR KHERI Two men have been arrested for the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl in a village in Lakhimpur Kheri district, police said on Sunday. While some reports had suggested that the accused had gouged out the girl’s eyes and cut her tongue, district superintendent of police Satendra Kumar denied these claims. According to police, the incident took place on Friday afternoon, when the two accused dragged the Dalit girl into a sugarcane field on finding her alone. “Initial investigation revealed that the assailants dragged the girl into the sugarcane field after finding her alone on Friday afternoon. The duo raped and strangled her to conceal the crime. We zeroed in on the duo on the basis of the statement of the girl’s family members and other witnesses,” Abhishek Pratap, Dhaurahra area circle officer (CO) said. The post mortem report established strangulation after rape as the cause of death, the officer said. The scarf used to strangle her was found near the spot, he added.Kumar said that there was no mention of mutilation of the girl’s body in the post-mortem report. Sections of rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act have been added to the FIR, was earlier filed under IPC section 302 for murder and a section of SC/ST Act (for atrocities against person belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe), the SP said.The process of slapping National Security Act against the two accused has also been initiated, the SP added. Meanwhile, a political controversy has erupted in the state after the crime came to light, with opposition parties hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state government for the alleged rise in atrocities against women and children.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, UP Congress president Lallu Singh, former Congress MP Jitin Prasada and several other leaders condemned the incident. Taking to Twitter, Yadav said, “The rape and murder of a teenage girl in Lakhimpur Kheri is an incident which has shaken humanity. In the BJP rule, atrocities on children and women are at an all-time high.” “Why is the BJP government shielding those who are involved in rape, kidnapping, murder and other crime,” the former state chief minister asked. Prasada said: “The inhuman act with a girl has put humanity to shame. This is an extremely saddening incident. In this episode, the police must initiate such a strong action that it becomes a deterrent for criminals.” In a tweet in Hindi, Prasada asked, “What was the police doing that such a big incident took place. Action must be taken against the guilty persons. The safety of the family (of the girl) should be looked into”. Mayawati demanded strict action against the guilty. “What is the difference between the SP government and the present BJP government... The BSP demands that the government should initiate strong action against the guilty in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and also in the Azamgarh incident.” She was referring to the murder of village head in Azamgarh recently.

16-08-2020||India||Speculations rife on role allotment in Bengal BJP after meetings in Delhi, Kolkata||Two back-to-back meetings of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi and Kolkata on Sunday within hours of each other, led to speculations that the party’s central leadership may re-allot organizational roles to some leaders in its West Bengal unit for the crucial 2021 assembly polls. BJP national general secretary and the party’s in-charge of West Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya flew down to Kolkata on Sunday and met Mukul Roy, the national executive member who was put in the charge of the Lok Sabha election in 2019. On the other hand, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh flew to Delhi and met party president JP Nadda on Sunday night. “Nadda Ji wanted to meet me,” said Ghosh while Roy did not take calls. The meeting between Vijayvargiya and Roy led to speculations that the BJP central leadership may find a new role for Roy who is known to be disgruntled at not being given a higher post in the state unit during the recent organizational changes. “Roy expressed his unhappiness before central leaders such as national joint general secretary Shivprakash during his last visit to Delhi. It is an open secret in the party that he and Ghosh have differences on issues relating to accepting defectors from Trinamool Congress (to which Roy belonged) and selection of candidates during elections. Roy feels that he should be given more independence for handling the 2021 elections. In our organizational structure such decisions largely depend on the state president,” said a Bengal BJP vice-president who did not want to be identified. Another vice-president, who is known to be close to Ghosh, said, “One should not read too much into this meeting. Vijayvargiya did not get the opportunity or time to come to Bengal since March this year. He will be staying for three days and hold several meetings.” Before meeting Nadda in Delhi, Ghosh dismissed speculations that he had been called to explain some of his public statements and organizational decisions. “Dilip Ghosh always bats on the front foot. I am president of the state unit for four and a half years now and during my leadership the party won 18 (of 42) Lok Sabha seats in Bengal. I was elected president once again after the polls. BJP does not change leaders at random. As far as I know, Mukul Roy was with the BJP and still is with the BJP. Our party allots roles according to a leader’s capability. I think some people are spreading rumours with vested interest,” said Ghosh while talking to reporters before meeting Nadda. BJP leaders in Bengal said Nadda and Ghosh discussed some important issues relating to the coming elections for more than one and half hours. The party did not make any official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speculations-rife-on-role-allotment-in-bengal-bjp-after-meetings-in-delhi-kolkata/story-qkr6qQGEoK6EdynL6lHahO.html

His ten-year-old son also sustained some injury. TMC however claimed that no party worker was involved in the incident. Sub-divisional police officer (Jangipur) Prasenjit Banerjee said, “Preliminary investigation shows that Kabir was making bombs on the roof of his house. One of the bombs went off accidentally and he was fatally injured. His minor son was also injured. We have started an investigation but no arrest has been made yet.” Local people told the police that Kabir used to work as a part time labourer in a bidi factory. They said they heard a loud explosion around 9 pm on Saturday. They rushed to Kabir’s house and found him lying in a pool of blood. Kachinur Bewa, mother of the deceased, said, “Kabir went to the roof after having dinner. There was an explosion within a few minutes.” Officers at Shamserganj police station said Kabir had been arrested a few times in the past and had a criminal record. They alleged that the family removed the bomb making materials to wipe out the evidence. The mother of the deceased denied the allegation. “My son was not associated with any criminal activity. We suspect that someone hurled a bomb at our house,” she said.

16-08-2020||India||Third parties to report high value transactions to identify tax evaders, says govt||Finance ministry officials have refuted media reports that claimed that government was considering modification of income tax returns forms for an expansion of statement of financial transactions (SFT) to ensure that the high value financial transactions are filled in the ITR by the taxpayers themselves.The officials called the reports “totally misleading”, while clarifying that the taxpayer doesn’t need to mention high value transactions in the return filed and reporting of such transactions will only be done in the most non-intrusive way by the third parties under the Income Tax Act.Further clarifying, the official said that reporting of high value transactions is done chiefly for identifying people spending big bucks on luxuries such as business class air travel, foreign travel, expensive hotels, expensive schools and yet not paying taxes claiming to be earning less than Rs 2.5 lakh per annum and also for identifying those under reporting their earnings.The chief purpose is to attain the widening of the tax base in a country where only a fraction of the population pays taxes, a fact highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi while launching ‘Honoring the Honest’ taxation platform on August 13. The exercise of collective information on high value transactions from third parties is in line with the government’s stated principle of honouring the honest, the official said.“The Income Tax Department is relying more and more on voluntary compliance and therefore it has become essential to identify tax evaders and for that purpose expenditure data collected from third parties through SFT is the best and most effective non-intrusive method. Any purported extension in the present list of SFTs, as reported in the media, is certainly not going to impact or affect the taxpayers as they are not required to file details of high value transactions in their ITRs,” the official said.The official added that the information will be used to identify those who are either not filing the returns or the income disclosed in the returns are not proportionate to the pattern of expenditure reported in the SFTs. Such exercise will be done through data analytics and artificial intelligence. There will be no manual intervention in such exercise.The official stressed that with the changing facets of taxation in India towards a faceless approach, it has now become even more imperative for the I-T Department to have broader SFT reports by third parties about those persons who undertake high value transactions but still do not pay income-tax.Identifying such persons evading tax is important for delivering justice to the honest taxpayers and the widening of the tax base will allow government fiscal space for lowering the tax burden of the honest taxpayers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-parties-to-report-high-value-transactions-to-identify-tax-evaders-says-govt/story-0hFNIswunVmdraaPfMzoyK.html

16-08-2020||India||Hindu family in Gwalior claims Muslim man’s body, cremates it, hospital orders probe||A hospital in Gwalior handed over the body of a Muslim man on Saturday to a Hindu family which did not remove the plastic to take a look even after he had tested negative for Covid-19 and cremated it, the Madhya Pradesh police said Sunday. The family members of the Muslim man have lodged a complaint with the police over the goof-up . This incident came to light on Sunday morning when family members of Irtaza Mohammed, 64, reached the hospital to bring the body. Earlier, on Saturday evening when they wanted to take the body for burial, the staff in the hospital showed them a different body and then asked them to return in the morning. Gwalior superintendent of police, Amit Sanghi said, “On August 13, Suresh Batham, 70, a resident of Bohadapur area in Gwalior and Irtaza Mohammed, 64, a resident of Morena died during their treatment at Jayarogya Hospital. The hospital refused to hand over the bodies to the families of both the deceased as Covid-19 test reports were awaited. Irtaza’s test report came back negative on Saturday. Hence, his nephew Akram Khan and others went to the hospital to collect the body in the evening. The staffers showed them the body of Suresh Batham but Akram told them that it was not Irtaza’s body.” “Later, staffers asked them to come on Sunday morning. Akram reached the hospital on Sunday morning with some of his relatives where they were informed that Irtaza’s body had been handed over to Suresh Batham’s family on Saturday morning. Later, it came to be known that Batham’s family which took Irtaza’s body had already cremated it ,” said Sanghi. The hospital superintendent RKS Dhakad blamed Batham’s family for the goof-up. Both the bodies were covered in plastic sheets because they had died before testing negative for Covid-19 and Batham’s family members did not bother to check whether they were taking his body.“When Batham family members came to the hospital they were asked to identify him but they took Irtaza’s body instead which was covered in plastic as he was a suspected patient of Covid 19. As Batham’s test report had also come negative they should have removed the plastic cover at home at least to identify the body,” said Dhakad. He said an inquiry has been ordered and action would be taken against the staffers concerned if they are found guilty.The family members of Batham who collected his body from the hospital on Sunday refused to talk to reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindu-family-in-gwalior-claims-muslim-man-s-body-cremates-it-hospital-orders-probe/story-zrvJWBqHbTSmheEDCUTXrM.html

The cumulative tally of positive cases in the jail is likely to go up as 250 other inmates will undergo tests on Monday, officials said. ”Most of the infected cases are asymptomatic. We have isolated them and those who have serious symptoms have been shifted to Covid hospitals,” Jail superintendent P Nirmalanandan said. Many under-trials and those nearing their term completion of sentence were freed earlier to lessen the load during pandemic outbreak, he said.The infections from the jail come on the day Kerala recorded 10 deaths and 1530 fresh virus cases. The mass infection at the central jail, where more than 1,000 prisoners are lodged, has worried already overworked health officials and others as the cause of the infection spread in the close quarters remains unclear.Among the freshly recorded infections in the state, 53 are health workers, said the office of the health minister K K Shailaja. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and seven of his ministers turned negative after repeated tests but they said they will complete two-week quarantine. They opted quarantine after some of the district officers whom they had interacted at the Air India Express plane mishap site at Kozhikkode last week tested positive for Covid-19. Meanwhile the CM has lauded health officials and others for pulling off a remarkable job in trying times. “We are into 200-day of Covid crisis. Looking back we can say with pride that this has not been just a period of despair and loss. This has been a time of courage, compassion, resilience and survival,” he tweeted on Sunday. Kerala was the first to report a virus case in January after a medical student from Thrissur returned from China. With ten more casualties, Kerala’s death toll has climbed to 157. Total cases in the state are at 44,384, with 15,310 active cases and 28,878 recovered cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/363-inmates-of-kerala-jail-test-covid-19-positive-state-s-tally-climbs-to-44k/story-QhyuDcEV3rXqLx7wI6dWlI.html
16-08-2020||India||10,000 ‘Rise Schools’ in MP to be equipped with e-books, skill centres||Samskar (etiquette), moral science and personal development would be taught in 10,000 schools in Madhya Pradesh in this academic year itself as part of the state government ‘Rise schools’ concept, said the state education minister.MP school education department’s action comes days after the Central government introduced the new education policy (NEP). “The state’s school education department, which has already completed the work on the new education policy of the state as per South Korea education model, will now merge it with the NEP. The 10,000 government schools will be upgraded as Rise schools to secure the future of kids. These schools will be equipped with all advanced technology including e-books, interactive boards, projectors, skill centres, art classes and other advanced infrastructure in one year. With quality education and skill training a major focus will be on overall development of students in these schools of MP so that they could emerge as samskari, self-reliant and skilled persons,” said Inder Singh Parmar, school education minister. “The teachers are being trained under a CM Rise training programme for imparting education in these schools. The future recruitment of teachers will also take place as per the qualification, including digital efficiency, required under new education policy,” said the minister. A school education department officer, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “In these schools, there will be dedicated periods during the studies for the students for arts & culture, personality development, moral science and etiquette. Special educators and speakers will be invited to motivate the students. Study materials and books based on life and deeds of great personalities will also be made available for the students.” “The classes of sports and yoga will also be made compulsory for strengthening students mentally and physically so that they are able to face future challenges efficiently,” said the officer. The school education department has a target of upgrading 30,000 schools as Rise Schools in the next three years. Social activists working in the field of education and opposition Congress have raised doubt on implementation of this system. Education activist Pankaj Prajapati said, “The central government has come up with a good education policy and the South Korean model is one of the best education models in the entire world but MP government needs to put in a lot of efforts to even implement 10% of it as MP lacks in basic infrastructure. We have doubts on implementation of it as the school education system is in a very bad shape.” Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “We will feel good if these things don’t remain confined to the files only. It is more like a dream to implement it as the BJP-led state government utterly failed in improving the condition of the school education system in the past 15 years of its rule.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-000-rise-schools-in-mp-to-be-equipped-with-e-books-skill-centres/story-50QONvvwlBfzr8UFCjp3qK.html

16-08-2020||India||Patanjali will step in if no other Indian company bids for IPL title: Ramdev||Yoga guru Ramdev on Sunday clarified that his business venture Patanjali Ayurvedic Ltd. will only step in to sponsor the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) if other Indian companies don’t come forward and said that he will not allow Chinese firms to dominate the Indian market. Refuting the claim that Patanjali has made a bid for IPL title sponsorship at Patanjali Yogpeeth in Haridwar on Saturday, Ramdev said “it is too early to talk about it as Patanjali will only come to the forefront (for IPL title sponsorship) if other Indian corporate houses don’t make any bid for the IPL title sponsorship”. Ramdev also stated that no paper work or financial assessment has been done from Patanjali side regarding IPL title sponsorship. “Patanjali will only make bid when no other Indian company comes out or is in the fray for IPL title sponsorship deal,” Ramdev said. He added that voices are being raised across the country urging his business to lay claim to IPL title sponsorship after Board of Control for Cricket in India suspended title sponsorship deal with Chinese mobile handset maker.“There are many Indian firms, corporates and companies that have been investing, sponsoring and associated with international cricket and IPL. People do not want Chinese products or firms to be associated with cricket and other sports, which clearly indicates Indians being vocal for local,” he said. “After Doklam, India-China relations have soured and Indians have realised the nefarious designs of China, so it is imperative we opt for localised indigenous products only,” said Ramdev. BCCI has invited expression of interest for the title sponsorship rights of IPL season 2020, which will be played in the United Arab Emirates from September 19 to November 10 with final bid deadline being August 18, 2020 as per the official IPL T-20 website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patanjali-will-step-in-if-no-other-indian-company-bids-for-ipl-title-ramdev/story-GIGJXnJ0uTGDrTlEoTDmhM.html
16-08-2020||India||Not aware, says minister Shyam Rajak after Nitish Kumar sacks him from cabinet, party||Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday evening sacked industry minister Shyam Rajak from the cabinet while the ruling Janata Dal (United) also expelled the senior minister from the party. The action came soon after reports surfaced that Rajak is all set to join the rival Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Monday. Sources said the chief minister sent a recommendation to Governor Phagu Chauhan to dismiss the industry ministry from the state cabinet in the evening and the same has been accepted by the Raj Bhawan. “Rajak has been expelled from the party for being found involved in anti-party activities,” said JD(U) state president Basistha Narayan Singh.When HT contacted the sacked minister for comments, Rajak said he was not aware about being sacked from the state cabinet or from the party. “I am not aware of it. I have not received any formal notification or communication from the party,” he said. He, however, evaded any questions about joining the RJD. “I will not comment on it. I have never compromised on my dignity and respect,” he said.Earlier in the day, there was a strong buzz in Patna that Rajak is all set to resign from the post of minister and also as MLA on Monday and likely to move back to the RJD. Sources said the dismissal of Rajak from the state cabinet and expulsion from the JD(U) today was done more as a face saving exercise by CM Kumar, knowing full well that Rajak could have earned some political points by resigning from ministership.Rajak has been unhappy with the JD(U) leadership, said people aware of development, for not being given much prominence as a minister. Incidentally, Rajak had switched to the JD(U) in 2009 after leaving the RJD and had won from the Phulwari seat as a JD(U) nominee in the 2010 election. In another development, the RJD on Sunday expelled three sitting MLAs, including son of former union minister MA Fatmi, for six years on charges of anti-party activities.The three MLAs expelled from the RJD are Faraz Fatmi , Maheshwar Prasad Yadav and Prema Choudhary.“We have expelled the party MLAs on charges of being involved in anti party activities as per provisions of the party’s constitution. The decision was taken by RJD chief Lalu Prasad,” said Alok Mehta, RJD’s state general secretary. Mehta, however, did not comment on reports that the three sitting MLAs facing the axe were all likely to join the JD(U). “The party took the decision based on their activities in recent times,” he said.

The two main zoos of West Bengal took the digital route on Sunday. This would allow people to watch some of the big animals live on Facebook, while sitting in their homes at least for two hours every day. All they need to do is to log in at the zoos’ Facebook page and enjoy. “As of now we would be showing some of the major attractions of the two zoos every day live for two hours – one hour each in the morning (9 am – 10 am) and in the afternoon (3 pm – 4 pm). The duration could be increased depending upon the response,” said Rajib Banerjee, state forest minister, after launching the facility. While the Alipore Zoo – the oldest in the country – has many endangered and exotic species such as the tiger, elephant, lion, kangaroos, giraffes, anaconda and chimpanzee, among others; the Darjeeling Zoo, which specializes in conservation of Himalayan species, has the red panda, snow leopard, blue sheep, Tibetan wolf and the salamander as some of its major attractions. “There are 12 zoos in West Bengal which attract around 50 lakh visitors round the year. The Alipore Zoo and the Darjeeling zoo together attract more than 40 lakh visitors. The zoos have been closed since March 17 due to the pandemic,” a senior zoo official said. The authorities are also planning to add a voiceover during the live sessions with some description about the animal that is being shown to make it more informative. People will be able to have a 360-degree view of the animals in the live session The authorities launched a mobile app in April to host virtual tours. The Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai was the first zoo in India to start live streaming of animals in their enclosures, almost two years back. The zoo now has live streaming of 14 species including tiger, lion, and hippos with the help of 180 cameras installed in the zoo. For the lockdown period, the authorities have added a special feature in which they are focusing one animal at a time to show some particular activity of the animal - for example an elephant enjoying a shower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-alipore-zoos-to-host-virtual-tour-to-live-stream-its-animals/story-RqxqG0Lwj9J774mUI2i1bI.html

16-08-2020||India||Rajasthan political crisis ends but differences remain as senior leader hits out at Gehlot loyalists||The political crisis in Rajasthan may have ended with Sachin Pilot’s return to the Congress fold with his loyalists but the differences between the two sides remain. Senior Congress leader in the state, Hemaram Choudhary, who stood with Sachin Pilot during the standoff with the Gehlot camp, has lashed out saying the 101 MLAs, who had camped with Gehlot, were not the true loyalists of the Congress party.He alleged that the MLAs seen to be in Gehlot’s camp were trying to safeguard their own personal interests while those supporting Sachin Pilot and branded ‘rebels’, were actually fighting for the betterment of the party. Choudhary was talking to the media at his residence in Barmer.Taking a dig at chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Choudhary said that Gehlot had stated that Congress is his mother but it is not correct. He said that Congress is the mother of all Congressmen and Gehlot is not the only son of Congress. He further said that when one son is trying to capture the mother and the others remain hungry, then the other sons have to plead before the mother for their rights and they did the same.Choudhary said that they have pleaded before the Congress leadership. He added that several things were not right since the party came to power in the state and added that when they tried to raise issues related to the party and the public, they were ignored after which they were forced to take such a step.Choudhary claimed that the party high command has heard and sorted out their issues with an assurance that such a situation will not continue. He expressed faith that the three member committee formed by the party brass will sort out their issues.Choudhary said he was shocked with the language used to target him. He said Gehlot had stated that those leaders who had not accepted money should return back to the Congress fold. Choudhary said Gehlot should now explain his allegation, now that they have returned. “I have a forty-years long political life with a clear image and I have never faced any allegation. My people already knew this and now, I hope that even the CM is satisfied,” he said. Referring to Sachin Pilot, Choudhary said the leader who revived the party in the state was criticised badly. “It is unfortunate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-political-crisis-ends-but-differences-remain-as-senior-leader-hits-out-at-gehlot-loyalists/story-41W5EUkTb128bMyOQXSgvN.html
16-08-2020||India||‘Tool to kill viruses, 10 screens’: Parliament readies for monsoon session||Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in the air-conditioning system, 10 display screens for live proceeding, placards to indicate name of parties, earmarked seats for top leaders and special cables linking Houses — an overhaul in logistics and infrastructure will support the Indian Parliament when it meets for the monsoon session amid Covid. While ministers, former PMs and floor leaders will get preference in the main chamber, many party MPs — even from the ruling sides — will be adjusted in the galleries, as per a plan prepared by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu.To be sure, the 100-year-old building is no stranger to facelift and modifications in its long journey. But the pandemic has prompted the authorities to make unprecedented amendments to a well-established system to ensure safety and adherence to health norms as the average age of MPs in Rajya Sabha is 63.39. The average age of Lok Sabha MPs is 54 but half of them are 56 years or above in age. As both the House proceedings will spread across the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and their galleries, there will be four large and six small display screens in the chamber and galleries of the Upper House, “audio consoles in the galleries, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, special cables connecting the two Houses for transmission of audio-visual signals, polycarbonate sheet separating the Official Gallery from the chamber of the House”, according to an official note, amid a slew of new measures. The first of its kind arrangements, overseen by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, also includes a quota of seats for different parties in the chamber and galleries of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, based on their respective strengths. The remaining lawmakers will be seated in the Lok Sabha, divided in two blocks—ruling NDA and other parties. A similar practice will be followed by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who will also use the Central Hall to accommodate excess members as the Lok Sabha would need a bigger space. Naidu has decided that in the Rajya Sabha chamber, seats will be earmarked for the Prime Minister, Leader of the House, Leader of the Opposition and floor leaders of other parties. “Former Prime Ministers and former Leaders of the House Dr Manmohan Singh and HD Deve Gowda. Ramvilas Paswan and Ramdas Athawale, being ministers and Rajya Sabha MPs -- will also have earmarked seats in the chamber of the House. Other ministers will be seated in the seats meant for the ruling party. The seating arrangements will be in strict compliance with the social distancing norms. “Special cables are being laid connecting the two Houses of Parliament for transmitting audio-visual signals of the proceedings both ways without any time lag to enable real time participation of members seated in the two Houses,” said an official communique. The Upper House would also see polycarbonate sheets—widely used in government offices now—to separate the officials gallery from the chamber as both are in proximity. A maximum of 15 officials and as many number of journalists would be allowed in the respective galleries. In the Lok Sabha press gallery, 20 journalists would be allowed. While the RSTV and LSTV will telecast live proceedings through their existing arrangements, Naidu and Birla have instructed the secretariat to minimise the physical handling of various papers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tool-to-kill-viruses-10-screens-parliament-readies-for-monsoon-session/story-FglBGXo3WY3WEkCv7PvYbM.html
16-08-2020||India||Heavy rain floods parts of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, rivers burst banks||Heavy rain in Telangana and parts of Andhra Pradesh since Friday has left many villages marooned with overflowing streams and rivulets while several colonies in the urban areas witnessing heavy water logging on Sunday. The Indian Meteorological Department’s bulletin on Sunday afternoon said the heavy rain was the result of a low pressure area over north coastal Odisha and adjoining areas of northwest Bay of Bengal and Gangetic West Bengal with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 9.5 km above mean sea level. “It is very likely to move west-north westwards and weaken gradually during the next 48 hours. A fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal around August 19,” the bulletin said. Two major rivers Krishna and Godavari, along with their tributaries, have been in spate forcing the irrigation department authorities open sluice gates of some dams and barrages to discharge water, resulting in inundation of low-lying areas. In Telangana’s Warangal town, several colonies had been submerged due to heavy rain since Friday night. The district received heavy rainfall ranging from 10 cm to 27 cm during this period. Following an SOS message from the Warangal (urban) administration, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation sent three disaster response force teams to Warangal on Sunday along with boats and other equipment to rescue people caught in the flood water and shift them to safer areas. “We shall take part in the rescue operations along with Warangal (Urban) district machinery,” Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management director Viswajit Kampani said. A statement from the chief minister’s office said the government had established two control rooms in Hyderabad to monitor the situation and also pressed two helicopters into service for rescue and relief operations. The Godavari river has been in full spate inundating several villages all along its course. At the temple town of Bhadrachalam in Telangana, the authorities issued a second level warning as the water level in the river reached 52.50 feet at 1 pm on Sunday. “The water level continues to rise,” the statement from the CMO said.Taliperu and Kinnerasani rivers, the tributaries of Godavari, are also overflowing, forcing the authorities to open the reservoir gates to discharge excess water. The CMO said due to the continuous rains, several streams and rivulets were in full spate across the state. In several districts, breaches to bunds of many water bodies were reported. Similarly, drainage canals were overflowing and water-logging continued on the roads in urban areas at many places. “Under the current conditions, there is a severe threat of inundation due to overflowing tanks and streams especially in the erstwhile districts of Warangal and Karimnagar where very heavy rain was reported,” he added. In Mulugu district of Telangana, hundreds of people were evacuated from villages on the banks of river Godavari. Heavy flood water inflow was reported at Sammakka barrage in Tupakulagudem of Mulugu district. In the Krishna basin too, massive inflows were reported with Jurala, Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar receiving flood water from upper regions. Inflow to Nagarjuna Sagar Project increased to 42,378 cusecs. The water level in the project touched 566.7 feet as against the full reservoir level of 590 feet. Considering the forecast of more rains for a few more days the disaster management department has advised people not to venture out except in emergencies. In Hyderabad too the GHMC authorities have advised people to vacate dilapidated residential buildings because of heavy rain. The water level in Godavari at Kunavaram and Polavaram in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district has also been rising alarmingly with every passing hour. At Dowleshwaram in East Godavari, the authorities opened the gates of the barrage and to discharge 14.63 lakh cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water into the sea. The exercise left several island villages in teh Konaseema area submerged. The Andhra Pradesh government has put its state and national disaster response force teams on high alert. “We are keenly monitoring the situation in 27 flood-prone blocks in East Godavari district,” an official statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-floods-parts-of-telangana-andhra-pradesh-rivers-burst-banks/story-znpZZu0Q4wfMW8CT0fqB3O.html
16-08-2020||India||Chetan Chauhan’s political innings blossomed during Mandal-Mandir times||Former cricketer Chetan Chauhan had an equally successful political career which started during the times of Mandir- Mandal politics in the country in late 1980s.Born in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly on 21 July 1947, Chauhan moved to Pune in Maharashtra in 1960 with his father, who was transferred there as an officer of Indian Army. He graduated from Wadia College in Pune, where his cricketing acumen was honed, but returned to UP for the second innings of his life in politics.He was fielded as a BJP candidate from Amroha Lok Sabha seat in the general elections in 1991-- also referred to as Mandal-Mandir elections—due to the highly polarized and charged atmosphere over two main issues of Ram Janmabhoomi movement for the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya and of Mandal commission, pertaining to reservations for the marginalized castes. Chauhan won the elections with 58.96% votes defeating Janata Dal’s Har Govind, who returned with nearly 31.64% votes. He represented the seat for the next five years, while the Centre was ruled by PV Narasimha Rao led Congress government supported by the left parties. However, in 1996 elections, Pratap Singh Saini from Samajwadi Party won the Amroha seat, located north-west of Moradabad about 130 km away from Delhi and known for its mangoes.Chauhan made a comeback in 1998 by defeating BSP’s Alley Hasan from Amroha. He polled more than 37% votes to defeat Hasan who could only muster little over 29% votes. A year later in 1999, he lost the elections to BSP’s Rashid Alvi.During his tenure as Lok Sabha MP in 1998-99, Chauhan also served as a member on the parliamentary committee on finance and on the consultative committee for the ministry of human resource and development (HRD). He also served as chairman of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) from June 2016 to June 2017.In 2017, he won the assembly elections for Naugawan Sadaat seat by defeating SP leader Javed Abdi and was presently serving as the home guards minister in UP cabinet led by Yogi Adityanath.He is the second minister in the UP cabinet to have succumbed to coronavirus disease after the death of Kamla Rani Varun on August 2.Chauhan also proved his mettle as an administrator while serving the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) in various capacities. He was also appointed manager of the Indian Team during their tour of Australia.73 year old Chauhan is survived by his wife Anita Chauhan and son Vinayak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chetan-chauhan-s-political-innings-blossomed-during-mandal-mandir-times/story-QzhuQvHJUBRJiyyFbcJkuM.html

Vijay Pratap Dixit, who himself reported the matter to the police, has been arrested. The Faridabad resident is employed with the company for a very long time.On August 13, police received a call from Dixit about a robbery near Bara Pulla Flyover here. During an enquiry, he told them that around 1.30 pm he collected Rs 2 lakh in cash and a cheque of Rs 10 lakh from his employer Nitin and on his instructions, he handed over the cash to company manager Ramesh Bhatia. He later handed over the cheque to Mahesh at Model Town here and collected Rs 10 lakh in cash from him and kept it inside his bag. When Dixit was on his way to Faridabad at around 6 PM, a man in Sarai Kale Khan area came from behind, threatened him with a blunt object and sat behind his two-wheeler, he told police. He said two other men on another motorcycle also followed him. When they reached near Bara Pulla Flyover, the three men robbed Rs 10 lakh from Dixit’s bag and fled with his mobile phone.Based on a complaint lodged by Dixit, a case was registered under IPC section 392 (Punishment for robbery) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and an investigation was initiated, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said.During the investigation, Dixit’s employer was examined. When Dixit was taken to recreate the scene of the crime at the place of incident, he started changing his statement and tried to frequently convince the investigators. On finding contradictions in his statements, Dixit was examined again and during cross-questioning, he confessed to committing the crime to take revenge from Nitin, he added. “Dixit disclosed that he has been serving his employer for a very long time. Despite that, his employer is not increasing his salary and the earnings didn’t meet his needs. Once, his employer had slapped him and also let him down publicly. In revenge, he decided to teach him a lesson by usurping the collection money of his company and concocting a story of robbery before police and his employer,” the DCP said. On his instance, the entire looted cash of Rs 10 lakh was recovered from his house, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upset-over-not-getting-a-salary-hike-man-stages-robbery-to-take-revenge-from-employer/story-OMGyK6w4mHLitj6d3sXAbM.html

The man who was identified as Jyotirmayi Vijayavargiya, a resident of Shalimar Township in Indore, had several mobile phone numbers. These numbers on different mobile phones were saved in different names including ‘IPS’, certain influential political leaders etc to convince people about his ‘credentials’. The person whom he called from any of these mobile phone numbers used to see his fake name on a particular App which is used to identify the names of unknown callers, said the officer. Police said he acquired the SUV fraudulently a couple of years back. He gave a cheque of Rs 14 lakh to the owner of the car to “buy” it but the cheque bounced. He is facing at least three criminal cases in Mumbai and Indore for committing fraud. Superintendent of police, STF Geetesh Garg said, “We got information from a toll plaza employee in Ujjain that a man in a Fortuner car was not paying the required toll tax while introducing himself as IPS officer Vipin Maheshwari. On this, a team of STF was sent to the toll booth and detained the man to find that he was impersonating an IPS officer. During questioning we found that he had also cheated several people by telling that he was a relative of a BJP leader. He bought the car from one Rajiv Arya who is also from Indore for Rs 14 lakh but the cheque he gave Arya bounced.” The officer said more than 100 cheque books were seized from the residence of the accused. He was operating through the bank accounts of his servants also. “An FIR under sections 170, 419 and 420 of IPC has been registered against him. We are trying to find out how many persons have been victims of this man”, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conman-who-impersonated-ips-officer-runs-out-of-luck-at-toll-plaza-in-ujjain/story-lsBynZhhrMT4iLkC3MUW5K.html

16-08-2020||India||Locked for five months, shrines in J-K finally reopen||Some prominent religious places including shrines opened in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday for prayers after remaining closed for over five months to contain the spread of novel coronavirus.People offered daily prayers in some shrines and mosques in Kashmir Valley but took precautions like maintaining social distance and wearing masks. Small mosques in the mohallas and interior areas had already opened up in the last few weeks but few devotees were showing up for prayers. On Sunday, for the first time in five months people offered prayers in congregation in prominent shrines like Dastigeer Sahib in the Old City. People also said that they visited Khanqah-e-Moula shrine on the banks of Jhelum.“We offered congregation prayer for the first time since mid-March in the afternoon today. Alhamdulillah all SOPs were followed. There was a good response from the people and they took precautions,” said Syed Khalid Geelani, Sajadah Nasheen (one of the caretakers) of Dastigeer Sahib shrine.People were upbeat. “Everybody is aware of the importance of precautions during this pandemic. Though we used to offer prayers in our local mosques for the last few weeks but opening of these shrines fills us with hope and gives us solace,” said Bilal Ahmad, a resident of Old City.But not every mosque opened on Sunday. Kashmir’s biggest mosque Jamia Masjid in Nawhatta was still closed and will open on August 18. “In coming couple of days the mosque will be opened after a cleanliness drive,” said a caretaker of the mosque. Some urged fellow citizens not to indulge in ‘blind fatalism’. “Blessed are we that these places have opened. I am so happy. But at the same time people should continue to take precautions. Their opening does not mean that the pandemic is over. People should continue to wear masks, take their own prayer rugs to the mosques, avoid handshakes, use sanitizers and maintain social distancing. Only then they should leave it to God,” said Yaqoob Ahmad, an Imam of a local mosque in Srinagar.Officials also urged people not to lower their guard. “Community response holds the key to fighting Pandemic. Glad to see observance of SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) as religious places opened today after 5 months. Hopeful about industry, business & transport to follow the pursuit,” wrote Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Shahid Chaudhary on Twitter.On August 4, the government had announced that all religious places and places of worship would be reopened from August 16 but detailed Covid-19 SOPs would have to be to followed like no large gatherings and no touching of statues.In the run up to the reopening of religious places, the district administration had reached out to managing committees of places of worship of all faiths and held meetings with over 3,000 religious heads to sensitise them about do’s and don’ts to prevent spread of Covid-19.The Covid-19 tally in Jammu and Kashmir crossed 28,000 on Saturday evening. Kashmir valley alone has over 21,000 of the cases. That pandemic has taken the lives of 527 people in the union territory out of which 486 casualties have been in Kashmir. Markets to reopen Officials said that from Monday markets will reopen and public transport services will resume operations according to a regulated schedule in Srinagar.In an order, Deputy Commissioner Chaudhary lifted restrictions on business and transport operations allowing a regulated resumption.The Jammu and Kashmir administration had re-imposed lockdown restrictions in Srinagar from July 13 and rest of the valley from July 27 as Covid-19 cases surged.After a State Executive Committee order on August 4, officials have permitted reopening of 50 per cent shops in all markets and resumption of public transport operations with a boarding of 50 per cent passengers in minibuses and up to a maximum of 4 passengers in 10-seater maxi-cabs and 2 passengers in taxicabs and auto-rickshaws.In all markets, alternate shops will open so as to prevent crowding and to enable queuing of customers as per the advised distancing norm. “The district administration has full faith in the business and trading communities of the district and is sure that there will be strict compliance with all SOPs and guidelines like wearing of face masks and observance of distancing while going about their businesses,” Chaudhary said.As for transport, not more than a third of the total number of vehicles will be allowed to operate on a particular route. There are around 80 designated public transport routes in Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locked-for-five-months-shrines-in-kashmir-finally-reopen/story-bTxBOwgezh7TXvRBsdZbhL.html
16-08-2020||India||Ravi Shankar Prasad says Rahul Gandhi’s attack on RSS, BJP relies on a myth, asks a counter question||Senior BJP leader and Union minister for electronics and information technology and communications, Ravi Shankar Prasad, on Sunday launched a counter attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for alleging that the BJP and RSS spread fake news and hatred using social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp to influence the electorate.Prasad said that Gandhi’s party had no locus standi to question the BJP given previous allegations of Congress having used online platforms to influence elections in India.“Losers who cannot influence people even in their own party keep cribbing that the entire world is controlled by BJP and RSS. You were caught red-handed in alliance with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook to weaponise data before the elections and now have the gall to question us?,” Prasad tweeted in response to Gandhi.In 2018, UK based Cambridge Analytica was at the centre of a controversy linked to Facebook data breach of around 50 million users in the US to benefit Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower had told British lawmakers that he “believed” the Congress party in India was a client of the company at the regional level.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi had referred to a WSJ report quoting unnamed sources to claim that the social media giant had been lenient on alleged hate speeches by BJP leaders in order to protect their business prospects in India.Also Read: Report on Facebook’s leniency to BJP members’ communal posts causes row“BJP and RSS control Facebook & Whatsapp in India. They spread fake news and hatred through it and use it to influence the electorate. Finally, the American media has come out with the truth about Facebook,” Rahul’s tweet had said.The WSJ cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders to suggest that the company’s senior official and India policy executive Ankhi Das had intervened in internal content review processes to stop a ban on BJP’s Telangana MLA T Raja Singh, who made communally charged posts targeting the Muslim community.The report claimed that Das, “told staff members that punishing violations by politicians from Mr. Modi’s party would damage the company’s business prospects in the country”.Facebook has, however, denied the claims made in the WSJ report and stated that it adopts a uniform policy on hate speeches across the world irrespective of the party, position or stature of the individual or organization involved.The BJP, too, responded to the report and said the party didn’t approve of the comment made by Telangana MLA and disassociates itself with comments that call for violence or are not in line with the party’s official stance.Prasad in fact asked Rahul Gandhi if he had condemned the recent communal violence in Bengaluru? “The fact is that today access to information and freedom of expression has been democratized. It is no longer controlled by retainers of your family and that is why it hurts. Btw, haven’t yet heard your condemnation of the Bangalore riots. Where did your courage disappear?,” Prasad asked in his second tweet addressed to Gandhi.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi lands another jibe over China, it’s a comment on PM ModiMembers of the minority community were involved in incidents of violence late on August 7 in Bengaluru over an offending social media post allegedly put out by Congress MLA Srinivasa Murthy’s kin, who has since claimed that his account was hacked. Three people had died and scores were injured in the Bengaluru riots that also included an attack on the local Congress MLA’s house. He had to flee to save his life from rioters. The BJP has accused the Congress of appeasing one community by not condemning the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ravi-shankar-prasad-says-rahul-gandhi-s-attack-on-rss-bjp-relies-on-a-myth-asks-a-counter-question/story-TH9ROcnyIz4nTDbBdnvbWM.html
16-08-2020||India||Rlys generates more than 5.5 lakh mandays of work under PM Modi’s jobs scheme in 6 states||Indian Railways has generated more than 5.5 lakhs mandays of work under the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the railways ministry said in a statement on Sunday.It said railways minister Piyush Goyal is closely monitoring the progress of these projects and generation of work opportunities for the migrant labours of these states under this scheme. “Around 165 railway infrastructure projects are being executed in these states worth Rs 2,988 crore. Till August 14, 2020, 11,296 workers have been engaged in this Abhiyaan and the payment of Rs 1,336.84 crore has been released to the contractors for the projects being implemented,” the statement said.The railways has appointed nodal officers in each district as well as in the states to establish a close coordination with the state governments. It said Goyal has directed railway administration at zonal level to act proactively to ensure migrants are engaged in projects and paid accordingly.The railways has identified a number of works which are being executed under this scheme. “The works are related to (i) construction and maintenance of approach roads for level crossings, (ii) development & cleaning of silted waterways, trenches and drains along the track, (iii) construction and maintenance of approach road to railway stations, (iv) repair and widening of existing railway embankments / cuttings, (v) plantation of trees at extreme boundary of railway land and (vi) protection works of existing embankments/ cuttings/bridges,” it said.On June 20, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan to empower and provide livelihood opportunities in areas/villages where a large number of migrant workers had returned during the lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The Prime Minister announced that an amount of Rs 50,000 crore would be spent for building durable rural infrastructure under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan.The scheme which is for 125 days, is being undertaken in mission mode, and involves focused implementation of 25 categories of works/ activities in 116 districts, each with a large concentration of returnee migrant workers in 6 states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. “Public works being undertaken during this campaign will have a resource envelope of Rs. 50,000 crore,” the Railways said.The scheme is a convergent effort involving 12 different ministries and departments to expedite implementation of 25 public infrastructure works and works relating to augmentation of livelihood opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-generates-more-than-5-5-lakh-mandays-of-work-under-pm-modi-s-jobs-scheme-in-6-states/story-jzXznzutkTUkrmXcLxbGkJ.html
16-08-2020||India||‘Responsible and responsive’: Solicitor General lauds PM for Covid fight||The “responsible and responsive” leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has helped India fight the Covid crisis with minimal damage, said solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta on Sunday, adding it is unimaginable as to what would have transpired if the country was under any other leadership.Mehta, the Centre’s second senior-most law officer, said each and every step to deal with Covid-19 was taken by the government in a methodical and scientific manner. He further said that there were guidelines in place to deal with every aspect of the epidemic.“But for the responsible and responsive leadership of our prime minister, I don’t think we could have passed through this international crisis with the minimum damage which was unavoidable. Shudder to even imagine what would have happened under any other leadership,” Mehta said while speaking at a virtual session organised by Akhil Bhartiya Adhivakta Parishad. As the face of the Central government before the Supreme Court in various Covid related petitions, Mehta said he has witnessed first hand the ways in which the government has tackled coronavirus.“I have gone through each and every aspect of the Covid management undertaken by this government and I can tell that you will not be able to identify or pinpoint any particular area where the government did not touch upon and warn (beforehand), those who were supposed to manage the situation. Each and every ministry, including commerce, finance, telecom, agriculture, health and home had guidelines in place,” Mehta said.Whenever petitions used to come before court, I used to find that the government had specific guidelines in place in the context of Covid, he added.Mehta underscored that he was not making political statements to curry favour but was speaking as a citizen and a lawyer who had the opportunity to witness the functioning of the government and the steps taken by them to counter the pandemic.To detractors, Mehta said the judiciary was accessible to each and every citizen even during lockdown, adding if there is still criticism it showed deliberate indifference and ignorance by such persons about the situation.The Supreme Court had come under fire during the initial months of the lockdown for its refusal to entertain cases related to Covid and the government’s handling of the same. Former judges, the members of the civil society and many senior lawyers had faulted the top court for accepting the government word on Covid management, particularly the adversities faced by migrant workers, without verifying the government claims. Mehta was the government lawyer in many of these cases and some of his arguments in those matters had also come under scrutiny. “I don’t think there would be any democracy as large as India in the world where the judiciary has functioned on a daily basis giving access to justice to everyone in the country – right from trial court to Supreme Court and I can vouch for the Supreme Court,” Mehta said.The Supreme Court, he said, functioned on a daily basis throughout the lockdown starting from March 25.“The judges of the Supreme Court, many of whom are more than 60 years old, have not taken a single day off. They could have said that their age may not permit them to expose themselves to Covid. But they worked with all precautions which could have been taken. Many petitions before the Supreme Court were avoidable ones and the court had the freedom to impose fine (on the petitioners) but it refrained from doing (so) considering the circumstances,” Mehta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/responsible-and-responsive-solicitor-general-lauds-pm-for-covid-fight/story-7vTBHQc4NH1ADo8nivqsjP.html

India had signed similar bilateral pacts with Germany and France in July.Vistara got its second B787-9 wide-body aircraft on Saturday. It had received its first B787-9 aircraft in February.“Vistara has already got the slots at the Heathrow airport in London. The flights between Delhi and London are likely to be announced in the next few days,” an industry source told PTI.The Delhi-London flight is likely to operate thrice a week, the source added.A wide-body aircraft has a bigger fuel tank that allows it to operate long-haul flights. Vistara has 43 planes in its fleet, of which 41 are narrow-body aircraft like A320neo and B737-800NG.The full-service carrier is also likely to operate flights between India and Germany and India and France, another aviation industry source said, adding that the probable destinations for these flights are Frankfurt and Paris respectively.It is not clear which Indian cities will be connected to Frankfurt and Paris by Vistara.The private carrier did not respond to the queries sent by PTI on the matter.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 amid the coronavirus pandemic.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic. All airlines in India have opted for cost-reducing measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to conserve cash.India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25 after a gap of two months. The airlines have been allowed to operate a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights.However, the occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vistara-likely-to-start-flights-from-india-to-uk-germany-france/story-mihfvkcj7UBcBpWIzBJ3GL.html

Experts and senior forest officials have been sent to the spot and an investigation has started,” additional principal chief conservator (APCF), wildlife, Arun Kumar Pandey told Hindustan Times. The officer added that the body has been sent for autopsy. “The cause of death is yet to be known and we will be able to tell anything only after an autopsy report,” said Pandey. This is the eighth elephant death in the state in the last three months.In June, six elephants died in four districts of the state. While the carcasses of two tuskers were recovered from the Pratappur forest range in Surajpur district, another elephant was found dead in neighbouring Balrampur district. Two elephants were electrocuted in Dharamjaigarh under Raigarh district and a calf died after getting stuck in a marshland in Dhamtari district. One elephant died in July in Jashpur district of the state. Following the fatalities, the state forest department in July issued orders to divisional forest officer (DFO) of Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh district, where maximum elephants were electrocuted in the last ten years, to take necessary steps to contain such incidents. The order said that the forest department should ensure that the 11 KV electric line, which has been instrumental in causing the deaths, should be 7.5 meters above the ground-level and insulated electric wires should be used in these areas. The department also directed the forest officers to coordinate with Chhattisgarh State Power Corporation and find out each and every illegal connection or live wire in these areas. As per the Chhattisgarh forest department, in the last decade the state has recorded an increase in the wildlife population including elephants, whose number rose from 225 to 290. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel recently issued necessary guidelines for the monitoring of wild animals in the state forests and improving measures for their conservation. North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants, which roam in plains of the state. Several reports of human-elephant conflicts have surfaced in the last few years in the region. A Union environment ministry report released last week said at least 500 people and 100 elephants die in India due to human-elephant conflict annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carcass-of-wild-elephant-found-in-chhattisgarh-s-surajpur-district-probe-ordered/story-HVTLu9GTOoMF0b2awXp66M.html

Alleging that the list of guests who attended the Independence Day programme at the governor’s residence was leaked out “electronically” on August 14, Dhankhar said, “Raj Bhawan is under surveillance. This should not happen. How can an office of the Constitution be under surveillance? I will take legal steps once our inquiry is over.” “Public servants do not get into political mode. Nobody is above law,” said Dhankhar, indirectly referring to those under suspicion. Dhankhar made the comments during his media address at a function organized at Raj Bhawan to mark the second death anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. He also criticized chief minister Mamata Banerjee for not attending the At Home function at the Raj Bhawan on Independence Day.Making another serious allegation, Dhankhar said, “There is lawlessness in the state…. There was a killing in Hooghly district (on August 15)… The dangerous head of Maoism is getting visible with support of state actors.” The TMC reacted sharply, saying the allegations were unfounded. “Our governor has made unfounded allegations. If he thinks that he is under surveillance then he should give proof. The guest list is no secret. Any employee of Raj Bhawan could have accessed it,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. In a rebuttal to Dhankhar’s allegation that Banerjee set a “bad precedent” by not attending the tea party at Raj Bhawan on August 15, “After the morning parade the chief minister paid a visit to Raj Bhawan with the chief secretary, home secretary and other top officials. She did not attend the afternoon tea party. She has never been in favour of attending gatherings in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even we have been asked not to attend Parliamentary meetings in Delhi. The state government advised Raj Bhawan to keep the gathering small. The governor is making an issue out of nothing.” “The duties of a chief minister are outlined in Section 167 of the Constitution. Nowhere is it written that a chief minister has to attend all programmes at Raj Bhawan. It is the governor who is breaking norms and protocols,” said Roy. Dhankhar did not name anyone in his Sunday address when he talked of the return of Maoism but political observers said he was possibly referring to Chhatradhar Mahato, the tribal leader from Jhargram district who headed the Peoples’ Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), an alleged Maoists-backed outfit during the last years of Left rule. Mahato, who was released from jail after 10 years in February this year after the Kolkata high court commuted his life sentence, was inducted into the TMC state committee on July 23 by Mamata Banerjee.“The governor’s comment is unfortunate and unfounded. Except for Maoist leader Kishenji, who was killed in an encounter, the government did not use any strong arm tactics to contain Maoism. Bengal is the only state where Maoism was controlled with development,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-bhawan-under-surveillance-maoism-returning-to-bengal-governor-dhankhar/story-BeVnXm9wczQyAWO3I5lXyI.html

The anti drugs enforcement agencies of five BRICS nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – also discussed steps to keep a check on smuggling of drugs through maritime route, it said. “The 4th Session of the BRICS Anti-Drug Working Group comprising of Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa and India was held this week. The Indian delegation was led by Rakesh Asthana (Director General, Narcotics Control Bureau) and comprised of B. Radhika, Deputy Director General (Ops), NCB, Vrindaba Gohil, First Secretary (Trade) - Embassy of India, Moscow; Dr. Vaibhav Tandale, Under Secretary (Multilateral Economic Relations), MEA and KPS Malhotra, Deputy Director (Ops), NCB,” statement by Press Information Bureau read.

Misuse of darknet and other advanced technologies for drug trafficking was one of the key focal areas of the meeting,” it added. The government further added that “the member nations adopted a communiqué that covered all the points discussed in the meeting”. BRICS is an informal group of states comprising the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa. “The growing economic might of BRICS countries, their significance as one of the main driving forces of global economic development, their substantial population and abundant natural resources form the foundation of their influence on the international scene and are the driving forces behind the grouping. Among other areas of collaboration, matters pertaining to drug trafficking is an important area of cooperation among the BRICS member states,” the PIB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-raises-drugs-smuggling-misuse-of-darknet-at-brics-meet/story-YV66Jay3J2pqXHWH3gsJvK.html

We are just preaching about being aatmanirbhar,” Raut said.Noting that Ram temple trust head Mahant Nritya Gopal Das has tested positive for coronavirus, Raut sought to know if Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who shook hands with Das during the temple’s ground-breaking function in Ayodhya on August 5, will quarantine himself.Former President Pranab Mukherjee, who has tested coronavirus positive, is in a critical condition and some ministers and bureaucrats in the Modi government have also tested positive for the viral infection, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-has-shown-it-is-aatmanirbhar-india-just-talking-about-it-sanjay-raut/story-EVl5DyBT35iSCqmc2XFPhL.html

WI). Surveys show that the number of GIB has reduced by 75 percent in the last 30 years.Also read: 875 fresh cases take Rajasthan’s Covid-19 tally to over 60,000To conserve the critically endangered GIB, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) launched the project, ‘Habitat Improvement and Conservation Breeding of Great Indian Bustard: An Integrated Approach’, during March 2016 in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Rajasthan forest department and NGOs with the financial support from the National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority Funds.An official familiar with the project said that the temporary conservation breeding centre (CSC) at Sam (Jaisalmer) is functioning well and till date 10 eggs of GIB have hatched.Meanwhile, Gujarat has recently placed a demand for GIB male chicks.“Yes, during the recent review of the GIB’s conservation efforts through video conferencing, we had made such a proposal before the MoEFCC officials. In 2016, there were 25 GIB individuals in Gujarat but now only 5-7 GIB individuals (all females) are being reported. Gujarat needs permission for re-introduction of male GIB chicks from Rajasthan, but no decision was taken on it so far,” said Sanjay Sisodia, additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Gujarat.Will Rajasthan consider Gujarat’s demand? At present, according to officials, the answer is “no” and it will depend on the future results of conservation breeding.“We do not have male chicks available right now, so we cannot respond to it right now. Conservation breeding of the GIBs is going on in the state, making the founder population. Our focus is on the next generation, a reproduction of the founder Population, for which we will have to wait for five years. If the next generation’s production is as expected, then we will be able to consider Gujarat’s demand, Karnataka’s or any other state,” said Arindam Tomar, additional principal chief conservator and chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan.He added, as per the project design of conservation breeding, we cannot share the founder population with anyone. Not everyone will be able to take care of it. After the production of the next generation, we will not mind giving any chick in favourable condition, because it is a national asset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-seeks-male-great-indian-bustard-chicks-from-rajasthan/story-FqE28O7kfC2ccNETy7o4fK.html
16-08-2020||India||2 arrested in connection with Bulandshahr topper’s death case in UP||The Bulandshahr police have arrested two people in connection with the death of US scholar Sudeeksha Bhati, 19, who died in a road accident on August 10. The suspects were identified as Deepak Solanki, a resident of Gulaothi, and his accomplice Raju, a resident of Bulandshahr dehat. The police have recovered the Royal Enfield motorcycle used in the accident. The police said its investigation revealed this was a case of road accident and not of harassment. Santosh Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police, Bulandshahr, said on Sunday the police scanned over 350 bikes from nearby areas and questioned over 1000 persons before zeroing in on them. “The police scanned 12 CCTV cameras and found Sudeeksha and her cousin going on a bike at 8.25 am. The same camera captured an Enfield rider Solanki at 8.17 am on the same route. About 150 metres ahead, Solanki picked up his accomplice Raju from near Arif Hospital. The duo stopped at a petrol pump for fuel and Sudeeksha’s bike crossed the way,” he said. “The two bikes were moving in the same direction. The two motorcycles travelled 10.5 kilometres in 9 minutes on a busy road. This shows that both the motorcycles were speeding,” he said. Solanki admitted that he was riding the motorcycle on August 10 when the accident took place, said police. Solanki said that a tempo traveller going ahead suddenly applied brakes because a bullock cart was in its way. The bullock cart owner Kamal Singh was also traced who said that he was going with his wife Saroj to sell wheat in the Aurangabad Mandi. “We have seized the Royal Enfield motorcycle used in the accident. The suspect had also modified the motorcycle’s number plate, silencer, indicator, etc,” said police. On August 10, Bhati, who was due to return to the United States, had gone to Bulandshahr with her uncle Satyendra and cousin on a motorcycle to meet her relatives. Sudeeksha Bhati, a tea seller’s daughter, was a district topper in Bulandshahr in 2018. She had scored 98% in her Class 12 examination in 2018 and was awarded a scholarship to study at Babson College, Wellesley, Massachusetts.The family had alleged that she was harassed by two men before she died in a tragic road accident. Her uncle Manoj Bhati earlier told reporters that the two men started “performing stunts near them” and would overtake them, then let them pass. At one point, the men stopped their bike just in front of their two-wheeler. Manoj Bhati said he applied the brakes but nevertheless, lost control. Sudeeksha sustained injuries and died later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-arrested-in-connection-with-bulandshahr-topper-s-death-case-in-up/story-1MxyIA4vYD23BikZhtWZVN.html

Suppressing her grief, N Maheswari, an Armed Reserve police inspector led the parade presenting the guard of honour to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish and Police Superintendent N Manivannan at the Palayamkottai VVC grounds here. “Though she learnt of her father’s death on August 14 night, she went for the funeral only after completing the parade (on Saturday morning) with a sense of patriotism,” a police release said. The police department said it was proud of her for placing duty for the country above personal sentiments and grief. Through the parade ceremony, the young officer did not exhibit any emotions of personal loss and led the contingent of police personnel with grace and dignity. The inspector’s 83-year old father Narayanasamy died in Dindigul district, over 200 kilometres from here and she left for his last rites after completing her duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-woman-cop-puts-father-s-funeral-on-wait-mode-leads-i-day-parade/story-TP7WOIe4iODhcGZfxjJCYJ.html

In case idols are to be painted, only water-soluble and non-toxic natural dyes should be used,” it said.Paints, colours and dyes used in making idols contain hazardous chemicals such as mercury, zinc oxide, chromium, lead and cadmium which harm aquatic life and can cause cancer, respiratory ailments and skin infections among humans.Several studies conducted to assess the impact of idol immersion have revealed deterioration of water quality in terms of conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and heavy metal concentration.BOD is the amount of oxygen required by bacteria to decompose organic matter in water. Clean water has a BOD value of less than 5 ppm, whereas highly polluted water has a BOD value of 17 ppm or more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-idol-immersion-community-celebrations-this-ganesh-chaturthi-delhi-pollution-body/story-mipTpH3yy5jj9xBScByFfL.html
16-08-2020||India||India sends equipment, personnel to Mauritius to contain oil spill||India has sent equipment and personnel to help Mauritius contain an oil spill after a Japanese bulk carrier ran aground on a reef on its south-east coast last month, the ministry of external affairs said on Sunday.The ministry said more than 30 tonnes of technical equipment and material on board an aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) has been sent to the island country “to supplement the country’s ongoing oil spill containment and salvage operations.”“The specialized equipment, consisting of Ocean Booms, River Booms, Disc Skimmers, Heli Skimmers, Power packs, Blowers, Salvage barge and Oil absorbent Graphene pads and other accessories, is specifically designed to contain the oil slick, skim oil from water, and assist in clean up and salvage operations,” MEA said in a statement.It also said that a 10-member technical response team, consisting of specially-trained Indian Coast Guard (ICG) personnel to deal with oil spill containment measures, has also been deployed to Mauritius to “extend necessary technical and operational assistance at the site”. MV Wakashio struck a coral reef on July 25, spilling about 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil and endangering corals, fish and other marine life in what some scientists have called the country’s worst ecological disaster.Authorities said on Saturday that the Japanese vessel has broken apart. The condition of the MV Wakashio was worsening early on Saturday and it split by the afternoon, the Mauritius National Crisis Committee said.“India’s assistance is in line with it’s policy to extend humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to its neighbours in the Indian Ocean region, guided by the Prime Minister’s vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region),” according to the statement.The urgent assistance reflects the close bonds of friendship between India and Mauritius and India’s abiding commitment to assist the people of Mauritius in need, MEA said.India had recently sent essential medicines, a special consignment of Ayurvedic medicines as well as a medical assistance team as part of SAGAR to help to Mauritius in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-equipment-personnel-to-mauritius-to-contain-oil-spill/story-I3NtjaMPJT1Wso85ljTmlN.html
16-08-2020||India||Supreme Court urges consumer forum to look into grievance of year-long adjournments||The Supreme Court has urged the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to ensure timely disposal of cases before it after the top court’s attention was drawn to a matter, which was adjourned by the forum for nearly a year.The top court did not pass any concrete directions to NCDRC and instead left it to the administrative authority of the forum’s president, justice RK Agrawal, to ensure that allocation of work and disposal of cases take place in a streamlined manner.“We consider it proper and appropriate to request the president of the NCDRC to look into the grievance and to take an institutional decision on the administrative side,” a division bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud said on Friday.NCDRC is a body established under the Consumer Protection Act to hear consumer complaints. It hears appeals against various State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions established at the state level. The NCDRC, as per the Consumer Protection Act of 2019, is also empowered to hear cases directly if the value of the good or services involved is more than Rs 10 crore. Earlier, it was Rs 1 crore as per the Consumer Protection Act of 1986. Appeals against decisions of NCDRC go to the Supreme Court.The top court was hearing one such appeal filed by an Uttar Pradesh-based jewellery retailer, LM Jewellers, against an order passed by the forum on February 28, 2020, adjourning a complaint filed by it to January 5, 2021. The petitioner submitted that adjournment of the case for nearly a year defeats the purpose of the Consumer Protect Act which is to ensure speedy resolution of consumer cases.Petitioner’s counsel, Nikhil Jain, said such orders were being passed by the forum as a matter of routine and a pattern had emerged of granting long adjournments. He pointed out another case in which NCDRC, on February 26, 2020, adjourned the hearing of a case to March 3, 2021, when a request for adjournment was made on the ground that the arguing counsel was unwell.The Supreme Court noted that the functioning of various tribunals has been hampered due to lack of adequate infrastructure and judges, prompting them to give long adjournments.“This court is cognizant of the fact that several tribunals suffer from a lack of adequate infrastructure including of judges to discharge adjudicatory functions. Hence, the presiding judges allocate dates on the basis of a realistic assessment of when cases can be disposed of when they are listed for final disposal,” the bench, which also comprised justice KM Joseph, observed.But it allowed the petitioner to raise the issue before the president of NCDRC so that appropriate steps can be taken to ensure speedy disposal of cases.“This is an issue on which, it is only proper and appropriate that this court (Supreme Court) should defer to the administrative authority of the president of the NCDRC to ensure that the allocation of work and disposal of cases takes place in a streamlined manner,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-urges-consumer-forum-to-look-into-grievance-of-year-long-adjournments/story-eIouknROhojIcV0b1XB7TO.html

In his weekly column RokhThok in Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana, MP Sanjay Raut questioned if the PM will follow the quarantine regulations.“75-year-old Mahant Nritya was present on the stage on August 5 at the bhoomi pujan ceremony of the Ram Temple. It was clearly seen that he had not covered his face with a mask. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat came in contact with the Mahant. PM Modi held his hand with reverence. So, will our PM will also be quarantined,” Raut asked in his column published on Sunday.Also read: PM Modi leads tributes to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on second death anniversaryRaut also took potshots at the BJP union minister of state Arjun Ram Meghwal, who had made claims that a particular brand of the ubiquitous Indian snack, ‘papad’, had a role in boosting the immunity and antibodies that could help cure Covid-19. “India is stuck in the wave of Bhabhiji Papad, while in Russia a vaccine has been found for Covid-19... This is a lesson on atmanirbharta (self-reliance) shown by Russia. We, on the other hand, will keep giving speeches on Atmanirbharta,” the Sena leader said in a veiled jibe referring to PM Modi’s speech on Atmanirbhar Bharat.The Sena leader, who recently visited New Delhi after a gap of few months said that the capital is in the grip of Covid-19. “At present, Amit Shah is also in isolation after contracting the infection. Even former president Pranab Mukherjee has been tested positive for the virus and his health is also in a worrisome state. At present, all cabinet members, bureaucrats, parliament members are vulnerable to falling prey to the lethal infection. Even during riots and war, Delhi was not so frightened as it is today. The city seems to be a bit more scared now. Although the fear of PM Modi and Shah was already mongering, but the fear of coronavirus is more,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-pm-modi-quarantine-himself-asks-sanjay-raut-after-head-of-ram-temple-trust-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-JgCm7WLYsBIJAteLPJjQiN.html

16-08-2020||India||Missing for 8 months, army jawan’s body found buried under snow near LoC||The body of an Indian army jawan, missing since January, was found on Saturday near the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir. Havaldar Rajendra Singh Negi’s family was subsequently informed about it later that night. He was 36.Negi, who was attached to Indian Army’s 11 Garhwal Rifles, had gone missing in January this year after accidentally slipping into heavy snow while on duty near LoC in Gulmarg area of Kashmir. Failing to find his body, the army had declared him a ‘martyr’ in June and communicated the same to his family in a letter on June 21. However, his wife Rajeshwari Devi had refused to accept him as a martyr saying she won’t do so until she “sees his body with her own eyes”.On Saturday, on the occasion of Independence Day, Negi’s army unit informed his family members about finding his body.Negi’s uncle Raghuveer Singh Negi, who received the call from the army unit, said, “I received the call about the tragic news from his unit on Saturday late evening. They said that his body was found under heavy snow during the search operation.”“They also informed that Negi’s body has been taken to the military hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir, where doctors are conducting the mandatory medical procedures before handing it to us,” said Raghuveer. He said earlier the army authorities informed that the body will reach Dehradun by Sunday evening, but later said it may take ‘two to three days’.“They said, as the body had been under the snow all this while, it may be damaged if it’s suddenly exposed to outer elements. Hence, the doctors would be carrying out some medical process after which it will reach us by August 19,” said Raghuveer. Initially, Negi was feared to have slipped towards the Pakistani side across the LoC after being reported missing on January 8, but later it was denied by the Indian army authorities. Negi, who had joined the army in 2001, hailed from Chamoli district, 147 km from Dehradun, and is survived by his wife and three children. He had shifted to Dehradun about three years ago with his family while his parents still live in their village in Chamoli. His parents would reach Dehradun by Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missing-for-3-months-army-jawan-s-body-found-buried-under-snow-near-loc/story-5wGiZlUF2C4lOrrmJ6K8KI.html

The pilgrimage was suspended on March 18 amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“The first lot of pilgrims chanted religious slogans before embarking upon the pilgrimage. So far around 200 pilgrims have embarked upon the pilgrimage,” said an official of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board.The board has put in place a number of safety measures to deal with the Covid-19 including online registration and social distancing.During the first week of pilgrimage, the Board has fixed a ceiling of 2,000 pilgrims a day--1,900 from within Jammu and Kashmir and remaining 100 from outside the Union Territory.“The situation will be reviewed thereafter and a decision will be taken accordingly. Pilgrims will be allowed to undertake the yatra only after online registration,” said the Board CEO, Ramesh Kumar.Pilgrims are required to install the Aarogya Setu App on their mobile phones before proceeding for the yatra. It will be mandatory for them to wear face masks. Children below the age of 10 years, pregnant women, persons with co-morbidities and persons above the age of 60 years have been advised to avoid the yatra in the interest of their own safety.Later as and when the situation normalises, the advisory for this group shall be revisited.The CEO added that the yatra is being allowed to move in a unidirectional manner. “The traditional route from Katra to Bhawan via Banganga, Adhkuwari and Sanjichhat is being used for going up and Himkoti route-Tarakote Marg will be used for coming back from the Bhawan,” he said.The Covid test reports of the pilgrims from outside J&K and red zones of J&K are being checked at the helipad and yatra entry points at Darshani Deodi, Banganga and Katra.“Only those with negative reports are being allowed to move towards the Bhawan. Ponies, pithus and palkis will not be allowed to ply on the tracks, initially,” he informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaishno-devi-pilgrimage-resumes-2-000-people-to-be-allowed-every-day/story-hQ8YiU2cHjUQsCwhNg4R8N.html

Law & order further nosedived with rise in political violence & killing,” the governor tweeted.He also said the Raj Bhavan “At Home was well attended” and wrote about the guest list which included Calcutta High Court chief justice TN Radhakrishnan, justice Sanjib Banerjee, justice Indra Prasanna Mukerji, Congress’ Abdul Mannan, left leader Sujan Chakraborty, top brass from defence and para military and dignitaries among others.In his earlier tweets, the governor said Banerjee’s absence from the event had “stunned” him. “Absence of CM and officials @MamataOfficial on occasion of Independence Day celebration at Raj Bhawan has like many startled and stunned me. We need to rise to occasion as respect to freedom fighters who gave their all to secure for us freedom and democracy. I am at a loss for words,” Dhakhar had tweeted after the party.“The vacant seat meant for CM @MamataOfficial at celebration of Independence Day at Raj Bhawan speaks volumes -has created unwholesome situation that is not in sync with rich culture and ethos of WB.“There is just no rationale for this unbecoming stance,” Dhankhar tweeted along with a photograph where he was seen sitting next to the vacant chair meant for Banerjee.He said that the traditional “At Home” programme was organised keeping in mind the Covid-19 protocol of maintaining social distance and less than 35 people were invited. “...It would have been befitting if CM and officials @MamataOfficial had participated. Their action not in sync with sanctity of occasion,” he tweeted.The Banerjee-led government and the governor have crossed swords on several occasions before this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bad-precedent-bengal-governor-hits-out-at-mamata-banerjee-over-i-day-event/story-wntZti13ZZ6AyVDnF4LIGI.html

A resident of Nerul, Navi Mumbai, Sakpal was admitted to Naval Hospital Ship Asvini in a critical state and was diagnosed with Covid-19-induced pneumonia a few weeks ago. The Indian Navy said his condition was successfully managed which led to his recovery. Sakpal was accorded a warm farewell at INHS Asvini. The facility is the primary naval healthcare centre for Covid-19 and looks after managing the care of serving and retired Covid-19 patients from the armed forces. Sakpal is among India’s many elderly people who successfully managed to defeat the deadly contagion. Experts have said that the elderly population, especially those above 65 years of age, are more susceptible to contracting the virus.  Also read: Meet India’s strong-willed centenarians who beat Covid-19Sepoy Ramu Laxman Sakpal (Retd) was accorded a warm farewell at INHS Asvini, the primary naval healthcare centre in the war against COVID-19 & managing the care of serving & retired COVID-19 patients from Navy, Army, Air Force & Coast Guard: Indian Navy https://t.co/2CwfjMdrlwJust last month, a similar report made headlines when a 100-year-old woman resident of Huvina Hadagali town in Karnataka’s Bellary district recovered from Covid-19.

16-08-2020||India||India not to give in to any PLA demand over disengagement. Restore status quo ante is the mantra||With the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) drawing up optical fibre cables to the transgressions spots at Pangong Tso and Gogra-Hot Springs, the Indian Army has decided to stay put at dominant positions on the ridge-lines of the Kugrang River till such time China does not restore status quo ante on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Even though PLA’s air activity over Ladakh and occupied Aksai Chin has become negligible, the Chinese army is present in strength across the 1,597-km LAC in Ladakh and showing no signs of any de-escalation. “ While we can see the Chinese intent to turn transgressions into intrusions in both the friction spots, the Indian Army has been directed to foil this PLA design even if it means sitting on the forward positions for time to come,” said a senior military commander.National security planners are quite clear that the May transgressions by PLA in the Ladakh sector had the approval of Chinese Central Military Commission (CMC), headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, as it involved both the Tibetan as well as Xinjiang Military district with troops being inducted from outside the Western Theatre Command.Deciding to put an end to Chinese unchecked expansionism, the Indian Army draws parallel to the 1984 Operation Meghdoot to claim Saltoro Ridge and Siachen Glacier. “We are used to sitting on heights since 1984. Even 36 years later, a full Indian brigade is sitting on the heights and guarding all the ingress points to Siachen glacier from any Pakistani attack. Any unilateral change in ground position on LAC is unacceptable to the Indian Army,” said an Indian diplomat.While Chinese diplomats talk about peace and tranquillity on the LAC, their interlocutors are making unacceptable demands on the Indian Army like asking removal of an old administrative base in Pangong Tso or coming down from heights in Kugrang ridgeline. It is these demands that are couched in diplomatic jargon of meeting India “half-way.”Despite a number of meetings at both military and diplomatic level, the Xi Jinping regime is adamant on its positions and posture on LAC with all dialogues showing hardly any progress.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech virtually made it clear that India was ready for two front aggression—from the Line of Control with Pakistan to LAC expansion by China. The speech was also signal to both the neighbours that India will not back down and stand up to aggression on its own. And in both the cases, the border flare-ups have been coupled with the progress (in this case regress) in bilateral ties.“Whether China wants the $80 billion bilateral trade with India which is hugely tilted in favour of Beijing to steadily come down is a call that Xi Jinping’s military ambition has to take. The ball is in the Chinese court,” summed up another Indian diplomat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-to-give-in-to-any-pla-demand-over-disengagement-and-de-escalation-restore-status-quo-ante-is-the-mantra/story-2GR8fbhawl8SjAGUX7eQbN.html

He added that those from Covid-19 red zones will be given permission for the pilgrimage only if they provide negative test reports. It will be mandatory for the pilgrims to wear face mask and install the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones before proceeding for the yatra.The CEO added that the yatra will move in a unidirectional manner. “The traditional route from Katra to Bhawan via Banganga, Adhkuwari and Sanjichhat will be used for going up and Himkoti route-Tarakote Marg will be used for coming back from the Bhawan,” he said on Saturday.Expressing happiness at the reopening of the temple for devotees, a pilgrim said that it was important to follow rules during the Covid-19 pandemic.“I’m happy that people can visit the temple once again,” Prashant Sharma, one of the first pilgrims to visit the shrine was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“The shrine management has laid out the rules clearly, and pilgrims are also following them properly. It is important to follow rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. If rules are not followed then the darshans will be closed soon,” added Sharma.A massive sanitisation campaign was launched by the shrine board right from Katra to Bhawan before the resumption of the pilgrimage.The shrine board has said that the cap on the number of visitors to the temple will be reviewed after the first week and a decision will be taken accordingly.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mata-vaishno-devi-shrine-reopens-for-devotees-after-5-months-covid-19-curbs-in-place/story-l4x9KreEhkyyIEhTnBJZ5O.html

Three of the accused are foreigner women,” the police said in a statement.The police have booked the organisers and the attendees for endangering public safety, organising the party during the coronavirus pandemic as well as violating sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. The party was organised by foreigners.Earlier an ‘underground’ party organised by ‘rich kids’ in Goa came to light after a brawl spilled onto the streets prompting the police to book the organisers.Tourism in Goa which has taken a huge hit on account of the coronavirus pandemic and which has brought the party scene to a halt has gone underground at a smaller scale. Tourists too have begun to return since the state has reopened for visitors but in limited numbers and mainly those who are willing to drive down for fear of contracting the virus while travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-police-bust-underground-rave-party-seize-drugs-worth-rs-9-lakh/story-EnWSeMTxxefC4Gelw1yduK.html

16-08-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi lands another jibe over China, it’s a comment on PM Modi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has led his party’s relentless attack on the government over the border stand-off with China, hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue on Sunday once again.“Everybody believes in the capability and valour of the Indian army. Except the PM: Whose cowardice allowed China to take our land,” Gandhi tweeted.Gandhi and the Congress have been critical of the government over the handling of the situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China after 20 Indian Army soldiers, including an officer, were killed on June 15 by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. He and his party have been questioning the government over its claim that China did not occupy or intrude into India.Congress had criticised PM Modi for not naming China in his Independence Day speech on Saturday, asking the government to tell people how it proposes to push back Chinese forces occupying Indian territory.“We all are proud of our armed, paramilitary and police forces. We 1.3 billion Indians and all Congress workers are proud of them. Whenever there has been an attack on us, they have given a befitting reply to the attackers,” Congress’ chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, told reporters after the flag hoisting ceremony at the party headquarters.“But we must also think why our rulers are scared of taking China’s name. Today, on the Independence Day, when China has occupied our territory, every Indian should ask the government how it proposes to push the Chinese forces back and protect our territorial integrity. Why are those who are sitting in power scared of mentioning China’s name?” he asked.Surjewala’s comments came after the Prime Minister, in his Independence Day speech, delivered a sharp message to China and Pakistan, declaring that the armed forces deployed along the borders with the two countries have given a fitting reply to those who sought to challenge India’s sovereignty. However, he did not name the two countries.On Friday, Gandhi had claimed that the country will have to pay a “huge price”.“GOI is scared to face up to Chinese intentions in Ladakh. Evidence on the ground indicates that China is preparing and positioning itself. PM’s personal lack of courage and the media’s silence will result in India paying a huge price,” he had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-lands-another-jibe-over-china-it-s-a-comment-on-pm-modi/story-TVS8wcJKExz4TEU9u2ddXI.html

While some societies have turned their community centres and gyms into ‘safe homes’ equipped with isolation beds and oxygen cylinders, others have tied up with private hospitals to ensure that residents who test positive get admission and ambulance service. “We have turned our community centre into a six-bedded ‘safe home’ with oxygen cylinders and other equipment such as sphygmomanometer and pulse oximeters. A Covid-19 positive resident can use it as a quarantine facility. We have tied up with a super-speciality hospital so that critical patients can be hospitalized without any hassle. The hospital will provide ambulance,” said Sanjay Kumar Goel, vice president of Suncity a housing society in north Kolkata with around 300 flats.Also read: Mamata pays visit to Governor on I-Day; Dhankar flays her for skipping ‘At Home’ functionRecently chief minister Mamata Banerjee had urged large housing societies to keep pulse-oximeters handy so that the oxygen saturation level of residents could be measured. Hospitalization is needed if the oxygen level drops below 90 percent.“The union health ministry had issued some guidelines for gated residential complexes in July which said that residential societies can come up with Covid19 care facilities following guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare. We have already developed a five-bedded facility with round the clock doctors and caregivers for our residents in the housing society. The state health department officials had come for a check. We are waiting for an approval. A few other housing societies in New Town have also developed such facilities. Some of the housing societies have also come together to form a network of doctors who can provide help,” said Sudipta Mukherjee, president of Greenwood Sonata housing in New Town. In a small housing society in east Kolkata, the resident welfare committee has tied up with a local nursing home so that they can get a doctor and nurse on call to check Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms. They have also developed a quarantine centre with four beds in one of the vacant twin-bedroom flats. The nursing home would give them telemedicine services twice in a day. An attendant has also been engaged who would go to the local market and buy all necessary items for the patients. After news report poured in over the past few months that some patients died as they didn’t get any ambulance on time while others were charged with exorbitant amounts by ambulance drivers, a housing society in Salt Lake decided to tie-up with an agency that would provide an ambulance on call.“We have tied up with a local agency which has two ambulances. They would provide us with an ambulance at a fixed price round the clock,” said Radhagobinda Sil, president of Baisakhi housing society in Salt Lake. Residents said that whenever a community centre or the gym is being turned into a quarantine centre, they are taking the expert help from local doctors and medical experts of the civic body. “Some housing societies have developed their own infrastructure like safe homes. This a very good initiative as these would help us keep the hospital beds free for critically ill patients. Even though there is no shortage of beds in government-run Covid-19 hospitals at present, there are more patients in hospitals with mild and no symptoms than critically ill patients. Mild and asymptomatic patients can easily be treated at home and safe homes,” said a senior official of the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-housing-societies-come-up-with-logistics-to-tackle-covid-19-crisis/story-ntb54DITTSky8ZKAqIUM1J.html

The chief minister hailed Covid-19 warriors, such as doctors, nurses, policemen and others for and also extolled cops who have been announced the Presidents Medal and bravery awards. In Kolkata, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee exuded confidence that the country will overcome the challenge posed by coronavirus.

16-08-2020||India||PM Modi stresses on women issues||Addressing the nation on India’s 74th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday spoke on a range of women’s issues including the government’s scheme to provide sanitary napkins at Rs 1 and setting up of a committee to deliberate on the minimum age for marriage. “We have worked for women empowerment. Navy and Air Force are taking women in combat. Women are now leaders, and we abolished triple talaq, got sanitary pads to women for just 1 rupee,” said PM Modi in his speech. “In 6,000 Jan Aushadi Kendras, more than five crore sanitary napkins have been provided to women in a short period of time,” he said. Laying emphasis on women empowerment, the Prime Minister said, “My dear countrymen, our experience says that whenever there is an opportunity for women power in India, they have brought laurels to the country, strengthened the country. Today, women are not only working in underground coal mines but also flying fighter planes, touching new heights in the sky.” In his address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Modi said, “We have set up a committee to deliberate on the minimum age for marriage of our daughters. We will take appropriate decisions after the committee submits its report.” The minimum age of marriage for women is 18 years and 21 for men. Discussing the role of women in the forces, the prime minister said India is among the countries of the world where women are involved in combat roles in the Navy and the Air Force. “We are expanding NCC in border areas; special training will be provided to about one lakh new NCC cadets, out of which we will try that one-third of them are our daughters,” he said. On the economic front, the PM said that 22 crore of the 40 crore Jan Dhan accounts belonged to women and about ₹30,000 crore have been deposited in these accounts during the pandemic. “Out of Mudra loans worth ₹25 crore, 70% of them have been taken by our mothers and sisters.

16-08-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 death toll hits 50,000 mark||The number of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India exceeded 50,000 on Saturday, making it the fourth country — after the United States, Brazil and Mexico — to cross this bleak milestone as infections mount world over.However, India’s case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of deaths to the total recorded infections — at 1.9% is lower than the global average of 3.5%, indicating that the country has controlled deaths better than other nations with similar or higher caseload.India is ranked third in the number of infections — only the US and Brazil have recorded more cases than India and have substantially higher death tolls from the viral illness. As of Saturday, India recorded a cumulative 2,587,872 cases and 50,079 deaths. The US saw 171,999 deaths from over 5.4 million cases, (CFR of 3.1%) and Brazil 106,608 fatalities from over 3.2 million infections (CFR of 3.2%). Mexico appears to be among the hardest-hit by the pandemic in the number of deaths, with an exceptionally high death rate, or CFR, of 11%. The country has 55,908 fatalities from just over 511,000 Covid-19 cases. India also took longer than the three countries in recording its 50,000th fatality: 156 days after reporting its first fatality linked to Covid-19 on March 12.In comparison, the US — the country worst affected by the public health crisis — took 23 days to breach this mark, Brazil 95 days and Mexico 141 days, according to data by worldometers.info.India, in the early stages of the outbreak, enforced a 68-day nationwide lockdown starting March 25, when the country had around 602 confirmed cases and 12 deaths. Most curbs have slowly been relaxed in the months since, with the government announcing a phased “unlock” plan from June.“We do not know yet what the reasons are for fewer deaths in India. However, there are some educated guesses. One, India has a relatively young population... Two, Indians get common cold from other coronaviruses that might be providing cross immunity against Sars-CoV-2,” said Dr Sanjay K Rai, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. A study published in journal Nature on July 15 hinted that previous exposure to other coronaviruses — such as the one causing common cold — may boost a patient’s immunity to Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. “Third, now there is evidence emerging that BCG [Bacille Calmette-Guerin] vaccination given to prevent tuberculosis is protective against Covid-19. We [India] have universal BCG vaccination...” he added. Although India’s death rate has been lower than other nations, public health experts have cautioned that the toll has been on a steady rise with the increase in daily new infections across states. In the seven days to August 14, India added an average of 934 deaths daily — about 34% hike from the average 615 fatalities added in the week ending July 19.This steady rise in the death toll is in line with the trajectory of the epidemic in the country. The virus first found a foothold in India in metropolises such as Delhi and Mumbai — which scaled up testing and other precautionary efforts in response — it has in recent weeks spread to rural areas as restrictions on movement gradually eased, and workplaces and businesses reopened.While Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Delhi were the initial epicentres of the disease, states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh are emerging as new hot spots, adding thousands of Covid-19 cases daily. These eight states account for over 74.8% of the country’s total tally.Scientists believe that until a vaccine is developed, retaining a low death rate while focusing on boosting health care infrastructure and widespread testing remain crucial to controlling the disease’s impact in the country. “A vaccine will help in preventing deaths in high-risk individuals. This infection is unlikely to just disappear... unlike other pandemics, Covid-19 is highly infectious and the spread is truly global... And if re-infection starts happening then we will need to immunise everyone,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a Delhi-based public health specialist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-death-toll-hits-50-000-mark/story-GcEGRlHivveuLSxfqlqmhJ.html
16-08-2020||India||Strong, self-reliant India stands for greater good of world: PM Modi||A strong, confident and “aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant) India is essential not just for itself, but for the sake of larger global good, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday in the course of a wide-ranging speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort to mark India’s 74th Independence Day. His 86-minute long speech also focused on the two other issues most Indians are worried about now -- the coronavirus pandemic (where Modi said his government has a plan ready to distribute a vaccine once it is found) and China (where, without naming the country, he referred to the country’s resolve to defend its sovereignty). And like some of previous speeches on Independence Day, this one too had a target -- connecting each of India’s roughly 600,000 villages through optic fibre cable within 1,000 days. But self-reliance, the corner stone of the NDA government’s policy response to the coronavirus disease, was theme of the speech. The PM outlined the contours of this new self-reliant India across all spheres — education, health, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure, trade, defence, foreign policy, environment, digital connectivity; for all segments of society — the poor, the middle class, women, young, entrepreneurs, labour; and in all regions — from Kashmir to the North-east, from urban to rural areas.In the backdrop of Chinese aggression at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and his past references to Chinese behaviour as “expansionist”, the PM also framed India’s freedom struggle as one against an “expansionist mindset”, which had devastated the world. In what could be seen as an attempt to weave the past and the present, the PM said history was witness to how India had posed a challenge to this expansionism, resisting all attempts to crush its spirit.The PM also reiterated India’s united resolve to defend its sovereignty. He paid tributes to security personnel who lost their lives and said those who had sought to challenge India at either the LAC or Line of Control got a response in the language they understood. Modi promised a new cyber security policy, a more self-reliant defence framework, continued upgrade of border infrastructure, an expansion of the National Cadet Corps to include young men and women from both border and coastal areas, and emphasised the importance of India’s ties with both the immediate and extended neighbourhood.In his address, the PM acknowledged the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic on society, economy and everyday life. He praised citizens for battling it and spoke of India’s successful efforts to increase testing, and produce and even export masks, personal protective equipment and ventilators; declared that the country has a plan for the rapid production and dissemination of the vaccine once it is ready; and announced a national digital health mission where every Indian will have a health identity card.Focusing specifically on digital connectivity, the PM mentioned how from just five dozen gram panchayats being connected before 2014, 150,000 panchayats were now connected with optical fibre cable, and another 100,000 would soon be connected. In the changed circumstances, given the accelerated push towards digital after the pandemic, the PM said, that all of India’s over 600,000 villages would now be connected with optical fibre cable within 1,000 days. Among contentious domestic issues, the PM spoke of Kashmir — of what he saw as achievements of the past year, praised elected local representatives and committed to elections after the process of delimitation — and Ayodhya, where he appreciated the peaceful resolution of the issue and restraint showed by citizens.The PM’s speech — his seventh consecutive address from the Red Fort — was criticised by the Opposition. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in a statement on Saturday, said the government is “standing contrary to the country’s democratic structure, constitutional values and established traditions”.West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee too said people must do all it takes to preserve the basic principles on which the country was founded. “We salute all those who sacrificed their lives to make the dream of a ‘free nation’ come true. Our freedom was hard-earned, and we must do all it takes to preserve the basic principles on which this country was founded,” she tweeted. On infrastructure, PM Modi referred to the ₹110 lakh crore investment announced for the National Infrastructure Pipeline Project and said that 7,000 projects had already been identified. “In a crisis, investing in infrastructure boost employment and benefits many new sectors.”On agriculture, the PM said that farmers have now been freed of all restrictions with the changes in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee mechanism. “If you make clothes or soap, you can sell it anywhere. But a farmer could not sell his produce anywhere, it was within a restricted framework. He can, now, breathe an air of freedom and sell his produce anywhere at the best price.” On manufacturing and trade, the PM spoke of India’s tremendous natural and human resources, and underlined the need to add value to it. “How long will we keep selling raw materials and buying finished products? How long will this game continue?”, he asked. It was time to reduce imports, enhance India’s own products, go vocal for local, innovate, and not just “make in India” but “make for the world”, the PM said. On environment, the PM spoke of making the new union territory of Ladakh a carbon-neutral zone, with a 7500 MW solar power plant. The PM also spoke, in detail, about battling pollution — a key environmental and public health crisis -- and announced an holistic, integrated, participatory and technology-based approach to tackle pollution in 100 selected cities of the country. On education, the PM referred to the new National Education Policy as a framework that would make Indian students both rooted in their own setting as well as equipped to become global citizens. In particular, he highlighted the importance of the National Research Foundation and the role of research and innovation for progress. Besides thematic issues, the PM also underlined the role of various demographic segments, and steps being taken to boost their quality of life, employment prospects and incomes. On labour, the PM said it was the source of progress and it flowers when obstacles are removed. In this regard, he outlined steps taken to improve lives of citizens — through bank accounts where money is transferred directly, construction of houses and toilets, provision of regular electricity, the availability of health insurance through Ayushman Bharat. “Everyone who is poor, without any discrimination, can benefit from these measures.” The PM said during the pandemic, these instruments had played a key role in enabling the welfare programmes of the government. On migrant workers in particular — who had to bear tremendous hardship during the pandemic — the PM spoke of the government’s Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojana for migrant workers who had returned home; their skilling; and the government’s plans to construct housing for them in cities where they work away from their homes to ensure they can remain productive without any worries. On the middle class, which he categorised as India’s strength, the PM said that once it gets the right opportunities, it can do “miracles” and professionals from the middle class have made a place for themselves in the world. “The middle class wants liberation from government restrictions. It wants an open field.” He spoke of how the government’s steps — through low cost air connectivity, highways and information ways, cheaper home loans, a fund for stalled real estate projects to ensure middle class home buyers get their homes, reduction of taxes, bringing cooperative banks under the regulatory umbrella of the Reserve Bank of India to protect savings, reforms in micro, small and medium enterprises — will help the middle class. On women, the PM said the country was committed to providing them equal opportunities. He spoke of how women today were working both in coal mines, below ground level, and flying fighter planes in the sky; the “freedom” Muslim women have got due to the triple talaq legislation; the enhanced maternity leave and benefits to pregnant women; the provision of direct income assistance in the bank accounts of women; and the provision of over 50 million sanitary napkins for women, at just ~1 each, through Jan Aushadi centres. Besides substantive policy themes and demographic segments, the third pillar of the PM’s speech rested on balanced regional development. In this, he referred to the government’s initiatives in eastern India in particular, the development pathway in Kashmir, and the focus on 110 aspirational districts where socioeconomic indicators have been below the national average and which have received priority in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-self-reliant-india-stands-for-greater-good-of-world-modi/story-DxSPQDcuxkDXtkI2R7yh1J.html
16-08-2020||India||Kerala CM Vijayan, ministers remain in quarantine||Kerala observed a low-key Independence Day on Saturday, with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and seven other ministers in quarantine over fears of the coronavirus disease. In a first, collectors in some of the districts in the state unfurled the national flag to mark the occasion.At many district headquarters, ceremonies were held with strict containment measures and a limited guest list. At several places, only the state government officials and police personnel, attended the events. In state capital Thiruvananthapuram, tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran hoisted the national flag in the absence of the chief minister. “Pandemic situation has thrown many challenges before the country. We will overcome this with unity and hard work. In such trying situations we have to ensure that people won’t starve. The state government has taken enough measures to check this and it has become a model for others,” the CM said in a Facebook post to greet the people on the occasion.Vijayan and seven of his cabinet colleagues have been under quarantine after they came in contact with district officers, involved in the rescue operations at the Air India Express plane crash site, who tested positive for Covid-19. Malappuram district collector K Gopalakrishnan, SP Abdul Kareem and many senior officers tested positive on Friday, a week after they took part in rescue operations. The Dubai-Kozhikode repatriation flight overshot the runway and crash landed, claiming 18 lives, on August 7. While Governor Arif Mohammad Khan also visited Kozhikkode last Saturday, he did not go under quarantine and hoisted the national flag at Raj Bhawan. In a statement, the Raj Bhawan said that his interaction with the infected officials was minimum. Meanwhile, the state government lifted the lockdown imposed to arrest the spread of Covid-19 in Thiruvananthapuram after 39 days. The restrictions will continue in containment zones. At least one-third of the state’s total active cases (14,094) are from the state capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-vijayan-ministers-remain-in-quarantine/story-wDPucDyMBCtFYWwuyKINYK.html
16-08-2020||India||Vested interests hit peace: Nagaland governor||Nagaland governor R N Ravi on Saturday blamed “vested interests” for misappropriating dividends of peace and not allowing them to reach the state’s people. He said “waves of positive change” sweeping other parts of the country seem to have bypassed Nagaland. “When the security forces and Naga armed groups agreed to suspend operations against each other paving way for a political settlement, the legitimate expectation of the people of Nagaland was dividends of peace—freedom from fear of guns, better health, better education, better infrastructure, better livelihood opportunities, an atmosphere to dream and an eco-system to pursue their dreams,” said Ravi, who is also the interlocutor for the ongoing Naga peace talks, in his Independence Day message.Ravi’s message came days before another round of meetings to thrash out a final agreement for the decades-old Naga issue are scheduled to begin in New Delhi next week. National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), or NSCN-IM, and Naga National Political Groups (NNPG) leaders are expected to take part in the meetings.NSCN-IM on Tuesday demanded Ravi’s removal as the interlocutor while accusing him of creating hurdles in the final settlement of the issue. It said the peace process is in a state of “simmering tension” and reaching “tipping point” because of Ravi. In June, Ravi wrote to chief minister Neiphiu Rio, saying armed gangs have been running extortion rackets and spreading fear while the state machinery has failed to rein them in. He was referring to the various rebel outfits in the state including NSCN-IM, which have been accused of collecting taxes. NSCN-IM chief Thuingaleng Muivah on Friday reiterated the demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution. He said as per the 2015 Framework Agreement signed between the outfit and the Centre, Nagas can co-exist with India, but will not merge with it. Muivah cited the agreement and said the Nagas will share sovereign powers as agreed in it and defined in the competencies.NSCN-IM, which is the biggest and oldest Naga rebel outfit, declared a ceasefire and has been in peace talks with the Centre since 1997. It signed the agreement, which was to be the basis for a final deal on the long-pending Naga political issue. NSCN-IM fought for an independent Nagaland for decades. But with signing of the agreement, they gave up on that demand but sought inclusion of all Naga-inhabited areas in northeast under one administration as well as a separate Naga flag and constitution. The Centre has rejected the demands.“Nagaland is endowed with one of the finest human and natural resources. Unfortunately, today it has the dubious distinction of the worst-performing state in the country including the northeast region on almost all the significant indicators of human development,” Ravi said.Ravi said nearly 25% of the state’s children are not enrolled in schools and around 60% of youths have not been to high school. The poor investment climate, internet connectivity, and lack of progress in agriculture and horticulture sectors were also highlighted in the message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vested-interests-hit-peace-nagaland-guv/story-b5a4sMyqpkDCOGSPvi0N2I.html
16-08-2020||India||Oppn parties hit out at Centre||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday hit out at the government, saying it is standing contrary to the country’s democratic structure, constitutional values and established traditions. In a statement, she also said the biggest tribute to the soldiers killed in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley will be to protect the country’s territory and thwart Chinese incursions. The Congress president did not attend the Independence Day flag-hoisting ceremony and instead veteran leader AK Antony unfurled the tricolour at the party headquarters in Delhi. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi was among the leaders present on the occasion but he did not speak to the media. The Congress also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not taking China’s name in his Independence Day speech. “We all are proud of our armed, paramilitary and police forces. We 1.3 billion Indians and all Congress workers are proud of them. Whenever there has been attack on us, they have given a befitting reply to the attackers,” Congress’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, told reporters after the ceremony at the party headquarters. “But we must also think why our rulers are scared of taking China’s name. Today, on the Independence Day, when China has occupied our territory, every Indian should ask the government how it proposes to push the Chinese forces back and protect our territorial integrity. Why are those who are sitting in power scared of mentioning China’s name?” he asked. In his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a sharp message to China and Pakistan, declaring that the armed forces deployed along the borders with them are capable of giving a fitting reply to those trying to challenge India’s sovereignty. However, he did not take the names of the two countries. “Today is the 60th day when our Colonel Santosh Babu and 20 other soldiers sacrificed their lives for the nation’s security in Galwan Valley (in a deadly clash with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh). I salute their bravery and urge the government to remember their valour and give due recognition to them. Our biggest tribute to them would be protecting the motherland and thwarting Chinese incursions,” Gandhi said in her statement. “Today every countryman needs to look within and think what does freedom mean? Are they free today to write, to speak, to ask questions, to disagree, to seek accountability? As a responsible opposition this is our responsibility to keep India’s democratic freedom intact,” she said. “We have tested our democratic values from time to time in the last 74 years of independence. Today, it seems that the government is standing contrary to the country’s democratic structure, constitutional values and established traditions. It is also a test for Indian democracy,” added Gandhi. The Congress president expressed confidence that India will unitedly defeat the Covid-19 pandemic and overcome the economic crisis. On the 74th Independence Day, the Congress also launched a web-series titled ‘Dharohar’. “Congress has been at the forefront in the efforts to create an India, which is a global leader in the industry, agriculture, science, technology, health, military, culture and all this without ever compromising on its secular and democratic nature,” Surjewala and party’s social media department head Rohan Gupta said in a statement. ‘Dharohar’ will showcase the history of the Congress and its contributions to India – right from the freedom struggle to the emergence of India as a superpower in 70 years of its independence, added the statement. In Kolkata, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the people must do all it takes to preserve the basic principles on which this country was founded. “We salute all those who sacrificed their lives to make the dream of a ‘free nation’ come true. Our freedom was hard-earned, and we must do all it takes to preserve the basic principles on which this country was founded,” she tweeted. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) said it will continue its fight to defend the Constitution of India, which was “under severe strain”. “We pledge to continue our fight in defence of the Constitution and against attack on fundamental rights. This freedom was hard-earned and any attempt to curb it will be fought back,” the CPI(M) tweeted. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted: “Today is the day to renew our pledge to secure all types of freedoms — economic, social, political — for Indians of all regions, faiths, languages, genders and beliefs, especially in these times when our Constitutional Republic is under severe strain.”Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy hoped the Centre would have a change of heart, if not today in the future, and accord special category status (SCS) to his state in accordance with the promise made in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-parties-hit-out-at-centre/story-JG7dNi7DzH77h8P7kKAIHJ.html
16-08-2020||India||Prepared to produce vaccines, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said three Covid-19 vaccine candidates were being tested in India and the country is awaiting the go-ahead from scientists to begin their mass production. He added that a road map for the distribution of the vaccine to every single Indian in the least possible time was also ready.“...our scientists are dutifully engaged in the laboratories. They are putting in great efforts. At present, testing for three vaccines is in different stages in the country. Once we get a green signal from our scientists, we will launch a massive production of the vaccine. We have made all the preparations,” Modi said in his Independence Day speech. Indian biotech companies have developed two of the three vaccine candidates that have entered the human trial stage in India. The vaccine candidate Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Virology (Pune) uses an inactivated strain of the virus to trigger an immune response. The vaccine has entered phase II trial to examine its immunogenicity, or the ability to produce an immune response.Zydus Cadila has developed the second DNA-based vaccine candidate called ZydCov D, which, too, is in phase II trial.The third vaccine is by Oxford University in collaboration with the Swedish-British biotech company AstraZeneca. Serum Institute of India, which will produce 1 billion doses of the vaccine if it is successful, will conduct its larger phase III trial.At least four other vaccine candidates have reached advanced pre-clinical stages and are soon scheduled to enter the human trials stage. The Department of Biotechnology, which is the nodal agency for vaccine development in India, is supporting the development of the four vaccines.A national expert group on vaccine administration has been formed to decide protocols for the procurement and administration of the Covid-19 vaccine. Government think-tank NITI Ayog member Dr VK Paul heads the group.Former Union health secretary K Sujatha Rao said that a Covid-19 vaccine is the need of the hour to help in preventing infections. “But the availability of a safe and effective vaccine will depend on the data generated from the phase III trials. The pace at which we are going, a vaccine should be available by March or April next year. When will it reach you or me is another question.”Rao said health care workers and high-risk populations such as the elderly will get the vaccine first. “The government should study the deaths from the infection to see who is dying to inform this strategy.”Dr T Jacob John, a former virology professor at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, said this is the right time to answer questions like who gets the vaccine. “Whether it will be licensed for sale or controlled by the government, how will the vaccines be delivered to the people, and who pays for it. The government needs to create a platform for vaccine delivery. The universal immunisation programme is for the children and there is not an adult vaccine delivery mechanism in the country just like the flu vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prepared-to-produce-vaccines-says-modi/story-Pt3cae0x8Jdo2M23VE7vqL.html
16-08-2020||India||Digital record of health to revolutionise sector||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday unveiled an ambitious National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) under which every Indian will get a health ID that he said will act “like a healthcare account” and make access to medical services easier.“From today, the national digital health mission will begin. It will revolutionise Indian healthcare sector. Every Indian will be issued a health ID that will act like a healthcare account, storing details of all the tests done, existing diseases, diagnoses, medicines prescribed,” said Modi in his Independence speech from Red Fort.It will also ease processes such as booking appointments, making payments, or getting registrations done at hospitals, he said. “Technology will be used to resolve various problems in the health care sector – whether it is getting an appointment, making payment, or queuing up to get the (registration) slip. People will be able to make informed decisions.”The National Health Authority (NHA), the agency responsible for the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), has been asked to design, build, roll-out and implement the project. Six Union Territories where the mission was rolled out through a pilot launch are Chandigarh, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep, NHA said in a statement.The programme is a part of the government’s National Digital Health Blueprint aimed at using technology to improve health care delivery. The objectives of the mission are to establish a core digital health database, create a system of electronic health records based on international standards, and establish data ownership pathways so that a patient is the owner his/her health records, among others.Experts said the move will be beneficial for ensuring continuity of treatment and expediting emergency care.“A nationwide health ID will ensure three things – continuity, connectivity, and portability of treatment. If a patient goes to a different doctor or someone else fills in for their doctor, all the medical records will be available to them ensuring continuity of their treatment. When a patient has to go to a secondary or tertiary centre, all the basic information will already be there in the record. This is particularly helpful in the emergency department where knowing the blood group or what a person is allergic to can save a lot of time. It will also save cost of repeat tests. The third is portability, which will enable me to have my entire healthcare record when I move from one city to the other without carrying several files,” said K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.However, the he said there are challenges involving exhaustive electronic record-keeping and issues of privacy.“Take for example, the US system, which is highly litigious and (where) defensive medicine is practiced; doctors tend to spend a lot of time in detailed record keeping. This can be solved either by simplifying the records to be maintained in a less litigious society or by training physician assistants who are trained to take medical notes and maintain records. However, the privacy needs to be ensured even if anonymised data is provided for research or else there will be telemarketers pushing medicines to people,” said Reddy.Deepak Agarwal, who headed the initiative to digitise patients’ records at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said it was a great initiative but impractical at the moment.“Accessing all medical records of a patient with just one click is a doctor’s dream. However, when we started implementing a similar system at AIIMS we faced several challenges. One is actually digitising the records for which every doctor has to input the records digitally, otherwise it will not work. Second, and more importantly, is finding a unique identifier. If we just enter the patient’s name as Ramu, there will be thousands of records with the same name and many people do not even use second names, making identification of people difficult. The only unique ID that most of the population has is Aadhaar card, but with a Supreme Court judgment no one can legally demand that it be linked. We had tried to do it before the judgment and there was a lot of resistance; now less than 1% patients give the details,” said Agrawal.Speaking of work done in the health care sector, the PM said that new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences and other medical colleges have been set up in the country, increasing the number of MBBS and MD seats for medical students by 45,000 in the last five years.He also said over 150,000 wellness centres are being set up across the country. “Around one-third of these are already functional and have helped in the Covid-19 fight,” he said.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-record-of-health-to-revolutionise-sector/story-RyvlxMC7iT1FsStYuW1LuL.html
16-08-2020||India||Centre to launch projects for lion, dolphin conservation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced the Centre will soon launch Project Lion and Project Dolphin for the biodiversity conservation of these species on the lines of and to replicate the successes of Project Tiger launched in 1973.In his Independence Day speech, Modi underlined commitment to the promotion and conservation of biodiversity and said India is one of the very few countries where the forest cover is expanding. “We have successfully carried forward Project Tiger and Project Elephant. The Tiger population has increased in India. In the coming days, we are starting Project Lion for the Asiatic lions. And under Project Lion, the work on the required infrastructure for the protection and security of Indian lions and in particular the special type of health infrastructure required will be undertaken. And emphasis will be laid on Project Lion.”Modi said Project Dolphin will focus on both river and sea dolphins. “This will also give a boost to biodiversity and also create employment opportunities. This is also a centre of attraction for tourism.”Asiatic lions are confined to Gir National Park and its surrounding environs in Gujarat’s Saurashtra. The Gujarat forest department in June suggested their population has increased by 29%— from 523 in 2015 to 674 in 2020. It said the distribution area of lions in Saurashtra has increased by 36% from 22,000 sqkm in 2015 to 30,000 sqkm. Experts have called for the reintroduced of the species outside Gujarat for the long term conversation of the Asiatics lions.The Gangetic dolphin is an indicator species, whose status provides information on the overall condition of the ecosystem and of other species in that ecosystem, for the Ganga ecosystem and is extremely vulnerable to changes in water quality and flow. It is categorised as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List.Union environment ministry officials said the projects Modi announced are new and different from previous ones for Asiatic Lions and Gangetic Dolphins. The ministry launched the Asiatic Lion Conservation Project in February last year. Vaccination of livestock, control of cats and dogs in lion habitat, identification of wildlife corridors, improvement of habitat, legal aid, wildlife forensic systems, and attractive relocation packages for pastoral communities were the highlights of this project.Additional director general (forests) Soumitra Dasgupta said it is a proud moment for them that Modi has announced the projects to conserve Dolphins, which are an indicator species, and Asiatic Lions a flagship species. “The Prime Minister referred to a long-term plan. It will involve the conservation of lions and their habitat in a holistic manner. There will be a focus on conflict mitigation and technology for management. Reintroduction... we have to see what are the possibilities. Last year, only some financial measures were announced but this project is new and long term,” said Dasgupta. He was referring to reintroduction of lions to other habitats apart from Gir Sanctuary in Gujarat. For example, Kuno Palpur Sanctuary in MP is being considered by the ministry for reintroduction of lions.Dasgupta said Project Dolphin will also be new, focusing on dolphins in the oceans and rivers. “Dolphin tourism is being prompted by other countries but we have not explored it very much. This will also help secure livelihoods...”World Wide Fund For Nature India (WWF India)’s program management director Diwakar Sharma said lions in India face most of the issues that other large carnivores face. “These include habitat loss and fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal trade. The Asiatic lion is confined only to the Gir protected area and its surrounding environs,” he said.Sharma said the current Asiatic lion population is built from a very small number in the early 20th century and thus faces the additional threat of genetic homogeneity, which makes the species susceptible to diseases like canine distemper. “It is thus in the interest of long term Asiatic lion conservation that the species be reintroduced to other places in and outside Gujarat.”A WWF-India and the Uttar Pradesh forest department assessment in 2012 and 2015 recorded 1,272 dolphins in the Ganga, Yamuna, Chambal, Ken, Betwa, Son, Sharda, Geruwa, Gahagra, Gandak and Rapti. “The Ganges river dolphin is threatened due to habitat degradation as a result of water development projects [dams, barrages and dredging operations], sand mining, overfishing, and pollution. The incidental catch of dolphins in the fishing gears, specifically gillnets are key causes of dolphin mortality in the Ganga,” said WWF India’s river basin management associate director Nitin Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-launch-projects-for-lion-dolphin-conservation/story-r1MGb3SQgFV3Z3GDzCmFlO.html
16-08-2020||India||Self-reliant India to focus on ‘make for world’: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday cited a robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) during the last financial year and said it reflects how global firms were looking at India as a major investment destination. He said the country is shifting its focus from Make in India to Make for World through the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India campaign)In his Independence Day speech, Modi said a series of economic reforms like one nation-one tax, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the bank merger have caught attention of the global investors. He credited the reforms for attracting huge FDI last year.According to the Reserve Bank of India data, there was about $74.4 billion FDI flow in 2019-20 and marked a 20% jump compared to the previous year.Modi said India should be “vocal for local” and asked citizens to glorify Indian products to promote Atmanirbhar Bharat. He referred to N-95 masks, personal protective equipment, and ventilators. Modi added Indian entrepreneurs manufactured them to meet the domestic demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic and also exported them.Modi said India is striving to achieve overall economic growth and become self-reliant, but humanity remains its ethos. “India has always believed that the entire world is one family. While we focus on economic growth and development, humanity must retain a central role in this process and our journey,” he said. “When we talk about becoming self-reliant, we do not merely refer to decreasing import demands. ...it is about our skills, our human resources. When we start sourcing things from abroad, then our capabilities start depleting and consequently, they get completely destroyed over generations. We need to preserve them and enhance that calibre of ours.”Modi said the government has launched over Rs 110 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) to boost the economy and create jobs. “In order to rapidly modernise India, there is a need to give a new direction to overall infrastructure development,” he said. He added over 7,000 projects under NIP have been identified.“This will be, in a way, a new revolution in the field of infrastructure. This is the time to end silos in infrastructure. There is a plan to connect the entire country with multi-model connectivity infrastructure.” He said NIP will play a crucial role in overcoming the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the economy and trigger higher growth.The Covid-19 pandemic and 68-day nationwide lockdown to check its spread adversely impacted the economic growth, which was already sluggish. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20, the lowest in 11 years. It followed precipitous growth contractions reported by the US and European countries after the pandemic closed shops, factories, and restaurants, signalling a period of recession. The US economy posted a second-quarter contraction of 9.5%, the worst figure on record.India is expected to report its April-June GDP numbers by the end of this month. Economists expect the economy to contract by at least 5% this year (2020-21) especially because of the hard lockdown for two full months of the quarter (April and May).The government on December 31 last year unveiled the NIP with an aim to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25. The focus of the infrastructure pipeline is to accelerate growth and create employment in both urban and rural areas. The NIP is already under execution as 40% of the projects worth Rs 44 lakh crore are at various stages of implementation, officials said requesting anonymity.Modi emphasised the need to import raw material and export value-added products to make India a manufacturing hub. “How long can the raw material be sent out of our country and finished products imported?. Atmnirbhar Bharat does not mean only reducing imports, it means enhancing our capacity, our creativity, our skills.”Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consultancy firm DVS Advisors LLP, said Modi called for Make in India in his first Independence Day speech in 2014. He said Modi has rebranded it to Make for the World to make India as a manufacturing powerhouse, which China did exceptionally well over the years. “It is high time that this strategy should be in place. India has already missed opportunities during the start of the trade war between the US and China. But Covid-19 and China’s attitude towards other nations have presented one more opportunity to take advantage of the negative perception of China.”Deepak Sood, secretary-general of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, called Modi’s address a morale booster for the nation braving the health pandemic and making all-out efforts to turn it into an opportunity for making India self-reliant. “When the Prime Minister talks about reforms...it is a loud signal to the world how the country’s top leadership is committed to creating economic opportunities for the investors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-reliant-india-to-focus-on-make-for-world/story-vRXXOiVdJL6bbdcohWKngN.html
16-08-2020||India||PM hails country’s agriculture sector||On the occasion of the country’s 74th Independence Day on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country needed to replicate the “self-reliance” of the country in agriculture in other sectors of the economy, underscoring the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign. The prime minister said his government had freed the country’s agriculture sector by abolishing archaic regulations, which will help to increase famers’ income. “The last few years have seen pioneering changes and futuristic reforms in agriculture. Farmers now have access to more markets, better financial support,” the PM said. Making the traditional address to the nation from the Red Fort, Modi said the country would adopt policies to reduce imports, just as it had done for food commodities. “There was a time when we used to import wheat from abroad; but our farmers have done a wonderful job. And now India is self-reliant in the agricultural sector.” The prime minister referred to steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector. On June 4, the Cabinet had approved amendments to the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act and cleared two other ordinances, one aimed at freeing up farm trade from all restrictions and the other guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices to farmers.“Some of you may not know this, but unlike any other business, where a businessman has the freedom to sell their product or service in any part of the country or the world and at a price they want, our farmers, till now did not have that freedom. They could only sell to who they were told to sell. Now, we have removed these restrictions, and given farmers the freedom to sell at the best price, and to whom they want,” Modi said.Modi’s reference to the freeing up of the agriculture sector included reading down of provisions of The Essential Commodities Act 1955 to allow for freer trade in farm commodities. “I admit there are lakhs of challenges for India to become atmanirbhar (self-reliant), and yes, there is fierce competition from the rest of the world. But I always say that if India faces lakhs of challenges, it also has 130 crore solutions,” Modi said.The agriculture sector, which supports half of all Indians, hasn’t been generating enough revenues to keep farmers profitable for nearly two decades due to trade restrictions and an obsession with keeping food prices low to avoid inflation, according to the OECD-ICRIER study mentioned above.The NDA government also brought, on June 4, ‘The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020’. The ordinance will effectively bring the curtains down on the decades-old agricultural produce market committees regulations (APMC) system that regulates buying and selling of farm produce.These reforms in “agricultural marketing” have been a long time in the making and various government panels and economists have often argued for changing existing structures of agricultural trade. The ordinance will pave the way for barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farm goods outside the physical premises of markets notified under APMCs, the Cabinet note said. The Modi government also approved ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’, which effectively ushered new rules for contract farming and futures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-hails-country-s-agriculture-sector/story-fRrLGjPUAsDGORaE4ng2ZN.html
16-08-2020||India||Report on Facebook’s leniency to BJP members’ communal posts causes row||A report suggesting Facebook was going easy on hate speeches by members of ruling Bharatiya Janata Party became the subject of a political controversy on Saturday, with the Congress saying it had met and flagged similar concerns to a senior executive of the social media company who has been named in the story.In an article published late on Friday, the Wall Street Journal cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders to claim that the company’s senior India policy executive Ankhi Das intervened in internal content review processes to stop a ban on BJP’s Telangana MLA T Raja Singh, who made communally charged posts targeting the Muslim community.Also read | BJP spreading virus of communal hatred: Sonia GandhiDas, the report added, “told staff members that punishing violations by politicians from Mr. Modi’s party would damage the company’s business prospects in the country”. Facebook denied the allegation and said it was still reviewing whether it had to act against Singh. Das did not respond to requests for a comment.“We had met Ankhi Das over the issue and raised our concerns regarding these matters,” said a senior member of Congress’s media team, who asked not to be named.“This expose on Facebook comes as a shock because one expects companies like Facebook to be professionally run and managed. New facts are emerging exposing the close ties of important officials of Facebook India with the BJP. Democracy needs to be insulated from being sabotaged by such unholy collusion,” said Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera.Facebook said its policies on such matters are unbiased. “We prohibit hate speech and content that incites violence and we enforce these policies globally without regard to anyone’s political position or party affiliation. While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,” a Facebook spokesperson said on queries relating to the claims in the WSJ story.Also read: 3 die after violence erupts in Bengaluru over Facebook postA BJP spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. A party functionary, who asked not to be named, said the BJP does not subscribe to the views of Singh and has distanced itself from comments that call for violence or are not in line with the party’s stance.India is one of Facebook’s fastest growing markets and the company is estimated to have close to 350 million users by June this year. Instagram and WhatsApp, both owned by the California-based company, have hundreds of millions more users from India.Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been under increasing pressure because there are concerns that they are not doing enough to crack down on fake news and hate speech. The controversy has particularly played out in the United States, where Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that the company cannot be “an arbiter of truth” in response to criticism over the type of political content, which at one point also triggered a staff walk-out.Shortly after the WSJ report was released, Ajit Mohan, the head of Facebook India, wrote an internal memo to the company’s India operations staff defending Das. “This article does not reflect the person I know or the extraordinarily complex issues we face everyday that benefits from Ankhi and the Public Policy team’s expertise,” he said in the note, a copy of which has been seen by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/communal-postsreport-on-leniency-to-bjp-causes-row/story-43fWgMtLZQw1HUKlwnGPoM.html
16-08-2020||India||Kerala plane crash: Cabin crew granted special leave to recover from tragedy||The cabin crew members of Air India Express flight IX1344, which operated from Dubai to Kozhikode on August 7, have been granted a special paid leave for a month. The ill-fated flight with 190 on board overshot at Kerala’s Karipur’s table top runway and dropped about 35ft into a gorge, killing 18 people. An airline source said that the crew members have been given the special leave so that they can rest and recover from the tragedy. The flight had four cabin crew members and two cockpit crew (pilots) on board. While the two pilots lost their lives in the accident, the cabin crew members were rescued. Top sources from the airline said that the cabin crew, who were stationed on their seats while landing at the airport, had started taking off their seat belts when the mishap took place. One of the crew members, Akshay Pal Singh, sustained a fracture on his leg along with multiple injuries. He is undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital and his condition is said to be stable. Another crew member, Shilpa Katare, had sustained minor injuries and was discharged after treatment from a hospital. Two other cabin crew members, Abhik Biswas and Lalit Kumar, escaped unhurt in the mishap. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Wednesday announced that a team of five officials have begun their investigations on the cause and the contributory factors leading to the mishap. The team has been asked to complete the investigations in five months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-plane-crash-surviving-cabin-crew-members-granted-special-leave-to-recover-from-tragedy/story-FuiW9IAnYRyocoivgs9DuO.html
16-08-2020||India||At Home event Prez Kovind hails 26 Covid warriors||President Ram Nath Kovind hailed 26 Corona warriors at an otherwise subdued At Home reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan which lasted just around 25 minutes and, for the first time, saw no former Indian Prime Minister attending the event. Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla sat at the main table; other dignitaries included BJP president JP Nadda, defence minister Rajnath Singh, NSA Ajit Doval, union ministers Hardhvardhan, S Jaishankar, Nirmala Sitharaman and Modi’s principal secretary PK Mishra. The event was held in Rashtrapati Bhavan’s convention centre, with portraits of former Presidents adorning the walls. The three service chiefs along with CDS Bipin Rawat and a few ambassadors were also present. A total of about 100 guests, including 26 Corona warriors, were invited for the programme that started with a brief speech by President Ram Nath Kovind hailing the Covid warriors (PM Modi led a round of applause for them). Refreshment including traditional delicacies such as samosa and dhokla. To drink, there was tea (green and normal), coconut water and orange juice. While hot samosas were served to guests, by waiters who were not just masked, but also sported a face visor, the dhokla, enchilada, and the tricolour sweet that is customary in many independence day celebrations, were already kept on shrink wrapped plates. There was designated seating, at tables named after rivers. Guests were ushered to their tables the minute they entered, although there was a bit of the usual networking seen at such events before the event started. With just around 30 tables, there was no special VVIP area like there usually is. According to officials involved in organising the event, former Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and HD Devegowda decided to skip the event due to the Covid situation. Similarly, Union home minister Amit Shah, who is in home isolation after he tested negative for Covid and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who was recently admitted in the hospital, also didn’t attend the event. For the first time, the function saw no spouses of the invitees, no live food counters, no freedom fighters and no free interaction with VVIPs—new rules of a new normal, protocol-wrapped ceremony, in the times of a pandemic. People were allowed in after their temperatures were taken; everyone was asked to show their status on the Aarogaya Setu contac-tracing app; and those not wearing N95 masks without valves, were provided them. The guest list was heavily pruned to maximum 90 from the normal gathering of 1500 dignitaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-home-eventprez-kovind-hails-26-covid-warriors/story-TV2GY2f4KL7I1SFC9KhxgP.html
16-08-2020||India||Record 869k coronavirus tests conducted in a day||As many as 57,381 people recovered from Covid-19 on Saturday across the country and marked the highest number of recoveries so far, which crossed the 1.8 million mark, with India achieving another peak in the total tests conducted in 24 hours, according to Union health ministry data.Over 70% of those infected by the disease have recovered so far. The total tests conducted in the previous 24 hours stood at 868,679 on Saturday, taking the cumulative tests to more than 28.5 million, the ministry said.The recoveries in 12 states are higher than the national average, with Delhi leading the way. The data shows that almost 90% of the people in Delhi have recovered from the infection, followed by Haryana (84%), and Tamil Nadu (82%).Officials credited the Delhi model for the decline in the number of new infections and deaths. The model involved ramping up testing and the number of beds for Covid-19 treatment, isolation of those with no symptoms or mild symptoms at home, providing pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators, plasma therapy, and surveys and screening. Delhi was the first to start a convalescent plasma bank. The state has decided to conduct serological surveillance every month to check the prevalence of antibody levels in the population.Officials said India is focusing on a test, track, treat strategy to prevent the spread of the infection. Dr Puneet Mishra, a community medicine professor at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said now the testing strategy needs to evolve in places such as Delhi and Mumbai. “In these areas, we have to focus on reducing mortality and for that hospitals and health centres have to keep an eye on those who are symptomatic, especially among the high-risk group. Ensuring that these people reach hospitals on time is important.”Officials said the focus is now on improved and effective treatment in hospitals, supervised home isolation, use of non-invasive oxygen support, improved services of ambulances for ferrying patients for prompt and timely treatment. The government is also working on the upgrade of clinical management skills of doctors. Doctors from AIIMS are providing active technical guidance through teleconsultation.The ministry said this has also resulted in a declining case fatality rate, which is well below the global average. The national case fatality rate, or the proportion of people who die among those diagnosed with the infection, is 1.94%.Dr Sanjay K Rai, a community medicine professor at AIIMS, said they do not know yet what the reasons are for fewer deaths in India. “However, there are some educated guesses that scientists have made. One, India has a relatively young population – just 8 or 9% of the population is above the age of 60 as compared to about 25% in the European countries. Old age puts people at higher risk of severe disease and mortality. Two, Indians get common cold from other coronaviruses that might be providing cross-immunity against Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19,” said Rai. “Third, now there is evidence emerging that BCG vaccination given to prevent tuberculosis is protective against Covid-19. We have universal BCG vaccination, the European countries do not.”He said the mortality rate is unlikely to increase as the infection spreads to smaller cities. “From the sero-surveillance in Delhi and Mumbai, we know that in 90% cases there are no symptoms or very mild symptoms and no medical care is needed. For most of the others, it is just oxygen support that seems to be helping; there is no evidence to suggest that the experimental drugs reduce mortality.”Rai said this is why they have suggested that only availability of oxygen needs to be ensured in primary and secondary level healthcare facilities. “Even if the government does provide ventilators, who will operate them? In the absence of trained professionals, it will do more harm than good.”Chandrakant Lahariya, a public health specialist, said a vaccine will help in preventing deaths in high-risk individuals as the infection is unlikely to just disappear. “Broadly, every pandemic infects many people initially because the entire population is susceptible and as people start getting immunity, the infection disappears in about 18 months to two years. However, unlike other pandemics, Covid-19 is highly infectious and the spread is truly global... if re-infection starts happening, then we will need to immunise everyone, especially the healthcare workers constantly at risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-869k-tests-conducted-in-a-day/story-Hjqhvw5QEm1XrPmrkKkPDL.html
16-08-2020||India||In a 1st, menstruation talk in PM’s Independence Day speech||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mention of sanitary pads in his Independence Day speech sends a powerful message to India’s 1.3 billion population that menstruation is a natural, biological process like eating and sleeping, and should be treated as such.Yet, the stigma around menstruation and female hygiene products lead to women talking about it in whispers, girls dropping out of school, advertisers replacing blood with sky blue ink, and embarrassed pharmacists and shopkeepers selling sanitary napkins shrouded in used newspapers and opaque bags. “This government has been always concerned about the health of our daughters and sisters. Through 6,000 Jan Aushadhi centres, about 50 million women have got sanitary pads at Re 1. We have worked for women’s empowerment. Navy and Air Force are taking women in combat roles… women are now leaders,” Modi said in his address from the ramparts of Red Fort.Since last year, Jan Aushadhi Suvidha Sanitary Napkins are being sold at a subsidised price of Re 1 at 6,550 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana Kendras across the country. The cost of production of each of these oxo-biodegradable pads is Rs 2.50, but is sold for Re 1 each with the government subsidising the retail discount from August 29, 2019.Centuries of stigma has made menstruating women temporary pariahs in some communities, which consider them impure and exclude them from religious, social and community participation. Menstrual blood, which consists of a mix of blood and cells and tissue from the uterine endometrial lining that is shed during menstruation, is as safe as blood from any other part of the human body.But we can’t just blame tradition. Even in modern societies, menstruating women are considered physically and biologically weak, less competent, and more emotional and high-strung. Such prejudices add to gender polarisation, which for generations has been used to exclude women from education, voting, owning property and participating in economic activity.Female workforce participation in India was 21% in 2019, which is comparable to the Arab world and is amongst the lowest in the world, according World Bank data modelled on International Labour Organisation estimates released on June 21, 2020. The global average of women in the workforce is 47%, with neighbouring Nepal having 83% working women, Bangladesh, 36%, and China, 60%.As women move from low-wage unskilled jobs to productive employment and better wages in the services and manufacturing sectors, they need employers to regard them as productive workers who won’t have an emotional or physical breakdown each time they menstruate. Equitable access to opportunities can be created by implementing policies that promote women employment, investing in economic sectors more attractive to women, and monitoring gender disparity in employment patterns.In a competitive workplace, laws with inherent gender biases create deeper unexpressed resentment and carry a high-risk of penalising women, both in terms of salary and career advancement. Since the new Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act doubled maternity leave for women from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for the first two children and 12 weeks for subsequent children, some companies have started treating women as a potential liability, with human resources personnel asking women employees intrusive questions about when they want to start a family, something they would never consider asking men. Such practices must be stopped.Talking about menstruation without embarrassment is a step in the direction of gender parity. In a country where women launch Mars Orbiters wearing Kanjivaram silk sarees and women in fatigues hold combat roles in the armed forces, menstruation is but a blimp in life’s journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-1st-menstruation-talk-at-i-day/story-du6zoOUwrFu31htY6XqfUL.html
16-08-2020||India||Ram temple issue figures in PM Modi’s I-Day address address||The construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya figured in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech on Saturday.“Ten days ago, the construction of the temple has begun…A peaceful resolution to Ram Janmabhoomi issue is unprecedented. The peace and understanding that the people showed is not only unprecedented but will serve as an inspiration for us in the future,” Modi said from the ramparts of the Red Fort. On August 5, Modi laid the first brick of the Ram Mandir at a grand “bhoomi pujan” ceremony in Ayodhya, and said the day will stand as a symbol of the commitment of several generations that devoted their lives to the construction of the temple.The beginning of the construction work comes after a 135-year-old legal dispute culminated when the Supreme Court, last November, awarded the disputed land to Hindu parties. It also comes in the wake of a three-decade-long mobilisation by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological affiliates, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 — an act declared illegal by the same SC verdict — that led to communal violence and deaths in various parts of the country. Modi making a reference to the Ram temple issue, which formed the pivot of the BJP’s journey, was not a political statement, a senior BJP functionary said. “It was said in a way of recollecting the events of the year gone by. It was not a political statement but an account given to the people,” said the functionary, requesting anonymity. Hari Desai, a Gujarat-based political commentator, said the mention of Ram temple in the PM’s speech was not out of place or inappropriate. He said, however, there should have also been a mention of the land given for the construction of a mosque near Ayodhya. “It would have just given confidence to the people of this country that the SC’s judgment has been respected,” he said.A proposed mosque coming up is on a five-acre site outside Ayodhya and is likely to be named after the village of Dhannipur where it is located.The Uttar Pradesh government handed the plot, currently occupied by rice fields 20km from Ayodhya town, to the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board earlier this month in accordance with the top court’s verdict that cleared the way for the construction of a Ram temple and also ordered the government to award five acres of land at an alternative site for the construction of a mosque. CPI general secretary D Raja was critical of Modi’s speech. “He failed to address the issues of unemployment and poverty but mentioned Ayodhya, which exposed him completely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-issue-figures-in-address/story-pa3UkjBHsnq9DY7gb10ONL.html
16-08-2020||India||With Art 370 gone, new era of normalcy dawned in J&K: L-G||Lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Saturday said the constitutional changes that divested Jammu & Kashmir of its special status last year will usher in a new era of normalcy while setting transparency, grassroots democracy, people’s welfare, development and employment opportunities as the targets for his administration.He referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharata Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Campaign) and said Jammu & Kashmir is bound to get the maximum benefit from it to revive its economy. “Eight task forces [have been] created for the dedicated implementation of the package,’’ Sinha said as he hoisted the tricolour at an Independence Day function in Srinagar amid tight security.Three-tier security was put in place across Srinagar amid intelligence inputs about a possible militant attack. Many important roads were barricaded with barbed wires and smart fencing across the city a day after two policemen were killed in an attack on the outskirts of Srinagar on Friday. Mobile 2G internet services was also snapped for four hours as part of the security measures.Sinha said the new domicile rules introduced following the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370 that stripped the region of its special status shall provide equality, justice to the deprived sections of the society, and women married outside Jammu & Kashmir. He added the reservation policy was also being made more effective.Sinha said a new era of normalcy and development has dawned in Jammu & Kashmir. “I seek the cooperation of people to create a new Jammu & Kashmir.’’ He referred to the achievements of the Jammu & Kashmir administration and added long pending works like Srinagar’s Rambagh flyover have been completed. “Work on Jammu Ring Road, Akhnoor Road, Pakal-Dul Hydro-Electric Project, Kiru & Ratle power projects have been expedited. The new tunnel at Banihal on Jammu-Srinagar highway and the world’s highest rail bridge on Chenab will be completed in 2021. By 2022, Kashmir will be connected all the way to Kanyakumari by rail...”Sinha said Jammu & Kashmir is at the forefront of the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana with three million beneficiaries. He added the administration plans to extend the benefits of the health scheme to 10 million beneficiaries. Sinha praised doctors, and paramedics, who are working selflessly to fight the Covid-19.Independence Day functions were held across the Union Territory and deputy commissioners hoisted the national flag in their respective districts. Sinha’s advisor, KK Sharma, unfurled the tricolour in Jammu.Big LED screens were also installed at two places in Srinagar for the live telecast of Modi’s Independence Day address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-art-370-gone-new-era-of-normalcy-dawned-in-j-k-l-g/story-vjk7RdgtbJoFj6I9RPRqqO.html
16-08-2020||India||Nepal PM Oli calls Modi, talks about boosting ties||Nepal looks forward to a meaningful bilateral cooperation, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli told his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in a phone conversation on Saturday, the first contact at the highest level between the two sides since a a border row hit their ties. Oli called Modi to congratulate him on India’s 74th Independence Day, and expressed his appreciation for the Indian leader’s renewed priority to the neighbourhood, as spelt out in his Independence Day address. The two leaders last spoke on April 10 to discuss the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. In May, Nepal protested against the opening of a road by India to Lipulekh on the border with Tibet, and ties were hit further when Kathmandu published a new political map that depicted the Kalapani area, controlled by India, as a Nepalese territory. Saturday’s phone conversation, which was widely anticipated in diplomatic circles, provided an opportunity for the two sides to clear the air and take forward the process of addressing their differences, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The conversation also came two days before a meeting in Kathmandu of the India-Nepal joint oversight mechanism, a body that oversees the implementation of development projects funded by New Delhi. The body, launched in 2016, is chaired by Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra and Nepal’s foreign secretary Shanker Das Bairagi. “Prime Minister Oli appreciated Prime Minister Modi’s renewed priority to neighbourhood as spelt out in today’s Independence Day address. The Prime Minister of Nepal looked forward to meaningful bilateral cooperation,” said a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry. A statement from the external affairs ministry said the leaders “expressed mutual solidarity in the context of the efforts being made to minimise the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in both countries”, and Modi offered India’s continued support to Nepal in this regard. “Prime Minister thanked the Prime Minister of Nepal for his telephone call and recalled the civilisational and cultural links that India and Nepal share,” the statement added. In his speech, Modi said India is forging deeper connections with its neighbours through a partnership of security, development and trust. Noting that a quarter of the world’s population lives in South Asia, he said the countries of the region can create countless opportunities for the development and prosperity of such a large population through cooperation and partnership. “All the leaders of the countries of the region have a huge responsibility, an important responsibility for the development and progress of such a vast population,” he said. “The more peace and harmony there is in this whole region, the more it will work for the welfare of humanity,” he added. Oli congratulated Modi on India’s recent election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and expressed his “best wishes for the successful discharge of this important responsibility”, the Nepalese foreign ministry’s readout said. The two leaders exchanged views on latest efforts in the fight against Covid-19 and agreed to work together in this area, it said. While underlining the need for early development of a vaccine, Oli expressed the hope that scientists around the world, including in India, will be able to develop it in order to control and prevent the disease from spreading further, it added. The two leaders also agreed to continue discussions on bilateral matters in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-oli-calls-modi-talks-about-boosting-ties/story-7BaANrKrfvD4iy9qHeYjBL.html
16-08-2020||India||Polls to be held in J&K after delimitation exercise: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday that elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir after a delimitation process in the Union Territory was over, while touching upon the nullification of Article 370 in his Independence Day address from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister said it had been a year since the government’s move to nullify Article 370, which accorded special status to the erstwhile state. “This one year has been a very important milestone for the new development journey of these regions as it gave women and Dalits of this region their basic rights, besides giving dignity to the lives of our refugee brethren,” Modi said. He also referred to the “Back to Villages” initiative of the administration of the Union Territory and said it ensured that development reached the villages and the poor. Under this scheme, bureaucrats spent time in villages to address the problems of the people.“I thank the panches and sarpanches from the core of my heart for their active participation in this development journey,” Modi said.The strength and real power of democracy lies in elected local bodies, Modi said. It is a matter of pride that the public representatives of these local bodies are taking forward the development process in J&K with their active participation and concern, he added.“The delimitation exercise is going on in Jammu and Kashmir under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge. As soon as the delimitation process is over, there will be elections in the future so that the Union Territory has its own government, which will undertake development work with renewed vigour,” Modi said.The process of delimitation of Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies in the Union Territory was set in motion with the appointment of former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai as the chairperson of the Delimitation Commission in March.The delimitation exercise will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act of 2019 that split the state into two Union Territories — Jammu and Kashmir with an assembly and Ladakh without an assembly. Delimitation will be based on the Census of 2011 due to an amendment in the J&K Reorganisation Act.The number of assembly seats in Jammu and Kashmir after delimitation will increase from 107 to 114, including 24 seats for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to news agency PTI.Before Jammu and Kashmir was reorganised, there were 46 assembly seats in Kashmir, 37 in Jammu and four in Ladakh, PTO reported. After delimitation, Jammu is likely to gain five seats and Kashmir two. By making Ladakh a Union Territory “we have fulfilled their aspirations and a much delayed demand”, Modi said.Ladakh, situated in the heights of the Himalayas, is moving towards the peak of development, Modi added. “A central university is coming up, research centres are being made, hotel management courses are running there. The plan is on to build a 7,500 MW solar park.” “Ladakh has a lot of qualities and we have to polish and preserve them. As Sikkim has an identity as an organic state in the northeast, the regions of Leh, Ladakh and Kargil can make its identity as a carbon neutral unit. For this, the government is working with local citizens to create a sample model…,” he said.J&K did come up in Modi’s speech last year as well. “Within 70 days of the new government, we removed Article 370 which was not done in last 70 years,” he said back then, referring to the government’s August 5 move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/polls-to-be-held-in-j-k-after-delimitation-exercise-modi/story-e6RB7qNNcKfpuMtSOmYLFI.html
16-08-2020||India||Ladakh, Leh, Kargil to be India’s first carbon neutral region: PM Modi||A 7500 MW solar park is being built in Ladakh for electricity and infrastructure development in the region. The Ladakh, Leh and Kargil region will be developed and declared to be a carbon neutral region, PM Modi said in his Independence Day speech on Saturday.While the concept of carbon neutral villages have been considered in India in the past and some villages in Kerala and Manipur have adopted it, this will be the first large region to be carbon neutral. Carbon neutrality means annual zero net anthropogenic (human caused or influenced) CO2 emissions by a certain date. “By definition, carbon neutrality means every ton of anthropogenic CO2 emitted is compensated with an equivalent amount of CO2 removed,” according to World Resources Institute. Many countries have announced to be carbon neutral by 2050 as part of the Paris Agreement.“Just like Sikkim has positioned itself as an organic state, the Ladakh, Kargil and Leh region is moving in the direction of becoming carbon neutral. This will be achieved with participation from local people,” PM Modi said adding that India now among top 5 countries in renewable energy generation.“It is heartening to hear an environmentally conscious independence day speech. The ongoing pandemic has shown that living in harmony with nature is the only way forward. The Ladakh region is a natural carbon sink and making it carbon neutral pave the way for many other regions in India to embark on this carbon neutrality journey. It will be now interesting to see how this announcement is operationalised and replicated in other parts of the country. It will also be intriguing to see how large businesses will respond to this call. “India leads the UN secretary general’s Industry Transitions Track along with Sweden and such domestic measures will enable enhanced global cooperation which is essential in winning the fight against climate change,” said Karan Mangotra, associate director and climate finance expert at The Energy and Resources Institute.PM Modi also announced that 100 cities will be considered on a mission mode to achieve clean air through various policy, participatory and technological interventions.Along the lines of Project Tiger; PM Modi said Project Lion and Project Dolphin will be rolled out soon to ensure biodiversity conservation which may also boost tourism.India recorded a 33% increase in tiger numbers from 2014 to 2018, according to the summary of the report, All India Tiger Estimation Results, released last year. There were 2,967 tigers in India in 2018, compared to 2,226 in 2014.In India, Gangetic dolphins are found along deep river reaches in Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. As per environment ministry’s assessment report, there are about 3700 Gangetic dolphins.Environment ministry will be launching a ten year “Project Gangetic Dolphin” which will try to empower the river dependent population in reducing the river pollution and allowing sustainable fisheries. The project will be implemented by various ministries including jal shakti, ministry of shipping, ministry of agriculture & farmers welfare, ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, ministries of power and rural development.Experts said the impact of large solar parks in ecologically fragile areas also need to be studied. “It will be important to see how the government seeks to achieve carbon neutrality in the region and whether social costs or impacts on biodiversity are being considered. Setting up of solar parks or creating plantations as carbon sinks are not environmentally benign projects as calculations for carbon emissions do not take into account all impacts,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-leh-kargil-to-be-india-s-first-carbon-neutral-region-pm-modi/story-Fch08ZUOlgusCxOTYvDMGK.html
16-08-2020||Editorials||The government must translate intent into action||On August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a raft of measures to ensure that India can maintain the delicate balance between its development priorities and the need to keep its environment healthy. The priorities of the government, PM Modi said, included saving Gangetic dolphins and Asiatic lions along the lines of Project Tiger, making Ladakh carbon-neutral, reducing pollution in 100 cities, and prioritising renewable energy.PM Modi’s endorsement of the need for a healthy environment is significant because only a strong political push can nudge both the bureaucracy and citizens towards opting for a green path, make it a mainstream issue, raise awareness levels, and increase funding for it. An excellent example of what political support can do to a neglected issue is the Swachh Bharat Mission — the PM’s interest raised the programme’s profile; sanitation became a key national issue; and additional resources were allocated. But there are other issues which merit attention. The Modi government is embroiled in controversy over a critical piece of green policy (the Environmental Impact Assessment). It has been criticised for opening up pristine forest blocks for coal mining, since this could adversely affect forests, critical biodiversity and forest-dependent communities, and undermine efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. The government is also seen as not doing enough to strengthen institutions that safeguard the environment. And even though renewable energy has been the top agenda, coal continues to be the mainstay of India’s power mix (50%). The Covid-19 experience is a reminder that the country should aim for not just socio-economic recovery, but a green socio-economic recovery. The PM’s intent is correct. Translate it into action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-government-must-translate-intent-into-action/story-47VlBNxfOjeR3PUZayXg7O.html
16-08-2020||Editorials||India and its worldview||Harmony, security and self-reliance are a seamless whole. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi drew these together during his Independence Day speech, a reminder that defence and foreign policy have unusual salience these days. The event, already muted by the pandemic, took place when much of the Northern Command has been mobilised, China has refused to restore the border status quo in Ladakh and the international system is in increasing disarray. It is no accident that PM spoke so much about the sacrifices of Indian soldiers, the defence measures the country is taking, and how much bigger the country’s international footprint has become. While never specifically mentioned, the centrality of the Chinese threat suffused much of the speech. Terrorism, and, therefore Pakistan, received an obligatory mention. The undermining of India’s territorial integrity, the soldiers killed in Ladakh, and the historical aside of India’s opposition to imperialism and “expansionism” were all messages addressed to Beijing. There has been a feeling that the Middle Kingdom does not understand the significance of what has happened on the Ladakh border and how much it threatens to distort bilateral relations. After this speech, China’s leadership has no reason to claim that it had no sense of the deepening hostility they have engendered in India.PM Modi made it a point to stress as to how much India’s standing has grown overseas. India was re-elected to the United Nations Security Council with a landslide vote. While the neighbourhood remains a concern, New Delhi has become a beneficiary of the changing geopolitics of West Asia with, for example, the recent bonding of two its regional friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. There was also a reminder of Southeast Asia’s importance. The idea of an “extended neighbourhood” that is connected by trust, land and sea sounds too broad to be meaningful. Yet, this is where India is going as it ratchets up new relationships across the world. PM Modi recognises that the question is how India reconciles all this with its current self-reliance framework. While it has laid out a reasonable indigenisation policy on defence, the task ahead will be an updated trade policy. India’s friends need to be reassured as to where New Delhi thinks economics fits into its extended neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-and-its-worldview/story-aEt7nAiM2cY1yYOlfrpUCN.html
