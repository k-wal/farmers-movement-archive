06-08-2020||News||How Mandal changed, and did not change, India||On August 7, 1990, the then prime minister, VP Singh, made a historic announcement in Parliament. Singh declared before both Houses that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) would get 27% reservation in jobs in central government services and public sector units.By giving reservation to OBCs in employment, Singh was fulfilling only one half of the first recommendation of the Mandal Commission. The Mandal Commission was set up on January 1, 1979, under the chairmanship of BP Mandal. It submitted its report on December 31, 1980. The second half of the Commission’s recommendation was the reservation for OBCs in central educational institutions. The OBCs had to wait till 2006 for this.The Mandal Commission had also recommended land redistribution and change in relations of production. It said in its report, “Reservations in government employment and educational institutions, as also all financial assistance will remain mere palliatives unless the problem of backwardness is tackled at its root. Bulk of the small landholders, tenants, agricultural labour, impoverished village artisans, unskilled workers, etc, belong to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.”The Commission further commented, “It is the Commission’s firm conviction that a radical transformation of the existing production relations is the most important single step that can be taken for the welfare and upliftment of all backward classes. Even if this is not possible in the industrial sector for various reasons, in the agricultural sector a change of this nature is both feasible and overdue.”No Union government has taken any substantial steps to bring about the structural change that was advocated by the Mandal Commission. We are moving in the opposite direction. Even though OBCs have got 27% reservation in employment and education, implementation remains inadequate. Agriculture, the backbone of the rural economy, has become economically unviable. Industrial capital remains firmly in the hands of the upper castes.Last month, the central government admitted in the Madras High Court (HC) that OBCs were not given reservation in the All India quota of medical seats in courses such as the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Dental Surgery since 1986. This will hopefully change from next year as the HC has given clear directions to set up a committee to look into this issue. But one wonders how many such other cases exist in which OBC reservation is not being implemented just because no one has noticed yet.The Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), for example, do not offer reservation in teaching posts and have no intention of doing so in the future. These 20 IIMs had requested the Union government to include them in the Institutions of Excellence category, which would exempt them from the implementation of reservation in faculty positions.The data collected by scholars Christophe Jaffrelot and Kalaiyarasan A shows that OBCs occupied only 8.37% posts in the Class A of central government services and only 10.01% of the Class B posts. These figures demonstrate the severe under-representation of the communities that make up more than half of India’s population.The history of reservation for the backward castes goes back to 1902 when Shahu Maharaj, the ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur, reserved 50% jobs for backward castes (all communities except forward groups such as Brahmins, Prabhus, Shenvis and Parsis).When India’s Constitution came into force in 1950, the question of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was already settled. But what is meant by backward classes and who should be included in this category were questions that remained mired in controversy for decades. The Jawaharlal Nehru government set up a backward classes commission in 1953, which drew up a list of 2,399 communities listing them as backward. But the government did not act on this report.The Nehru dispensation was largely hostile to the idea of accepting caste as the basis for defining backward classes. This view was shared by the upper caste-dominated media and academia too, which would have preferred “secular” criteria such as income, literacy, or occupation. The belief that acknowledging ascriptive units such as caste would make them firmer in the minds of people was held by many. (The secularists have finally won with the institution of quotas for “economically weaker sections”, which makes income a criterion for backwardness.)Due to the government’s inertia, the OBC category could not gain any meaningful traction nationally until August 7, 1990. Retrospectively speaking, the four lost decades did immense harm to OBCs. They remain severely under-represented in government jobs and the corridors of power, and, after the promising start of the 1990s, their political representation, too, has weakened. Hopefully, the 30th anniversary of the Mandal moment will give a new fillip to their politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-mandal-changed-and-did-not-change-india/story-K9gS9hXivYSKuX5lMYHPPI.html
06-08-2020||News||UNSC: A diplomatic ‘two-front’ war||Stoking diplomatic deadwood in the hope that the embers may catch fire is a parlour game at the United Nations. One of our neighbours — Pakistan — has indulged in this for years. “The India-Pakistan Question”, inscribed on the United Nations Security Council (SC)’s agenda on January 6, 1948, was last considered by SC on November 5, 1965. Yet, on the annual requests of Pakistan, the item has remained an inert part of the Council’s formal agenda. These requests are followed by sundry communications, in a bid to stir the pot. They are circulated and filed. No one is bothered. Then, in August 2019, following changes to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)’s special status provided in the Indian Constitution, China weighed in favour of its “iron brother” and initiated what was akin to a diplomatic “two-front war”.Using its perch on the Council, China took over the driver’s seat of this venture. Since China did not have the requisite majority to call for a formal meeting, it requested an informal consultation. China proposed a draft outcome statement and lobbied for support. The tussle was transformed into one between a Permanent Member of the Council — China; and a non-member of the Council — India. Pakistan was the cat’s paw in the equation.The duo threw everything into the fray. They argued along the following three axes. Contrary to previous Council decisions, India changed the status quo, violating international law. The change resulted in large-scale human rights violations, leading to a serious humanitarian situation. This, along with India’s military assertiveness along the Line of Control constituted a threat to international peace and security. The Council, which is responsible for maintenance of international peace and security, needed to respond. The same talk that we hear now on India-China issues was voiced then. Can India take on an economy five times its size? Can actions evoking criticism domestically be shielded from global scrutiny? Will a global power, which had sewn up vast swathes with its Belt and Road Initiative, not get broad support against a mid-sized delegation with limited resources? A blow-by-blow account is left for another time. Suffice it to say that then, as now, hubris of global overreach was on display. Then, as now, quiet diplomacy was in play. Then, as now, despite the disparity in the power equation, some stay silent. Then, as now, key partners weigh in our favour. The closed-door outcome was better than expected. The public diplomacy victory was the icing on the cake. More efforts — including one earlier this week — have been made. These follow a slightly different tack. Pakistan writes a letter to the president of the Council. China follows up to raise the matter during closed, informal consultations under “Any Other Business”. The “pinprick” doesn’t yield anything, as overwhelmingly, others aren’t interested. The rubric “Any Other Business” can be used by anyone, to raise anything. Some have used it to prick China about Hong Kong, and in course of discussions also referred to the treatment of Uighurs. Others target Russia by raising matters not on the active agenda. In short, failed “pinpricks” are par for the course. Our overcoming such efforts provides useful “lessons learnt”. First, in August 2019, the People’s Republic of China took the unprecedented step of trying to extricate an agenda item that it had historically never engaged with. When the item was last considered in 1965, it was the Republic of China whose representative sat on the Council. China invalidated the oft-repeated shibboleth that it will handle “differences through peaceful discussion” bearing in mind “sensitivities and concerns”. Despite not succeeding, China keeps trying in other ways. Try, try and try again seems their theme song; never letting our guard down needs to be ours.Second, China, an authoritarian autocracy averse to invoking human rights concerns in Council discussions, opportunistically masqueraded as a champion of human rights in J&K in August 2019. China used a double-edged weapon against us. When those who partner us in thwarting Chinese efforts accuse China of violating human rights, we need to consider whether to continue the approach of keeping our distance or work with them on such issues.Third, when China initially pushed for a discussion on J&K, it cloaked itself as a “concerned” member of the international community. China’s interests in owning a suitable piece of real estate in the region were not obvious to all. China’s actions this summer are increasingly viewed as of a full-fledged party to a dispute. Should it keep treading this path, someone or the other can raise concerns about China’s role, which can lead to China attracting UN provisions that apply to parties to a dispute.Fourth, when confronting “wolf warriors”, we need to better understand the “wolf totem” too. China’s manoeuvres on one front tend to presage, at times, other interventions and may possibly be a precursor to developments on other fronts. We, therefore, require greater coherence in our approach to China, across the board. Fifth, the broader takeaway is that in a fast-evolving multipolar order, bilateral differences among the poles are best addressed appropriately, rather than taken to multilateral platforms and nurtured as disputes. If a pole still persists, then, at best, it would be a “pinprick”, nothing more. No pole, irrespective of its weight relative to the others, can easily sway the rest to the detriment of another pole. The “de facto” realities of a multipolar world are resetting the “de jure” world of multilateralism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/unsc-a-diplomatic-two-front-war/story-FIMwBHAa9BJOCj5pDsbuWN.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||Overgrown trees leave residents concerned in southern sectors||Unpruned trees in some southern sectors have left the residents concerned for their safety. Residents say trees aren’t being pruned and branches in some cases have touched the electricity supply lines, a perfect recipe for mishaps during the monsoons. Residents of southern sectors say this is again an example of “step-brotherly treatment”. President of the Sector 44-B resident welfare association (RWA) Swadesh Talwar said, “We had been asking the municipal corporation (MC) for months to prune a tree as there is a pipe with wires going through it which has now sunk into the trunk of the tree. The residents here are fearful that it may lead to electrocution.” In Sector 46-A, there are many vacant plots having large trees. Sector’s RWA president Rajinder Garg said, “The trees have become so thick that the streetlights aren’t effective anymore. We have complained to the MC numerous times but our complaints are not addressed.”Vice-president of the Sector 49 RWA Jatinder Mehta said pruning happen only after residents complain or approach the higher officials of the MC. “Pruning of trees should be a regular process in all sectors. Nowadays, MC acts only when there is a complaint.”Pruning of trees within the sectors is done by the horticulture department of the MC. Officials say pruning works are put on hold during monsoons except for if there is an emergency. “We are receiving a few complaints, pruning will resume in September,” officials said. He said due to shortage of labour and the lockdown, pruning work couldn’t be carried out completely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/overgrown-trees-leave-residents-concerned-in-southern-sectors/story-JEbz0snBhINiNIL1sYGMSO.html

Her mother, a brother and a cousin were arrested, who during questioning confessed that they strangled the girl as she used to talk to a boy over phone, the police said. Kaithal superintendent of police Shashank Kumar said the police had got a tip-off about the girl’s murder and a team lead by DSP Ravinder Sangwan reached the spot only to find her body being cremated.In the presence of duty magistrate Hardev Singh, police officials pulled out the girl’s body from the pyre and sent it to PGIMS in Rohtak for the postmortem examination. The accused have been charged with murder and a probe has been launched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-16-year-old-girl-s-body-pulled-out-of-pyre-mother-brothers-held-for-murder/story-yHgG7OYl7VuPkRFdt82vKP.html
06-08-2020||City||Haryana to launch special campaign to prevent farm fires||In order to bring down the incidents of farm fires in the coming kharif harvesting season (beginning in October), the Haryana government will conduct a special awareness drive for farmers to apprise them of the adverse impacts of burning paddy residue. The officials working on the plan said the government has decided to keep a strict vigil, especially on villages which are notorious for the burning of crop residue. A local-level committee will be formed to keep an eye on the erring farmers so that immediate action can be taken, they added. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) had shared details of villages having maximum cases of active fire locations with the district administrations concerned. “Last year, we had identified villages with maximum cases of stubble burning and this time also, we are planning to identity at least 30 hot villages in every paddy sowing district for a focused approach,” said HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan. Officials from agriculture, revenue, pollution control board, and development and panchayats department will initiate a drive in these villages to make farmers aware of the adverse impacts of burning of paddy residue. “Last year, we observed a significant reduction in farm fires as compared to the previous years’ data as we had adopted the strategy of identifying top burning’ villages in every district based on the active fire locations identified in the previous season,” Narayanan said. Sanjeev Kaushal, additional chief secretary, agriculture and farmers’ welfare department, said, “This year we will divide the villages in red, orange and green zones. There will be a special focus on red zones. Also, the pollution control board will be asked to file FIRs against the erring farmers this year.” As per figures, the state has recorded a considerable decline in farm fire incidents. Last wheat harvesting season, as many as 3,911 active fire locations were identified by Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) against 7,378 of 2019. A total of 6,630 such locations were identified during the last paddy season against 2018’s 10,286. According to officials, setting up the custom hiring centres in the state did not give desired results as most of the machines were purchased by big farmers and small farmers were unable to hire them. Now, the government is focusing on providing straw bailers for the management of crop waste and making it profitable for the farmers. This year, the state government has introduced a ₹1,304-crore plan for crop residue management with special focus on kharif harvesting season. The state agriculture department officials said this year, the area under parmal varieties has increased which may create more problems as they are harvested by the machines and leave around 20 quintals of unmanaged crop waste behind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-to-launch-special-campaign-to-prevent-farm-fires/story-Ikbxm7smW7F3eRmCC9D4cO.html

On Thursday, the SIT arrested two wholesale medicine distributors from Jaipur and Agra — including one who was involved in distribution of remdesivir — an experimental drug administered to Covid-19 patients in emergency situations. The suspects have been identified as Hariom Tikiwal, 42, owner of Krom Pharmaceuticals in Jaipur and Amit Aggarwal, 45, a wholesale medicine distributor from Agra. So far, the police have arrested 10 persons in the racket — including four Iraqi interpreters and four pharmacists and two wholesale distributors. Three pharmacists have been nabbed from Delhi, while one was picked up from Gurugram . Ever since the Iraqi interpreters were arrested on July 28 in a raid — during which police had allegedly recovered 48 vials of remdesivir, 55 strips of fabiflu and 18 packs of Lopikast (three drugs used to treat Covid-19) — the police have followed a pattern of reverse tracking and conducted raids in Delhi, Gurugram, Jaipur and Agra, based on questioning of the suspects in custody. Police said the first key link in the chain was established with the arrest of Pradeep, a pharmacist in Jharsa, sector 38. Probe found that Pradeep had allegedly procured remdesivir injection for Rs 15,000 per vial without an invoice from a supplier in Delhi and sold it to Mohanad, one of the arrested Iraqi suspects, for Rs 18,000 per vial. Police had recovered 84 vials of remdesivir, which Pradeep had allegedly concealed in a room near a tubewell in his village in Pataudi. He had allegedly received Rs 15 lakh as advance and the consignment was supposed to be sent to Iraq through medical tourism patients. A vial in Iraq is sold for over Rs 1 lakh . During interrogation, Pradeep allegedly told the police that he procured medicines from Sajid and Faizan, who run a medical store in Jhandewalan, Delhi, following which the duo was arrested on July 31. The following day, one Tarun Goyal, a pharmacist from Hauz Khas, Delhi, was arrested for allegedly selling the vials to Sajid and Faizan. The trail led police to Agra as Goyal revealed his source, Amit Aggarwal, who runs a wholesale medicine shop, MK Distributors, along with his brother in Agra. Police said in a statement that after raids in Agra, probe revealed that Hariom Tikiwal, a wholesale distributor of medicines in Jaipur and one of the distributors of remdesivir, used to procure the drug for Rs 4200 per vial from the manufacturing company and sell it to Aggarwal in Agra for a margin. Police said everyone in the network sold the injections for a margin, with the chain eventually reaching to Iraqi interpreters. Karan Goyal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), DLF, who is heading the five-member SIT, said, “There is a whole chain involving pharmacists, wholesalers and distributors of pharmaceuticals, who were supplying these medicines across states. We are trying to get to the source and questioning suspects about their dealings. We shall also write to the concerned pharmaceutical company since some of these drugs are directly sold to hospitals and there are no intermediaries.” Earlier, the police had said that the role of some hospitals in Delhi was also under the scanner. Police probe has found that the Iraqi interpreters had been smuggling medicines to Iraq for at least two years and since the pandemic, they had started dealing primarily in drugs used to treat Covid-19 which were in short supply and hence sold at exorbitant prices in Iraq. The suspects worked as translators for medical tourism patients at private hospitals and enlisted the patients or their attendants as conduits and asked them to carry medicines along with their personal medicines in the flights to Iraq, where an aide would collect it from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-drugs-racket-sit-probe-widens-to-four-cities-two-wholesale-distributors-held-ten-arrested-so-far/story-UQoy4DQpPIVjgqSRrwFmxN.html
06-08-2020||Gurugram||21K people to be covered under state-wide Covid sero survey||More than 21,000 people will be covered across Haryana for Covid-19 serological survey to ascertain the proportion of population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection .In each of the 22 districts of Haryana, including Gurugram, at least 960 people will be tested during the sero survey which aims to look for IgG antibodies against Covid-19 that may have developed without the patient showing any symptoms of the virus. The survey is likely to start from the third week of August, according to the official letter issued by the state health department on Thursday. For five Haryana districts — Gurugram, Ambala, Faridabad, Panchkula and Sonepat — this will be the second round of sero-survey being carrid out to try and determine the prevalence of infection spread. In the first round of survey in Gurugram — conducted from last week of June till mid July — 454 IgG antibody tests were done, out of which 56 were positive and 398 were negative. The survey showed a positivity rate of 12.3%. As reported by HT earlier, experts said that if the positivity rate is extrapolated to the 15 lakh population of the city (as per the 2011 census), then 12.3% translates to 1.85 lakh population who may have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The health department officials, however, have maintained that the survey was held in too small a scale to derive any conclusions. Overall, in the five districts 1,544 people were tested, of which 180 had antibodies while the remaining 1,364 were negative. Therefore, to gauge the actual spread of the disease among the wider population base, who had been left out from testing, the state government will cover all 22 districts this time. The sample size too this time, has been increased to 960 per district, and will cover at least 21,120 people. Rajiv Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “The purpose of the study is to know how many people have already suffered from the infection without showing any symptoms — like cough, cold and fever. Or they might be cases of mild symptoms, which went unnoticed. Through IgG test we can tell who got infected in the past. The findings will help the department to draw guidelines as per the district regulations to prevent and control the spread of infection furtherin the community.”IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus develops in the body two weeks after the onset of the infection and it remains in the body for long time, indicating that the body had contracted the virus in the past. For this, 5ml blood is drawn from people who are covered under the survey for the antibody tests.Arora said, “Each district will get 10 kits, through which 960 IgG antibody test will be conducted. Some of the districts have kits from the previous survey, which has been included in the total kits to be provided.” According to the official letter on sero survey issued by the state health department, the survey will start from third week of August and the final report will be drafted by the end of the month. It will be conducted in collaboration with PGIMER, Chandigarh. Out of the 960 people to be covered under the survey, population from both urban and rural areas will be taken into account as state’s rural and urban population ratio is 60:40. “The survey will be conducted in clusters identified based on GPS mapping. In urban areas, four clusters will be selected, whereas in the rural areas we will select 12 clusters. Only people above 18 years of age will be covered only after they give their consent,” Arora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/21k-people-to-be-covered-under-state-wide-covid-sero-survey/story-wW8yAK2xk2yeJ4OS4rNK1N.html
06-08-2020||City||Gurugram: DTCP directs Ardee City developer to initiate registries or face action||Gurugram: The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has issued directions to the developer of Ardee City project to start executing apartment registries of around 300 property owners within a week, which have been pending for over a decade. The department has also said that if the developer does not take action in this regard, then it could face penal action. The directions follow the repeated complaints lodged by the residents, who have alleged that despite repeated pleas, the process of registration had not started.Earlier in February, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during a grievance meeting had issued directions that the registry of these properties should be started at the earliest. The residents said that they have paid all the dues to the developer, while the latter raised the objection that majority of residents have pending dues and thus registries were not carried out. District town planner RS Bhath said that action was delayed in the matter due to the lockdown but after the restrictions were relaxed, the developer was asked to share details of owners but they got no response.”The department has now directed that details of homebuyers who have or haven’t deposited dues should be submitted. If the response is not filed within a week, an FIR will be filed,” he said.Anil Hasija, vice president, Ardee City’s developer, said that this matter was sub-judice and will be decided by the court. “Those owners who have paid their dues can get their houses registered but others need to pay,” he said.The residents, meanwhile, said that they have already submitted documents of around 60 home owners in the month of March but no action was taken. “There is no connection between maintenance dues and registry as the property price has already been paid in full to the developer 10 years back. The process of registry of floors has no clause about maintenance and this is a sheer delaying tactic,” said Chaitali, a homeowner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-dtcp-directs-ardee-city-developer-to-initiate-registries-or-face-action/story-0QI413dHS5D357BmNYs2lN.html
06-08-2020||Gurugram||Five Covid patients booked for skipping home quarantine||Five people, who had tested positive for Covid-19, were booked for allegedly violating quarantine protocols and leaving home isolation, thereby potentially threatening the spread of the infection in Molahera sector 22, the police said on Thursday. Police said preliminary probe has found that all the patients hailed from Kushinagar district in Uttar Pradesh and had gone back to their respective homes. Police teams are currently trying to trace their whereabouts. According to the police, the incident was reported to them by the health department on August 2 when officials had gone to the area for an inspection and did not find the Covid-19 positive patients at the given address. Police said that on July 28, one person had tested positive for Covid-19 and was advised home isolation. Over the next three days, the samples of four other tenants, aged 26, 47, 22 and 24 respectively, in the same building were taken,who positive for the virus on August 2. Police said after the patients were not found at the given address, the officials tried to contact them on their mobile phones. Some of them had shared only Aadhaar card numbers and not full details of their respective hometowns, following which the landlord was questioned. Vikash Bhola, station house officer (SHO), Palam Vihar police station, said, “We are trying to trace them. It has been found that they were from Kushinagar district in Uttar Pradesh and had returned there in a vehicle. Two of the patients have negative reports and we have sought clarity from the health department. There was some complicity from their landlord in helping them escape and hence he too has been booked.” A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule), 120-B (criminal conspicracy) of Indian Penal Code and section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act at Palam Vihar police station on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-covid-patients-booked-for-skipping-home-quarantine/story-gmGZA2VH0j7CiOYeZb24XK.html
06-08-2020||Gurugram||Stabbed 30 times: Woman out of danger, suspect had been threatening family, cops say||Investigators probing the violent knife attack on a 23-year-old woman on Thursday said they had found evidence that the suspect, Vivek Kondal, was in touch with the victim’s family members for the last few months and had on multiple occasions threatened them.The woman was stabbed 30 times allegedly by her former classmate Kondal at her house in Sector 14 on Tuesday night. The woman, who suffered injuries on her ear, neck, chest, and stomach in the attack, was rushed to a private hospital in the city and later referred to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. The woman was discharged on Thursday and is out of danger, said police. Police said that during questioning so far, Kondal had told his interrogators that he had warned the victim’s family members several times, but they did not pay any heed to his threats. Police said the suspect had managed to obtain bail in the case on Wednesday. “Kondal was in touch with the woman’s relatives and was trying to convince them to get her married to him. But as he had still not completed his studies, the girl’s family found her a match and fixed her marriage. This angered Kondal,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police. The crime team with the help of cyber crime cell has taken out Kondal’s call detail records and are analysing it to get exact details to know since when he was in touch with the victim’s family members. Police said they have asked the relatives to join the investigation and their statements will be recorded. The police said the incident took place around 9.30 pm on Tuesday, shortly after the victim had returned with her husband from her parents’ house in Delhi. The suspect allegedly came to the woman’s house and stabbed her. The woman’s father-in-law, who was also injured in the attack, said they were not aware of the motive of the suspect. “We are still not convinced with the explanation he has given to the police. She got married in February this year, why will he come after five months to take revenge. We hope we get justice and the suspect is punished soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/stabbed-30-times-woman-out-of-danger-suspect-had-been-threatening-family-cops-say/story-aBvaOejXDbRfMgdkpZN7DK.html
06-08-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad: Teenaged traffic violators to watch a 30-minute film on road safety as punishment||The Faridabad Police has made it mandatory for teenaged traffic violators to watch a 30-minute-long film on road safety and clear a quiz afterwards in the place of paying a fine. The police said they will not be issued a challan, provided that they watch the film on the spot and pass a quiz based on it. If they fail to secure 35 marks, they will be required to take a retest. This exercise, which started on Thursday, is only for teenagers to ensure they are aware of road safety rules and to ensure they drive safely, the police said. The process of paying challan for others will also be modified soon, said police.The commissioner of police of Faridabad, O P Singh, said that the step was taken to streamline vehicular movement and is a way to educate young motorists on traffic norms. “However, the initiative has not been taken well by the defaulters so far,” he said. Singh said as per the new norms, it is mandatory for violators to watch a 30-minute-long movie at the police booth. They can only be released if they clear the test.The police said since it was difficult to arrange for projectors for more than 150 spots in the city, the movie has been downloaded on smartphones of all the teams deployed at traffic checkpoints. The quiz with answers has also downloaded. Many of the traffic violators, however, said it was a torture to watch a road-safety movie and they prefer paying the fine if given a chance. Anuj Kumar, a resident of Sector 21C, said that he was caught by the police after he jumped a traffic signal. “I was asked to sit on a chair at the police post, where one of the policemen handed over his mobile and asked me to watch a movie. I thought the movie would be of a few minutes but it was long and it took me almost two hours to answer all the questions correctly. I offered to pay the fine but was denied. They made me complete the quiz with all the correct answers,” he said. “These days, young people often violate speed limits and can be seen jumping traffic signals. Earlier, we used to issue challans to the parents of minors but this did not their approach towards the violation. A majority of them do not believe in wearing helmets and parents often do not keep a check on them. So we thought of educating them through this exercise,” he said, adding that this exercise will continue for a month and they are hoping to see a change as a result of this change. The movie talks about various traffic rules and the reasons behind them: Why one should not talk on a mobile phone while driving or crossing a traffic junction, why it is important to wear seat belts while driving, why it is unsafe to drink and drive, and suchlike. On Thursday, 270 bikers were caught riding without helmets and were made to sit at the check post and take the quiz, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-teenaged-traffic-violators-to-watch-a-30-minute-film-on-road-safety-as-punishment/story-cuP1Bo1hHj8sI8dZqZvYpI.html
06-08-2020||Gurugram||After experts raise doubts, HSPCB sends Bandhwari leachate samples for retest||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board(HSPCB) on Wednesday collected fresh samples of leachate from around the Bandhwari landfill site for a second laboratory test to assess whether the leachate’s chemical constituents conform to the required guidelines for discharge, as stipulated by the Centre’s Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The move comes almost two weeks after experts and environmentalists raised concerns regarding the HSPCB’s first report in the matter, dated July 18, that found no presence of heavy metals in leachate samples collected soon after the first heavy monsoon rains, around July 9. A copy of the report is in possession of Hindustan Times. Apart from the absence of heavy metals in the leachate samples, the report had stated that the pH levels (which measure acidity) and the biological oxygen demand (which is the measure of oxygen consumed by microorganisms as they decompose organic waste) in the samples were within the limits prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) solid waste management rules.Experts who reviewed the report said its findings were “highly improbable” and did not adhere to the rules of the national accreditation board for testing and calibration laboratories (NABL). In response to these allegations, HSPCB officials said on July 25 that a second analysis would be commissioned. “We have now sent two batches of samples for testing at separate labs. One will be sent to Panchkula to be tested at the HSPCB’s headquarters, and the other will be tested by an independent private laboratory. Lab reports, as well as a site inspection report, will be ready in seven days. Following that, we will issue our concluding analysis,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, Gurugram. Singh also pointed out that four samples have been collected this time, in the presence of a local environmentalist as well as a three-member team of HSPCB officials, who have been tasked with preparing the final report. An order to this effect was also issued by Singh on July 29, following complaints from city resident Vaishali Rana Chandra — an activist who has been tracking developments at the landfill. The HSPCB had initially inspected the area and collected three samples from a leachate pond for chemical analysis on July 13.Dr Rekha Singh, an approved environment expert from the Quality Council of India under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF), had expressed her doubts about the initial findings of HSPCB. She said, “The results seem highly unlikely for a leachate sample taken from a landfill. Going by the report, which shows desirable acidity and oxygen demand, the water may even be fit for drinking. This definitely raises some questions as to the integrity of the report, as most samples taken from the field -- even in natural water bodies -- show higher pH levels and the presence of contaminants.”Dr Vinod Kumar Mogha, an independent expert with over a decade-long experience in material sciences and laboratory testing, said the report does not, as per the NABL guidelines, provide any confirmatory statements about the quality of the samples taken. “Any lab test is done with a certain aim, and reports must mandatorily summarise their findings and provide conclusive statements. The HSPCB report does not tell us about the implications of its test results, as it should have,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-experts-raise-doubts-hspcb-sends-bandhwari-leachate-samples-for-retest/story-CFXMfCdlKmcTRaxaNYNCOK.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||More Asha workers under lens, parents of rescued newborns record statements||Involvement of more Asha workers in child trafficking racket busted by the Chandigarh Police has come to fore, going by the statement of the parents of the rescued 11-day-old girl who was sold for ₹1 lakh. The parents of the girl are daily wagers and she was their fourth child. Accused Bhawna (32) of Sector 45, Chandigarh, arrested for child trafficking was reportedly introduced to the couple by an Asha worker in Muktsar. The Asha worker had told the couple that Bhawna was her sister and unable to bear children.She reportedly had convinced them to hand over their newborn to Bhawna so that she can raise the child as her own. The couple handed over the custody of the newborn to Bhawna, but soon they released their folly and tried to contact the Asha worker and Bhawna. However, the phone number given to them was switched off. The family told the police that it was only when police came looking for them they got to know that the child was sold for ₹1 lakh to a childless couple in Chandigarh. The statements of parents of the girl were recorded before a magistrate. “The Asha worker who had persuaded to give up the baby girl has been traced. She is admitted to a hospital, thus her statement could not be recorded,” said a senior police officer, adding it is being probed whether the Asha worker was aware of the child being sold or not. Police on Tuesday had arrested five people including two Asha workers and a police constable. The accused were arrested while they had come to Chandigarh to sell newborn boy for ₹4 lakh to a businessman staying in Sector 37. Father of rescued boy records statementThe father of the rescued newborn boy recorded his statement before a magistrate on Thursday. Hailing from Dhuri, he stated his wife had delivered twins of which one was stillborn. He was handed over the body of the stillborn never informed about the other boy. His wife was discharged from hospital on August 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-asha-workers-under-lens-parents-of-rescued-newborns-record-statements/story-ZScSQgoNJFl7UeUJOvsn2O.html
06-08-2020||Lucknow||Donated 18 years ago, shila for Ram temple lying in Ayodhya treasury||A shila (stone) donated for construction of the Ram temple during the shiladan ceremony held in the temple town on March 15, 2002 remains apparently forgotten under ‘double lock’ of the district treasury of Ayodhya.“Yes, this shila was donated in two parts for construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. This is one of the shilas carved at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s karyashala (workshop) set up in Ayodhya. Now, when other shilas are going to be shifted from the karyashala to the construction site, this shila, kept under ‘double lock’ of the district treasury, should also be taken out and given for construction of the temple,” said Anil Kumar Gupta, who then served as the divisional commissioner of Faizabad (now Ayodhya) and receiver for the Ram Janmabhoomi site, where the Ram temple will now come up in Ayodhya.Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the first brick of the Ram temple at the bhoomi pujan ceremony held in Ayodhya on Wednesday.The then chairman of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas (Ram temple trust), the late Mahant Ramchandra Das Paramhans, had donated the shila to the then Prime Minister the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s emissary Shatrughan Singh at Bada Sthan (Ayodhya) on March 15, 2002. After taking the donation, Singh had handed over the same to the district administration, asking the officers to place it with respect under double lock of the district treasury.“Yes, the late Ram Chandra Das Paramhans had donated the shila in two parts. As the shila was to be donated to an emissary, the Centre decided to depute Shatrughan Singh from the union home ministry’s Ayodhya cell to receive the donation. Singh was flown in by a special plane to Ayodhya to receive the shila,” recollected Gupta.“Although the then VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) president Ashok Singhal was present on the occasion, the late Mahant Ramchandra Das Paramhans was the main donor of the shila,” he added.“Now when donations are pouring in for the Ram temple, the state government should transfer the donated shila from the treasury to the (temple) trust for construction of the Ram temple,” said VHP’s Ayodhya-based regional spokesman Sharad Sharma.VHP had announced a symbolic puja for the Ram temple on March 15, 2002 and later agreed to hold a ‘shiladan’ outside the then disputed Ram Janmabhoomi complex. Later, Ramchandra Das Paramhans’s successor Suresh Das also demanded that the district administration should transfer the shila to the trust for construction of the temple.Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said there were many valuable items, including gold and silver and the shila, kept in the district treasury in Ayodhya. The district administration handed over a list of all these valuable items to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust on February 5, 2020.“We have many valuable items, including gold and silver and the shila in the treasury and transferred them on paper to the temple construction trust. It is for the temple trust to take out these items as per convenience. We have no problem. Let them decide the time. We will give all these items to them,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/donated-18-years-ago-shila-for-ram-temple-lying-in-ayodhya-treasury/story-v5cH0BQb9K9L87lIHuof8L.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||Liquor theft inquiry:IAS, IPS officer face heat, Vij recommends action against duo||Haryana home minister Anil Vij has sought departmental action against IAS officer, Shekhar Vidyarthi and AGMUT cadre IPS officer, Pratiksha Godara, following their indictment by a Special Enquiry Team (SET). Vidyarthi is the excise and taxation commissioner (ETC) and Godara is a former Sonepat superintendent of police.The state government had formed the SET to probe theft of confiscated liquor from warehouses. During the lockdown, large quantity of liquor was pilfered from a godown in Kharkhauda in Sonepat. The police was also investigating the matter. “I have also written to the state vigilance bureau to conduct an inquiry on the issues that the SIT has flagged,’’ Vij said. Findings against IAS officer  Additional chief secretary, power, TC Gupta, headed the SET which had submitted its inquiry report to the home minister last week. The report indicts Vidyarthi for ordering the closure of liquor vends during the lockdown by only giving verbal instructions. “These verbal instructions should have been followed by written orders. However, no written instructions were issued by the ETC or the collector (excise). In the absence of written instructions to field officials and system integrator regarding steps to be followed for ensuring complete closure of vends, permits and passes for movement of liquor were issued during the closure period by some districts,’’ reads the inquiry report. Vij added that Vidyarthi was also responsible for dilly dallying in reply to information that SET sought and hampering the visit of the SET to NV distillery. “ The police is naming drivers of the vehicles confiscated with liquor as accused but except in a few cases, no serious efforts appeared to have been made to address the origin of smuggled liquor and to issue notices to the distilleries suspected to have smuggled liquor to join investigations. However, after the constitution of the SET, the investigating officers have sent notices to distillery managements. The name of NV distillery is surfacing in many cases again and again. How is it possible to steal liquor in a big way without the complicity of the management itself or the excise officials posted there?,’’ said the inquiry report. The home minister added that to verify the allegations, the SET had decided to visit NV distillery on July 3. “Though Vidyarthi agreed to accompany the SET during their visit to the distillery, he cited pre-occupation with work a few hours before they were to leave. Hence, the visit could not materialise,” Vij said. The probe report said a written request for facilitating the SET’s visit was sent on July 18 to the ETC. “A response was received on July 29 evening when the SET was in the last stages of finalising its recommendations. It said that matter was legally analysed by the ETC office and the request to visit the distillery was not covered under the provisions of Punjab Excise Policy, 1914 (as applicable to Haryana). This is nothing, but an attempt to block the visit of the SET to a distillery,’’ the report said. Findings against IPS officer Vij added that the AGMUT cadre IPS officer, Pratiksha Godara, who was on deputation to Haryana was indicted by the SIT for providing gunman to Bhupinder Dahiya, an accused in the Khakhauda liquor theft case and even recommending an arms licence for him. “The SET found that she knew, he was a liquor smuggler,’’ Vij said. The IPS officer however had told the SET that two police gunmen were provided to Bhupinder after he cited threat to his life from a gangster Raju Basodi. The gunmen were withdrawn immediately after the arrest of one of the shooters of Basodi gang. “ But since the threat to his life persisted, she had recommended a weapon licence for Bhupinder,’’ said the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-theft-inquiry-ias-ips-officer-face-heat-vij-recommends-action-against-duo/story-cCyGcyh9E1r6MEIn4vP89K.html

06-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad clears budget, no hike in property rates until March 31||The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) cleared the budget for 2020-21 and also took up several proposals, including freezing of sector rates till March 31, 2021. According to officials, the authority on Thursday proposed a budget that will see the body expecting to receive ₹1,102.76 crore and spend ₹931.83 crore. According to records, in 2019-20 the body received only ₹606 crore as against the budgetary expectation of ₹1,780 crore and spent only ₹768 crore as against the expected ₹1,343 crore. “We plan to spend majorly on the development of our Madhuban Bapudham Housing Scheme as well as taking up infrastructure development works. In another major proposal which was cleared, the board decided to free the sector rates till March 31, 2021 except in three localities of Indirapuram, Vaishali and Kaushambi,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner, after Thursday’s meeting in Meerut. The sector rates are the rates on which the GDA sells it properties for the first time to an allottee. The subsequent sales are taken up on circle rates which are defined by the district magistrate every year. “The proposal for freezing the sector rate would mean that there will be no hike in cost for our properties. The three localities have been left out as we have pending properties available in these areas and put to auction regularly. The decision to free the sector rates is prevalent since 2012 in order to bring the sector rates and circle rates at par. Otherwise, consistent hike in sector rates in past rendered the prices of our properties higher than the market rates,” said Shivpuri. With the freezing of sector rates, the authority plans to dispose off its pending 658 properties valued at about ₹1625 crore. The properties include 613 plots, with 28 properties having area of over 2000 square metres and 17 plots meant for hospital and schools. At present, the sector rates for GDA properties in Indirapuram, Vaishali and Kaushambi are ₹50,000 per square metres (sqm). The existing circle rates for Indirapuram range from ₹66,500 to ₹73,100 per sqm while those for Vaishali range from ₹67,500 to ₹74,200 per sqm. Kaushambi on the other hand, being close to Delhi, commands circle rates for properties in range of ₹72,500 to ₹79,700 per sqm. In another decision related to pricing of properties, the district magistrate on Thursday evening said that there will be no hike in circle rates this year too. “Due to Covid-19 situation, we have decided that the rates which prevailed in August, 2018 and those decided in August, 2019 with minor modifications, will continue to prevail this year too. There will be no increase in circle rates this year,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-clears-budget-no-hike-in-property-rates-until-march-31/story-BwbZZidGDR57gup7n6AaNK.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||CHB scraps transfer charges, buyer saves ₹15.7L on ₹1 crore property||In a major relief to the allottees of the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) dwelling units, the CHB board of directors in a meeting held here on Thursday decided that the transfer charges, 15% of the consideration amount and stamp duty, will not be applicable in those cases where a freehold CHB dwelling unit is transferred through duly registered sale deed.“The decision will be applicable in those cases where the original allottee executed a registered Sale-Deed through a General Power of Attorney (GPA).,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer (CEO), CHB. It will save the genuine purchasers from paying considerable amount as Transfer fee just because of technicalities in registration of sale-deed, Garg added.Welcoming the decision, Rajat Malhotra, general secretary, CRAWFED, said, “It will reduce major burden on the CHB allottees registering their properties. The CHB was charging 15% on the so called profit amount on the allottees who sold their properties through the GPA. This was particularly the case in transfer of property before the conversion of leasehold to freehold properties.”At the time of registration of sale deed, in addition to the sale amount, the buyer has to pay stamp duty. In the case of the CHB, the purchaser had to pay an additional 15% as transfer charge to the CHB.“So, for a property priced at ₹1 crore, the purchaser pays ₹1 crore plus ₹5 lakh stamp duty (at 5%). But, for the CHB property transferred through GPA, the purchaser for registering the sale deed had to pay additional ₹15.75 lakh as transfer charges (at 15%),” explains Rajesh Kumar, a city-based real estate consultant. Now with this decision, the buyer in the above quoted cases will not be charged the additional ₹15.75 lakh.The property experts say that the decision will boost the sagging real estate market in the city. “It is definitely a positive step for the property market in the city. Now, people who were not keen to buy CHB property because of the extra financial burden will come forward,” said Kamal Gupta, president, Chandigarh Property Consultant Welfare Association.THE GENERAL HOUSE SCHEME STILL ONThe board of directors also decided against shelving the general housing scheme in Sector 53. A revised plan for the scheme will be prepared with modified density and floor area ratio (FAR) parameters.UT urban planning has twice rejected CHB proposal for increasing the FAR in the project . The increased FAR would have decreased the cost of dwelling units in the project. Only 178 applications were received against the 492 flats on offer in March this year. The scheme offered 3HK flats for as high as ₹1.8 crore, 2BHK flats for ₹1.5 crore and 1BHK flats for ₹95 lakh. The CHB had slashed the proposed rates by 15% to attract more buyers but it did not work.BoxCHB TO FOLLOW UT PAYING GUEST POLICYIn the Thursday’s meeting, the board also decided that the CHB would follow the existing paying guest policy of the Chandigarh administration for CHB’s independent houses. However, before its implementation, approval of the UT administration will be obtained.The CHB had formulated its own paying guest policy and presented the same before the board of directors. But, the directors decided that there should be uniformity in policy in the city. “As per the UT policy, applicant for the paying guest facility needs to submit a completion certificate. For CHB properties, this condition will not be applicable,” said Garg. Also, they will have to register with the CHB secretary and not the UT estate office.Quotes:The decision will be applicable in those cases where the original allottee executed a registered sale deed through a general power of attorney (GPA).Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHBIt will reduce major burden on the CHB allottees registering their properties.

06-08-2020||Delhi||Tilak Nagar: Three held, juvenile detained for robbing and killing man, injuring his friend||A day after a man was robbed and killed, and his friend grievously injured, by three unidentified men in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar, police on Thursday said they have arrested all three and detained a juvenile accomplice. Police said the attack was planned as a revenge by one of the arrested suspects, who was an employee of the man who survived the attack and was sacked recently. The man who planned the attack was identified as Sonu Singh, 19, and he used to work at the packaged food distribution agency run by the injured man, Dheeraj, until a few months ago. His associates were identified as Kawaljeet Kumar, 19, previously involved in six criminal cases, and Anil Bahadur, 19 -- all residents of Tilak Nagar. While one juvenile accomplice was also apprehended, police said they’re on the lookout for another suspect, Kuldeep Prakash, who is on the run and was previously involved in a murder and robbery case in Vikas Puri.According to the police, a call was received at the Tilak Nagar police station at 11.29pm reporting that a few men had stabbed two men at Block 24 in Tilak Nagar and had fled towards Mall Road. “A police team reached the spot found that the injured persons had already been taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital. While one of the injured men, Ranjan Mishra, 25, who had sustained stab wounds to his right thigh, was pronounced dead at the hospital, his friend Dheeraj, who was also critically injured, survived and is undergoing treatment. His condition continues to be critical due to excessive bleeding,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named. Additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Sameer Sharma said one of the eyewitnesses, who helped shift the injured to DDU hospital, told the police that he had seen three men attacking the duo and then fleeing on a motorcycle. “The eyewitness said the injured also told him that they have been robbed of their laptop, mobile phone and ₹45,000 cash. A case of robbery and murder was registered and the investigation was taken up,” Sharma said.He said, after hours of scanning CCTV footage, technical surveillance, local enquiries and verification of least 50 active criminals, the suspects were identified as residents of Tilak Nagar. “Our teams raided their hideouts and arrested them. Of the money they had stolen, ₹24,640 was recovered along with a knife used in the murder,” the additional DCP said. Sharma said, during interrogation, Sonu revealed that he used to be an employee of Dheeraj at the latter’s shop. “He said they had gotten into a dispute over salary and Dheeraj had sacked him. When Sonu told his juvenile friend about Dheeraj, he introduced him to Kawaljeet, Anil and Kuldeep. As Sonu had also told them that Dheeraj leaves for his house every night with a daily collection of about ₹50,000, they hatched a plan to rob Dheeraj,” he said.The officer said, as planned, the juvenile suspect followed Dheeraj and Ranjan as soon as they left the shop around 10.30pm Tuesday. When they reached Choukhandi Chowk, the juvenile informed Sonu, Kanwaljeet and Anil, who intercepted the duo near Block 24 to rob them. But when the two men fought back, the trio stabbed both of them and fled with their valuables,” Sharma said. He said Kuldeep had helped the trio in carrying out the crime and several police teams are currently searching for him..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tilak-nagar-three-held-juvenile-detained-for-robbing-and-killing-man-injuring-his-friend/story-VatKNaecfuYv6sDFpSoubJ.html

06-08-2020||Noida||Ayurveda products in high demand at Covid-dedicated facilities||The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the demand for immunity boosters under ayurveda and homoeopathy at different Covid-dedicated facilities in Gautam Budh Nagar district. Entrepreneurs thank the central government ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (Ayush) for the spike in business.Rajesh Kumar, who runs an ayurvedic products store in Sector 26, said, “Since March, the demand for honey has gone up 45%, chyawanprash by 85% and turmeric by 40% in ayurvedic stores. The interest in these products has mostly been fuelled by the recommendations from the ministry of ayush to fight the coronavirus. It appealed to the people to include spices like turmeric and coriander in their cooking and to have chyawanprash.”With increased demand, prices of certain medicines too have gone up.“A 60-capsule box of Giloy tablets, which used to be sold for ₹100 now sells for ₹250,” said Kumar. Dr Vikas Kheria, an ayurveda doctor at the Gautam district hospital in sector 39, said that these medicines came with the added advantage of not having any non-organic compounds thereby reducing the risk of side effects. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi recommended use of ayurveda to boost immunity. Ayush products, being non-chemical and organic, have more immunity boosting and healing capacity. That’s why, we are serving the kadha (decoction) to the Covid-19 patients in all our L-1 facilities (for mild cases). This brewed drink is made of pure herbs like giloy, guduchi, tulsi, amalaki, ashvagandha, and others,” he said. Homeopathic practitioner CB Jha, who is also the president of Atta market association, said that he distributed around 5,000 vials of immunity boosting homeopathic medicines to front line Covid-19 warriors. “The government has approved and recommended the Arsenicum Album 30C as a preventive medicine to boost immunity. In my clinic, at least 100 patients come daily for this medicine,” he claimed. Companies like Dabur and Patanjali also said they have seen an increase in demand for Ayurvedic products across portfolio. “It was witnessing a strong growth in enquiries for key products, especially the immunity booster range including Chyawanprash, Honey, Giloy tablets, Giloy Churna, Ashwagandha capsules and the recently launched Immunity Kit,” said the spokesperson of Dabur. A senior sales officer of Patanjali, requesting anonymity, said that the demand for ayurvedic products with health care benefits has gone up. “Immunity building products are in greater demand. All the products, coming in the wellness and immunity section, have witnessed considerable increase in demand, ” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ayurveda-products-in-high-demand-at-covid-dedicated-facilities/story-xaag7OizLDUr6zB7dkmWFL.html

The two-member YMC has given the DDA more time to submit a report.“From media reports and videos on social media...it is evident that the reports given to YMC were not reliable. The claims had clearly been made without checking the ground situation and amounted to concealment of facts,” YMC’s letter stated. The YMC had ordered an inspection of the floodplains underneath the Signature Bridge and the Sarai Kale Khan flyover by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and DDA after complaints of dumping of debris and biomedical waste surfaced on July 27. “DDA is requested to institute an efficient and reliable system to prevent ingress in the floodplains. The delay in responses is also highlighted and is resulting in public apprehension that nothing is being done. You may wish to fix accountability as the officers who have been reporting to YMC appear not to be conversant with the ground reality and depend on others without checking,” it said. The committee also said that despite it asking DDA several times to augment the number of security personnel given the size of the floodplains, repeated cases of fresh encroachment and riverside dumping, it has not been done. “Also, it is shocking that debris is still lying on the site, despite DDA claiming that the 4,600 cubic metres of construction and demolition debris has been collected and the floodplains are free of such dumped material”, it said. YMC also asked DPCC that the joint inspection report be submitted and “punitive” action be taken against the violators polluting the floodplains. In response to the letter, DDA initiated another inspection of the floodplains on August 4. DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “An inspection was taken up by the DDA on July 29 and again on August 4. It was found that the debris had been lying after construction work undertaken by different agencies. The DDA took up the matter with the respective agencies and they have agreed on clearing it expeditiously. Also, a systemic change is being put in place so that it is not repeated in the future. Besides, adequate security personnel had already been deployed.”Hindustan Times (on July 28 and August 1) reported on the unabated dumping of construction debris as well as it being levelled and flattened at various locations, including Mayur Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and at the Signature Bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ngt-committee-asks-dda-to-submit-report-on-dumping-in-floodplains/story-b1pSR4TUDM2ks0GleJujtO.html

The move came after a plea was filed contending that such entities were “misrepresenting themselves as medical diagnostic laboratories”.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan directed the government to take action in accordance with law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the case against any such entity which is operating illegally in violation of the law, after hearing all stakeholders.The bench said a decision would be taken as expeditiously as possible and practicable after all stakeholders, including the alleged violators are heard.The court was hearing a plea seeking a ban on allegedly illegal online health service aggregators from collecting diagnostic samples for testing of Covid-19 virus. The petitioner in the case — doctor Rohit Jain— in his plea filed through advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, had contended that such health service aggregators pose the “biggest threat to life and safety of the common people”.It had also sought directions to the Centre, Delhi government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to issue “guidelines for registration and minimum standards for sample collection centres operated by online aggregators and the minimum qualification for taking samples by representative of aggregators”.The petition had contended that many of the online health service aggregators are operating illegally as they are neither accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) nor approved by ICMR or any other regulatory body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-tells-delhi-govt-to-take-action-against-illegal-online-health-service-aggregators/story-pC2NEsaXm6ihFRAL2MjswI.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||Man granted bail illegally kept in jail, DG prisons apologises to high court||The Delhi high court Thursday directed the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to conduct specialised module training for jail superintendents, deputy superintendents and assistant superintendents with a focus on their duties and obligations and rights of prisoners. The direction came after a prisoner was illegally detained in jail even after being granted bail.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad said the training was necessary so that such incidents do not happen again. The court was hearing a plea by a prisoner who was detained for 10 days even after being granted bail.The person was granted bail by the trial court on May 18 in a cheque bounce case but was released only on June 25. The jail authorities had earlier told the court that the petitioner was not able to secure the sureties required to be submitted along with the bail bond. It said that the accused could give the sureties only on June 15 and hence the delay in releasing him.On the last date of hearing, the court had pulled up Tihar authorities for their failure to release the man. It had asked the jail authorities to furnish the data of prisoners released during the past three years.On Thursday, a status report was filed by advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel of the Delhi government and advocate Chaitanya Gosain on behalf of the director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel tendering “an unconditional apology for the inappropriate explanation given by the superintendent, Central Jail-I, Tihar jail, for unlawfully detaining the petitioner between June 20 to June 25 .The report further submitted that at least 1.5 lakh prisoners have been released during the past three years and the direction of the court to compile the data relating to such prisoners would be a stupendous exercise and need a lot of time.Goel, who was present during the video conferencing hearing, apologised to the court. He submitted that in order to prevent any such mistake in future, the prison (headquarters) has constituted a committee to randomly inspect jails concerning detention of prisoners and their release.“Further, a circular has been issued informing all concerned that no person must be detained without any valid reason and that the official concerned will be held responsible in case of a lapse,” the status report said.He assured the court that after a lot of introspection, it has been decided that course correction is warranted within the department. He said that 14 law officers are also being appointed on a contractual basis soon and they will be available in each of the jails t advise and guide officials and prisoners.Following this, the court said officers posted in the jails would attend online workshops arranged by DSLSA, tailor-made for making them aware of the rights of prisoners and their duties with respect to inmates. The matter would be now heard on September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-granted-bail-illegally-kept-in-jail-dg-prisons-apologises-to-high-court/story-f18odXvJzOmJxInYyOqnWL.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||Eye on Mohali MC polls: Board to decide on delimitation of wards||The local bodies department of Punjab has set up a board to decide on the delimitation of the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) wards and on allotment of 50% wards reserved for women.The civic body elections were scheduled for OctoberDelimitation involved bifurcation, trifurcation, merger or removal of sectors from the wards.The board comprised director local bodies or Mohali deputy commissioner as chairman, supported by MC commissioner, former Congress councillor Kuljit Singh Bedi and local resident Amarjit Singh. The board will submit its report soon. The civic body had initiated the process to establish ‘ward bandi’ (delimitation) for preparing the list of its wards. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg added that plans were being worked out for the same.Board member Kuljit Singh Bedi said the board would be deciding on delimitation of the wards. The idea is to simplify ward bandi by adjusting the number of sectors in a ward or redefining its limits, he added The MC elections were last held in February 2015. During that time, only the data of 2014 was taken, and the number of voters decided accordingly. After six years now, the population in Mohali has also increased and new sectors have become overpopulated. Therefore, in the steps to be taken for ward bandi, it was necessary to readjust the ward limits. The population of sectors 66 to 69, sectors 76 to 80 and the old areas under MC had increased exponentially, so ward bandi must be framed accordingly, Bedi added. In the last term the Congress had 14 councillors and the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party won 23 seats. The Azad group led by former mayor Kulwant Singh won 10 seats and two seats were won by independent councillors. In the 2015 elections, 27 councillors including 10 councillors of the Azad group, 14 councillors of Congress and two independent councillors elected Kulwant Singh as mayor, but later in August 2017, he joined SAD. The elections will be held in 50 wards and the MC has already submitted details of the wards and their populations to the local bodies department. Out of 2.36 lakh people voting, 25,000 belong to the scheduled caste (SC) category. Five seats have been reserved for SC candidates, two for women (SC) , three for backward classes (BC) and two for women (BC). There are 43 general category seats, of which 23 are for women and 20 for men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/eye-on-mohali-mc-polls-board-to-decide-on-delimitation-of-wards/story-e3bZflfrykAL9Gk83XCIdJ.html

Over 60,000 fines were issued for various traffic violations in the month alone, the highest in any month so far.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Traffic police, said that the traffic department this year issued 55,424 fines in January and 27,245 in February. “Then the lockdown was announced (From March 25) and restrictions on vehicular movement came in place. In March, a total of 19,823 fines were issued and the numbers decreased to 11,541 in April. However, from May, the violations started increasing as the city went into Unlock 1.0. In May and June, 19,402 and 56,434 challans were issued, respectively,” he said. The traffic department recorded the maximum challans – 60,180 – in July, and collected Rs 1.70 crore as fines in the month. Most of these challans are for riding two-wheelers without helmets and driving a car without seatbelts.

In 2019, the Noida traffic police had issued 6,99,708 fine and collected ₹14.76 crore fine throughout the year.The number of vehicles is increasing on the city roads as people have resumed travelling for work or leisure. Noida Entrepreneurship Association (NEA) has over 1,800 members who run factories and industry in the district and 90% of them have resumed services with limited manpower, said NEA vice president Sudhir Shrivastava. “This shows that life is returning to normal.

06-08-2020||City||Patients in home isolation told to dispose of medical waste in yellow bags R||The Greater Noida authority has asked asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in home isolation and those in home quarantine to dispose of biomedical waste such as used masks, gloves among other items separately in yellow coloured garbage bags.The authority officials said that kin of asymptomatic patients and suspected patients who are isolating or quarantining at home need to buy yellow coloured bags for storing waste, and these bags will be picked up by a private agency. The hazardous waste will then be treated by a second private agency hired by the authority.“We have issued an official order and made it compulsory for the people to buy a yellow bag and store the waste in it. We have also engaged a private agency AG Enviro Infra Pro Private Limited to collect the waste from the houses where infected or suspected patients live. This agency will store the hazardous waste such as mask, gloves and other such waste collected in the yellow bags,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The authority has tasked Synergy Biomedical Waste Private Limited to treat hazardous waste. “AG Environ will collect the hazardous waste from houses and then hand it over to Synergy that will treat this waste scientifically at its Meerut plant. We have taken effective measures to ensure that the risk of others being infected out of this hazardous waste is eliminated,” said Chandar.The authority has asked the district health department to ensure all households with asymptomatic and suspected patients make due arrangements for segregation and collection of biomedical waste in line with the new order. One kilogram packet of yellow garbage bag containing at least 40 of them costs around ₹135 in the marker, said officials.Residents, many of whom had been demanding separate waste collection, have welcomed the authority’s move and want its strict implementation. “The Greater Noida authority must enforce this rule strictly because it can be risky to dispose of hazardous biomedical waste casually. The authority should have enforced this rule ever since Covid-19 cases had started to surface. We hope that it will be enforced on priority,” said Harendra Bhati, founder of Active Citizen team, a citizen’s group.“Those in home isolation or quarantine should also help the authority by segregating the hazardous waste and hand it over to the designated person only,” said Davendra Tiger, president of Greater Noida federation of RWAs, an umbrella body of resident welfare association.Till August 5, the Gautam Budh Nagar district had 254 patients in home isolation.Greater Noida authority estimates that at least 20 kg of biomedical waste from households with Covid-19 patients will be collected daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patients-in-home-isolation-told-to-dispose-of-medical-waste-in-yellow-bags-r/story-ceMWtGW0wP6Ab7915Yp27J.html
06-08-2020||City||Symptomatic or not, Ghaziabad to test those with co-morbidities through RT-PCR||The Ghaziabad health department will now test asymptomatic people with co-morbidities for the coronoavirus disease Covid-19 throught the gold standard RT-PCR method if they test negative for the virus through rapid antigen tests.Experts welcomed the move and encouraged the government to go adopt an even aggressive testing scheme.The new measures expand on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines that required those showing symptoms after having tested negative for antigens be tested through the RT-PCR method for confirmation. Officials said the Uttar Pradesh government, in an order issued on August 5, approved the new measures to reduce the fatality count due to Covid-19. The co-morbidity list includes diabetes, kidney or heart ailments, cancer, organ transplant, HIV, liver ailments, old age and even obesity. Ever since the introduction of antigen testing on June 26, it has become the primary testing method in Ghaziabad, accounting for over 57% of the total 118,546 samples tested so far. The test has returned a positivity rate of 2.46% (number of positive test results per 100 tests).“But so far only those who showed symptoms after a negative test were tested again using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. With the new directions from the state government, we will now include symptomatic as well as asymptomatic persons having co-morbidity, for the subsequent RTPCR test,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The reason for the re-test using the RT-PCR method is because the antigen tests have a low sensitivity value, meaning true positive cases may not be captured efficiently. However, the tests have been preferred as it is affordable and quick. The district has nine sample collection centres where anyone with an ID card could go and provide their samples for antigen testing as well as RT-PCR test free of cost. Till August 5, the district has taken up 23874 subsequent RT-PCR tests and of these, 1,060 returned positive while the reports of 5057 tests are awaited. “The new measure will help reduce fatality rate as most deaths are of people who had co-morbid conditions,” said Pandey. “In my opinion, rather than testing those with co-morbidities twice, the authorities should perform only RT-PCR tests on them. Testing through rapid kits come in handy in cases when such persons arrive for treatment in hospitals and the doctors need to know immediately if they are positive or not,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “In any case the new measures are welcome as it will help early detection and early treatment.”The officials said that the state government also directed that the door-to-doo surveillance exercise in all residential wards should be completed within 7-10 days. Teams have been tasked to record people who may be affected by influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory illness (Sari). ILI cases are those with symptoms of fever and cough, and Sari are ILI cases that require hospitalisation.“The urban centres should have 10% more teams for intensive surveillance activity while 10% additional teams should be formed as reserve. The surveillance works will also be taken up outside the containment zones and suspected cases (like those of ILI and Sari ) will also be identified with the help of local councillors and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs),” the directions by UP chief secretary, RK Tiwari, read. The chief secretary has also directed that in districts where the sample positivity rate is over 5%, more testing/sampling was required. In an earlier order on July 23, the UP government had assigned different targets of conducting 900, 500, 350 and 250 RT-PCR tests per day which will total 30,100 such tests per day in the state. Both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar were assigned 350 RT-PCR tests per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/symptomatic-or-not-ghaziabad-to-test-those-with-co-morbidities-through-rt-pcr/story-h4vLGNCF5qHXtgduPbUSJI.html
06-08-2020||City||Eight booked, two arrested for shooting at Jewar gang-rape victim’s brother||The brother of a 38-year-old woman -- she was one of four women gang-raped near Sabota village, around a kilometre away from Yamuna Expressway in 2017— was shot and injured by a group in Jewar Kasba on Monday (August 3).The man, the sole surviving male member of the family, sustained bullet injuries to his legs and was admitted to a private hospital for treatment. He said that the suspects involved in firing at him had been picked up for questioning in the gang-rape case too, but were later released.His brother was murdered in 2017, while trying to stop the rape of his women relatives in 2017, while three others had died in mysterious circumstances. The man injured in Monday’s shooting said his family had suspected the role of some neighbours in the gang-rape incident as well. “Based on our information, the police had picked up some of them for interrogation but later released them. They were angry with us ever since,” said the man, who is recovering in a private hospital in Jewar. According to the police, the incident took place on August 3 evening. The suspects — Munna, Sartaj and some of their relatives got into a quarrel with two others — Mustaqeem and Khatoon — allegedly over a loan of ₹ 600.“I had gone to see what had happened in the neighbourhood. Munna, his brothers Sartaj and Adil, and relatives Shah Alam, Nasir, Jameel, Kadir, Adil and Sagheer started beating me up without provocation. Munna and Sartaj later shot me with a countrymade gun. I sustained two gunshot wounds to my legs and collapsed,” the victim, a scrap dealer said. The man’s nephew said his uncle lives in Palwal and had come home for Eid-al-Adha celebration. “My uncle has sustained bullet injuries in both legs and he is in the ICU. We are frightened about our safety,” he said. The gang-rape incident took place on May 25, 2017, when the scrap dealer was travelling from Jewar to Bulandshahr in a Maruti Eeco with his family members, his driver and the driver’s wife (34). The then SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar, Love Kumar had said six members of a Bawaria gang in a Mahindra Scorpio had stationed themselves near Sabota village. They waylaid the Maruti Eeco and held the occupants at gunpoint in a field. “The scrap dealer, his brother-in-law (42), nephew (27) and driver (52) were held at gunpoint while the scrap dealer’s wife (37), sister (37) and sister-in-law (52) and the driver’s wife (47) were gang-raped. The gang leader, Raju, also shot the scrap dealer at point-blank range when he tried to stop the assault on his family,” Kumar had said after the arrest of the four accused in the case on July 23, 2017.When contacted, Sriparna Gongulee, additional commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said she is not aware of Monday’s shooting incident. “I will direct the officials to investigate the matter and act against the accused,” she said. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said a case has been registered against eight persons under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) . “Monday’s incident took place over some monetary dispute between two groups. This incident is not related to the gang-rape. Police have arrested Munna and Sartaj and launched a search to arrest other named suspects. There is no law and order issue in the neighbourhood,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eight-booked-two-arrested-for-shooting-at-jewar-gang-rape-victim-s-brother/story-5miuPTLK96A6dDrxUVKErM.html
06-08-2020||City||Buddha nullah cleanliness drive in Ludhiana: Encroachments marked for removal; shifting of 500 dairy units likely||After completing the demarcation process of Buddha nullah as per the records of the revenue department, the third party (contractor) has commenced upon marking the encroachments alongside the nullah.The project is expected to complete within 20 days, following which the municipal corporation (MC) will initiate the proceedings to raze those encroachments. The matter was discussed during the meeting of a committee constituted by local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra for shifting of dairy units situated on the banks of the nullah. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of mayor Balkar Sandhu on Wednesday evening and deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal among others also participated.INCREASED WIDTH TO PREVENT FLOODINGIn the second week of July, MC, revenue department and irrigation department had commenced the demarcation process, which is being taken up to increase the width of nullah that has been overflowing in the past years during the monsoon season. During the meeting, the officials also deliberated upon the proposal to shift over 500 dairy units situated at Haibowal and on Tajpur road. As demanded by the dairy owners’ association, the civic body is working to allow change of land use (CLU) of the existing dairy complexes for commercial and industrial purposes.The MC will also finalise the CLU fee and forward the proposal to the local bodies department for a final approval. The project to shift the dairy units has been hanging fire for a long time. Additionally, sites are being identified to shift these units to the areas falling outside the MC limits. Earlier last week, a special task force constituted for cleaning the nullah had also directed the officials to plan out a modern dairy complex, where these units could be shifted. It was suggested that such a complex should have the facilities to treat dairy waste and cow dung.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The dairy units have to be shifted as the nullah is getting polluted due to dumping of dairy waste into it. The rates of CLU are being finalised and we are also scouting for locations in the nearby villages where the dairy units can be shifted.”FLOATING GARBAGE BARRIER BEING SET UPUnder the initiative to clean the nullah and stop solid waste from getting into Sutlej river, a floating garbage barrier is being installed near New Kundanpur area by the MC.The initiative was taken by member of special task force Colonel (retd) Jasjit Singh Gill and the project is being taken up by Lets Clean Ludhiana Foundation, an NGO, and Munjal foundation.The barrier has been made with the help of drums to restrict solid waste floating in the nullah at a point, from where it will be lifted out. With this, the nullah will not get choked and solid waste will not get into the Sutlej.Colonel Gill said, “Barriers installed in Sidhwan canal were successful. A special machine is also being developed to lift the accumulated waste from the barriers, but till the time it is not ready, MC machinery will be used.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said more barriers will be set up if the present project is successful. A monitoring committee of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also asked the MC to stop dumping of solid waste in the nullah that added to pollution in the nullah and the Sutlej.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/buddha-nullah-cleanliness-drive-in-ludhiana-encroachments-marked-for-removal-shifting-of-500-dairy-units-likely/story-4aWPWj3LkOdsGFLayQWXTM.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC sets aside PU order on not granting affiliation to DAV Management Institute||The Punjab and Haryana high court has set aside Panjab University’s (PU) decision to not grant affiliation to the Institute of Management at DAV College in Sector 10 and directed that an inspection be carried out over there again. The high court bench of justice Arun Monga also directed PU to set up a new committee without those associated with such panels in the past and carry out another inspection within two months. PU would then have to take a decision again on affiliating the institute. Till then the MBA programme of DAV College would continue. The court acted on the plea of the DAV Institute of Management challenging PU’s 2019 decision to not allow continuation of the MBA programme when it was newly established in 2017. “For every student, the alma mater carries a certain sense of pride for the rest of his life. In the present case, a peculiar situation has arisen owing to the institutional clash of country’s two premier institutions, the alumnae of 2nd academic Sessions are facing the paradox of no alma mater,” the bench observed. The institute had applied for extension of affiliation in November 2018 for the 2019-20 session, but PU slept over the matter till it got a wake up call when a case was filed before the high court. The entire process for affiliation or its refusal was to have been completed by PU by May 15, 2019, till which time, however, the university was still considering grant of extension of affiliation for the 2018-19 session even though it had commenced by July/August, 2018. “This entire lackadaisical approach/demeanour of the university in such nonchalant manner does not inspire confidence, to say the least. University ought to be mindful of the students whose future life and career is at stake and who have taken admission on the implicit assurance that retrospective temporary extension of affiliation would be granted by university like in the past. Why can the university not adhere to the strict timelines as laid down by the Supreme court ?” the bench asked. On PU not following University Grants Commission regulations while constituting the inspection committees, the court said: “What seems to be bothering the University inspection team is not whether or not the infrastructure as required has been provided by the Institute or not, but rather the sourcing of the said infrastructure.” The bench was referring to a report of an inspection committee, adding that objections did not point to what was required, but rather that the requisite infrastructure was available. The court also took exception to the fact that Dr Anupama Bawa, a varsity teacher, was associated with the inspection committee which gave the final report, even as she had given a dissenting note on an earlier occasions. She was not only associated with the committee but made its chairperson as well . “The reasons contained therein (in the report) do not pertain to lack of infrastructure or office staff or faculty or any other such thing, but rather a personal outlook of said professor. She felt that over the years, the MBA degree of Panjab University had lost its brand equity,” the bench said, to the report given by professor Bawa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-sets-aside-pu-order-on-not-granting-affiliation-to-dav-management-institute/story-IO0FZw80Z7ogWuXkXQHtTL.html

All 11 blocks will have five model ponds each.Rural development officials said that Seechewal model is a water treatment model designed by environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal, under which sewage water can be purified and used for irrigation. Similarly, Thappar model, designed by the Thappar University in Patiala, is a technically refined model to treat and use waste water.ADC Vishesh Sarangal said that construction has been started at 11 villages of different blocks in district under MGNREGA and convergence. Funds, between Rs 16-17 lakh, will be incurred on construction of each pond.Under these models, officials said used water draining out from houses and other sources, before flowing into the pond, passes through three wells where solid and oily waste are segregated.He said that the refined liquid then flows into the pond and remains stagnant there for at least seven days, which helps kill germs naturally. Then it can be used to irrigate crops through pumps.He said that this model helps in recharging groundwater table as sewage water will be treated in three wells and the same will be used for irrigation and farmers will not have to depend on other sources.He added that Punjab government is making efforts to stop groundwater depleting by plantation of saplings, increasing green cover, promoting maize and other crops which use less water, drip irrigation, and installing rainwater harvesting systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/55-seechewal-thappar-models-based-ponds-to-be-developed-in-jalandhar/story-oMx0NF9uP5PqCk63LYd4wK.html

I will be joining office in a couple of days and all their issues will be resolved soon. I urge them to continue working diligently to save the poor and needy,” he added.The RMOs, who come under the panchayati raj department, have accused health department officials of being biased against them since they were deployed on Covid-19 duties in March.The health department officials say some RMOs have been absent from Covid-19 duty.On July 24, additional chief secretary health Anurag Aggarwal had issued orders to all deputy commissioners from across the sate to ensure that the RMOs attended duty and to ask for an explanation from those defying orders.The RMOs reportedly did not take very kindly to being deployed at the help desk at the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital.“The RMOs were primarily deployed for Covid duties but the health department is using them for non-Covid duties. At Bathinda and Barnala the rural medical doctors were asked to perform postmortem and medico legal duties. We had objected to it, following which orders were issued against us that we are remaining absent from duty,” said Dr JP Narula, state president of the Rural Medical Services Association.He said that since minister Bajwa was battling with Covid-19 the delegation of doctors had decided to meet him next week.Dr Narula also claimed that in Ludhiana 62 rural medical officers were managing frontline duties on rotation at different Covid care centres since March.With rural medicos involved in Covid duties, rural health services, particularly care of elderly villagers has been hit badly.The association has demanded that RMOs on non Covid duties should be deployed in the rural dispensaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rural-medicos-at-loggerheads-with-health-dept-find-a-supporter-in-minister-bajwa/story-yxvV86KXZzedF64lQVBlQK.html

Now, in our increasingly interdependent world, we have a chance to make this a more peaceful century,” the spiritual leader said.When conflicts arise, the Dalai Lama said, they should be settled through dialogue, not the use of force. We need to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons, with the ultimate aim of a demilitarized world.“War means killing. Violence leads to counter violence. We need to put an end to combat and the production of weapons and construct a more peaceful world,” he said.“We human beings have created many of the problems in today’s world. As long as we have strong negative emotions and we view our fellow beings in terms of ‘us’ and ‘them’, there will be a tendency to try to destroy them,” The Dalai Lama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/75th-anniv-of-atomic-bombings-dalai-lama-calls-for-elimination-of-nuclear-weapons-demilitarised-world/story-Jsp8krsDhzk9xvkCV3m6nN.html

People there are highly patriotic and are ready to fight the enemy and even make supreme sacrifice if need arises, he added. The CM said a panel of five superintendents of police (SP), who are battalion commandants, visited four dozen border villages of Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti after the Chinese aggression in Galwan valley last month. “They talked to people about the issues. The residents of these frontier villages have said it on record that they are going nowhere. Nobody talked of migration,” Thakur claimed. He, however, said that locals had some issues related to development which will be resolved at the earliest.On July 25, while citing the police panel’s report during a press conference, director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu had said migration from border villages was a threat to the national security. He had said the panel implied that people were migrating from the border areas due to poor infrastructure and a lack of economic activities. Besides strengthening road and communication infrastructure, the panel specifically recommended increasing economic activities, like tribal tourism and marketing of local flowers and produce, to repopulate the areas.Meanwhile, the CM also said the development of border areas was top priority of the state government. “A lot of development projects in these areas are ongoing which I think should not be discussed in open,” he said. “Foremost is the Rohtang tunnel inauguration of which is expected to be inaugurated in last week of September. The tunnel will facilitate quick movement of forces to the border areas,” he added.‘TEMPLES TO REMAIN SHUT’Replying to another question, Thakur said as of now, there is no plan to reopen temples in the state.“Once, we were almost ready to reopen the temples but the decision was withheld in wake of rising Covid-19 cases,” he said. The CM said monsoons are here and the threat of viral and bacterial diseases outbreak always looms large. “So, the temples are not opening in the rainy season at least till August 31. After that, the government will consider reopening the shrines when the situation is under control,” he added.CM GETS ROUSING WELCOME IN KANGRAThe chief minister was accorded a rousing welcome on his arrival at the Gaggal Airport in Kangra district for a three-day visit. Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar, Industries Minister Bikram Singh, Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Sarveen Chaudhary, Forests Minister Rakesh Pathania, MP Kishan Kapoor, MLAs Vishal Nehariya, Arun Mehra, Reeta Devi, Arjun Singh, Hoshiar Singh, Mulkraj Premi, Ravi Dhiman, former MLAs and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion to receive the Chief Minister.BJP workers flouted the social distancing norms while welcoming the CM at Kachehari market of Dharamshala town as the police watched helplessly. Police had told the BJP workers to line up keeping in mind the social distancing norms. However, as soon as the CM arrived there, the upbeat BJP workers almost mobbed him trying to hand over bouquet and flowers.FOLLOW UP DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS TO ENSURE TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION: CM TO MLASChief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday urged the MLAs to follow up on the ongoing developmental projects in their respective constituencies to ensure time-bound execution of these works.He was presiding over a meeting of ministers, MP, MLAs and district-level officers of Kangra to review the progress of ongoing projects in the district.Thakur directed the officers to ensure time-bound completion of all the developmental projects to check price escalation, besides ensuring that people could harp the benefits of development.He said special focus must be laid on implementation projects announced by him.The CM said various departments must ensure that all the announcements are implemented within the stipulated time period. He said the government is laying special stress on development of Kangra since it the biggest district in the state.He said though the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the pace of development, the government is striving hard to meet the deadlines. The CM said the Covid-19 situation is under control in Kangra despite being the largest district population-wise. “Authorities must ensure that people follow social distancing and use face masks. All social, cultural and religious gatherings must also be avoided,” he added.“Vacant posts of doctors and paramedics will be filled up at the earliest in health institutions of the district. Efforts will also be made to provide specialist doctors in all major hospitals of the district,” he added.The chief minister said the state government has constituted a cabinet sub-committee for finding the unspent money under different projects. He said mechanism will be evolved to divert the amount with the consent of local representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jai-ram-contradicts-police-panel-report-on-migration-from-hp-s-border-villages/story-dSPY2UCNkZCRAuqdvGdOgI.html

He said the state government has weakened the institute of legislature. “Name plates of underseving people are put on MLA priority works. These name plates will be removed when the Congress will come to power in the state,” he added.“Stern action will also be taken in the future against those officers who are giving preferences to unconstitutional forces,” he said.Agnihotri said some people are engaged in money laundering during the pandemic which is a matter of concern and should be stopped. He also lashed out at the government over rising suicide cases in the state amid the pandemic.“More than 2,000 persons have died by suicide ever since Jai Ram Thakur led state government came into power which has never occurred during any government’s regime,” he said, adding that it is a matter of concern and also exposes the state government’s claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/focus-on-prevention-of-covid-19-instead-of-virtual-programmes-agnihotri-to-hp-govt/story-pwzWdFZfJjMX1f612dG2XO.html

He claimed that the store had no right to charge for the carry bag, as it was difficult for him to carry the shirt without one. Despite repeated notices, the opposite party (OP) did not respond and was proceeded against ex-parte. “We feel that a carry bag is definitely a part and parcel of the sale by the OP that had no legal or moral right to charge Rs 8 extra for it. Such malpractice should be curbed with a strong hand. There is definitely unfair trade practice adopted by the OP,” stated forum president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma and member Natasha Chopra in their order. “It is also possible that the OP continued this practice for years and collected a huge amount. In order to curb such malpractice, it is important to impose special cost on them, so that correct message should go in society and such traders think a thousand times before adopting this practice again,” the forum said.The forum, thus, directed the store to deposit Rs 30,000 in its Legal Aid Account and pay Rs 2,000 as compensation to the complainant within 30 days, failing which the complainant will be entitled to interest at 12% per annum on the compensation amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/charging-8-for-carry-bag-costs-zirakpur-store-32-000/story-ViVgJ3AFYEXmWRgloQlbbI.html

06-08-2020||Lucknow||When it counts, only peers stand by retired scorers||Cricketers in India keep getting money even after retirement as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has made provisions to help them and their families even after their death. But there seem to be nothing for the scorers, who keep maintaining records meticulously, sitting in one corner of the ground. A few retired scorers on the BCCI’s panel faced serious health problems during the lockdown. One of them passed away. In most cases, the 140-odd scorers, including the present ones, kept sharing the burden of treatment and hospitalisation of their colleagues among themselves as no other support was allegedly forthcoming. Koushik Saha of Kolkata passed away in hospital after suffering from diabetes, whereas M Nagaraj of Bengaluru and Mumbai’s Ramesh Parab had to struggle a lot for the financial support for their treatment. The 64-year-old Parab remained in ICU for 35 days and his present and former colleagues contributed Rs 2.80 lakh for his successful treatment. “ We spent our entire life counting and maintaining the records of cricketers. Are we not entitled to any benefits at this stage of life?” asked Mumbai’s Vivek Gupte. “Like cricketers and international umpires, we scorers also need retirement benefits, pension and support for medical treatment. We are also an integral part of the system,” said Gupte, who wants all scorers on the BCCI panel to approach their respective state cricket associations to put pressure on the board to take care of the scorers also after their retirement. He wants to BCCI to float a medical group insurance policy for all scorers, active as well as retired, to cover all ailments, hospitalisation and medicines etc. The board should also help with a lump sum ex gratia amount, in cases of emergency, to both active and retired scorers, he said. The others who joined the group of retired scorers include Tapash Roy, Suhas Sapre, Gautam Roy, Narayan Lakhotia, MS Rahman, BV Venkatesh, R Bhaskar, Vishwas Ghosalkar, Uday Gharat, T Chennakesavalu, D Ravichandran, Narendra Nalwaya, Saurabh Chaturvedi and OP Sharma. “We chose to write letters to our respective state associations to take up our cases with the board,” said Gupta who, along with 16 others, faced a sudden axe from the board just before the start of the cricket season last year. “This wasn’t the right way to axe all 17 without any prior notice. The scorers’ job calls for much less physical involvement. Scorers are seated indoors (more often in air-conditioned comfort). The fitness levels (required) are restricted to normal fine eyesight and hearing ability, and normal physical fitness with abilities to concentrate and follow the game for long hours,” he added. “Therefore, trying to equate the rule followed for umpires and match referees for scorers too, is incorrect. Ability, together with the required physical fitness, should be taken into consideration rather than the age,” he said, adding, “The retirement age should be restored as per BCCI announcement of 65 years subject to an annual medical test after 60 by BCCI panel medical practitioner and further extension, if any, would be given only subject to successful clearance.” Besides the scorers in Mumbai and Saurashtra, retired scorers in Uttar Pradesh too have decided to approach the board through UPCA in this regard. “For 35 years, I did only scoring and nothing else. Now at this stage of life, I am struggling for survival, including meeting expenses for my routine medical treatment,” said Saurabh Chaturvedi, who did the scoring in over 1,000 plus matches. “I demand that the board at least consider a fixed monthly pension and or fix a lump sum package at the time of retirement of scorers in recognition for the service rendered for the past so many years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/when-it-counts-only-peers-stand-by-retired-scorers/story-vHD5dhCxMcDgT5bwA0kgJL.html

Punishment must be deterrent so as to protect the society from such offenders. Sentencing has to commensurate to the gravity of offence. Hence prayer for leniency is declined.”The court awarded him “rigorous imprisonment for life with possibility of remission, commutation etc and to pay a fine of ₹50,000.” Out of this amount ₹45,000 shall be paid to the victims and ₹5,000 to the state.The court directed that the youth “be provided with educational services, skill development, alternative therapy during his stay in the place of safety.” The district child welfare committee has also been directed to evaluate the progress of the youth now living in a juvenile home, ensuring that he is not ill treated.The case dates back to July 1, 2016, when an FIR was registered at police station Sector 36 under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the youth, then a minor. Eshwar Taal, a 25-year-old tubewell operator from Sector 42 complained to the police that his father Mahipal and his brother, all from Assam, used to run a dhaba near the powerhouse in Sector 42 and sleep in the powerhouse building. Some days later, the helper, also hired from Assam started working for them and one night when the father and the helper were drunk they had an argument. When Taal returned from work at around 6.15 am the next day he found his father dead with his throat slit and injury marks on his face.The helper was missing with his belongings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/19-year-old-gets-life-term-for-murdering-dhaba-owner-in-2016/story-6ruHmR9KiyvMUPFe3FkSRP.html

He also demanded that a murder case be registered against chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Mann said, “The chief minister, who also holds the excise and home portfolio, is responsible for the tragedy and a murder case must be registered against him.” He said his party will no longer address the CM as ‘Captain’ as he had undermined the honour accorded to the position. “AAP has been demanding that a murder case be registered against all involved in the spurious liquor tragedy that led to the death of 110 people since the first day. All kinds of mafias have been enjoying the government’s patronage from the last 15 years,” he said. “Earlier the reins of the mafia were in the hands of the Badals. Now, they are in the hands of the Congress MLAs, ministers and the CM himself,” Mann said.He alleged that the liquor mafia active in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Batala (Gurdaspur) areas were connected to illicit distilleries at Rajpura, Ghanour and Khanna, which indicated that the liquor mafia was calling the shots under the patronage of the CM’s wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur. He demanded a time-bound inquiry into the matter by a sitting high court judge or the CBI. “These mafias are controlled by the who’s who of the ruling party through police stations and the civil administration,” he said.AAP also demanded that a liquor corporation be setup in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooch-tragedy-register-murder-case-against-capt-says-aap-state-chief-bhagwant-mann/story-MwZGh65rcskHuGU4s04z3K.html

The hospital management has to fill 4-5 forms against the previous practice of 17-18 forms. Rao said, “At every review meeting, private hospitals raised the issue that time was lost in filling various forms. Even manpower was unnecessarily needed to fill 17-18 forms for Covid patients.” The senior official said that the administration appointed a three-expert committee to address the issue. The panel found that private hospitals need to fill and submit the same information at various offices, including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), district collector, municipal corporation and charity commissioner. The experts suggested that these agencies can also get the information from a single platform.” Rao said, “Based on the panel’s recommendations, the form-filling exercise has been reduced to four and five.” The commissioner said that private hospitals are voluntarily approaching the administration to convert their hospitals into Covid care centres. Rao said, “A private hospital had to use its beds to quarantine 45 staff. When I suggested that the infected staff will be shifted to a civic-run quarantine facility, the hospital agreed to turn the hospital into a Covid care centre. Hence, we got 45 beds for critical patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-divisional-commissioner-reduces-paperwork-of-pvt-hospitals-for-covid-cases/story-S3idMBsOGR1bjRNKWugLSO.html

After all, as Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee chief between 1991-1992, Nilangekar ensured his party bagged 38 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state.Nilangekar had a couple of other distinctions too. He is remembered as ruling the state merely for 277 days and was the second CM of Maharashtra after AR Antulay to have resigned due to indictment from the court.Nilangekar resigned in 1986 from the post of the chief minister when the Bombay High Court passed strictures against him after “fraud” was alleged in the results of the (MD) examination of Mumbai University in 1985 “at his behest” to help his daughter Chandrakala and her friends.“When Mumbai University declared the results of MD (obstetrics and gynaecology) examinations during November 1985, eyebrows were raised as Nilangekar’s daughter was among the other students cleared it with handsome marks,” said Chitra Lele, professor, political science at SNDT University. There were around 34 out of 47 students who cleared the exam that year.Dr Mahesh Gosavi, an assistant medical officer at the King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital and whistle-blower smelled fishy in the case and approached the court, which eventually ruled against Nilangekar.Interestingly, it was the same courtroom in Bombay High Court that ruled against both Nilangekar and Antulay. Around four years before the verdict on Nilangekar, the same courtroom in Bombay High Court, which convicted Antulay in “cement scam”. Antulay, eventually resigned after two years in 1982.“Despite serving for a brief period, Nilangekar was for a long time remained a political force in Latur district, his hometown, and Marathwada region,” said Lele.By late 1990s when Congress sidelined him, his daughter-in-law Rupa Dilip Nilangekar joined BJP and defeated father-in-law during 14th Lok Sabha polls. The late CM’s grandson Sambhaji Nilangekar, also a BJP member, was a minister in Devendra Fadnavis cabinet.Following Nilangekar’s exit, another stalwart from Marathwada YB Chavan was made the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/served-as-cm-for-277-days-nilangekar-was-second-after-antulay-to-resign-due-to-court-ruling/story-mfodYVPgOjPoiazsS9jqlO.html

He held several high positions in the bureaucracy and the government.The city-based bureaucrat has penned a book ‘The Babri Masjid-Ram Mandir Dilemma: An Acid Test for India’s Constitution.’“I hope this is not the beginning of a new chapter. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been saying that this is just the beginning and next would be Mathura and Kashi,” said Godbole.“Reopening religious issues affect and divides the society at large. Politicians rake up religious issues for political gains,” he said.Stressing on the need of a political consensus among all parties regarding no changes to be made to the character of religious institutions, Godbole said, “There is parliamentary legislation and the character of any religious institution must not change and these issues must be discussed in national integration council and this body has been put in the limbo.”“Religion must be separated from politics,” he added.Godbole lamented that the Parliament which was supposed to keep the government in check for its excesses has failed to discharge its constitutional duty.“Parliament as a body is non- functional and they must function to be effective in making the government adhere to the constitutional and secular principles of the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/don-t-rake-up-religious-issues-for-political-gains-says-former-union-home-secretary-madhav-godbole/story-Ymhem0pqaCeeRCiMI07aRN.html

Sadia Dehlvi belonged to one such family of traders who took on the name Dehlvi upon making this city their home. Sadia, 63, died at her home in Nizamuddin East after a long battle with cancer. Her son, musician Arman Ali Dehlvi was by her side. The last rites were performed on the morning of August 6. Saddened by the untimely demise of historian and writer Sadia Dehlvi Ji. Delhi will remember her as a true dilliwali and a historian of the people. RIP pic.twitter.com/I59ri3vbT5In her lifetime, Sadia donned many hats —an author, journalist, scriptwriter. She also wrote a column for Hindustan Times. She would narrate stories and talk about the tehzeeb of Dilli with such soulfulness that you would be transported to a mystical place — a Delhi that is now lost. Her home was a warm place filled with the laughter of friends, the music that her son made, and of course, food. Her wit was distinct, just like the aromas wafting out of her kitchen.

She was a great raconteur and could really spin a story with a twinkle in her eye. She was a great cook and her benchmark was her mother; if her mother nodded in approval, that meant it was alright. Family was important for her.”Read: Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya: Celebrating the mystic’s life and timesA devotee of the Chishti order of Sufism, Sadia was most at peace at the dargahs of Ajmer Sharif and Nizamuddin Auliya.

Her home was the essence of Tehzib-e-Dilli — the immaculate culture as well as hospitality of Delhi. A great lover and devotee of Chishty Sufi tradition, she frequently visited Ajmer Dargah Sharif. Sadia Aapa had a special connect with Khawaja Gharib Nawaz and would spend hours in Dargah Sharif meditating as well as interacting with mystics, faqirs and deekers. For us, visiting Delhi will never be the same.”Author Bhaichand Patel, who had been friends with Sadia Dehlvi for over three decades, talks about Sadia’s love for life. “I have known her since 1986. I had just come to Delhi at that time. She knew everybody in town, and came from a distinguished family. She was a wonderful person, very bright, brainy and a learned person. She was always helpful to people, everybody loved her. She also had a wedding reception at my home and a lot of VIPs came including the Giani Zail Singh who was the President that time. And when she was young, she was prettier than any movie star,” he says.Sadia spent a considerable time in Old Delhi, and at her family’s ancestral home, Shama Kothi in Central Delhi, forging strong ties with the people there. Of one such family of hakeems, Munib Ahmed Khan, recalls his time with her. “Sadia aunty was a very strong person. She was a fighter all through her life. Our families go back a long way.

She typified the old Shahjahanabadi culture even while driving the image of the traditional Muslim woman away from the stairs of the Jama Masjid and bringing it centre stage. Her mannerism, on one hand, made her look like a post-modern elitist woman of the kind you see on European screens, and on the other, evoked that certain sense of plainness which is characteristic only to the streets of Purani Dilli.

This added swag to her personality,” adding, “If you ask me how I would give an ode to her, I would say I will make nihari.”Abhinav Bamhi of Faqirchand and Sons Bookstore says that it was her unmistakable aura that attracted everyone. “I have seen her at our shop a few times, and met her at book launches, literary events and cultural evenings. She always had this charisma — everyone going around her, people greeting and coming up to her. I enjoyed admiring her assertively profound presence and aura. She had such an amazing Dilliwali vibe that one could feel the culture in her, that urdu ka andaaz and mystical sufi vibe. These are some things that will stay with me forever,” he says.Anuj Bahri, of Bahrisons Booksellers, says that she would visit them often, and in true Dilli style, he pens an ode to her: Dilli ki nazaakatKo dekha hai kareeb seTum woh lau hoJo dilli ke dil se roshan rahe giThe night was cooler, the moon shone a bit brighter and there was a whiff of jasmines somewhere close.

Every country is expected to take care of its citizens, safeguard its interests and focus on internal problems,” Naidu said while delivering the first Sushma Swaraj Memorial Lecture organised by Panjab University, Chandigarh, via video-conference. Without naming Pakistan, Naidu said, “I advise not only our neighbour, who made this comment, but also all countries that they should not interfere in the internal affairs of others. We are a democratic country and we have a track record that we discuss issues, understand their pros and cons and then take decisions in the larger interest of the country.” On August 5, 2019, the Centre had revoked Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. “It (Article 370) was an issue that concerned the country’s unity, integrity, safety and sovereignty,” said Naidu, who is the chancellor of Panjab University.REMEMBERING POPULAR SUSHMA Sushma Swaraj, the former external affairs minister who died in August last year, had graduated from the university’s department of laws in 1973. The vice-president said that she was the most popular external affairs minister India has had in recent times. “She used to articulate the position of India on all issues in an efficient manner. She had the ability to convey everything in a sweet manner but she was firm on commitments,” he said. He recalled her contribution to parliamentary debates and contribution to public service. Naidu advised Panjab University to organise lectures every year “to remember the great leader it has produced. She is an ideal personality worth remembering every year.” Besides organising the memorial lecture every year, Panjab University plans to set up a chair in Sushma Swaraj’s name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/abrogation-of-article-370-an-internal-matter-other-countries-have-no-business-interfering-venkaiah-naidu/story-7nM5SF90hiN1IuCK8dqQqK.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Court rejects Indrani Mukerjea’s bail plea in Sheena Bora murder case||A special CBI court here rejected the bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, noting that the possibility of the accused influencing prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out.After failing to secure bail multiple times on medical grounds, Mukerjea in December last year filed another plea, seeking bail on “merits” of the case.Special CBI court judge JC Jagdale rejected the plea on Wednesday. The court observed thatsome important case witnesses like Rahul Mukerjea, son of accused Peter Mukerjea, and Vidhi, daughter of Indrani Mukerjea and her former husband and co- accused Sanjeev Khanna, were yet to be examined.“There is no doubt that the accused is an influential and wealthyperson. Therefore, the possibility of influencing prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out,” the judge said.While arguing for bail, Indrani Mukerjea told court that the prosecution’s case was “false and baseless” and she had nearly 120 documents to prove it.She submitted that there is no scientific evidence to prove that the crime happened.She pointed out inconsistencies in the evidence put forth by the prosecution to prove her role as a conspirator and one of the killers of her daughter Sheena Bora.She also raised doubt about the “credibility and legality” of the probe.Indrani Mukerjea claimed there are numerous contradictions in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses, including accused-turned-approver Shayamwar Rai.“They have either contradicted their own statements, or the statements of other witnesses, or the prosecutions story itself,” she had submitted.However, the judge in his order observed that in the middle of trial, the court cannot declare that the part evidence is either wholly reliable, or partly reliable, or totally unreliable.“At the present juncture, the court cannot conclude that the evidence led by Shyamvar Rai (approver) has falsified or suffered from fatal infirmities due to cross-examination of the said witness,” the court noted.The judge further observed that at this stage, the trial court cannot pass a final conclusion about the evidentiary value of the witnesses.“In my opinion, the accused and the advocate concerned should co-operate with the trial court to finish the said trial,” the judge added.Indrani Mukerjea is currently lodged at the Byculla women’s jail in Mumbai.Last month, the court rejected her another bail plea, citing the risk of contracting coronavirus in the wake of the disease outbreak in the jail.Sheena Bora (24) was allegedly strangled in a car by Indrani Mukerjea, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and Sanjeev Khanna in April 2012.Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.Indrani Mukerjea was arrested in August 2015.Former media baron Peter Mukerjea was also later arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy. He is currently out on bail, which was granted by the Bombay High Court earlier this year.His 17-year-old marriage to Indrani Mukerjea ended during the period of incarceration as the two got divorced in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/court-rejects-indrani-mukerjea-s-bail-plea-in-sheena-bora-murder-case/story-wieCJSSigivY3lHZGUKrZP.html

06-08-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand govt to declare all jails as containment zones||Alarmed by the recent discovery of 67 infected jail inmates and staffers at Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Central Jail (BMCJ) and Pakur’s divisional jail, the state government is all set to declare prisons across the state as containment zones to ban any unauthorised entry and exit, officials said on Wednesday.A decision in this regard has been taken and a formal order is likely to be issued soon.Confirming the development, inspector general (IG), prison, Birendra Bhushan said, “It has been decided to declare all jails across the state as containment zones to impose complete lockdown there. Sampling would also be ramped up. Besides, many other decisions are also taken for effective containment of the pandemic.”Bhushan added, “An order in this regard will be issued soon.”As many as 54 people, including 32 inmates and 22 staff of BMCJ, were found infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus on August 3. Among the infected inmates, two are politicians. Besides, 13 prisoners lodged in Pakur divisional jail were also found infected with the virus.The spike in Covid cases among jail inmates has prompted the government to take strict measures to seclude the large number of inmates and staff from outside exposure.At present, Jharkhand has around 26,000 prisoners lodged in different jails across the state. The total capacity of these jails, however, is approximately 20,000.Elaborating on the decisions taken, the IG (Prison) said, “Prisoners’ meetings with their relatives would remain suspended. Usage of telephone booths by inmates would not be allowed during lockdown period. All the cells would not be opened simultaneously for prisoners’ movement inside the jail premises. Only one cell would be opened at a time.”“Besides, movement of jail staff too would be restricted. No one would be allowed to venture outside,” he said.The IG also informed that in order to contain the spread of the disease, a decision has also been taken to improve the food quality by adding more nutritious items and immunity boosters like eggs, lemon tea, and ‘kaadha’.“We are also trying to set up a dedicated 100-bed Covid hospital for jail inmates at Ranchi’s Khelgaon sports complex. Every jail has already set up an isolation centre in its premises,” Bhushan said.In order to prevent panic among inmates, the jail administrations have been asked to initiate counselling sessions for prisoners.Through amplified sound systems, the inmates are being informed about the pandemic’s nature of spread and its recovery pattern. They are being motivated to take it positively and that there was nothing to worry about as all possible steps were being taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/j-khand-govt-to-declare-all-jails-as-containment-zones/story-2fCc7f8LvGeJP6oQy5BLvO.html

06-08-2020||Delhi||Covid-hit private bus operators demand relief from Delhi government||Private bus operators in the national capital have sought relief from the Delhi government in the wake of losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, saying 65-70 per cent of their vehicles are still off roads. Claiming that “the whole ecosystem stands the risk of collapse,” the Delhi Contract Bus Association office-bearers, in a letter written on Wednesday to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot, urged for waiver of road tax from April to December this year. The association represents contract carriage and all India tourist bus operators catering to schools, offices, national and multinational companies and tourists. “The transport operators are under acute financial strain and about 65-70 per cent of their vehicles are still off the road. In the present critical situation of the trade, the bus operators are devastated. The situation is aggravated by depletion of their finances in meeting obligations like staff salaries, taxes and interest on EMIs,” said the association general Harish Sabharwal. Due to shortage of demand, their operations are becoming economically unviable, and it has become very difficult to pay the taxes for vehicles due since April, he said. “In sync with your government’s endeavours to help the citizens of the state during these tough times and to provide them the much-needed relief, it is earnestly requested to your good self to issue needful directions to the Transport Department in this regard,” said the letter to the chief minister, requesting a tax waiver. Due to the pandemic, the financial crisis in the passenger transport segment has reached its peak. Unless the governments provide the timely and necessary support to the sector, the whole ecosystem stands the risk of collapse, Sabharwal said. Gurmit Singh Taneja, working president of the Delhi Contract Bus Association, said there was no revenue generation for school bus operators, as schools were closed indefinitely. “As per the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the school buses are painted with yellow colour and they run on CNG and cannot be used anywhere else. But during lockdown they have incurred costs like EMI’s, staff salaries, insurance, parking charges, Road Tax and several government compliances, borne by the operators,” Taneja said. Domestic and international tourism is at a standstill due to the pandemic and hence there is no earning for tourist buses as well.  Office goers are working from home, IT-sector, multinational and national organizations are still closed, he said. There is no revenue generation and financial inflows as mostly payments from business houses and companies are restrained and existing finances with small bus operators as well as that of big bus operators are depleting fast, Taneja reasoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-hit-private-bus-operators-demand-relief-from-delhi-government/story-5mApNxAqV6tc0YzMkYY2TK.html

06-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugramwale: Days of her post-multiplex life||The coronavirus pandemic has made theatre-going seem like a habit from some dead civilisation. So, spare a thought for those poor folks who consider the multiplex manager their “soulmate” because of his exclusive access to film tickets.One such committed movie-goer Jyotika Bhaskar, who enjoys a great bonding with a multiplex manager, presides over the world from her 11th floor apartment overlooking Gurugram’s Golf Course Road. In her early 50s, she lives with her daughter and has a passion for pursuits that necessitates outings into the wider world outside—Ms Bhaskar loves hanging out with friends in multiplexes and malls. The pandemic has made all these things impossible.Helping us prepare a part of Covid-era history’s first draft, Ms Bhaskar generously responds to a set of questions about ‘daily life these times’ we have been putting to people from diverse backgrounds. The pictures are taken through the mobile screen that connects her to this reporter.Five outdoorsy things you’ll do after the pandemic is over.1. I will visit Tina, my mother, in her Delhi home in Ishwar Nagar, and give her the tightest squeeze ever. This pandemic is making us do such strange, unnatural things, like seeking permission from our loved ones before greeting them the way we used to. Asking permission to hug your own mom??? Yeh kya baat hui? Cruel coronavirus.2. I’ll go get a plate of gol gappas from the Harish Bakery in Sector 56. For me, his crunchy gol gappas, with the yummiest khatta meetha jal jeera paani, are pure magic. Not to forget the fact that my loyalty always makes the folks there give me two extra ones. Have tried chaat and gol gappas at many other places too, yes, but nothing beats these in the quaint market of (Sector) Chhappan.3. I cannot wait to pack my stuff and head out with the loved ones to the hills in Himachal. I like to drive myself in the plains, but let my sister, Monisha, or brother-in-law, Sunil, take over the steering wheel once the hills begin. This journey to Manali, with a break in Kasauli for two days, is just the thing that invigorates my being. The mountain roads through which we pass are beautifully interspersed with furious looking white-water rivers. I always stop to dip my feet into the cold water. It’s thrilling.4. I’ll go to my most favourite shopping place — Lajpat Nagar (Delhi). Being a proud Gurgaonwale, I do go to the malls but Lajpat Nagar is something I have missed a lot in these months. I’ve known some of the shops there since the time I was a child. Such as the pressure cooker repair man who never writes anything on paper but knows which cooker belongs to whom; the gota zari embroidery shop; the dry fruits shop and of course the momo lady! Kahaan gaye yeh sab? Are they still there or not? How are they coping these days?5. My once-a-week movie watching has come to a halt because of this pandemic. While everyone has family members’ mobile numbers, doctor’s number, etc., saved on speed dial, I have the number of multiplex manager Prateek. For the past many years, I have been watching the latest releases in a nearby multiplex where I’m treated like a VVIP. Just have to send one message on phone and Prateek promptly books my ticket, and even keeps the popcorn and coffee ready for me. He also knows of my favourite seat in the theatre—J6! I’m sure that these days Prateek must be missing me as much as I am missing him. Once I couldn’t get the ticket and was crying openly in front of the box office when he approached me and said, “Ma’am, you never have to worry about the ticket, please don’t cry!” This happened some 8 years back and since then Prateek has been my soulmate!The view outside your window at the moment.A green garden, trees and lots of birds. At a little distance, a very sad lonely Rapid Metro bogie is standing by itself on the tracks.What’s going on in your mind right now?Was that it, or is this it? Was the life before corona? Or is the life this, during corona?Objects in your house that give you solace in self-isolation.My kitchen bartans (utensils). My utensils and my kitchen kept me sweaty and upbeat through these crazy, messy, emotional, up-and-down days. I cooked and cooked and cooked. My pressure cookers, kadhais, non-stick pans— all called out to me all the time. During these months my daughter, Mahima, and I decided that we would ourselves make all those dishes that we love to eat. Together we rustled out peach upside down cake, banana bread, kung pao chicken, fried rice, biryanis, and so many more dishes. I also pulled out old family recipes. Seriously grateful to my kitchen for keeping me sane in these tough days of self-isolation. Hope I live to see that much-awaited post-pandemic dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugramwale-days-of-her-post-multiplex-life/story-8ag56Dam2sCXMMvhdJYoLL.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||Scheme to give free sanitary napkins to 22.50 lakh BPL women, girls launched||The Haryana government on Wednesday launched a scheme to give a packet of free sanitary napkins to about 22.50 lakh women and girls below the poverty line every month for a year.A scheme was also started to provide fortified flavoured skimmed milk powder under the ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’ for children aged 1-6 years in anganwadi centres, and pregnant and lactating mothers under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), an official statement said.It would reach about 9.03 lakh children and 2.95 lakh pregnant and lactating mothers visiting 25,962 anganwadi centres in the state. Under the ‘Mahila Evam Kishori Samman Yojana’, adolescent girls and women between 10 to 45 years of age of below poverty line (BPL) families would be provided free sanitary napkins every month for a year. Each packet would contain six sanitary napkins, it said.Apart from this, the Education Department has also prepared another scheme under which 6.50 lakh girl students would be provided six sanitary napkins every month. Speaking after launching these schemes here, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar urged all the deputy commissioners (DCs) to include the ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’ in their flagship programmes and make targeted efforts towards addressing the problem of anaemia and malnutrition among women and children in their respective districts.On the occasion, the chief minister also distributed packets of skimmed milk powder to five beneficiaries of the ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’, including three children and two pregnant women. He also distributed packets of free sanitary napkins to some beneficiaries of the ‘Mahila Evam Kishori Samman Yojana’. Packets of skimmed milk powder and sanitary napkins were also distributed simultaneously to the beneficiaries of both the schemes in all the districts of the state who joined the programme through video conferencing, the statement said.Expressing concern over the problem of malnutrition and anaemia, Khattar said there are a few districts in the state like Nuh, where the problem of anaemia among women and children is comparatively high. He asked the DCs to ensure effective implementation of the ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’ in their respective districts, saying that the fortified flavoured skimmed milk powder to be distributed under the scheme would play an important role in reducing malnutrition. This milk would contain nutritious elements like protein, calcium, magnesium, B-12 as well as vitamins-A and D, which would replenish the micro-nutrients and vitamins in the body, the statement said.Under this scheme, around 200 ml of fragrant skimmed milk would be given per day for six days in a week to the children between 1 and 6 years of age in anganwadi centres and pregnant and lactating mothers.Khattar said apart from the government, other government organisations and NGOs working in the field of women and child development could also play a vital role in the effective implementation of these schemes at the grassroots level and also encouraging the beneficiaries to take maximum benefit under this scheme.  He said the BJP-led government has been working by focusing on ‘4-S’ --’Shiksha (education), Swasthya (health), Suraksha (security) and Swamlamban (self-reliance)’. Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Women and Child Development Kamlesh Dhanda said the two schemes would not only give a major boost to ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign but also help in addressing the problem of malnutrition among women and children. She said an amount of Rs 256 crore would be spent on both these schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/scheme-to-give-free-sanitary-napkins-to-22-50-lakh-bpl-women-girls-launched/story-4yPwwjdxpdGd8DfT87ZBEN.html

06-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt survey to find avenues to bolster its income||The Delhi government will conduct a study to find ways to improve revenues, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday.The move comes a day after the government sent notices to around 10,800 companies in the city for paying lesser or no tax between January and March this year. The Delhi government’s tax collection in January-March this year has gone down by over ₹2,000 crore compared to the same period last year.On Wednesday, Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, held a meeting, for the second consecutive day, to discuss ways to increase government’s revenue collection. Sisodia on Wednesday directed the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDC) to prepare a detailed study to improve the revenue base in Delhi and submit its report in two months. The DDC is a policy think tank of the Delhi government. Its chairperson is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and vice-chairperson is Jasmine Shah, who is also the media advisor to the CM.Talking about the scope of the study, Sisodia said the DDC would have to suggest short and long-term measures to improve revenue collection. He also directed DDC to consult with experts in the field and organisations working in public finance while carrying out the study.“The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has put a huge strain on government revenues in the national Capital territory (NCT) of Delhi. Therefore, all out efforts need to be made towards revenue augmentation so that the government is able to undertake all necessary works and programmes for the welfare of people of Delhi,” Sisodia said after the meeting. According to Delhi’s economic survey for 2019-20, Delhi is ranked position is 19th in terms of its own tax revenue as the percentage (4.73%) of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) during 2018-19.  “For 2018-19, Uttar Pradesh’s tax revenue as percentage of GSDP is 9.1%, Kerala’s is 7.7%, Rajasthan 7.2%, Maharashtra 7.1% and Andhra Pradesh 7%. Looking at Delhi’s trend itself, its tax revenue to GSDP was 6.18% in 2009-10, which reduced to 5.38% in 2014-15 and further reduced to 4.73% in 2018-19. In comparison, the average tax revenue for all states as a percentage of their GSDP was 5.94% in 2009-10, which increased to 6.25% in 2014-15 and further increased to 6.69% in 2018-19,” the government said in a statement. DDC vice-chairman Jasmine Shah said the Delhi government’s early call for opening the economy and a robust healthcare strategy has set the right conditions for an economic revival. “The DDC will perform a rigorous study on the improvement of the revenue base of Delhi. We will involve the field experts to perform this study. Today, the Delhi model of fighting against Covid-19 has become a model for across India and we are confident that with time and a proper strategy, we will be able to overcome the revenue deficit too,” he said. In a bid to improve Delhi’s revenue deficit, the trade and taxes department of the Delhi government has started analysing the returns by taxpayers registered under GST. On Tuesday, Sisodia held a meeting with the officials, in which it was said that of the 15,000 taxpayers analysed so far, nearly 970 taxpayers have not filed returns for 2020-21 from January to March. The Delhi government has also found that this year, nearly 10,800 companies paid lesser or zero tax from January to March. Taking cognizance of these findings, the Delhi government has prepared a list of defaulters. The deputy chief minister has appealed to all the companies to immediately deposit their taxes. He also said that the Delhi government will take stringent action against the defaulters. “The Delhi government has evaluated 15,000 companies so far but in the future up to 7 lakh companies registered under GST will be evaluated. The Delhi government will take strict action against all the defaulters after the evaluation,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-survey-to-find-avenues-to-bolster-its-income/story-YwaqO6mFp4PbdWgIJCb49O.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Dreams of a father||He will remember the year 2020 for the rest of his life, he says. Not because of the coronavirus pandemic, though.“It’s the first time somebody in our family scored such marks in high school,” says Beni Prasad Bansal. In his early 50s, the newspaper vendor is talking of his son. “Akshar got 97.6% in his 10th standard board exams.” Since Mr Bansal is wearing a mask, it is impossible to make out his happiness, or perhaps his pride, from his face. And he is too soft-spoken, too restrained in his demeanour to betray such vain feelings through his voice. Nevertheless, he must be believed when he says that he has no reasons for any regrets at the moment.The gentleman feels confident in his talented son enjoying a career that will be superior to his. He himself has been a newspaper seller for decades. Since 1992, this tall quiet man has been standing every morning (his back always straight and erect unlike the passing crowd about him) on the same spot in central Delhi, with his cycle decked with the morning’s newspapers. On this late morning, he has already delivered the papers to the houses of all his regular clients—he stuck one folded copy very deftly in a shop’s shuttered metal grills—and is now patiently waiting for chance customers, just like the vegetable seller standing next to him. He shall go home as soon as all the newspapers are sold. Relatively free for the time, Mr Bansal gives an account of the 10th standard results of the rest of his family to give perspective to his son’s performance.His daughter, Aishwarya, completed her 10th some years back. “The students were given grades instead of marks the year she cleared 10th. She had gotten B.” The young woman is employed as an analyst in a Noida-based company, and is currently working from home due to the pandemic. Mr Bansal himself scored 73% in 10th. “I had to quit studies after clearing the 12th board exams because of problems at home.” Suddenly shifting his voice to a flat feeling-less tone, he talks of his “old ambitions of setting a private business, but the dreams could not become real.” His wife, Rekha, scored more than him: 80%. She is a home-maker.His father, Sri Narayan Das, who retired as a bank clerk in 1996 scored... Mr Bansal doesn’t know. He calls up his father on mobile, who tells him that it all happened too long ago for him to remember. All he recalls is that he barely managed to pass. “Back then 10th pass people would get jobs as bank clerks, I think,” says Mr Bansal.And then there was Vimla Devi, his mother. “My mother studied till fifth standard. Women weren’t encouraged to study much in her times.”Mr Bansal isn’t sure of what his son’s plans are, but for now the boy wants to pursue science as his principal subject. And he aims to score similarly illustrious marks in the 12th standard board exams, too. The vendor doesn’t want his son to pick up his profession. “I have no complaints with my newspaper selling career, but it demands high labour with not much money in return.” Gesturing towards the dailies arranged on his cycle’s handle bar, he says that nobody could predict the front-page tomorrow—will it be all good news or speak of calamities still to happen? “That’s the thing with future... you don’t know what it will be like.” But his son has surprised him by exceeding his expectations and “Akshar’s tomorrow should be definitely better than his father’s or grandfather’s... that’s all I pray.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-dreams-of-a-father/story-yVxHLF5xjyc4g4elPUyzjP.html

06-08-2020||Chandigarh||Electricity bill-related issues hassle Chandigarh residents||Residents are a harried lot as the UT electricity department is charging four months’ bill in one go, even as many are struggling with the monthly expenses amid the lockdown. Besides, the department is also not sending hard copies of bills and has reduced the time given for payment, say residents. “It is very difficult for the residents, particularly, retired senior citizens to pay large amounts,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation. “In addition to it, the department is also not giving the benefits of four months’ lower slabs. The electricity charges are levied depending on the slab of consumption. For every month ,there are two slabs, but with four months’ bills being charged in one go, instead of getting benefits of lower slabs four times, residents are only getting it only once. This is disturbing the monthly budgets of tresidents,” added Puri.NO HARD COPY OF BILLSResidents also complain that not all power consumers are receiving hard copies of the bills. “Residents have to check the bills online and sometimes, they get an SMS. This is also creating confusion. The administration should either allow for staggered payment of the bills, or relax the deadline for the payment of the bill by 15 days,” said Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh (FOSWAC).RK Garg, a city-based RTI activist, said, “The electricity department has skipped the mandatory 15 days’ time to pay electricity bills. On August 4, I received the department’s message on my mobile regarding the bill. I was surprised to see that the due date is on August 14. So, the electricity department has not given mandatory 15 days’ time to pay hefty bills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bill-related-issues-hassle-electricity-consumers-in-city/story-OJJMzGhDVzhceEI8w27oCL.html

06-08-2020||Mumbai||CM asks BMC, other civic bodies to be on high alert||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray took stock of the monsoon situation in Maharashtra, especially in Mumbai and asked civic bodies to stay on high alert as heavy rainfall has been predicted in Mumbai for the second consecutive day on Thursday.He has also appealed to citizens to not venture out of their homes unless in dire need. He has also ordered the authorities for better coordination to handle situation arising out of the heavy downpour. “Municipal corporations, police, power supply authorities have been directed to ensure that the citizens do not face any hardship. Authorities have been directed to restore outage of power, clear waterlogging by acting swiftly. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has been asked to avoid any type of mishap due to heavy rainfall,” the statement issued by the chief minister’s office stated. Shaft panel of Jaslok hospital falls off due to rainAs Mumbai was battered with heavy rain for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, a shaft panel of Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, covering three floors, fell off due to strong winds. However, no one was injured in the incident. A statement issued by the hospital stated, “Due to incessant rainfall and heavy wind pressure this afternoon, one of the shaft panels of the hospital building got loosened and was blown away. However, no one was hurt due to the incident as our team quickly acted in time. We are committed to the well-being of our staff and patients with all safety measures in place.”All-time high August rain for Dahanu Dahanu recorded its all-time highest 24-hour rainfall, beating a 75-year-old record, on Wednesday with 383.1mm rain over 24 hours. The previous record was set on August 14, 1945 with 353.3mm rainfall. This is the first year in over a decade when the weather station at Dahanu recorded more than 300mm rain in 24 hours in August. According to rain readings from Palghar district administration, Palghar recorded 460.6mm rain over 24 hours while Zhar recorded 460.4mm, Boisar 452mm, and Tarapur 447mm. However, since the India Meteorological Department (IMD) does not have weather stations there, rain readings were not taken by them. Independent meteorologists explained why Dahanu, Palghar and areas north of Mumbai received more rain between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. “The offshore trough (strong wind currents over the Arabian Sea coast) formed due to the low pressure system in Bay of Bengal keeps shifting. It had earlier shifted northwards allowing more rain in areas north of Mumbai. The same system moved slightly towards the south, leading to heavy rain for Mumbai, Raigad and Ratnagiri,” said professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. Spotted deer rescued from Goregaon drain A male spotted deer was displaced during heavy rains on Tuesday and got stuck in a large drain at Goregaon (East). The forest department, in coordination with wildlife groups Spreading Awareness on Reptiles and Rehabilitation Program (SARRP) and Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), rescued the deer and took it to the animal rescue centre at Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The animal was examined and will be rehabilitated back to the wild. “The rescue operation was conducted in a strategic manner where the rescue teams secured it from both the sides while a team entered through the manhole with the help of a ladder,” said Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW.Flight operations disruptedStrong winds led to flight diversions and go-arounds at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Wednesday.According to air operator Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), seven flights had to go-around. While MIAL said that no flights were diverted, airport sources said three flights were diverted between 5.30pm and 7pm.According to sources, SpiceJet 7304 had to divert to Surat, IndiGo 6E 969 had to divert to Ahmedabad and IndiGo 755 had to divert to Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-asks-bmc-other-civic-bodies-to-be-on-high-alert/story-EmCURKFzxV41oIHL0RSASO.html

06-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai washed out, again; SoBo worst-hit||If not for the pandemic and lockdown, Mumbai would have witnessed monsoon mayhem on Wednesday, with citizens stranded in trains and at railway stations, roads waterlogged and hours-long traffic snarls. Nevertheless, the heavy rain with gusty winds led to several incidents of severe waterlogging, tree collapses, partial house or building collapses with properties damaged as signages of prominent buildings got blown away. The island city, especially south Mumbai, was the most affected and many new locations that have never been inundated during the monsoon in the previous years such as Girgaum Chowpaty, Nariman Point, and Babulnath were heavily waterlogged. No injuries were reported. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), waterlogging was reported at nine prominent locations in the island city, four locations in the eastern suburbs, and three locations in the western suburbs, with many areas submerged in two- or three-ft deep water. A total of 142 instances of tree or branch collapses were reported across the city, of which 112 were reported from the island city alone, 13 from the western suburbs, and 16 from the eastern suburbs.

Ashish Chauhan, CEO of BSE tweeted on Wednesday evening, “The signage on top of the BSE building toppled due to heavy wind and incessant rain today. We are seeking the help of fire brigade to ensure that the signage doesn’t fall to the ground and injure anyone or create property damage for anyone. Please bear with us.” Mumbai also reported six instances of partial house collapses, where a wall or balcony of a building collapsed, three of which were in the island city, and three in the eastern suburbs. BMC repeatedly urged citizens to stay indoors, or stay put. Maharashtra minister for environment, Aaditya Thackeray tweeted: “Requesting all to remain indoors. Mumbai is lashed with high velocity winds and extremely heavy rain as we all can witness....While we’ve asked all to stay home, the police and urban/ rural local bodies staff are on streets and are braving the stormy rains. Please stay home and stay put wherever indoors you are across the entire belt receiving rains.” BMC on Wednesday evening said, “All officials of the fire brigade and the gardens department are out on the streets, removing collapsed trees off the streets to ensure smooth traffic.” Local train services were severely impacted on both the central and western line.

With the help of some local youths, Mamta was rescued from the nullah and was taken to Saiwan government hospital.Palghar district collector Dr Kailas Shinde said he will recommend Mamta’s name for bravery award to the Maharashtra government and the same will be sent to the Centre. “I will present a strong proposal on her behalf as Mamta showed her presence of mind and did not get scared despite the torrential downpour,” said Shinde. Meanwhile, the tehsildar has done a panchnama of the hut which got damaged. The revenue department will render compensation to the family as per government rules, said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5-year-old-swept-by-currents-holds-onto-a-tree/story-AkMnccfFM0hYoTetT6fIuK.html
06-08-2020||City||Ludhiana: SAD speaks out against termination of contractual MC junior engineers, sub-divisional officers||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has come out in support of the 50 contractual junior engineers (JE) and sub-divisional officers (SDO) of municipal corporation (MC) who were served cessation notices by their contractor after the MC raised objections over their performance.Leader of the opposition in MC House, Harbhajan Singh Dang, former mayor Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria, among other SAD leaders, met mayor Balkar Sandhu on Wednesday over the issue.One-month notice periods of over 35 staffers in the bridges and roads department has ended, and notices have been served to 15 JEs and SDOs working in operations and maintenance in the last few days.The leaders said that on one hand, the government was making tall claims of providing employment to the youth, and on the other, MC’s move would result in unemployment at a time when the youth was already struggling to find jobs.Dang said, “The MC is terminating those who were employed during SAD-BJP tenure. The employees are performing well. Also, the MC will face staff shortage if these people are terminated. The mayor has assured that he will look into the matter.”Mayor Sandhu said, “The contracts of only a few JEs and SDOs will be renewed as per requirement and on the basis of their performance. The services of operation and maintenance staff will also be terminated if their performance is not found up to the mark.” One of the MC employees requesting anonymity said that the civic body was not satisfied with the performance of the employees but the civic body had cited financial crisis as the reason behind the terminations. It has also come to light that many of the employees were taken aboard on the recommendations of the then SAD-BJP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-sad-speaks-out-against-termination-of-contractual-mc-junior-engineers-sub-divisional-officers/story-wCl6aPY0FAB65MPJOP850O.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Lake water levels increase to 37.36% from 34.95%||The seven lakes that supply water to Mumbai have shown slight increase in water stock as water level reached 37.36% on Wednesday morning, up from 34.95% useful water content on Tuesday morning. The water level in the lakes was 89.96% this time last year. The current water stock is sufficient to supply water to Mumbai for a little over 100 days. Owing to the heavy rainfall since the past two days, Vihar lake situated inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) overflowed at 10pm on Wednesday, according to the civic body. Vihar lake, with a capacity of 27,698 million litre, is the second lake to overflow in the city. Earlier, Tulsi lake, also situated in SGNP, had overflowed on July 28. However, Vihar and Tulsi lakes do not have significant contribution towards drinking water supply to Mumbai. Starting Wednesday, Mumbai has imposed 20% water cut in the city owing to meagre rainfall in catchment areas. Between Tuesday and Wednesday morning, rainfall added 33,411 million litre (ML) water to the seven lakes, taking the total the water content to 539,307ML on Wednesday. However, this is much less compared to the stock this time last year when there was 1,301,984 ML water in the seven lakes. In 2018, the water level was 1,2,18,692 ML. About two weeks ago, on July 21, the water stock in the lakes was at 28%. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) supplies 3,850 million litre water per day (MLD) to Mumbai as opposed to a demand of 4,200MLD. After the 20% water cut, BMC will supply 3,080MLD water to Mumbai, according to information from BMC. In the past 24 hours, Upper Vaitarna received 97mm rainfall, Modak Sagar received 141mm rainfall, Tansa received 83mm rainfall, Middle Vaitarna received 99mm rainfall, Bhatsa received 88mm rainfall, Vihar received 105mm rainfall, and Tulsi 154mm rainfall. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems — the Vaitarna system which supplies to the western suburbs and the island city and the Bhatsa system which supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lake-water-levels-increase-to-37-36-from-34-95/story-irpKFanDuNYipAFLhQUcHL.html
06-08-2020||City||Waterlogging, tree collapse reported in Kalyan, Bhiwandi||Heavy rains lashed Kalyan and Bhiwandi on Wednesday, leading to waterlogging, tree collapse and electrocution of three cows in the city. Major waterlogging was reported below Mankoli bridge on Mumbai-Nasik highway, near Bhiwandi as continuous downpour was reported in Thane and its neighbouring cities since Tuesday night. However, traffic police said there was no disruption of traffic flow due to waterlogging. “The traffic was smooth compared to other days as fewer vehicles were on the streets on Wednesday morning. The road parallel to the bridge was waterlogged, hence we deployed traffic cops and warden at all the points of the stretch to manage the traffic and avoid disruption,” said an officer of Narpoli traffic unit. Bhiwandi recorded 43mm rainfall since the past two days. Sudesh Naik, 30, who took the bypass road on Wednesday morning, said, “Water had covered the entire road below the bridge and the vehicles were moving very slow. Usually there is a lot of traffic jam on this stretch, but many skipped the road on Wednesday because of rain, owing to which traffic was normal.” Kalyan also received continuous downpour leading to waterlogging at several spots with Kalyan- Dombivli receiving 88.6mm rainfall over 24 hours. Three cows were found electrocuted at Kalyan (East) on Tuesday night, following which locals complained to the electricity board. An official from Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) said, “The cows were walking near the electric pole amid heavy rain and got electrocuted. Our officials visited the spot. We are doing the needful to avoid such tragedy hereafter.” Waterlogging was reported at Sant Tukaram nagar, Chikanghar in Kalyan (West) due to the rise in nullah water. There were reports of water entering the houses from Rambaug in Kalyan (West), Kolsewadi and Raja Ram Nagar in Kalyan (East). A total of 11 tree fall cases were reported with Kalyan Dombivli fire department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waterlogging-tree-collapse-reported-in-kalyan-bhiwandi/story-2DCL7RkGD1M4S7tdFYomIO.html

As per rough estimates, the number of samples taken in the first three months is less than those collected in July.”“Special sampling camps were held at the cloth market earlier in the month and at the areas that we considered high-risk zones, including Ambala Sadar. We knew that activities will gradually increase after ‘Unlock 1’, so we increased the sampling that added to the number,” he added. In July, the Ambala health department collected 20,458 samples from the district. The first case in Ambala was reported on March 28, and the count reached 292 by June 30.

06-08-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar govt to distribute free sanitary napkins to 23 lakh women every month||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said under the ‘Mahila Evam Kishori Samman Yojana’, the state government will give six packs of sanitary napkins for free every month to about 23 lakh women and adolescent girls. Speaking after launching ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’ and ‘Mahila Evam Kishori Samman Yojana’ here, Khattar said the education department has also prepared a scheme under which 6.5 lakh girl students would be provided six sanitary napkins every month. Khattar asked all deputy commissioners (DCs) to include ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’ in their flagship programmes and make targeted efforts towards addressing the problem of anaemia and malnutrition among women and children in their districts. He said the state government has been laying special emphasis on the overall development of women and children. Under the ‘Mukhya Mantri Doodh Uphar Yojana’, fortified flavoured skimmed milk powder would be provided to children between one and six years of age in anganwadi centres and pregnant and lactating mothers under the integrated child development scheme. Khattar distributed packets of skimmed milk powder and free sanitary napkins, which were also given to the beneficiaries of both the schemes in all districts who joined the programme through videoconferencing.Khattar said Nuh was among the districts where the problem of anaemia among women and children was comparatively high. He said his government has been working by focusing on 4S — shiksha (education), swasthya (health), suraksha (security) and swavalamban (self-reliance). He said now, another ‘S’ has been included to denote ‘swabhiman’ in order to ensure that people live with self-respect. Minister of state for women and child development Kamlesh Dhanda said Rs 256 crore would be spent every year on these schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-govt-to-distribute-free-sanitary-napkins-to-23-lakh-women-every-month/story-6BMJJuwsrV85PBs5bgagnO.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Amid lockdown, pandemic, citizens make Ganesh idols at home||For Balu Ganpat Chavan, 46, a head constable in Central police station in Ulhasnagar, Ganeshotsav means childhood memories. However, given the risk amid the Covid-19 pandemic this year, Chavan decided to sculpt a clay idol. In the three days that he got last week, after four months on Covid duty, he got his Ganpati idol ready. Like Chavan, many residents have decided this year to make their own idol. “During this tough time, we need the blessings of the lord, so missing the celebration was not an option. I decided to sculpt the idol with my son who cleared Class 10. However, with my busy schedule, it seemed difficult. Last week, I finally got leave for three days and bought clay from the market. I sculpted a two-foot tall idol and am now waiting for it to dry, so we can paint it,” said Chavan, a resident of Belavli in Badlapur. “I had done it earlier as a kid, but making the idol with family made it special.” Dombivli-based artist Sharad Patil, 37, who is renowned for sketches, too is on a similar mission. “Last year, we got our idol from a friend, but it is not advisable to get it from outside this year,” said Patil, who lives at Star colony, Dombivli (East). The Bhoir family from Khadakpada in Kalyan thinks lockdown is an ideal time to make the Ganesh idol at home. Vishant Bhoir, 31, an interior designer, said, “We shifted to this house last year and wanted to make our own idol, but it was not possible as I was busy with work. This year, we are home and have lot of free time. I started work on the idol and my five-year old daughter, Saisha, too joined in.” Instead of immersing the idol in a water body last year, the Bhoirs had immersed it at home and saved the mud. The family has made an 11-inch idol from the same mud. “It took only four hours for me to finish shaping the idol. My daughter, too, stayed up with me to work on the idol. In these depressing times, the quality time with family seems like the greatest reward,” Bhoir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-lockdown-pandemic-citizens-make-ganesh-idols-at-home/story-M09xDwTGtTfzHBUIS514ZN.html

The gallery wall of the first floor of Krishna Bhawan, a 32-year-old structure in Wagle Estate, collapsed. Santosh Kadam, chief of regional disaster management cell, Thane, said, “The access route to the first floor of this four-storey building was blocked, so we had to use a ladder and evacuate residents from the gallery. There were no injuries. The building was not in the list of dangerous buildings.” The rescue operation was completed in half an hour. Suresh Sahni, a 37-year-old building resident, said, “The gallery was not very sturdy, and hence we had provided additional outside support, which collapsed during heavy rains. We heard a loud noise and found a rumble of bricks and cement in the pathway below. With no other option during lockdown, we continued to stay in this premises. We shall now repair the building based on a structural audit.” Thane saw waterlogging in five areas and 11 tree fall incidents till Wednesday evening.

06-08-2020||Mumbai||Parents complain against PTAs over school fees||As the pandemic and the resultant financial loss led to parents urging several private schools to reduce their fees, parent teacher associations, which are expected to help parents address their grievances, are posing as obstacles.Several parents said that even as a large number of them had urged the school management to reduce fees, PTA had not spoken in their favour. “We have been urging parent representatives on the PTA executive committee to put our issues in front of the management, but they seem to be in favour of the school. In fact, the school has also used many of those members against parents to threaten them to pay full fees,” said the parent of a south Mumbai-based school which recently discontinued online classes for students whose parents have requested a cut in the fees. After several requests in this regard were sent from parents of private schools to the government, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad had said the school PTA can recommend a fee reduction as per the rules. As per the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, schools in the state have to get any revisions in their fees approved by the executive committee of the PTA. The committee consists of the school principal as the chairperson, a parent as the vice-chairperson, a teacher as secretary, a teacher and a parent as joint secretaries and a parent and a teacher from every class as joint members. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum, said the apathy of several parents to be a part of the PTA is a key factor that allows private schools to act as per their whims. “Over the past few years, we are seeing a certain disinterest among parents in participating in PTAs and raising their voice. This is really bad for the parent community. This issue then gets highlighted in a situation like this where there are so many unaddressed complaints.”Meanwhile, parents from several schools said the PTA had not been formed as per the due process. “There are many schools where elections to PTA don’t take place and people close to school management get appointed as parent representatives. However, this does not mean that the government cannot do anything. The government can step in and conduct audits of schools and take action if procedural lapses are found,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association. Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, “We cannot comment as the matter is subjudice.” A government resolution released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR, however, was stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.What parents can do:The executive committee of PTA has to approve any revision in the fee structure and such revisions have to be declared in advance. The PTA can check expenditure and income of schools and urge the school to reduce fees if expenditure is found to be less If 25% or more parents are unhappy with the PTA’s decision with respect to fees, they can approach the divisional fee regulatory committee (DFRC) and oppose the PTA’s decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-complain-against-ptas-over-school-fees/story-WDWlTgel8BjyvKD3bca7YJ.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Reverse migration of workers has started, no need for Shramik specials: State to Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to file a detailed affidavit on the number of trains arranged to transport migrant workers to their native places, number of migrant workers who boarded the trains, and the cost and loss incurred by the state for the same since July 11. The directions were issued after the state informed the court that there was a reverse migration of workers returning to Mumbai, and hence the petitioner’s demand to arrange trains was an exercise in futility. The court also said that in light of the fact that receiving states were not willing to allow the workers to return, the state should first take the opinion of the receiving states and only if they agree then the state should arrange for trains or buses to take back workers. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AS Gadkari, while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Centre for Indian Trade Unions, was informed by advocate Ronita Bhattacharya Bector that there were more than 13,000 migrant workers who wanted to return back to their native places in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and other states and hence the Maharashtra government should arrange transportation facilities for them. However, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni strongly opposed the contention and submitted that there was a reverse migration of workers who were returning to Mumbai and hence the petitioners claim was unfounded. He further said that after the last hearing, they had received a list of around 8,000 migrant workers, who wanted to return to their hometowns, from the petitioner and other NGOs, hence eight trains were arranged and the railways was paid ₹69 lakh for the same. Kumbhakoni then submitted that less than half the workers actually boarded the trains, leading to the state suffering a loss of ₹42 lakh. He further cited an instance of Pune wherein the petitioner had sought transport arrangement for 383 migrant workers, but only 49 workers turned up. In light of these submissions, he said that the petitioner should be asked to deposit the amount accruing for the transport of workers whose list they submit. He added the state would then refund the amount for workers who availed the facility as the state could not be made to incur losses. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as some states refused to allow workers to return, the state should ascertain the number of migrant workers wanting to return back and the state they belong to, and then contact the concerned state and find out whether the state was willing to allow trains to bring back workers. The court directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh to publicise the list after collating the information. The court also directed the state to file a detailed affidavit enumerating the grounds it had raised within seven days and directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder within a week after that and posted the matter for hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/reverse-migration-of-workers-has-started-no-need-for-shramik-specials-state-to-bombay-hc/story-8YXXcWIpTtagbXZ7u3TUhO.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||28% decline in home quarantine cases as Mumbai’s Covid-19 curve flattens||The number of individuals in home quarantine has declined by 28% in the last one month as the Covid-19 curve continues to flatten in Mumbai. Similarly, the number of those in institutional quarantine has decreased by 62% during the same period. Now, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed ward officers to close down vacant Covid care centres (CCC) as more than 90% are lying vacant.On July 4, 246,870 people were kept under home quarantine in Mumbai. This number decreased to 178,740 on August 4. During this period, 12,374 people were quarantined at private institutions like lodges, schools, colleges and hotels, among other facilities. By August 4, the number decreased to 4,674, as per data provided by BMC.Currently, with more cases of Covid-19 being reported from residential buildings, the civic body is focusing on quarantining people at home. “Earlier, we were getting infected cases from slums, and we had to isolate them at other places. Thus, we rented out hundreds of vacant places to keep them under institutional quarantine. But now, with the recovery in slums, the load on CCCs has decreased,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Till June, almost 60% of the beds under CCC-1 and CCC-2 facilities were occupied by high-risk contacts, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. But now, almost 92% of the beds are lying vacant in all the wards.Cumulatively, BMC has 72,656 beds in CCC facilities. Of this, only 6,065 beds are currently occupied. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nair Dental Hospital and in-charge of the jumbo centre at NESCO, Goregaon, said, “Due to overcrowding at slums, we didn’t have any option but to quarantine all the high-risk people along with the contacts of the infected people, in separate facilities. But now, as patients from residential buildings have enough space to maintain social distance from family members, we are allowing them to remain isolated at home.”BMC has instructed ward officers to hand over the vacant CCC facilities to their respective owners. “We will keep a certain number of beds in each ward as a precaution,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/28-decline-in-home-quarantine-cases-as-mumbai-s-covid-19-curve-flattens/story-iXdDhxU0kWl2RU58NVGT2M.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||State government scraps scheme to reduce farmer suicides||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to scrap Baliraja Chetana Abhiyan, a pilot project to counter distress among the agrarian community, and ultimately, reduce farmer suicides. However, the scheme failed to bring down suicides, following which the decision was taken, the relief and rehabilitation department said.“After taking a review of five years of progress, it was found that the scheme was not effective in giving desired results, as the number of farmer suicides has not declined. Hence, it has been decided to scrap the scheme,” the order states.The pilot project was started in Osmanabad and Yavatmal districts on July 24, 2015. It aimed at boosting the morale of distressed farmers in villages and to enable them to lead a responsible and purposeful life by the means of counselling and financial help. The project comprised 11 schemes under which the farmers were provided financial support for several requirements such as mass marriage, cancer treatment, preparation for competitive examinations, the first year of MBBS studies, accidental deaths etc. The state had also planned to extend the scheme to all the districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada region most affected with farmer suicides.“The scheme was started on an experimental basis and that too for two districts. Scrapping it now does not mean that it won’t be started again. We will be starting it in different districts this time. The decision on this is yet to be taken,” said Kishor Raje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.As per the statistics from Yavatmal districts, 386 farmers had died by suicide in 2015, the year the project was started. The cases dropped in 2016 and 2017 with 272 and 242 cases respectively. But again, rose to 255 cases in 2018 and 286 cases in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-government-scraps-scheme-to-reduce-farmer-suicides/story-IcC7P4vV1IaLoHkdW9VJXN.html

The car belongs to high court lawyer Ranjit Malhotra.On July 15, the single-judge bench of justice Jaishree Thakur had directed the administration to register the car within two weeks. The permission for the same had been denied in 2019.Malhotra had bought the car in 2019 from a counsellor of the European Union posted at Delhi for the vehicle’s body carried work by renowned Mexican artist Senkoe. “I opted for CH01 CB 0370 as I wanted something matching ‘PJE 37’, the number of our father’s car. This was the closest available,” said Malhotra. Earlier, the administration had even initiated the process of filing an appeal. “The case did not have any policy or monetary implications. So, it was decided by the administration to not file an appeal,” said UT’s senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/finally-car-with-artwork-gets-registration-number/story-8SqIIqLME9DVBsKGV99nVJ.html

06-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai readies for national cycle challenge||Cyclists may be in for a treat as Mumbai might soon experiment with setting up efficient cycling infrastructure in the city. The city’s civic body has registered for the Central government’s India Cycles4Change challenge and is looking at implementing a pilot project by October.Launched in July, the challenge aims to inspire cities to implement quick, cycle-friendly interventions in the wake of Covid-19, with the support of citizens and experts. At present, 95 cities have registered for the challenge, including Thane, Kalyan, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik, and Nagpur in Maharashtra.Organisations like World Resources Institute, Smart Commute Foundation (SCF), and Project Mumbai are assisting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the challenge. “We had our first meeting on Sunday, during which we decided to undertake a survey of how Mumbaiites travel and also identify roads where pop-up lanes can be introduced,” said Firoza Suresh, Mumbai’s bicycle mayor.Linking Road, Carter Road, Lokhandwala back-road, NCPA-Chowpatty, and Juhu 10th Road have already been shortlisted for the pilot project, and traffic and civic authority permissions are awaited to begin setting up the infrastructure.A BMC official, who is coordinating with various organisations for the program, said, “We have been looking at cycling as an alternative mode of transport since 2018. We are working on creating a cycle track along the Tansa pipeline, and cycling as a last-mile connectivity option from the upcoming Metro stations is also being planned.”According to the Central government’s Smart Cities Mission, the India Cycles4Change challenge, in stage one, cities will have to implement at least one pilot intervention. The mission will then shortlist 11 cities that will receive support to scale-up their plans with the aid of national and international experts.Parin Visariya, senior urban development associate at ITDP India Programme, which is the knowledge partner for the challenge, said that the main aim of the challenge is to implement quick cycling interventions. “We have also sent survey forms to cities to understand the state of cycling in cities and what stops citizens from opting for cycling,” Visariya said.According to a survey by ITDP India, cycling is expected to increase by 50-65% as cities come out of lockdown. World over, cities are leveraging this opportunity to expand their cycling networks and public-bike sharing systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-readies-for-national-cycle-challenge/story-QqHtJuJMBEqgj4hZiTIS7I.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||‘Trees along Konkan wildlife corridor felled for mining, infra’||Despite a ban on tree felling at the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi wildlife corridor in south Konkan, petitioners before the Bombay high court (HC) have alleged deforestation across 639.62 hectare (ha) for mining, construction of roads, and rubber plantations for over 10 years.Through successive orders over the past decade, the HC in 2012 and 2013, based on 2011 petition by Awaaz Foundation, had directed the Union environment ministry and Maharashtra government to ensure the 38 km-long and 10 km-wide corridor in Sindhudurg district to be protected as an eco-sensitive area (ESA) where environmentally destructive activities are prohibited. The HC had reiterated its order in 2018, based on a 2016 petition by NGO Vanashakti, declaring the belt a ‘no tree felling zone’.“The wildlife corridor is being steadily denuded. After brazen disobedience of HC orders, the state has chosen to do little to protect the region’s ecology. Repeated reminders to authorities have fallen on deaf ears. Our only hope is the judiciary to intervene again,” said Stalin D, director, Vanshakti.On Wednesday, the HC bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AS Gadkari, while hearing an interim application (IA) by Vanashakti through videoconferencing, directed the Union environment ministry to file their response regarding the steps taken to comply with previous HC orders. The matter has been kept for hearing on Friday.Parag Vyas, advocate appearing for the Centre told HC that the environment ministry would be finalising the Western Ghats eco-sensitive zone final notification by September. However, as per submissions by the petitioner and confirmation by the state forest department, the entire Dodamarg taluka and majority of Sawantwadi had been left out of the draft notification proposed by Maharashtra. “As far as the ESA declaration for this particular corridor is concerned, Maharashtra will have to inspect and submit a proposal demarcating the exact area proposed as ESA for the corridor,” Vyas said. The NGO’s affidavit alleged contempt by Central and state bodies for non-implementation of previous court orders for failing to declare the ESA even after seven years. The affidavit brought on record a March 2019 report highlighting deforestation across 639.62 ha area of the corridor, of which 229.38 ha or 35% green cover had been lost in Dodamarg taluka alone. The report used satellite images and assessed deforestation between 2009 - 2018. It further said tree felling across 52 villages in the corridor (26 in Dodamarg and 26 in Sawantwadi) had been undertaken across private lands for rubber and pineapple plantations, mining, procuring wood and construction of roads. Some villages had witnessed deforestation the size of 15 ha each. “Consequences of such rampant deforestation had come true upon the occurrence of a massive landslide in village Asaniye in Dodamarg on August 6, 2019,” the IA said.Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) said, “The state is committed to notify the proposed area as an ESA. We have appointed Wildlife Institute of India Dehradun to identify the exact coordinates and area of the corridor, which will be sent as a proposal to the state and then the Centre. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, execution of the study has been delayed.”Sushant Khandekar, sub-divisional officer, Sawantwadi said any cases of tree felling, even on private land was handled by the forest department that had identified a tree officer for such inspections.Sawantwadi deputy conservator of forest Samadhan Chavan said, “We had identified 76 major spots in both talukas where tree felling took place over 10 years mostly across private land. Cases have been filed in each case and fines collected. The process is ongoing. No tree felling has taken place on government or forest land since the HC’s 2018 order.” The HC bench on Wednesday also listed and clubbed another application (to be heard on Friday) filed by Awaaz Foundation that prayed for the completion of the ESA declaration process of the corridor as well as a restraint on mining.STATE RENEWED CONSENT FOR MINING IN CORRIDORThe Kolhapur regional office of the state pollution control board renewed an iron ore mining license at Kalne village in the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt last year. Operations to handle 7.5 lakh metric tons of iron ore per annum up till March 31, 2021 across 32.25-hectare area at Kalne, were allowed. Mining activity in the area led to the destruction of 32.2 ha green cover. MPCB had said mining operations were first issued permissions in 2009 much before the petition to protect the area had been filed, and renewing such consent is permissible for any proposed ecologically sensitive area as well.“There has been a conspiracy by vested interests since the Madhav Gadgil panel recommenced Sawantwadi-Dodamarg as an ESA banning mining. First, the vested interests diluted the Gadgil panel recommendations against the wishes of local people and ecologists. They then lobbied to exclude villages of this area from the proposed ESA contrary to HC orders,” said activist Kailash Anerao.WHAT’S AT STAKE AND WHY THE ESALocated in Sindhudurg district, Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt lies in the heart of the biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats. The area is a source of perennial water bodies. Dodamarg taluka has 62 villages while Sawantwadi has 82. The forest department had identified 25 biodiversity-rich villages within this corridor through a rapid assessment in 2013. According to the forest department, seven tigers were photographed at Dodamarg from 2014-2019 and there is evidence of 22-25 tigers using this landscape. The wildlife corridor is also home to leopards, elephants, and a host of biodiversity. It connects the Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur to Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka. It is an integral part of the Sahyadri-Konkan wildlife corridor through which several wild animals move. The 38kmx10km corridor is home to 303 plant species, 127 types of trees, 66 types of shrubs, 29 types of climbers, four types of bamboo, 15 kinds of grass and 99 types of medicinal plants. It also has leopards, sloth bears, wild buffalo, pangolins, king cobra, civet cats, and several residents and migratory bird species(Source: State forest department, petitions filed before the Bombay HC)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trees-along-konkan-wildlife-corridor-felled-for-mining-infra/story-UEnzWc1A9ZRmxkOKVOXllN.html
06-08-2020||City||Ludhiana gyms reopen to tepid response||With fear gripping the city amid rising cases of Covid-19, gyms opened to a tepid response on Wednesday with most of them wearing a deserted look.The owners who were allowed to reopen the gymnasiums after more than five months of lockdown said all precautions had been taken but residents were still fearful.Owner of Aura Gym in New BRS Nagar and president of Punjab Gym Welfare Society, Navneet Singh, said, “Very few residents turned up for a workout on Wednesday. We have taken all the necessary precautions including frequent sanitisation of the machines, thermal screening of visitors, checking with pulse oximeters etc. No one including the trainers is allowed to enter or exercise in the gym without a mask.” Navneet Singh said, “As per the guidelines issued by the government, the gym owners are not providing facilities like spa, sauna and swimming pool. Further we are also not organising high intensity group classes like aerobics and zumba. The others have also been advised to put the group classes at halt as it might spread the disease.Another gym owner in Model Town extension, Jagdish Sra, said, “Tepid response was expected. But we have been receiving calls from residents concerned over precautions being taken at the gym and it was expected that they would show up in the coming days. With this, the owners would at least be able to bear the fixed charges like electricity bills and rent, which were a burden on our shoulders during the lockdown.”ENTRY IN BATCHES TO AVOID CROWDINGFor avoiding crowding in gyms, the owners are now preparing batches for entry. Owner of a gym in Dugri market, Harpreet Singh, said, “The residents are slowly showing up at the gyms. I have already directed my staff to prepare batches. Customers will be allowed to exercise only at a particular time.”President of Gym Ekta Welfare Association Monu Bhardwaj said, “The government has allowed the owners to allow residents inside their gyms as per the capacity and area of the gym keeping in mind that a distance of 6 feet is maintained. We have advised gym owners to allow only 10-12 people at a time.”A resident of South City exercising at Aura Gym, Chanakya, said, “It was a new experience going back to gyms. But with the precautions being taken by owners, it was easy for us to exercise without any fear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-gyms-reopen-to-tepid-response/story-UGC6tVfhMxSNUm852PXn2H.html

06-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC advises Bihar IPS to use digital platforms for investigation||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday rejected Bihar Police officer Vinay Tiwari’s request to be exempted from home quarantine and advised Tiwari to use digital platforms to conduct his investigation while in isolation. Tiwari is in Mumbai in connection with a first information report (FIR) filed in Patna, regarding the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Tiwari reached Mumbai on August 2 and according to Bihar Police authorities, he was forcibly quarantined by BMC. On August 3, BMC issued a clarification that Tiwari was asked to quarantine as per the guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government to contain the spread of Covid-19. The civic body also said it had explained to Tiwari the procedure to apply for an exemption from home quarantine. Following this, Bihar Police had sought an exemption for the same from BMC. In response, BMC on Wednesday advised Tiwari to use digital platforms to pursue his investigation and asked Tiwari to follow the state’s Covid-19 guidelines. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu confirmed a letter had been sent to Bihar Police citing the prevalence of Covid-19 in Bihar and advising Tiwari to use digital platforms while quarantined. If Tiwari wishes to step out before the end of his quarantine, he must first get tested for Covid-19 and if the results are negative, he would be free to move around. Corporator Vinod Mishra, who is the leader of Bharatiya Janata Party in BMC, said, “I have written to the BMC commissioner regarding the matter. The reason to detain the said IPS officer proves malice behind the detention. Under no provisions of existing laws, directives, notifications such an order of undertaking investigations via digital platforms can be passed. This proves BMC administration is a puppet at the hands of the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-advises-bihar-ips-to-use-digital-platforms-for-investigation/story-OTcPXlZTvTiSzJULHmzWYK.html
06-08-2020||Chandigarh||BJP appoints Jat leader as in-charge for Baroda bypoll||The appointment of Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal, a Jat leader, as the BJP’s election in-charge for Baroda assembly bypoll on Tuesday is being seen as a step towards placating the majority Jat vote bank in the constituency. The election commission is yet to announce the schedule for the bypoll. Orders of his appointment were issued by BJP’s state office in-charge Gulshan Bhatia on the directions of Haryana BJP president Om Prakash Dhankar. Before Dalal’s appointment on Tuesday, Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, a Punjabi khatri, who was the party’s election in-charge for 2019 assembly polls, was ‘informally’ looking after the management for the impending bypoll, party sources said. Dalal’s appointment as poll in-charge is also significant in light of the acerbic remarks made two days ago by independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, a Jat leader himself. Kundu had on August 2 raked up the ‘Jat versus non-Jat’ issue at a meeting of Sarv Jatiya Sarv Khap mahapanchayat at Chichrana in Baroda. The outburst probably was enough to hasten Dalal’s appointment, political analysts say. MLA Kundu, who addressed the khap leaders, shamed the Jat gathering on Sunday about Sanjay Bhatia’s continuation as the BJP ‘in-charge’ for the Baroda assembly bypoll. “Yeh 52% ka halqa hai. Thaara prabhari kaun hai. Bhatia…. Doob ke mar jao. Apne lath tha lo. Mangan ki zaroorat koi naa... (This constituency has 52% Jat votes. And who is your in-charge? Bhatia (Sanjay). You should be ashamed. Get ready for a fight. There is no need to make requests for anything),” said Kundu, a former BJP worker who won from Meham assembly seat as an Independent after being denied a party ticket. State BJP chief Om Prakash Dhankar, however, said since the Karnal MP was also the party in-charge for Sonepat district, he was taking care of Baroda assembly seat. “Sanjay Bhatia will continue to look after the Baroda assembly constituency even now. However, agriculture minister JP Dalal will be the election in-charge,” Dhankar said in response to a query. Fifteen Jat candidates of the saffron party, including Dhankar, were routed during the 2019 assembly polls. Only five made it to the state assembly. Political analysts attributed this outright rejection by the Jat electorate, which constitutes about 25% of voters and are the single largest influencers, to the BJP’s approach of having a non-Jat chief minister at the helm. The state BJP recently replaced Subhash Barala, a Jat leader, as the state unit president with another Jat, Dhankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-appoints-jat-leader-as-in-charge-for-baroda-bypoll/story-STJ2ZcgUxunbYQc2TdnUfO.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Artis, prayers: Maha BJP celebrates Ayodhya Ram Mandir bhoomipujan||To mark the bhoomipujan of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) held celebrations at the party office on Wednesday, with the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis even breaking into a song popular during the 1992 rath yatra campaign. “This is a dream come true for many generations and of millions. It is a matter of great fortune and providence to be able to witness this historic moment,” said Fadnavis on the occasion. The former chief minister, along with state party chief Chandrakant Patil, national joint organizational secretary V Satish, state organisational secretary Vijay Puranik, former ministers Ashish Shelar and Vinod Tawde, present at the celebration, were among several others who had participated and witnessed the 1990s BJP movement for the Ram Mandir leading upto the Rath Yatra in 1992. The leaders worshipped the framed portrait of Lord Ram, saw the bhoomipujan being done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a grand screen and participated in a programme of bhajans organised on the occasion. “I have participated in all kar sevas, I am a Ram sevak and have been involved from Day one with the Ram Janmabhoomi. This is a dream come true. The temple was destroyed in 1522 back by a general of Babur to show us that they can destroy the culture of Hindus and even Lord Ram cannot save us. Now, after so many years, Lord Ram’s temple will now stand on the same very site. This is a beginning of new India and new identity for us,” said Fadnavis. While speaking to a TV channel, Fadnavis taunted the Shiv Sena saying it was surprising that only two parties, the Sena and All India Majlis-e-Ittehedul Muslimeen (AIMIM) had sought e-pujan for the Ram Mandir instead of a live event. “As a Hindutva party, how do you make a demand for just e-puja; this moment has come after 490 years. It’s an insult to people who have struggled, fought and lost their lives for the Ram Mandir campaign,” said Fadnavis. Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh also celebrated the day across the city and the state in localities and neighbourhoods by lighting diyas and organizing Lord Ram aartis in the evenings and reciting Hanuman Chalisa in the morning. “Even though the temples haven’t opened we are marking this auspicious occasion by lighting diyas outside our homes, while community events like reciting of Hanuman Chalisa and holding evening aartis is being carried out in housing societies, temple offices etc,’’ said Manoj Singh, RSS karyakarta from Goregaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/artis-prayers-maha-bjp-celebrates-ayodhya-ram-mandir-bhoomipujan/story-UIxrjfT99zatlizJucCCZK.html

The state expects the case to remain with Mumbai Police and plans to question Patna Police’s jurisdiction over the case as Rajput died in Mumbai on June 14. On Wednesday, while hearing a petition filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty regarding a first information report (FIR) filed in Patna that accuses her of abetting Rajput’s suicide, SC asked the Maharashtra government to file a status report on the investigation into Rajput’s death within the next three days. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told SC that the Centre had accepted the Bihar government’s recommendation and transferred the case to CBI. However, the Maharashtra government said the case remains with Mumbai Police. Advocate Sachin Patil, standing counsel for Maharashtra government in SC, said, “The SC will decide the legality of the transfer of the case to CBI on the recommendation of the Bihar government. Patna police has neither jurisdiction to register the complaint nor to investigate it.” Sanjay Kumar, state chief secretary, said, “All parties have been asked to file their say and we will file it in due course. Our argument will depend on the situation on that day and what is allowed by the Apex Court. I am not aware if the notification related to the transfer of the case has been issued by the Centre.” An official from the state home department said, “The case registered by Patna Police has been transferred, not the one Mumbai Police is investigating. We will continue to investigate our case.” Another official from the department said, “Maharashtra government appeared in court through caveat in the petition filed by Rhea Chakroborty. We will present the current status of the case, claiming how the investigation is moving in the right direction; has recorded statements of 56 persons; and that there is no need to transfer the case. We have been saying this from day one. Secondly, as per the provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure and a notification issued by the ministry of home affairs in 2013, the FIR should be registered at the place where the offence took place. Patna police registering the case and investigating it is bad in law and this will be argued in court.” According to the officials from the home department, SC is expected to take cognizance of the transfer of the case in the next hearing. “Due procedure has not been followed while transferring the case to CBI. Even if CBI takes over in the FIR already filed, the case will still have to be transferred to Mumbai,” said a home department official. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-clarity-on-transfer-of-rajput-case-to-cbi-says-state-after-sc-hearing/story-YsWVOfzox5Sy6XLWOnMe5J.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA can cut 357 mangroves for Metro station at Sewri, Bhakti Park: HC||The Bombay high court on Wednesday allowed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to cut 357 mangroves for construction of Metro piers at Sewri and Bhakti Park station for Metro line-4, that connects Wadala in eastern suburbs to Kasarwadavli on Ghodbunder road in Thane.The bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Riyaz Chagla allowed MMRDA to cut 357 mangroves primarily after noting that Metro line-4 is a project of “immense public importance for the public transport.”The bench also took into consideration that all requisite permissions for the Metro line are already granted by various statutory authorities.The relief, however, is not unconditional. The bench has directed MMRDA to comply with the conditions imposed by authorities while granting permissions. Those include compensatory fire station over a hectare of degraded mangroves forest at Gorai where the authority will have to plant 4,444 mangroves saplings, bear the cost of the nursery, cost of raising and maintenance of the plantation for 10 years.Bhakti Park station on Metro line-4, 48 piers on the alignment covering about 1,200 square meters pass through CRZ-2 and mangroves forests. Besides, MMRDA will also require to construct a temporary approach road for carrying out the construction work. It was required to move HC given earlier court directives prohibiting development work in mangroves forests and a 50-meter buffer zone around mangroves unless HC finds that the work is of considerable public importance.Apart from connecting Wadala and Ghodbunder road in Thane, Metro line-4 will also provide inter-connectivity with existing Eastern Express Highway, Central Railway stations, Monorail, Metro line-2B (connecting DN Nagar in Andheri with Mandale), Metro line-5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), Metro line-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-JVLR-SEEPZ-Kanjurmarg- Vikhroli, and Metro line-8 (Wadala-General Post Office).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-can-cut-357-mangroves-for-metro-station-at-sewri-bhakti-park-hc/story-0srhtnHCD45GufjfL2Ou7K.html

Twenty patients who recently recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have donated plasma at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak, 16 in Faridabad, 11 in Gurugram and two in Panchkula, reveal the data obtained from the four plasma banks.The convalescent plasma therapy has been given to 25 patients in Faridabad, 17 in Rohtak, five in Gurugram and two in Panchkula. Haryana’s first plasma bank was set up at ESIC hospital in Faridabad in the second week of July and since then, three more such banks have come up in Rohtak, Gurugram and Panchkula. Head of the medicine department at PGIMS, Dr VK Katyal, said they have been taking plasma from people aged between 18 and 60 on the basis of their health conditions.“This therapy is a boon for a Covid-19 patient, whose kidney and liver are damaged. We are treating a 39-year-old patient, who is suffering from a liver problem. He has shown significant improvement after two convalescent therapies,” he added.On being asked about tepid response to plasma donation in Haryana, state’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said 33% of the recovered patients have shown unwillingness to donate plasma.“Many recovered patients with kidney, heart, lung or liver diseases are not eligible for the donation. Moreover, women who have ever been pregnant and someone weighing less than 50kg are also barred from the donation,” he added.The nodal officer said nearly 17% of the recovered patients were found to be unfit for the donation as they suffered from various diseases. “About 10% recovered patients have given wrong details on helpline numbers introduced to enrol people for plasma donation. Many people are skipping donations so that they can offer it to their family members in the case they get infected. Few donors fear that they could witness side effects if they donate plasma,” Dr Chaudhary said. “A plasma donor should have normal weight, haemoglobin level above 12 and no history of diabetes or hypertension. Moreover, the donor should not have hepatitis B or C and HIV. The therapy will be administered to those with respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), oxygen saturation less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or pus in their lungs,” the doctor added.‘Want to save it for my father’A 23-year-old recovered patient from Rohtak, who refused to donate plasma, said, “My father is suffering from diabetes and I want to save the plasma for him in case he contracts the infection.”“I am the sole breadwinner of my family and I didn’t donate plasma for the fear of side effects. I took this decision as a precautionary measure for my family,” said a 36-year-old man from Jhajjar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fear-of-side-effects-keeps-plasma-donors-away-in-haryana/story-O5ZotlaR7tzFYBMBfCjJEK.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Sheena Bora case: CBI court rejects Indrani Mukerjea’s bail plea filed in December||The special CBI court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, prime accused in Sheena Bora murder case. This was her fifth bail plea where she alleged that false witnesses and evidence have been planted by the prosecution against her. Indrani had moved bail plea on merits of the case in December last year. In her plea, Indrani had listed contradictions in the prosecution’s case and alleged that she has been falsely implicated for murder of her daughter. The court has rejected her contentions at this stage of the trial. The court had recently rejected her plea for interim bail.Indrani alleged that the skeleton recovered by the Pen police in May 2012 is not the same one discovered by Khar police three years later in 2015. The prosecution has alleged that after removing parts of the skeleton for further investigation, the Pen police buried the body at the same place, in a pit. The same as per prosecution was exhumed by Khar police. The prosecution alleged that the body exhumed was that of Sheena as the DNA of the ‘skeleton’ is a match with Indrani. However, Indrani has disputed this and claimed the skeletons are different. Indrani also questioned the credibility of the key prosecution witnesses - Shyamwar Rai, a driver who also allegedly helped in killing Sheena; Kajal Sharma - who help in writing letters on behalf of Sheena after her death and her son Mikhail Bora.The prosecution opposed her plea and contended that this is not the stage to test the credibility and reliability of the witnesses. The prosecution had cited the deposition of Rai, Sharma and Mikhail to show involvement of Indrani. “The witnesses have clearly stated about how Indrani was involved in the planning of the murder, its execution and later also in the destruction of the evidence by destroying the body of Sheena,” the prosecution argued adding that the medical evidence had also supported the prosecution case and corroborated the evidence of the other witnesses.The prosecution contended that looking at the gravity of the offence and status of the accused, she should not be released on bail. “She is a British national, the possibility of her escaping from the country cannot be out,” prosecution submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-case-cbi-court-rejects-indrani-mukerjea-s-bail-plea-filed-in-december/story-c4V4ZRgvtkzQSyl26vFe0I.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Disha Salian death: Cops request citizens to share info; father alleges harassment||Two months after the death of talent manager Disha Salian, Mumbai Police issued an appeal on Wednesday, asking the public to share any information they have related to her passing. An investigation into Salian’s death is underway. Meanwhile, Salian’s father Satish has written to Mumbai Police, complaining of harassment and victimisation by the media. Salian is believed to have died by suicide on June 8, when she fell off the 14th floor of a building in Malad where she lived with her fiancé Rohan Roy. So far, the police has recorded statements of Salian’s family, friends and the guards at the building. Vishal Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (zone 11), said, “We can’t say how she fell. Our investigation is on. Many people have been sharing information related to Salian on social media because of which we are appealing to all citizens to share any information they have related to her death so that we can also investigate in that direction.” Citizens with information concerning Salian’s death can contact the offices of Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner of police (north region); Thakur, Dilip Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Malwani division); or Jagdeo Kalapad, senior inspector of Malwani police station. Rumours about Salian have been circulating on social and news media over the past few weeks. On Wednesday, Salian’s father Satish wrote to Yadav, complaining of harassment. Previously, Satish had submitted a written complaint on July 13 alleging his daughter was being defamed on social media. In his letter, Satish alleged his family is being harassed by the media that is reporting “misleading news”, which could hinder the police inquiry. He also wrote that Salian’s family does not suspect anyone of foul play in her death. “News about her involvement with any politician or attending parties with big names of film fraternity, rape, murder are all stories cooked by these media people just to sell it to channels. These stories hold no truth. These are misleading the people and tarnishing my daughter’s reputation and my family’s reputation. These fake news are taking a huge toll on my family, health and we are being victimized by the media. We are completely satisfied with the investigations being conducted by Mumbai Police and have faith in them,” Satish wrote in his letter. Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner of police (north region), confirmed the police has received Satish’s letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/disha-salian-death-cops-request-citizens-to-share-info-father-alleges-harassment/story-eN7EGoN7GO38FpmJ1ixAFI.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||South Mumbai receives highest 24-hour August rainfall; strong winds cause chaos||Heavy rain and strong winds for a second consecutive day brought chaos to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Wednesday as trees fell, signages of buildings were blown away and waterlogging on roads and railways tracks caused disruptions. The downpour, however, helped Mumbai cross its seasonal average rainfall figure with two months of the monsoon season still remaining. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 293.8mm rain in 12 hours (8.30am to 8.30pm Wednesday), which is the highest ever in August even for a 24-hour period since 1974, when records began to be kept, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The previous 24-hour highest rainfall was 261.9mm recorded on August 10, 1998.Maximum wind speed over the city was higher than that recorded when cyclone Nisarga had brushed past Mumbai in June. The wind speed recorded at Colaba was between 70kmph and 80kmph, which increased up to 107kmph between 5pm and 5.15pm. The wind speed recorded during cyclone Nisarga was 92kmph. The normal wind speed for Mumbai is between 10kmph and 15kmph during rainy days and between 25kmph and 30kmph on heavy rain days.The city has so far received 2,366mm rain between June 1 and August 5 (8.30pm) against its seasonal average of 2066mm. The Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs, has recorded 2,356.9mm rain during the same period against its seasonal average of 2260.4mm. In 59 hours till 8.30pm on Wednesday, the city has received 456mm rain. The weather bureau, however, said rain intensity is likely to reduce from Thursday and a yellow alert (heavy rain in isolated areas) has been issued after two days of red alert. “South Mumbai witnessed 30-50mm rain per hour, falling under the very intense rain spell category, on Wednesday. The low pressure area over north Bay of Bengal adjoining Odisha draws winds (pull-effect) from the Arabian Sea over coastal areas, and the upper air cyclonic circulation over parts of south Gujarat. Both activate strong monsoon conditions. These high speed winds characterise the intensity over coastal areas,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, adding that the systems draw moisture from the sea, leading to convective cloud formation, which intensified over south Mumbai and later moved towards the suburbs. “Although similar weather conditions will last till Wednesday night, the situation is likely to improve on Thursday.”Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet, said, “The formation of such convective clouds (10-14km above mean-sea level) witnessed over south Mumbai on Wednesday was a rare event. We are witnessing such events, where convective clouds are dissipating and regenerating continuously due to overall changing weather patterns. This is a pre- or post-monsoon type rain phenomenon capable of giving high speed surface winds drawing continuous moisture from the sea.” Independent meteorologists said the wind pattern exhibited anti-clockwise nature due to a vortex formation (spinning column of air caused by weather factors enhancing monsoon conditions). “This brought rain clouds and pushed them to move over south Mumbai. They weakened rapidly after crossing south Mumbai, thereby leading to less rain over the suburbs,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, water stock across seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai was 35% of the required amount. It was 90% last year by this time. “With very heavy showers underway over these areas, we expect improvement in levels over the next 48 hours,” said an official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Deoras said Thursday evening onwards the weather in Mumbai region would stabilise. “No severe weather threat is expected during the weekend since at the most intermittent light showers are possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/strong-winds-cause-chaos-downpour-helps-mumbai-cross-season-s-avg-rainfall/story-gShCQOm7JJOwPipDZ4SdzO.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha crosses 300,000 Covid recoveries; toll is 16,476||Maharashtra crossed the 300,000 mark of Covid-19 recoveries on Wednesday after 6,165 patients recovered from the virus in a day, taking the state’s tally to 305,521. The state had reported 12,326 recoveries on Tuesday, the highest so far since the first case was reported on March 9. The state also reported 334 Covid-19 fatalities on Wednesday, the highest so far in a day, taking the state’s toll to 16,476. However, according to the state health department, of the 334 deaths, 242 were from the past 48 hours, 60 are from last week and 32 from the period before last week. Covid cases in the state rose to 468,265 after 10,309 infections were recorded on Wednesday, pushing up the tally of active cases to 145,961. In four days before Wednesday, the number of recovered patients each day had been more than the daily case load. The number of recovered patients on August 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 10,725, 9,926, 10,221 and 12,326 against 9,601, 9,509 and 8,968 and 7,760 fresh cases, respectively. This has helped in pushing up the recovery rate of the state to 65.25% from 59.84% on July 29 and 54.08% on July 5. The national recovery rate stands at 67.19%.Officials said the process of flattening of the curve has begun. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading the communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee of the state, said, “Plateauing [of cases] has started in Maharashtra according to my reading. But we will have to wait for another 12-14 days as more relaxations have been come into force only today [Wednesday]. We will have to see the number of new cases during this incubation period (14 days) and only then we can arrive at a conclusion.”Last week, the state health minister Rajesh Tope, too, had said the peak has arrived and cases will hit a plateau by mid-August. “In my view, the peak has arrived and cases will continue to rise for another 15 days. We are expecting a plateau or flattening of the curve somewhere around August 15. Once we hit the plateau, cases will start declining,” Tope said.The state government has allowed malls and market complexes to operate between 9am and 7pm from Wednesday. It has further allowed outdoor non-team sports such as golf, gymnastics, tennis, badminton and malkhamb with conditions of social distancing and sanitation.Mumbai, meanwhile, has maintained stability in daily fresh cases with 1,125 cases reported on Wednesday. Its case count stands at 119,240. Of these, 20,679 are active cases.On Tuesday, the city had recorded 709 cases, second-lowest spike since May 12, when it recorded just 426 cases. The city’s toll stands at 6,591, after 42 deaths were reported on Wednesday.Pune continued to contribute maximum cases in the daily tally, as it recorded 1,282 cases on Wednesday, taking its total infections to 65,136. Pimpri Chinchwad, satellite city in the Pune Metropolitan Region, recorded 740 cases and is the third highest contributor in the state.The state, meanwhile, continues to struggle with high fatalities. As many as 1,482 deaths have been reported in the past five days as against 6,988 deaths in entire July, 5,638 in June, 2,286 in May, 449 in April and 10 in March. With 16,476 total deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state is 3.52% as on Wednesday. It continues to be second highest in the country after Gujarat, where CFR is 3.86% with 2,533 deaths (65,599 cases) till Tuesday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department. Maharashtra, however, still has highest number of deaths across states in the country.The state’s positive rate stands at 19.40%, up from 18.57% on July 5. So far, the state has tested over 2,413,510 people, and of them, 1,945,245 have tested negative. Currently, 36,466 people have been kept at institutional quarantine facilities and 943,658 people have been home quarantined across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-crosses-300-000-covid-recoveries-toll-is-16-476/story-As4R1f5PIKot3Hducdt9wJ.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Slums see surge in Covid patients who are not high-risk contacts: BMC||From June-end to the first week of August, the city’s slums have seen a 53% rise – 6,174 on August 3 from 4,041 on June 29 – in the number of Covid patients, who are not high-risk contacts of earlier positive cases or those whose source is not yet identified, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) revealed. BMC officials denied the possibility of community transmission, wherein people get infected, even if they are not in contact with an infected person, stating the source in the 6,174 cases is in a way interlinked with the earlier positive cases, but it has not been able to establish it. Of the 6,174 cases, 3,370 cases are from slums in the suburbs – Kurla (545), Malad (544), Dahisar (536), Andheri West (628), Mulund (524) and Bhandup (593). Areas such as Bandra West and Bandra East have only 44 and 31 such cases, respectively, followed by Marine Lines and Dongri with 44 and 21 cases, respectively. A senior BMC official from the public health department said, “The spread in those who are not high-risk contacts of those testing positive is due to layers of contacts or via common touch points. There is no community transmission in the city, and also community transmission cannot be announced by BMC, but only by the state or Central government.” Manish Valanju, assistant municipal commissioner of L Ward that covers Kurla, said, “We are tracing 19 high-risk contacts behind every positive case in slums. However, we cannot trace and quarantine every person in the vicinity, considering many also come under the bracket of low-risk contact. It is possible that these people have got infected through common touch points. Also, many times those testing positive in slums do not give information about their high-risk contacts.” Kishore Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner of T Ward that covers Mulund, said, “In slums, many do not give correct information due to stigma. On a daily basis hundreds use the same toilet that a positive patient might end up using. We trace maximum closest contacts from slums, but not all.” BMC had launched an initiative, ‘Chase the Virus’, on May 26. Among other targets, ward officers were given the task of tracing or “chasing” maximum contacts of Covid-19 patients, moving them to institutional quarantine facilities, and breaking their contact with the community around them. From the earlier target of 10 high-risk contacts for every one Covid-19 patient, BMC increased it to 15. Currently, on an average, BMC is tracing up to 10 to 20 high-risk contacts per positive patient across the city. Overall, BMC has traced 19.95 lakh contacts, of which 7.05 lakh are at high risk. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant from the city, said, “If those testing positive in slums are not high-risk contacts of Covid patients, there is a possibility that they are low-risk contacts. In this case, we need to monitor the low-risk contacts, too, for symptoms, considering there is a possibility of them carrying the virus further, especially with the relaxations.” Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,125 fresh cases and 42 new deaths, taking the city’s tally to 119,240 and toll to 6,591. The number of discharged patients in Mumbai was 91,673 with a recovery rate of 76.88%, and active cases stood at 20,679. The fatality rate was 5.52%, and the doubling rate 80 days. Dharavi, an earlier hot spot, recorded only one new case, bringing the area’s case count to 2,589, of which 2,254 have been discharged. On August 4, Mumbai conducted 7,244 tests, taking the total tests to 5.67 lakh, with an overall positivity rate of 20.83%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/slums-see-surge-in-covid-patients-who-are-not-high-risk-contacts-bmc/story-eh39NZLPLlPppL5QZLKAyI.html
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Spice-based formula can target the Sars-Cov-2 virus in 60 minutes, claims IIT-B||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) have developed a spice-based formulation that rendered the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid -19 inactive within an hour, in laboratory tests. Dr Rinti Banerjee’s group at IIT-B’s department of biosciences and bioengineering validated the efficacy of the nutraceutical and phytopharmaceutical formulation called Picovrid, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR is globally considered a gold standard test for Covid-19. The tests were done at the civic-run Kasturba Hospital, which was among the first facilities to treat Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra. “The active ingredients in our formulation have a direct action in disrupting lipid and protein layers, degrading the outer lipid envelope of Sars-Cov-2, thus inactivating the virus,” said Banerjee, a Madhuri Sinha chair professor. Picovrid as a nutraceutical comprises constituents that are approved and within limits laid down by the Food Safety Standards and Authority of India (FSSAI). As a phytopharmaceutical, Picovrid-P contains approved Ayurvedic spices and natural emulsifiers, which are above food limits but at doses that are one-tenth of those found in conventional Ayurvedic formulations. Picovrid is available in the form of an oral syrup, herbal water, flavoured beverages, oral liquid shot, capsules, gels, infusion bag of herbal tea, flavoured milk and yogurt. The team has filed a patent application for the two technologies. A manuscript about the technology is also being prepared for publication in international journals. Having tested the formulation against Covid-19 positive swab samples with success, the team undertook a pre-clinical evaluation of Picovrid on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced lung injury in rats. Globally, LPS-induced lung injury is among the most commonly-used rodent models for studies on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A viewpoint article published in the medical journal Lancet in July stated that the Covid-19 pandemic has witnessed an increase in patients with ARDS in intensive care units across the world. Introducing one dose of Picovrid in LPS-induced lung injury in rats showed a significant reduction in the levels of bronchoalveolar IL6, which is a complication that Covid-19 patients develop. Banerjee’s lab has developed various technologies for respiratory diseases, including ARDS, over the years. The team said Picovrid has a multi-pronged strategy – immune boosting, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory. “As an anti-viral, Picovrid directly inactivates the virus and is therefore useful for early Covid-19 cases. As a prophylactic, it can be of use for those at risk of being exposed. As an anti-inflammatory, our formulation is useful for those progressing towards severe disease because it reduces IL6 levels and reduces the cytokine storm associated with complications of Covid-19 which is a leading cause of mortality.” said Banerjee. As a nutraceutical, the technology is ready for commercialisation and is available for licensing. As an Ayurvedic formulation, since all actives are already approved as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopoiea and texts, the technology has the advantage of a short timeline to commercialisation with phase III integrated clinical trials according to AYUSH guidelines unlike the longer path of three stage trials for new chemical entities, new drugs or vaccines. Talks are ongoing for clinical trials, which may be conducted post-licensing over the next two months. Nagpur-based Government Medical College is one of the locations where a clinical trial has been registered with Clinical Trials Registry – India (CTRI). “It [the formulation] definitely holds promise. It looks very good with the information we have at this point. But let’s get a feel of what it looks like in the clinical trial phase. However, I think it will do very well there,” said Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease specialist and a member of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce, who was not involved in developing the technology. Banerjee said the technology is also affordable because a 14-day course is expected to cost around ₹300 in comparison to current drugs that cost in the range of ₹9,000 to ₹44,000. “The pre-clinical results are very promising, and if clinical trials of the technologies validate the pre-clinical findings, the formulations hold promise in different forms for prophylaxis on one hand and as a two-pronged affordable therapy for Covid-19, addressing requirements of both antiviral effects and cytokine reduction, on the other,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/spice-based-formula-can-target-the-sars-cov-2-virus-in-60-minutes-claims-iit-b/story-e3cYueJVJAWxfNsxlF0mIN.html
06-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s active cases lowest in two months||At 725, the number of active cases in Gurugram is the lowest in the last two months, according to district-level data. Officials attribute the decline in the number of active cases to increased testing and high recovery rate.Data shows that on June 2, the total number of active cases in Gurugram was 775 when the total case count was 1,063. With a test positivity rate of almost 37% at the time, the cases grew exponentially and in the first week, it crossed the 1,500 mark. For the next many days, almost 130 to 230 new cases were being reported. By June 16, the active cases had climbed to 1,722 with the total case load of 3,682. In July, however, a decline was visible as the daily growth rate of cases in the month reduced to 1.7%, which in June was 12.6%.The number of active cases was 1,091 on July 29, which came down to 991 by July 30, further to 883 on August 2 and finally to 757 on August 4. Health officials said that in the last one week, less than 100 new cases were reported every day. Dr. Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, said, “Samples of nearly 2000-2500 people are being collected daily but not too many people test positive. On Tuesday, at least ,2519 samples were collected, for 1,466 antigen tests and the rest for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Out of the total samples, only 68 were positive. Within a week’s time, the active cases can come down to 500.”Another reason for decline in active cases is high recovery rate, according to Ram Prakash. Gurugram’s current recovery rate is over 90%. “Not many patients are sick. Patients are mostly asymptomatic, home isolated and are easily getting recovered,” he said. In the last one week, per day recovery numbers exceeded the new cases, showing its impact on the active cases figure.Dr. Virender Singh, chief medical officer, said, “The test positivity rate has come down due to increased surveillance and testing. It is less than 8%. Every day more than 2000 tests are being conducted to identify new cases. Special focus on worst affected areas also helped in the declining numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/active-cases-lowest-in-two-months/story-WjQKaLzDTYM8amDGCWXZYK.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||12-year-old battles for life after being sexually assaulted, stabbed multiple times||A 12-year-old girl is battling for her life at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) after she was allegedly sexually assaulted inside her home before being stabbed multiple times with a pair of scissors on Tuesday, the police said. Police are yet to identify or nab the alleged perpetrator(s). A case of attempt to murder and sexual assault under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has been registered at the Paschim Vihar West police station, a Delhi Police spokesperson said. Police said the girl’s parents and sister work at a nearby garment factory. They had gone to work and the girl was alone in the single-room house when the crime took place. The building where the family lives has many rooms which have been rented out to other people, mostly factory workers. Police are questioning her neighbours. “Investigators are questioning people living in the building and the neighbourhood as well. Since the crime took place in a room, the role of someone she knew has not been ruled out. The CCTV cameras installed in the neighbourhood are also being scanned for clues,” the spokesperson said. Joint commissioner of police (western range) Shalini Singh said the crime was reported to police control room around 5.30pm Tuesday by a neighbour who spotted the injured teenager coming out of her home.  An investigating officer, who did not want to be named, said a police team was dispatched and the personnel rushed the critically injured girl to a nearby government hospital. But on ascertaining her serious condition, doctors there referred her to AIIMS. The police officer said according to neighbours,they had found the girl, drenched in blood, walking out of the single room accommodation. “They said the child fell unconscious before she could tell them anything. There was a deep stab wound to her head apart from other injuries to her abdomen and other parts of the body,” the officer said. When the police team went inside, they found blood splattered all over the room and a bloodstained pair of scissors on the floor. A sewing machine in the room suggested that the alleged perpetrator(s) used the pair of scissors kept there to attack her. “Prime facie, it appears that the suspect used the pair of scissors to try and kill the girl. The exact sequence of events can be ascertained only when we record the girl’s statement or after we nab and question the suspect(s),” the officer said. On Wednesday, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) took suo motu cognizance of the crime and issued a notice to the station house officer (SHO) of Paschim VIhar police station, demanding by August 8 a copy of the first information report (FIR), detailed action taken report and other information related to the case. “Reportedly, the girl was brutally raped and the culprit(s) tried to kill her. Presently, she is fighting for her life in AIIMS, Delhi. It is reported that she was attacked with blunt objects and has injuries all over her body. This is a very serious matter,” the notice, signed by DCW chief Swati Maliwal, read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/12-year-old-battles-for-life-after-being-sexually-assaulted-stabbed-multiple-times/story-mFrppTZ02buEksrqkSSpzN.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||25-year-old stabbed to death, friend injured while fighting robbers in Tilak Nagar||New Delhi: A 25-year-old man was stabbed to death and his friend suffered critical injuries while fighting three masked bike-borne robbers on the street near a public park in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar on Tuesday night. Both of them were stabbed in their thighs, apparently with a knife by the assailants, who robbed them of their laptop, Rs 45,000 cash and a cell phone, police said on Wednesday. One of the victims, Ranjan Mishra,25, ran for nearly 100 metres on the road to save his life by hiding at a dark spot behind the park. Police suspect he bled to death, while his friend Dheeraj (identified only by his single name in police records) was rescued from the spot by three passersby, who admitted him to a hospital.A police officer associated with the investigation said it seems that the two friends had a scuffle with the robbers. “Mishra was stabbed in his right thigh and Dheeraj on his left thigh. Mishra died of excessive bleeding. A case of murder, attempt to murder and armed robbery has been registered,” he said. Police said they were scanning CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood for clues about the suspects.Ranjan and Dheeraj worked in a private company but lost their jobs due to Covid-19 pandemic and had recently started a business of delivering products of a leading food and beverage company from their office in Vishnu Garden, police said. The two lived in a rented home in Sagarpur area.“We only found one injured man (Dheeraj) on the road and did not know that his friend was also attacked and he was hiding behind the park. Dheeraj fell unconscious in the car before he could tell us about his friend (Ranjan Mishra). If we knew about him, we would have taken him to the hospital too,” said Ashish Vohra, who along with two friends and a local resident rushed Dheeraj to Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital in their car.  Vohra, a property dealer who lives in Tilak Nagar, said he was returning home with his friends – Deepak Chopra and Amit Dhawan – after attending a birthday celebration in Kirti Nagar. “When we reached near the park, we saw three men whose faces were covered with white towel fleeing on a bike, brandishing firearms or knives. As we turned on the road towards my home, we spotted a man bleeding on the road signalling for help. His scooter was lying nearby,” said Vohra. The three friends stepped out of the car. Dheeraj fell unconscious after just telling them that he has been robbed. A local resident reached the spot and the four rushed Dheeraj to DDU hospital after informing the police. “While the doctors were administrating life-saving injections and medicines to the injured men, the police brought another injured man almost half an hour later. The second man was declared brought dead due to excessive bleeding. The policemen told us that the other victim was found near the park, nearly 100m away from the spot where we had found his injured friend,” Vohra added.  Mishra belonged to Samastipur in Bihar and is survived by his parents, wife and a six-month-old child. He had returned from his home town a week ago, Mishra’s brother-in-law Hari Krishna told the police.Joint commissioner of police (western range) Shalini Singh praised the effort of Vohra and his friends and said that Dheeraj may also have died due to excessive bleeding had he not been taken to the hospital in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-year-old-stabbed-to-death-friend-injured-while-fighting-robbers-in-tilak-nagar/story-qXJcQKTbINpYTvptjwyg1J.html

While the suspect was conscious when police officers reached the crime spot, he fell unconsciousness minutes later, and died in a hospital later that day.Police identified the couple as Mohammad Hashim (28), who was a motor mechanic and Minnat Khatoon (25), a homemaker.The alleged murderer Mohammad Mushtaq, an e-rickshaw driver, stabbed the two multiple times with a meat cleaver, killing them on the spot, said a senior police officer associated with the investigations.According to the police, the two families often quarrelled over minor domestic matters such as disposing waste water and garbage outside their houses. The police also said that the murdered man and the alleged killer had a heated argument on Saturday, after their vehicles collided. The senior officer the alleged murdered was alive when police reached the scene after a neighbour informed them of the attack.A case of murder was registered at Narela police station based on the neighbour’s statement.“We caught him from the terrace of his house and were interrogating him when we saw him frothing from his mouth.

06-08-2020||Gurugram||Woman battling for life after former classmate stabs her 30 times||A 23-year-old woman was stabbed 30 times allegedly by a former classmate at her house in Sector 14 on Tuesday night. The woman, who suffered injuries on her ear, neck, chest, and stomach in the attack, was rushed to a private hospital in the city and later referred to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. A surgery was performed on her but her condition was still stated to be critical, said police on Wednesday evening. The suspect was arrested from the spot. He was produced before a court on Wednesday and granted bail.The police said the incident took place around 9.30 pm on Tuesday, shortly after the victim had returned with her husband from her parents’ house in Delhi. The suspect , identified as Vivek Kondal, reportedly came to the woman’s house on a motorcycle and knocked at here door. He then entered the house and asked her in-laws to call the woman. He told them that he wanted to talk to her urgently regarding some serious issue. As soon as the woman came out, Kondal pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed her 30 times. The father-in-law of the woman jumped in and tried to save her, and in the process sustained injuries. He immediately raised the alarm, following which some neighbours gathered and caught hold of Kondal and informed police control room. The woman’s husband was taking a bath at the time of the incident, police said.Police commissioner KK Rao said that Kondal and the victim were classmates at a college in Delhi University and the man had been stalking her since then. “The woman has received at least 30 stab wounds. Kondal has told the police that he thought the woman was also fond of him, but when he approached her last December, she turned down his proposal and made fun of him,” Rao said. He allegedly told investigators that he was angry that she had rejected his advances multiple times and got married instead to a Gurugram-based man in February. Kondal, police said, is a resident of Delhi and a student of postgraduation. A case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 452 (house-trespass) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Sector 14 police station. Investigators claimed that Kondal was also injured as he fell down while trying to flee. Later, he was caught hold of and assaulted by locals before being handed over to the police. “We are checking if the suspect has a criminal history and from where he procured the knife. We are also investigating if he was involved in similar cases in the past. During questioning, he told the investigating officer that he had approached her several times, but she would turn him down saying that she was not interested in getting married to him and always advised him to study well. Earlier also, he had clashed with the woman’s parents and had broken the window panes of their house in Delhi in a fit of rage,” said Rao. The father-in-law of the woman said that he has suffered injuries while trying to save the woman. “We are not aware if Kondal was stalking my daughter-in-law and that he would attack her. We are still under trauma due to this incident and scared of sending our son out of the house, even for work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-battling-for-life-after-former-classmate-stabs-her-30-times/story-CNGSGfGNNnjFB34tBUyQhJ.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi traders festoon markets, light lamps to celebrate Ram temple in Ayodhya||Markets in different parts of the national capital Wednesday set up large LED screens to play the live telecast of the groundbreaking ceremony of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya. Most of these markets, which have remained more or less deserted owing to social distancing norms that are in place on account of Covid-19 pandemic, donned a festive look and were festooned with brightly coloured lights, balloons and decorative pieces. The market associations also used their social media groups to urge residents to light lamps to mark the occasion and also distributed sweets among shoppers. People gathered in front of the LED screens at the markets of Greater Kailash-1 M Block, Green Park, Kailash Colony, Krishna Nagar, and Ashok Vihar to watch Prime Minister Narendra Modi lay the foundation stone to formally mark the beginning of the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which is round 600km from Delhi. Large banners and hoardings of Lord Ram and the proposed temple were spotted at these markets. The Rani Jhansi Road near the Jhandewalan temple in North Delhi was dotted with saffron flags. Traders at Sadar Bazar, Chandni Chowk, and Khari Baoli markets too had put up saffron flags and large cut-outs of Lord Ram to mark the occasion. Rajendra Sharda, president, GK-1 M Block market association, said, “Around 100-150 people gathered in the morning to watch the live telecast. We distributed 250 packets of laddoos (sweets) as prasad after the telecast. It was a great feeing to see the event bring together people from all walks of life even during the pandemic. We took care of social distancing norms during the programme.” At many places in Old Delhi, traders organised special aartis (rituals) and lighting of lamps. On the Church Mission Road, traders performed an aarti. At the Krishna Bazar Chowk, conch shells were blown just as the rituals of the groundbreaking ceremony began in Ayodhya. Members of Green Park residents’ welfare association (RWA) said they had raised concerns over the setting up of a screen by the market association amid the Covid-19 situation. “We had taken up the matter with the police and the area subdivisional magistrate and urged them that a gathering must be avoided at this time. But the rain played spoilsport and not many could gather on Wednesday,” said Lalit Kumar, general secretary, Green Park RAW. In Vasant Kunj Sector A, residents invited a bhajan (prayer songs) singer to the small community event at the neighbourhood temple. “We have organised a “bhajan sandhya” from 7pm-9pm to celebrate this historic moment. Also, we have ordered around 500 earthen lamps and residents have been urged to come out and light them,” said Amit Aggarwal, member, Vasant Kunj Sector A RWA. Suresh Goel, 70, a resident of Vasant Vihar recalled the 1990s and the tension that had flared between communities after the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6, 1992. “I have been able to witness both events during my lifetime. Delhi was on high alert then. After decades, the temple is being built, which is a moment of joy for all of us,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-traders-festoon-markets-light-lamps-to-celebrate-ram-temple-in-ayodhya/story-6V2twE5ZR3ps3iTPe04HwL.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||Restrictions imposed at JNU non-teaching staff complex after 30 test positive for Covid-19||The South Delhi district administration on Wednesday organised a compulsory Covid-19 testing camp at a housing complex for non-teaching staff inside the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus after at least 30 residents tested positive for the virus in the last two weeks. The university had restricted movement at the Saraswatipuram housing complex last week. JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said they had organised another testing camp with the south district administration’s help on July 23. “Around 30 persons tested positive from Saraswatipuram, a housing complex for non-teaching staff. The district administration asked us to restrict movement in the complex completely. Some students have also tested positive. The university has sent them to AIIMS Jhajjar for quarantine.” Kumar said at least 40 Covid-19 positive cases have been reported in the university to date, including both students and staff. “Sawaswatipuram had majority of the cases because the children of many staff members work outside the campus,” he said. In an order issued on July 29, Kumar said, “In view of the increasing number of cases of Covid-19 in the university, a visit was made by a Rapid Response team on July 24. The areas affected were Saraswatipuram, Poorvanchal, Paschimabad, and Dakshinapuram. Maximum clustering of cases were seen in block number 2, 5, 6 and 7 of Saraswatipuram and it has been decided to restrict the area. No moment should be allowed.” The movement in the complex that has around 272 houses will remain restricted till August 11, the order said. Pranjal Patil, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Vasant Vihar, said the district administration had written to the university to restrict the area around Saraswatipuram. “The university had then requested us to conduct another round of antigen testing on Wednesday. We did not send any staff to the campus since university has its own security team and they are taking care of people quarantined at the campus. We are closely monitoring the situation,” she said. As a precautionary measure, JNU has installed barricades at several locations in the housing complex and security guards are being assigned round the clock. “The university has given the responsibility of taking care of the residents at the complex to its security officials. We have shared the numbers of security personnel with the residents and they can directly contact them for groceries and other essential stuff,” the registrar said. A senior security official at JNU, who wished not to be named, said, “The housing complex is like a small containment zone inside our campus. The security personnel are working round the clock to help residents. We make regular announcements requesting residents not to step out and maintain social distance at home as well.” The university has advised students to avoid non-essential movement in the campus and asked residents aged above 60 and below 10 to stay indoors. Students have been advised against inviting outsiders. On July 7, two students had tested positive in Periyar hostel, following which the hostel was sealed and around 50 students were isolated for 14 days. The hostel has now been de-sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restrictions-imposed-at-jnu-non-teaching-staff-complex-after-30-test-ve/story-0yUgUncCrgWZGyxvNfXuoM.html
06-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt panels suggest ways to hospitals to bring down Covid deaths||Equipping Covid-19 wards with more high-flow nasal oxygen systems, scaling up plasma therapy administration in earlier stages of treatment, early transfer of severe patients to intensive care units (ICUs), and preparing for a ICU bed augmentation strategy for a potential second wave of the pandemic – these are some of the suggestions submitted to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Wednesday by committees set up by him to monitor Covid-19 mortality rate in hospitals.The government, however, did not share any data from the findings of the committee. A senior official said that the report is being further analysed and more inputs would be shared in a few days.Last week, the chief minister’s office had shared data which suggested that Covid-19 deaths in the city had dropped by 44.50% between July 1 and 12 compared to the corresponding period in June, citing data summarised from records of the health department.On July 30, the chief minister set up four committees to look into Covid deaths more specifically covering 10 hospitals – both public and private – that include Lok Nayak Hospital, GTB Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, Max East & West, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, RML Hospital, Jaipur Golden Hospital, Sir Balaji Action Medical Institute, Escorts, and St. Stephen’s Hospital.“The CM on Wednesday convened a meeting with the committees which were constituted last month to inspect the 10 hospitals (government and private) in the city with the highest mortality rate, and give hospital-wise recommendations on following standard operating procedures and protocols. In the meeting, each of the four committees submitted their reports and presented recommendations to the CM Arvind Kejriwal, to induce measures for the betterment of Covid patient care services and reducing mortality rate in the hospitals,” said Kejriwal’s office in a statement.As per the summary of the reports shared by the CM’s office specifying hospital-wise recommendations to reduce mortality rate, the GTB Hospital was suggested to equip Covid wards with high-flow nasal oxygen systems and scaling up of convalescent plasma therapy. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) systems is a supportive facility administered to Covid-19 patients for enhanced oxygen supply and control of the respiratory rate.For Safdarjung Hospital, which comes under the central government, and Lok Nayak Hospital, which is Delhi government’s biggest covid hospital, the committees recommended developing of early warning scorecards to ensure prompt detection and shifting of patients from the wards to the critical areas and high-risk cases to be transferred to ICU at the earliest sign of deterioration.For Safdarjung Hospital, the committees also opined that the number of covid ICU beds should be increased in case there is a second wave.For three private hospitals in the city, which include the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute and Jaipur Golden Hospital, the committee suggested that they should ensure early detection of complications in patients on prolonged ventilation and management as per protocols and more timely application of HFNO.“The CM reiterated on Wednesday that all steps should be taken to bring Covid deaths to zero. During the inspection by the committees, it was found that the death rate in all these hospitals has decreased as compared to earlier. The CM is personally monitoring all critical Covid-19 patients. Due to the direct intervention of the CM, immediate steps have been taken to reduce the rate of deaths in Delhi. On July 16, a checklist was sent by the health department to the hospitals for Covid patient management which further helped reduce deaths due to Covid. As a result, the deaths in Delhi have come down to just 11 today,” the statement issued by the CM’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-panels-suggest-ways-to-hospitals-to-bring-down-covid-deaths/story-gsE5PkQtdvsqANrE6SsCaI.html

06-08-2020||Pune||Showers dampen malls and hotels’ return to business in Pune||Pune: City malls and hotels saw decent visitors on day one after Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) allowed them to restart their business from Wednesday. However, many possible customers chose to avoid stepping out of their homes as it rained throughout the day. “Despite a pretty wet Wednesday, we received an encouraging response with customers coming in throughout the reopening day. As a specialty destination dealing in furniture and decor, we usually focus on conversions rather than plain walk-ins and it was heartening to see double digit conversion on Wednesday,” said Mahesh M, CEO, Creaticity, Yerawada. DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pune, Chinchwad, also saw customers after it was reopened. “In Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, we got permission to reopen slightly earlier than the Pune counterpart. Still, the business is as slow as the first day as today [Wednesday] is actually the second day. The customer query count is more than yesterday. We received queries even during the lockdown days from regular customers,” said Aditya Malla, general manager, DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pune, Chinchwad. Along with standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by the government, DoubleTree has its additional set of preventive norms for staff and visitors. “We have added SOPs like — Hilton clean stay, Hilton event ready — which is helping people to stay more alert regarding hygiene inside hotel and its premises,” said Malla. “Good to see people following social distancing norms inside the mall. I am a regular visitor and feel excited to step in again after the lockdown. Today, I brought sunglasses for my sister,” said Vishal Kakaliya, a resident of SB Road after visiting The Pavillion. “With stringent SoPs in place, we have seen customers more responsible and cooperative in following the virus norms. We are expecting a gradual increase in footfall in the coming days,” said Rahil Ajani, centre director, The Pavillion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/showers-dampen-malls-and-hotels-return-to-business-excitement-in-pune/story-QIWduxCjlD4ZnyMkfLisXJ.html
06-08-2020||Pune||Pune pvt hospitals describe pandemic an ordeal; patients complain of overcharging||Pune: Private hospitals have been at the forefront of fighting the Covid-19 pandemic as the government’s public health infrastructure is seen incapable to deal with the situation. Despite the civic administration promising to look into issues highlighted by private hospitals, complaints remain unresolved. These include harassment in the form of compulsory documentation and updating data, poaching of staff, price cap leading to losses and also imposing more taxes for biowaste disposal. Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) hospital association has written to the district administration and state several times to provide relief, but is yet to get any answer. Dr Sanjay Patil, who heads the Hospital Board of India said, “Private hospitals are facing the load because the government has ignored its public health infrastructure for many decades. Private hospitals and doctors are putting in all their efforts to battle the virus pandemic even as PMC’s hospitals and health facilities are lying unused. Many private hospitals have volunteered to provide support to the government. Majority of Covid-19 cases prefer private medical care citing government hospitals’ lack of infrastructure facility and expertise. Government hospitals are not upgrading their infrastructure, for example PMC’s Dalvi hospital, Naidu hospital and even Kamla Nehru hospital lack critical care and it leaves private hospitals overburdened. When the H1N1 epidemic broke out, it was decided to set up another infectious hospital and upgrade Naidu hospital.” There are around 100 private hospitals in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad offering its services to Covid patients. The government plans to include some of the 700 nursing homes into the Covid network. According to Patil, manpower is another issue private hospitals are struggling with along with lack of coordination between various government authorities, including the central government. Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri hospital, said, “We are facing severe staff shortage as the government is taking away the resources which private hospitals cannot afford because we have to pay them as per the original norms otherwise we will run into fund crunch as there is no help from the government. PMC is also not releasing the credit it owes us. The civic body owes us about Rs 9 crore out of which 50% is due to Covid treatment. Also, the documentation process keeps almost 4-5 staff busy. We have asked PMC to at least provide a data entry operator, but are yet to get any help. Updating data is a huge task and failure to do so invites the administration’s attention. We not only have to update the date on website, but also WhatsApp message it sometimes. Why can’t the government agencies coordinate among themselves and share the information.” The price cap norm put in place by the government had left private hospitals record over 70% loss in addition to the non-Covid surgeries being postponed indefinitely. Dr Rao said, “The government is not giving any relief, but is adding to our troubles. PMC has imposed a 15% excess tax on biowaste disposal when we had asked for its waiver.” While private hospitals claim that they are being harassed by the administration and running into losses, cases of Covid-19 patients being fleeced by private hospitals have also been reported. A senior citizen who was admitted to a private hospital was charged Rs 7.5 lakh as he was admitted in the hospital for over a month. His son said, “My father was admitted on July 4 and was in ICU for over 20 days. He was diabetic and also had high blood pressure. Although most part of the bill was covered by insurance, we still had to pay close to Rs one lakh at the time of discharge.” Amar Bhosale, a construction site labourer whose father was admitted at Symbiosis Lavale as he needed ventilator support which was unavailable at cantonment hospital under Khadki cantonment, said, “We were charged close to Rs 3.15 lakh. My father was admitted on July 22. After much argument and a letter from an MLA, my father was admitted under the Mahatma Phule Jyotiba scheme. However, before the scheme was put in place, we had to pay close to Rs 1.5 lakh out of which I have already paid Rs 60,000 and the rest should be paid at the time of discharge.” Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 for the district, said, “There have been about 15 complaints from patients, Covid and non-Covid cases, for overcharging. We are trying to resolve them and some notices have also been issued. It is observed that generally hospitals take advantage of the grey areas in annexure C as per the government general resolution (GR) as it does not mention which are costlier medicines. The price is capped for ICU beds too at Rs 9,000 and for PPE kits we have told that hospitals must divide the charge for the kit if it is being used for multiple patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-hospitals-in-pune-describe-pandemic-an-ordeal-amid-complaints-from-patients-about-overcharging/story-aRG23JVsp2w0RQ96TKg3dJ.html
06-08-2020||World||It’s not for me: Speed of Covid-19 vaccine race raises safety concerns||The frenetic race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine has intensified safety concerns about an inoculation, prompting governments and drugmakers to raise awareness to ensure their efforts to beat the coronavirus aren’t derailed by public distrust.There are more than 200 Covid-19 vaccine candidates in development globally, including more than 20 in human clinical trials. US President Donald Trump has vowed to have a shot ready before year’s end, although they typically take 10 years or longer to develop and test for safety and effectiveness.In the drive to find a potential Covid-19 vaccine “fast is good for politicians,” said Heidi Larson, who leads the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), a global surveillance programme on vaccine trust. “But from the public perspective, the general sentiment is: ‘too fast can’t be safe’“, she told Reuters. Regulators around the world have repeatedly said speed will not compromise safety, as quicker results would stem from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence.However, these reassurances have failed to convince many, including in Western countries where scepticism about vaccinations was already growing before the pandemic.Preliminary results of a survey conducted over the last three months in 19 countries showed that only about 70% of British and U.S. respondents would take a Covid-19 vaccine if available, Scott Ratzan, co-leader of ‘Business Partners to CONVINCE’, told Reuters.Business Partners to CONVINCE, a U.S./UK initiative that is partly government funded, conducted the survey jointly with VCP and the results were broadly in line with a Reuters/Ipsos poll of the U.S. public in May. “We just see this distrust growing against science and government,” said Ratzan.“We need to address legitimate concerns about the rapid pace of development, political over-promises and the risks of vaccination.” The VCP/Business Partners’ survey, expected to be published in a few weeks, will also show that Chinese participants were the most trusting of vaccines, while Russians were the least so, Ratzan said. Drugmakers and governments had hoped the scale of the Covid-19 crisis would allay concerns about vaccines, which they see as crucial to defeating the pandemic and enabling economies to fully recover from its impact.Vaccine hesitancy - or the reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated - is also known as “anti-vax”, a term that is sometimes associated with conspiracy theories when often it simply reflects many people’s concerns about side-effects or industry ethics. In January 2019 the World Health Organisation named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats for that year.In Europe, scepticism among the public was high before the pandemic due to a range of factors including negative coverage of pharmaceutical companies as well as false theories including suggested links between childhood immunisations and autism.Only 70% of French people considered vaccines safe in a 2018 survey commissioned by the European Union executive. The EU average was 82%, but trust fell to 68% for the shot against seasonal flu. The VCP project on vaccine trust, funded by the European Commission and pharmaceutical companies among others, aims to identify early signs and causes of public mistrust and tackle them with information campaigns before it is too late.Larson said headlines referring to Warp Speed - the name of the U.S. operation aimed at delivering a COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. population by next year - could increase vaccine hesitancy even more than perceptions that the disease could become less lethal.“One of the most frequent things that comes up in people’s conversations is concerns about how quick it is. If I have to pick one theme that is more recurrent than others it is this one,” Larson said.Data collected by VCP from social media show that by the end of June about 40% of Britons’ posts concerning a Covid-19 vaccine, for example, were negative, with many distrusting any coronavirus vaccine and the medical establishment.Announcements about fast progress in Covid vaccines in Russia and China in particular could also contribute to rising scepticism. “We don’t have transparency and don’t know how accurate or valid their data are,” Ratzan said, adding that errors there could boost scepticism elsewhere.Key for any information campaign to be successful is to tailor it to different audiences as there is no uniform profile of anti-vaxxers, said Kate Elder of Doctors Without Borders, a non-governmental organisation.“They go from the highly educated to those who don’t believe in science,” she said, urging politicians to be more careful in their messages on vaccines and to better explain the reasons behind potentially fast results against Covid-19.“We are exploring the idea of a chatbot that will speak in different languages,” said Ratzan, adding it could be something similar to Smokey Bear, the U.S. Forest Service’s campaign to educate about preventing wildfires. “Different parts of the world will require different strategies. We know we need to tailor it and to be specific,” he said.Risks are high if hesitancy is not addressed quickly. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, growing scepticism about the vaccine led to a failure of the vaccination campaign in France, where only 8% of the population got a shot against the virus which is estimated to have killed around 280,000 people across the world.A study published in May in the Lancet by a group of French scientists warned of similar risks now in the country where vaccine hesitancy went up from 18% in mid-March when a lockdown was imposed on the French to 26% by the end of that month.“Distrust is likely to become an issue when the vaccine will be made available,” the scientists concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-not-for-me-speed-of-covid-19-vaccine-race-raises-safety-concerns/story-sWmfz99xcdcznNjhg6LopM.html
06-08-2020||World||French President Macron announces fundraising conference for Lebanon||French President Emmanuel Macron says an international fundraising conference for Lebanon will be held in the next few days after the deadly explosion that devastated Beirut.On a visit to the gutted city, Macron said Thursday that France will organize a conference with European, American and Middle Eastern and other donors to raise money for food, medicine, housing and other urgent aid.He promised a “clear and transparent governance” so that the aid goes directly to the populations and aid groups.Beirut residents blame years of corruption and mismanagement by Lebanon’s leaders for Tuesday’s explosion, which killed more than 130 people, wounded thousands and left tens of thousands homeless.France once governed Lebanon as a protectorate and maintains close ties.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.BEIRUT (AP) — Residents of Beirut vented their fury at Lebanon’s leaders Thursday during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, blaming them for the deadly explosion that ravaged the capital. Shouting, “Revolution!” they crowded around the visiting leader who promised to press the politicians for reform.For many Lebanese, Tuesday’s giant blast was the last straw after years of corruption and mismanagement by a political elite that has ruled for decades.The blast, which killed more than 130 people, wounded thousands and left tens of thousands homeless, is believed to have been caused when a fire touched off a stockpile of 2,750 tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate that authorities left sitting in a warehouse for years — despite a customs official’s repeated warnings.Macron visited the devastated port and toured a hard-hit neighborhood lined with heavily damaged buildings. A crowd gathered around him and shouted their anger, chanting, “Revolution!” and “The people want to bring down the regime!” — slogans used at mass protests last year.Macron told them he would speak to Lebanon’s political leaders.“I will propose to them a new political pact this afternoon,” he said. “I will be back on the first of September and if they can’t do it, I will keep my responsibility toward you.”He also promised that French aid would be given out with transparency and “will not go into the hands of corruption.” France once governed Lebanon as a protectorate and maintains close ties.Elsewhere, he said his visit was “an opportunity to have a frank and challenging dialogue with the Lebanese political powers and institutions.” France will work to coordinate aid, he said, but warned that “if reforms are not made, Lebanon will continue to sink.”There have been widespread pledges of international aid to Lebanon, but the country has been mired in a severe economic crisis and faces a daunting challenge in rebuilding. It’s unclear how much support the international community will offer the notoriously corrupt and dysfunctional government.Losses from the blast were estimated by Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud to be between $10 billion to $15 billion, who said nearly 300,000 people are homeless.The disaster may also have accelerated the country’s coronavirus outbreak, as thousands flooded into hospitals. Tens of thousands have had to move in with relatives and friends after their homes were damaged, further raising the risks of exposure.The head of Lebanon’s customs department, meanwhile, confirmed in an interview with LBC TV on Wednesday that officials had sent five or six letters over the years to the judiciary, asking that the ammonium nitrate be removed because of its dangers.Badri Daher said all he could do was alert authorities to its presence, saying even that was “extra work” for him and his predecessor. He said the port authority was responsible for the material, while his job was to prevent smuggling and collect duties.The judiciary and the port authority could not immediately be reached for comment. The government said Wednesday an investigation was underway and that port officials have been placed under house arrest.The ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilizers, had been stored at the port since it was confiscated from a ship years earlier. Based on the timeline and the size of the cargo, that ship could be the MV Rhosus. The ship was initially seized in Beirut in 2013 when it entered the port due to technical problems, according to lawyers involved in the case. It came from the nation of Georgia, and had been bound for Mozambique.The stockpile is believed to have detonated after a fire broke out nearby in what appeared to be a warehouse holding fireworks. Daher, the customs official, said he did not know if there were fireworks near the site.Another theory is that the fire began when welders were trying to repair a broken gate and a hole in the wall of Warehouse 12, where the explosive material was stored. Local news reports say the repairs were ordered by security forces who were concerned about theft.Security officials have declined to comment during the investigation. Port officials have rejected the welding theory in interviews with local media, saying the work had been completed long before the fire broke out.Lebanon’s various political factions, including the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group, have ruled the country since the 1975-1990 civil war. Almost all the country’s public institutions are divided up among the factions, which use them as patronage generators for themselves and their supporters. Little actual development is put into the institutions and anything that requires joint action often becomes mired in bickering. As a result, even basic services like electricity and trash collection are in a shambles.The tiny Mediterranean country is beset by soaring unemployment and a financial crisis that has wiped out people’s life savings. Hospitals were already strained by the coronavirus, and one was so badly damaged by the blast it had to treat patients in a nearby field.Dr. Firas Abiad, director general of Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the public hospital leading the coronavirus fight, said he expects an increase in cases in the next 10 to 15 days linked to crowding at hospitals and blood donation centers after the blast.Authorities had largely contained the outbreak by imposing a sweeping lockdown in March and April, but case numbers have risen recently. A renewed lockdown was to take effect this week but was canceled after the explosion. The country has reported more than 5,400 coronavirus cases and 68 deaths since February.“There is no doubt that our immunity in the country is less than before the explosion and this will affect us medium- to long-term,” Abiad said. “We desperately need aid, not only us but all hospitals in Lebanon.”The explosion was the most powerful blast ever seen in the city, which has survived decades of war and conflict. Several city blocks were left littered with rubble, broken glass and damaged vehicles.Authorities have cordoned off the port itself, where the blast left a crater 200 meters (yards) across and shredded a large grain silo, emptying its contents into the rubble. Estimates suggested about 85% of the import-reliant country’s grain was stored there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-announces-fundraising-conference-for-lebanon/story-bJVBmdyWjP8wUFpK0y9y1H.html
06-08-2020||World||UK says 50 million face masks it bought might not be safe||The British government says it won’t be using 50 million face masks it bought during a scramble to secure protective equipment for medics during the coronavirus outbreak because of concerns they might not be safe.The admission sparked calls from the political opposition for an urgent inquiry into the way contracts for essential supplies were handed out.The masks were part of a 252-million-pound ($332 million) contract the government signed with investment firm Ayanda Capital in April. Papers filed in a court case reveal that the masks won’t be distributed because they have ear loops rather than head loops and may not fit tightly enough.The papers, published Thursday, are part of a lawsuit against the Conservative government by campaigning groups the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor. They want the courts to review contracts signed by the government for personal protective equipment, which they say were not properly scrutinized.As the coronavirus outbreak accelerated across the U.K. in March, it became clear that the country lacked enough masks, gloves, gowns and other protective gear for health care workers and nursing home staff. That sparked a race to buy billions of pieces of equipment from suppliers around the world.Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, said the government had signed three contracts worth more than 100 million pounds each “with respectively a pest control company, a confectioner and a family hedge fund.”“Each of those contracts has revealed real cause for alarm,” he said.The government said in its response to the lawsuit that the offer to supply the 50 million masks came from Andrew Mills, a businessman who is both an adviser to the government’s Board of Trade and to Ayanda Capital. Mills has denied there was any conflict of interest.The government says another 150 million masks of a different type supplied by Ayanda are still being tested.It said in a statement that “there is a robust process in place to ensure orders are of high quality and meet strict safety standards, with the necessary due diligence undertaken on all government contracts.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “very disappointed” that the shipment was unusable. But he said Britain had “achieved a colossal race against time” to obtain supplies of equipment and stockpile it in case of a second wave of coronavirus in the fall and winter.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called for an urgent investigation into the way personal protective equipment was acquired.“It’s just not good enough to people who need that protective equipment that we find ourselves in this position,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-50-million-face-masks-it-bought-might-not-be-safe/story-tsUoNt5nG4DnGvTOOhz6WM.html
06-08-2020||World||US launches 5-pronged ‘Clean Network’ to curb Chinese tech access||The United States on Wednesday announced an expanded five-pronged “Clean Network” initiative to further reduce Chinese access to data on Americans. It would include removing “untrusted” Chinese apps such as TikTok and WeChat from American apps stores.“With parent companies based in China, apps like TikTok, WeChat, and others are significant threats to the personal data of American citizens, not to mention tools for CCP content censorship,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a news briefing.TikTok is in talks with Microsoft to sell its US operations at a reported price of $30 billion. As President Donald Trump announced earlier in the week, TikTok faces a ban in the US if the deal is not clinched by September 15.The top US diplomat went on to unveil an expanded version of the “Clean Path” initiative he had launched in April. It”s called the “Clean Network” and 30 countries have already signed on.Here are the five “lines” of the network: Clean Carrier, to keep out “untrusted” Chinese telecommunications companies connecting the US and foreign destinations; Clean Store, to remove “untrusted” Chinese apps from US apps stores; Clean Apps, to prevent Chinese companies such as Huawei from pre-installing or making available for download on their devices US apps; Clean Cloud, to keep Chinese cloud service providers from accessing data on Americans; and Clean Cable, to to ensure Chinese government cannot “compromise” information carried through undersea cables.On undersea cables, Secretary Pompeo cited Huawei, which, he said, “significantly underbids” rival companies on multiple procurements to connect Asia, the Pacific, Africa, and Europe “using Chinese state-backed underseas technology”.The secretary said the state department will be working closely with the department of commerce and other agencies to “limit the ability of Chinese cloud service providers to collect, to store, and to process vast amounts of data and sensitive information here in the United States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-launches-5-pronged-clean-network-to-curb-chinese-tech-access/story-RYjphziXoM8AgqvV8nnwtJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says coronavirus vaccine possible before November 3||US President Donald Trump said on Thursday it was possible the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine before the November 3 election, a more optimistic forecast than timing put forth by his own White House health experts.Asked on the Geraldo Rivera radio program when a vaccine might be ready, Trump said, “Sooner than the end of the year, could be much sooner.” “Sooner than November 3?” he was asked. “I think in some cases, yes possible before, but right around that time,” Trump said.Trump, who is seeking re-election to a second term amid a U.S. economy crippled by coronavirus shutdowns, has pushed for schools to reopen and things to get “back to normal” as coronavirus deaths in the country average more than 1,000 per day.Top government health officials have said corners would not be cut in the race to secure a vaccine against the virus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. government infectious diseases official, offered a more conservative view in a Reuters interview on Wednesday, saying there might be an indication that at least one vaccine works and is safe by year end.Trump was upbeat on the U.S. economic recovery once a vaccine is available. “We’re going to have vaccines very soon, we’re gonna have therapeutics very soon,” he told the radio program.Asked if he believed China may have stolen a vaccine from the United States, Trump said, “I can’t say that with certainty, but it’s possible.”Chinese government-linked hackers targeted biotech company Moderna Inc, a U.S.-based coronavirus vaccine developer, this year in a bid to steal data, according to a U.S. security official tracking Chinese hacking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-coronavirus-vaccine-possible-before-november-3/story-O76IXKh8fBwaGjLx7K5aIO.html
06-08-2020||World||US congressional body expresses bipartisan ‘concern’ over Kashmir||The US House of Representatives committee that oversees foreign relations on Wednesday expressed bipartisan “concern” over the situation in Kashmir in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar by its top Democratic and Republican leaders, worded carefully so as to not sound a discordant note.“We note with concern that conditions in Jammu and Kashmir have not normalised one year after India’s repeal of Article 370 and the establishment of Jammu and Kashmir as a Union Territory,” Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Michael T McCaul, the top Republican called the ranking member, wrote in the letter.It was a rare instance of bipartisan criticism of the Kashmir changes. Democrats have condemned it before, and in many public forums such as congressional and semi-congressional hearings and on social media, headlined most prominently by Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, an Indian American. Republicans had been mostly supportive thus far through their silence, taking the lead from the Trump administration’s carefully calibrated response that it was an “internal matter” for India but it wanted the restrictions in place in the immediate aftermath be removed at the earliest.Cognizant perhaps of the significance of the bipartisan nature of their criticism, the two lawmakers sought to soft-land it by averring themselves as “champions” of the relationship, which they have been indeed over the years, and added they were “delighted” at the two countries’ “close cooperation on issues from defense to climate change”.They also offered full-throated support for India in its ongoing border tensions with China. “This closer relationship is all the more important as India faces aggression from China along your shared border, which is part of the Chinese government’s consistent pattern of unlawful and belligerent territorial aggression across the Indo-Pacific. The United States will remain steadfast in support of India’s efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”They also acknowledged “the ongoing serious security and counterterrorism concerns in the region”, in a barely veiled reference to threat emanating from across border in Pakistan.The House Foreign Relations Committee controls the state department’s budget, and uses that power to influence the country’s foreign relations. Its Senate counterpart — the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — wields similar influence through its power to confirm or reject the appointment of ambassadors and senior officials.Engel had joined the top Democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, Senator Bob Menendez, to call on India to protect the constitutional rights of “all it citizens” in reference to the Kashmir restrictions. “As the world’s largest democracy, India has an opportunity to demonstrate for all its citizens the importance of protecting and promoting equal rights, including freedom of assembly, access to information, and equal protections under the law,” they had said then in a joint statement. But it was not a bipartisan action like Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressional-body-expresses-bipartisan-concern-over-kashmir/story-H3h960tPLMThwDVC0tqgiL.html
06-08-2020||World||In big shift, Pope names 6 women to Vatican financial oversight body||Pope Francis has appointed six women, including the former treasurer for Britain’s Prince Charles, to the council that oversees Vatican finances, naming them in one fell swoop to some of the most senior roles.The appointments to one of the Holy See’s most important offices marked the latest attempt by the pope to keep promises to improve gender balance made years ago but which women’s groups have said were too slow in being realised.Francis has already appointed women as deputy foreign minister, director of the Vatican Museums, and deputy head of the Vatican Press Office, as well as four women as councillors to the Synod of Bishops, which prepares major meetings.Still, Thursday’s new appointments marked the largest number of women named at one time to Vatican posts.The previously all-male Council for the Economy consists of 15 posts. One cardinal is the coordinator and the 14 other posts are divided evenly among members of the clergy and lay people.The seven-member lay portion now consists of six women and one man. Of the six women, two each are from Britain, Spain and Germany. The sole male lay member is Italian.One of the Britons, Leslie Jane Ferrar, was treasurer to Prince Charles from 2015 to 2017 and now holds a number of non-executive and trustee roles, the Vatican said.The other, Ruth May Kelly, served as secretary of state for education and for transport, and as minister for women and equality, in Britain’s former Labour government from 2004-2008.The other four women have backgrounds in business, banking and academia.Francis established the Council for the Economy, which oversees budgets and sets policy, in 2014 as an international body to oversee often-troubled Vatican finances.The new council is starting its work as the coronavirus pandemic has hit the Vatican’s finances hard, forcing it to dip into reserve funds and implement some of the toughest cost control measures ever in the tiny city state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-big-shift-pope-names-6-women-to-vatican-financial-oversight-body/story-Xrrv87bs12tLD3o0aDdYHK.html

The bombing destroyed the city and killed 140,000 people, mostly civilians and including many children. The US dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on August 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression in Asia. Survivors, their relatives and other participants marked the 8:15 a.m. blast anniversary with the sound of a bell followed by a minute of silence.

For instance, it has long singled out telecom equipment provider Huawei, encouraging allies not to use its equipment in their high-speed 5G wireless networks and banning U.S. telecom companies from using government funds for equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom equipment provider.Citing national security concerns, it has also barred Google from providing its Android apps such as Google Maps for Huawei phones. The Federal Communications Commission is considering barring operations of Chinese telecom companies China Telecom and China Unicom, which provide services in the U.S., due to national-security concerns.President Donald Trump has also threatened to ban TikTok, although the legal basis for such a move remains uncertain.“It’s a PR stunt. No specifics. It’s an objective,” George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson said by email.Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo said the U.S. government is trying to push its allies and companies to stop using Chinese gear and software “at all levels of their communications networks, from the internet backbone to app stores.” That includes calling for companies to yank their apps from Huawei’s app store, which advertises that it contains apps from European and U.S. companies like travel service Booking and Amazon.The legal authority for the administration to take action against apps and app stores is unclear, Triolo write in a research note. The State Department did not immediately a question seeking information about the legal authority the administration could use to justify such measures.The initiative is meant to force countries and companies to choose sides between the U.S. and China, Triolo said. He expects many companies and governments to resist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-talks-tougher-on-chinese-tech-but-offers-few-specifics/story-dAaekuR3bBv5WwxhqtnSFJ.html
06-08-2020||World||China firm to make 100 million doses of potential UK Covid-19 vaccine by 2020 end||Shenzhen Kangtai one of China’s top vaccine makers will produce 100 million doses of British pharma company AstraZeneca’s potential Covid-19 vaccine by the end of 2020, the two companies separately announced in China on Thursday.The vaccine deal is the first to cater to China, the most populous country in the world, the statements said.The potential coronavirus vaccine developed by the company with Oxford University has produced a promising immune response in a large, early-stage human trial, medical journal The Lancet said in a report in July.AstraZeneca’s China arm on Thursday announced the deal on the social media app WeChat, saying it has signed an “…exclusive authorisation cooperation framework agreement with Kangtai Biology in the Chinese mainland market to actively promote the development, production, supply and commercialisation of the adenovirus vector vaccine AZDI222 through technology transfer”.The Chinese company posted a statement on the deal on the website of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.As part of the technology transfer deal, the Chinese company will ensure the annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses of the new coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020.The deal adds that the “…vaccine design capacity will be expanded to at least 200 million doses by the end of 2021 to meet the needs of the Chinese market”.The two companies will also explore the possibility of cooperation on the vaccine candidate in other markets, AstraZeneca said.In May, the British company and the University of Oxford partnered to develop and produce the potential new vaccine for Covid-19, which has triggered the worst pandemic in decades.The experimental Covid-19 vaccine is probably the world’s leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development, the World Health Organisation’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan had said in late June.“Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate,” Swaminathan had said, adding:“So it’s possible they will have results quite early.”The company has signed manufacturing deals globally to meet its target of making 2 billion doses of the vaccine, the Reuters said in a report Thursday.The British company, according to Bloomberg, has struck deals to supply hundreds of millions of doses of the experimental vaccine for the UK, US and Europe.Shenzhen Kangtai is one of China’s biggest vaccine makers, with shots against diseases such as pneumonia and measles. Many of its products employ more sophisticated techniques, including genetic engineering. It’s also a major supplier of hepatitis B vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-firm-to-make-100-million-doses-of-potential-uk-covid-19-vaccine-by-2020-end/story-KF2XVs1QpZX7oewCQGveeI.html

North Darfur, White Nile, Sennar and Kassala states are the latest to report storms and flooding, the report said.In North Darfur, at least 600 internally displaced people are “in dire need” of shelter and food after a flash flood hit the camp where they lived in the Al Lait area.“The Sudan Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rains are expected during August and September in most of the country, which can lead to further flooding and displacement,” said UNOCHA.Last week, heavy rains caused the collapse of the Bout Dam in Blue Nile province, destroyed 1,200 houses and left at least five people dead across the country.The Sudanese government and humanitarian agencies are monitoring the situation and providing assistance to those affected, said UNOCHA.Last year, flooding killed a total of 78 people in 16 Sudanese provinces, between July and August, according to the U.N.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-tens-of-thousands-affected-by-floods-in-sudan/story-vDvUdWVTvPqvuyimawPw1M.html
06-08-2020||World||Seeking refuge in US, children fleeing danger are expelled||When officers led them out of a detention facility near the US-Mexico border and onto a bus last month, the 12-year-old from Honduras and his 9-year-old sister believed they were going to a shelter so they could be reunited with their mother in the Midwest.They had been told to sign a paper they thought would tell the shelter they didn’t have the coronavirus, the boy said. The form was in English, a language he and his sister don’t speak. The only thing he recognized was the letters “Covid.”Instead, the bus drove five hours to an airport where the children were told to board a plane.“They lied to us,” he said. “They didn’t tell us we were going back to Honduras.”More than 2,000 unaccompanied children have been expelled since March under an emergency declaration enacted by the Trump administration, which has cited the coronavirus in refusing to provide them protections under federal anti-trafficking and asylum laws. Lawyers and advocates have sharply criticized the administration for using the global pandemic as a pretext to deport children to places of danger.No U.S. agents looked at the video the boy had saved on his cellphone showing a hooded man holding a rifle, saying his name, and threatening to kill him and his sister, weeks after the uncle caring for them was shot dead in June. And even though they were expelled under an emergency declaration citing the virus, they were never tested for COVID-19, the boy said.Three weeks after their uncle was killed, the children fled Honduras, crossing the U.S.-Mexico border alone. Under the normal process set out by U.S. law, they would have been referred to a government facility for youth and eventually placed with their mother. Instead, they were expelled on July 24 after three days in U.S. detention and now live in Honduras with another uncle who is looking to leave the country himself.U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined multiple requests for comment on the boy’s story, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also declined, saying the children had been in Border Patrol custody until they boarded a deportation flight operated by ICE.Spokesmen for both agencies have refused to answer most questions about how they treat roughly 70,000 adults and children expelled under the emergency declaration issued in March. They have refused to say how they decide whether to expel children or where to detain them before expulsion, including in hotels where at least 150 unaccompanied children as young as 1 year old have been held.Much of what’s known about expulsions has come from the accounts of children like the 12-year-old boy, who recounted his experience to The Associated Press last week with a recall of details that makes him seem older.The AP is not identifying the boy, his sister, their mother or where their mother lives in the U.S. because of fears the children are still targeted by the people who killed their uncle.Dr. Amy Cohen, executive director of the advocacy group Every Last One, interviewed the boy several times and said she found him credible based on her conversations with hundreds of other immigrant children.“When he has an opportunity to exaggerate or embroider his story, he absolutely does not,” Cohen said. “And he is consistent with everyone he has talked to. There’s no sense that the story is rehearsed.”Six children have died since 2018 after being detained by the Border Patrol, several in conditions that raised questions about how the agency treats children. The agency says it has instituted new medical checks and takes anyone determined to need additional care to a hospital.In court, meanwhile, the Trump administration has argued children it is seeking to expel are not entitled to protections under the Flores settlement, a 2-decade-old court agreement that sets standards for the detention of immigrant children.The children’s uncle took them in three years ago after their mother fled with their older sister due to gang threats, according to the family.It’s not clear who killed the uncle. But the boy said he remembers family members deciding not to have his uncle taken to the hospital because they feared they wouldn’t be able to afford to get his body out of the morgue.The killing frightened the family. According to the boy, he was left alone in his uncle’s home with his sister to fend for themselves. The boy said he cooked meals for them with the beans and eggs left in the house.Then, one day, he said, a man approached him outside the house, asked to see his phone and gave it back with a video saved on it. In the video, a masked man said the siblings’ names and warned: “You either join us and start working with us,” or end up like your uncle. The same day, someone left a note outside their home threatening them, he said.“It reminded me of my uncle’s death,” he said. “I felt a lot of fear.”They joined a large group of migrants leaving Honduras in hopes of reaching the U.S, he said. After the group split up in Guatemala, a man took him and his sister through Mexico and to the border.Parts of the story are impossible to verify. Experts say MS-13 and other gangs often deliver death threats verbally, and migrant groups and routes through Mexico and Central America are known to be controlled by human smugglers who charge thousands of dollars per person. The boy’s mother says she doesn’t believe her son or any other relative paid a smuggler.The siblings crossed the border around July 21 and were apprehended by Border Patrol agents, the boy said. Based on his description, it appears he and his sister were detained at the Border Patrol’s central processing center in McAllen, Texas, where children and adults are separated into large cages of chain-link fencing. Opened during the administration of former President Barack Obama, the same processing center was used two years ago to detain hundreds of parents and children separated by the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy.The boy said he was held in a cage with about 20 other boys his age and older. He was separated from his sister but could see her from a distance in another enclosure.Once a day, someone took their temperatures, but the boy says he was never given a medical exam or a test to see if he had the virus. He said he wore a mask he brought with him from Honduras.He was able to call his mother from custody once before he and his sister were expelled. The phone call she received was from a number in McAllen, Texas.The next call the mother received was from an official in Honduras, a few days later, asking her to send a relative to pick her kids up from a shelter for deported children. That was how she learned they had been expelled, she said.She sat recently in the trailer where she lives with family, including her elder daughter, now 16.“I wanted something to be done and to be able to be calm, to know that my children are safe with me,” she said, crying. “No part of Honduras is safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seeking-refuge-in-us-children-fleeing-danger-are-expelled/story-vPRand38RzpyNqlaA2S7sJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Two kids caught in Indian, British citizenship legal row||Two children of Indian parents --- aged 9 and 11 --- are the focus of legal action in the high court of England and Wales, with the local authority in Birmingham keen to apply for British citizenship on their behalf, and the parents opposed to the change of citizenship.The high court on Thursday ruled that the local authority did not have the power to apply for British citizenship on the children’s behalf in the face of parental opposition and where that may lead to a loss of their existing citizenship, without first obtaining the court’s approval.The parents and children have not been named in court documents, which state that the children are Indian citizens, born in the UK after their parents arrived here in 2004. They failed to get permanent residency. The mother moved to Singapore in 2015, while the father remains in England.Prominent lawyer Harish Salve represented the father of the children, while a legally qualified Delhi-based individual named as ‘Rao’ in the judgement represented their Singapore-based mother. Both parents opposed the idea of British citizenship for the children.The judgement said: “In August 2015, for reasons which it is not now necessary to describe, the children were removed from their parents and placed in a foster home where they have lived ever since. Contact with the parents has not taken place since that time”.“The mother left the UK in November 2015 while pregnant and now lives in Singapore. The father has remained in England, but his antagonism towards the local authority has made contact unachievable. In the course of a complex set of proceedings, the children became the subject of placement orders”, it added.Birmingham local authorities, who have been caring for the children since 2015, were keen to apply for British citizenship to regularise their immigration status. The Indian high commission was involved in the proceedings through a solicitor and an official attending some of the hearings. The mother emphasised nationality as being fundamental to a person’s life, and of an importance that is on a par with serious medical treatment. Deprivation of Indian citizenship has consequences for succession and for the children’s ability to own land, she contended.The local authority’s lawyer contended that a decision about a change of citizenship was not one of such magnitude that it had to be put before the court, comparing the decision “to routine vaccination and not to serious medical treatment”.But Justice Peter Jackson ruled: “The characterisation of a change of citizenship as akin to routine vaccination is misplaced. Changing a child’s citizenship is a momentous step with profound and enduring consequences that requires the most careful consideration”.The court asked the local authority to indicate whether it wished to progress the matter, in which case the judgement said the court will give appropriate directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-kids-caught-in-indian-british-citizenship-legal-row/story-DboNTxs88wDJoPfQYrvzxM.html
06-08-2020||World||In Beirut, Macron says Lebanese leaders need to hear ‘home truths’||President Emmanuel Macron offered France’s support for the Lebanese people on Thursday on a visit to Beirut following a huge warehouse blast, but said crisis-hit Lebanon would “continue to sink” unless its leaders carry out reforms.Macron was the first foreign leader to visit the Lebanese capital since the explosion on Tuesday that killed at least 145 people.France has long sought to support its former colony and has sent emergency aid since the blast, but is worried about endemic corruption and has pressed for reforms as a financial crisis deepened in the Middle East country.After landing in Beirut, Macron said France’s solidarity with the Lebanese people was unconditional, but said he wanted to tell some “home truths” to political figures. “Beyond the blast, we know the crisis here is serious, it involves the historic responsibility of leaders in place,” Macron told reporters.“We can’t do without telling each other some home truths,” he added. “If reforms are not carried out, Lebanon will continue to sink.” He mentioned reforms of the energy sector, public tenders and the fight against corruption. Lebanese officials have blamed the disaster on a huge stockpile of a highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at Beirut port.But many Lebanese people who have lost jobs and watched savings evaporate in a financial meltdown have blamed it on politicians who have benefited from decades of state corruption and bad governance. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for “concrete action” during a visit to Beirut last month and said protesters’ calls for change and transparency had “unfortunately not been heard so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-beirut-macron-says-lebanese-leaders-need-to-hear-home-truths/story-9UA6rvjySjvaDVtieqm7dK.html
06-08-2020||World||Chinese court sentences Canadian to death for making drugs||A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced a Canadian citizen to death for producing drugs, the third Canadian to be given the capital punishment since Ottawa detained a top executive of the Chinese company, Huawei, in 2018. The Canadian identified as Xu Weihong was sentenced to death for manufacturing ketamine, a tranquilising drug for humans and animals, on Thursday at a first trial in the southern city of Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Intermediate Court said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday that drug crimes were very serious and everyone was equal before the law.“China’s relevant authorities handled the case independently according to law. I don’t think it should have any effect on China-Canada relations,” Wang said when asked to share details about the case.A Chinese national, Wen Guanxiong, was also charged with making drugs in the same case; he was jailed for life.The latest conviction of a Canadian comes at a time when ties between China and Canada are strained over the case of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in the Canadian city of Vancouver in late 2018, on a warrant from the US.Beijing has said that the US and Canada have abused their bilateral extradition treaty to arbitrarily take compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without cause.“This is a serious political incident that grossly violates the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese citizen,” the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier.In January 2019, a Canadian citizen Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was given the death sentence in the north-eastern city of Dalian after the judge had changed his original 15-year jail sentence.Schellenberg, then 36, was detained in 2014 on suspicion of smuggling crystal meth from China to Australia.Three months later, in April 2019, Fan Wei, another Canadian was sentenced to death in the southern city of Jiangmen.Beijing has also formally charged two Canadians, ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, with spying since the diplomatic hostilities began.China has denied that their arrest is linked to Meng’s case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-sentences-canadian-to-death-for-making-drugs/story-V4WR8fyUfBDNxFJfanP2FJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Iraq to list hazardous materials after Beirut explosion||Iraq announced Thursday it will create an inventory of all hazardous materials at ports and airports after the ignition of ammonium nitrate fertiliser at a portside warehouse levelled swathes of Beirut.An emergency committee chaired by the head of Iraq’s border agency said it had been tasked with carrying out the work and had given itself 72 hours to complete it. The goal was to “avoid any repetition of what happened in Lebanon” in Iraq, the panel said.The huge blast that caused widespread destruction across the Lebanese capital on Tuesday was triggered by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser that had been stored in the city’s port for years.A security official said on condition of anonymity the ammonium nitrate had arrived in Lebanon in 2013 on board a Moldovan-flagged ship sailing from Georgia and bound for Mozambique.Port authorities unloaded the ammonium nitrate and stored it in a rundown warehouse with cracks in its walls, several security officials said.Security forces launched an investigation in 2019 after the warehouse reportedly started to exude a strange odour, and concluded that the “dangerous” chemicals should be removed, but no action was taken.The revelations have sparked fury in Lebanon that so much ammonium nitrate could be stored for so long in the heart of the capital.The standing of Lebanon’s political class was already close to rock bottom after months of mass protests against mismanagement of the deeply indebted economy, before social distancing related to the coronavirus pandemic brought some breathing space for the establishment.Iraq too has seen mass protests over the past year against a political system based on confessional quotas that is seen as corrupt and incompetent.The searing summer heat in Iraq makes it even more vulnerable to the danger of accidental explosions of poorly stored hazardous materials.The accidental ignition of munitions stocked in residential areas has caused deadly explosions in Iraq in the past, although such incidents have largely been put down to the costs of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-to-list-hazardous-materials-after-beirut-explosion/story-XztyO3NmDiuN0OLAG2tqdO.html
06-08-2020||World||Beijing warns of ‘measures’ If US denies Chinese media visas||China repeated that it would take measures if Washington didn’t renew visas for Chinese journalists working in the U.S., amid questions over whether it will make a tit-for-tat move against American reporters in Hong Kong.“We learned that relevant Chinese journalists applied for visa extensions but none of them have received a clear reply from the U.S. side,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday, echoing comments he made earlier this week. “If the U.S. is bent on going down the wrong path, China will take necessary and legitimate measures to defend its interests.”Speculation over the future visa status of U.S. journalists working in Hong Kong mounted this week following online posts by Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin that a number of Chinese journalists would see their visas expire on Aug. 6, and “none of them” had yet been renewed.“From what I know, given that the US side hasn’t renewed visa of Chinese journalists, Chinese side has prepared for the worst scenario that all Chinese journalists have to leave the US,” Hu wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “If that’s the case, Chinese side will retaliate, including targeting US journalists based in HK.”The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong said Thursday that it “opposes using journalists’ visas as a weapon in international disputes.”The club “is aware of recent examples of delays involving the issuing of visas to foreign journalists in Hong Kong, as well as suggestions by the Chinese government that more foreign journalists could face repercussions in response to U.S. actions,” it said in a statement.“The FCC calls on the Trump administration to lift its restrictions on Chinese media working in the U.S., and on Hong Kong and China’s governments to refrain from retribution in targeting U.S. media and journalists working in Hong Kong,” it said.Hong Kong’s ability to determine its own immigration policy has been undermined in recent years, and any squeezing of journalists in the financial hub could fuel a broader escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China.“We said many times that the U.S. caused the current situation and is responsible for it,” said Wang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. “The U.S. should immediately correct its mistakes and stop its political oppression against Chinese journalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-warns-of-measures-if-us-denies-chinese-media-visas/story-xMLeaD3PxmUQILaqzqwEQO.html
06-08-2020||World||Germany mandates tests for some arrivals as Covid-19 cases increase||Germany will require people arriving from countries considered high-risk to take coronavirus tests starting this weekend, the health minister said Thursday, as the country recorded its highest daily tally of new infections in three months.German officials have voiced alarm over a steady upward creep in the number of new infections over recent weeks. The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said 1,045 cases were recorded on Wednesday — the first time since May 7 that it has counted more than 1,000 cases in a day.Daily figures can be volatile or distorted by delays in reporting, and the number is still far short of the peak of more than 6,000 reached in early April.“What we are seeing is a lot of small outbreaks,” Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters. “People are getting infected at family parties, at their place of work or at community facilities.”On top of that, school holidays — the dates of which are staggered across Germany’s 16 states — are ending in some regions, increasing concerns that vacationers could bring home the virus.Last Saturday, the government started offering free tests for people returning to the country.People entering from countries deemed high-risk — currently most of the world outside Europe, as well as Luxembourg and parts of northern Spain — are required to quarantine for 14 days unless they can present a negative test result no more than two days old.Spahn said that, starting Saturday, people arriving from those countries will be required to take a test unless they bring a new test result with them.“I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,” Spahn said.The minister dismissed arguments by some politicians that people who can afford a vacation should also have to pay for their tests.He said many returnees from high-risk and other countries “have saved hard for this vacation, put a lot of money aside, don’t have a lot in reserve — and nevertheless, I want to make it possible for them to get tested.”Germany’s Covid-19 response has been widely regarded as relatively successful. The Robert Koch Institute has recorded 9,175 deaths from over 213,000 confirmed cases -- a lower death rate than in many comparable countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-mandates-tests-for-some-arrivals-as-covid-19-cases-increase/story-JATOpLz6WMYSOwPOjaXjzH.html
06-08-2020||World||China threatens countermeasures as Taiwan prepares for US visit||China on Thursday threatened to take countermeasures over a trip to Taiwan by US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, as the Chinese-claimed island geared up for its highest-level U.S. official visit in four decades.The visit, which begins on Sunday, adds to tensions between Beijing and Washington over everything from trade and human rights to the novel coronavirus pandemic. China calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its bilateral ties with the United States.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing that any attempt to deny or challenge the “one China” principle, which states that Taiwan is part of China, would end in failure.“China will take strong countermeasures in response to the U.S. behaviour,” Wang said, referring to Azar’s visit.While he gave no details, China last month said it would impose sanctions on Lockheed Martin for involvement in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.Taiwan has batted away China’s criticism, saying Beijing has no right to comment.Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing. The Trump administration has made strengthening its support for the democratic island a priority, and boosted arms sales.Azar, who is scheduled to meet President Tsai Ing-wen, is coming to strengthen economic and public health cooperation with Taiwan, and support Taiwan’s international role in fighting the pandemic.Taiwan is locked out of most global agencies, such as the World Health Organization, due to the objections of China, which views the island as a Chinese province that is not entitled to any of the rights that statehood confers.Taiwan Centres for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said Azar and members of the U.S. delegation would be tested for coronavirus before leaving for Taiwan, and again upon entry at the airport.Only if they are negative will they be allowed in.“They must wear masks at all times,” Chuang said.“There are rules on where they can go,” he added, saying that Taiwan’s often-crowded night markets would not be on the list for private visits.The members of the U.S. delegation will also have to maintain social distancing when meeting government officials, Chuang said, adding they would use dedicated elevators “to avoid any risks”.Taiwan has won praise for its steps to control the coronavirus, including strict border quarantine controls and the widespread wearing of masks, which have won broad public support.It has reported 477 cases of the coronavirus and seven deaths. Most cases have been imported, and only a small number of people remain in hospital or isolation.The United States has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, and the wearing of masks has become a heated political issue, with some people objecting to what they see as an infringement of personal freedom.

TikTok’s “Trust and Safety Hub”, set up in Dublin in January, deals with regulators and governments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.It also moved its privacy oversight of European users to Ireland in June and TikTok said its Irish and UK entities will take over from its U.S. business in managing and safeguarding the personal data of its European users.“TikTok’s decision to establish its first European data centre in Ireland is very welcome and positions Ireland as an important location in the company’s global operations,” Martin Shanahan, head of the Irish state agency charged with attracting foreign investment, said in a statement.($1 = 0.8420 euros)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-to-open-first-european-data-centre-in-ireland/story-JY15rYB05gG6wJpsE0dA5L.html
06-08-2020||World||French President Macron arrives in Beirut to show support after blast||French President Emmanuel Macron has arrived in Beirut to express support for Lebanon in the wake of a massive explosion that tore through the capital earlier this week. France and other countries have send emergency aid and search-and-rescue teams. But Lebanon, which was already reeling from a severe economic crisis, will need substantial international support to rebuild. The blast killed at least 135 people, wounded thousands, and obliterated Beirut’s port.Lebanese army bulldozers plowed through wreckage to reopen roads around Beirut’s demolished port Thursday, a day after the government pledged to investigate this week’s devastating explosion and placed port officials under house arrest.The blast Tuesday, which appeared to have been caused by an accidental fire that ignited a stockpile of ammonium nitrate at the port, rippled across the Lebanese capital, killing at least 135 people, injuring more than 5,000 and causing widespread destruction.It also may have accelerated the country’s coronavirus outbreak, as thousands flooded into hospitals in the wake of the blast. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to move in with relatives and friends after their homes were damaged, further raising the risks of exposure.French President Emmanuel Macron was expected to visit later Thursday amid pledges of international aid. But Lebanon, which was already mired in a severe economic crisis, faces a daunting challenge in rebuilding. It’s unclear how much support the international community will offer the notoriously corrupt and dysfunctional government.Losses from the blast are estimated to be between $10 billion to $15 billion, Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud told the Saudi-owned TV station Al-Hadath on Wednesday, adding that nearly 300,000 people are homeless.The tiny Mediterranean country was already on the brink of collapse, with soaring unemployment and a financial crisis that has wiped out people’s life savings. Hospitals were already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, and one was so badly damaged by the blast it had to treat patients in a nearby field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-arrives-in-lebanon-s-beirut-to-show-support-after-blast/story-1Y8A2atFI1sAnvqOv2uOpJ.html

The findings by scientists, including those from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US, show that the vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, induced neutralising antibodies in mice when given as two intramuscular injections of a 1-microgramme (mcg) dose three weeks apart.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  Additional experiments found that mice given two injections of the 1-mcg dose and later challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus either five or 13 weeks after the second injection were protected from viral replication in the lungs and nose, the researchers said. Mice challenged seven weeks after only a single dose of 1 mcg or 10 mcg of mRNA-1273 were also protected against viral replication in the lung, they said. NIAID Vaccine Research Center (VRC) scientists worked with investigators from the University of Texas at Austin to identify the atomic structure of the spike protein on the surface of the novel coronavirus. This structure was used by Moderna in the development of the vaccine candidate, according to the researchers. The latest study found that the investigational vaccine also induced robust CD8 T-cell responses in mice. It did not induce the type of cellular immune response that has been linked to vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), according to the researchers.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  This rare, allergic-type inflammation was seen in individuals vaccinated with a whole-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in the 1960s, they said. The researchers explained that VAERD can occur when a vaccine induces an immune response that is not strong enough to protect against infection. They vaccinated mice with sub-protective doses of mRNA-1273 and then challenged the mice with SARS-CoV-2. The mice showed no evidence of enhanced lung pathology or excessive mucus production, indicating the vaccine did not cause enhanced disease, the researchers found. The team noted that the data from these studies, combined with data from studies in nonhuman primates and Phase-1 clinical testing, support the evaluation of mRNA-1273 in clinical efficacy trials. The researchers also explained how their prior research on a candidate MERS-CoV vaccine paved the way for a rapid response to the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-candidate-protects-mice-from-covid-19-finds-study/story-iPyd0Ke9vAAQFgAkdFsxtO.html

He said Macron will host a summit of the EU’s seven Mediterranean nations on Sept. 10 to discuss developments in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyprus-france-to-boost-defense-ties-under-cooperation-deal/story-rJXWZQLJ1PmfEfLHffMApL.html
06-08-2020||World||France’s Macron heads to Lebanon after deadly mega-blast||French President Emmanuel Macron was expected in Lebanon Thursday, two days after a monster blast sowed unfathomable destruction in Beirut and brought Paris’s Middle East protege to its knees.The highest-ranking foreign official to visit the country since Tuesday’s tragedy, Macron will visit the site of the blast that obliterated part of Beirut port and ripped through entire neighbourhoods of the city.Two days on, Lebanon was still reeling from a blast so huge it was felt in neighbouring countries, its mushroom-shaped cloud drawing comparisons with Hiroshima and the devastation caused by its shockwave with the scene of an earthquake.The provisional death toll stood at 137 but with dozens missing and 5,000 wounded, the number of victims was expected to rise as rescue workers continued to comb through the rubble.According to several officials, the explosion was caused by a fire igniting 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser stored in a portside warehouse.“Apocalypse”, “Armageddon” -- Lebanese were lost for words to describe the impact of the blast, which dwarfed anything the country had ever experienced despite its violence-plagued history.The Beirut governor estimated up to 300,000 people may have been made temporarily homeless by the destruction, which he said would cost the debt-ridden country in excess of three billion dollars.International probeEven as they counted their dead and cleaned up the streets, many Lebanese were boiling with anger over a blast they see as the most shocking expression yet of their leadership’s incompetence and corruption.“We can’t bear more than this. This is it. The whole system has got to go,” said 30-year-old Mohammad Suyur as he picked up broken glass in Mar Mikhail, one of the most affected districts in Beirut.Many questions were being asked as to how such a huge cargo of highly explosive material could have been left unsecured in Beirut for years.Prime Minister Hassan Diab and President Michel Aoun promised to put the culprits behind bars but trust in institutions is low and few on the streets of the Lebanese capital held out any hope of an impartial inquiry.Human Rights Watch on Thursday supported mounting calls for an international probe as the only credible option.“An independent investigation with international experts is the best guarantee that victims of the explosion will get the justice they deserve,” the watchdog said.In France, prosecutors on Wednesday opened a probe into the blast over injuries inflicted to 21 French citizens.Paris spearheaded international mobilisation in support of Lebanon, which will mark its centenary next month but has looked like a country on its last legs since defaulting on its debt earlier this year.Flights carrying medical aid, field hospitals, rescue experts and tracking dogs have been flying in since Wednesday to Beirut airport, which sustained no serious damage from the explosion.Political backlashBesides the international emergency effort, the aftermath of the terrible explosion yielded countless uplifting examples of spontaneous solidarity.Much of the cleanup was being handled by volunteers who improvised working groups, bringing their own equipment and making appeals for help on social media.“We’re sending people into the damaged homes of the elderly and handicapped to help them find a home for tonight,” said Husam Abu Nasr, a 30-year-old volunteer.“We don’t have a state to take these steps, so we took matters into our own hands,” he said.Business owners swiftly took to social media, posting offers to repair doors, paint damaged walls or replace shattered windows for free.An unprecedented nationwide and cross-sectarian protest movement that erupted on October 17 last year had looked for a moment like it could topple what it considers a hereditary kleptocracy.The euphoria faded as change failed to materialise and the combination of economic hardship and the coronavirus pandemic left the revolution in tatters.The revulsion at Tuesday’s tragedy and its implications could rekindle the flame however and activists’ social media accounts were rife with calls for a new push to remove Lebanon’s widely reviled political leaders.“Lebanon’s political class should be on guard in the weeks ahead,” Faysal Itani, a deputy director at the Center for Global Policy, wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times.“Shock will inevitably turn to anger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-s-macron-heads-to-lebanon-after-deadly-mega-blast/story-kK2J142TkGJHvVGoFXMbVO.html

06-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un directs aid to North Korean town under virus lockdown||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un directed his government agencies to act immediately to stabilise the livelihoods of residents in a city locked down over coronavirus concerns, state media reported Thursday.North Korea declared an emergency and locked down Kaesong near the inter-Korean border in late July after finding a suspected virus case there. It hasn’t confirmed yet if the person tested positive and still says the country hasn’t had a single case of Covid-19, a claim questioned by outside experts.Kim presided over a meeting Wednesday of the ruling Workers’ Party’s executive policy council where they discussed a special supply of food and funds to Kaesong, the Korean Central News Agency said. The report didn’t specify the measures that were to be taken. North Korea has said the suspected virus patient is a runaway who had fled to South Korea three years ago before slipping back to Kaesong last month. Some experts speculate North Korea is aiming to hold South Korea responsible for a potential virus spread in the North or try to save its face before winning aid items from the South.Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with symptoms. But the Kaesong lockdown is the first such known measure taken in a North Korean city to stem the pandemic.Foreign experts say a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea could cause dire consequences because of its fragile public health care infrastructure and chronic lack of medical supplies. They are also skeptical about North Korea’s claim of having had no infections because the country shares a long, porous border with China, its biggest trading partner, where the pandemic emerged last year.Kaesong, a city with an estimated population of 200,000, is just north of the heavily fortified land border with South Korea. It once hosted the Koreas’ jointly run industrial complex, which has been shut since 2016 amid nuclear tensions, and an inter-Korean liaison office North Korea demolished earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-directs-aid-to-north-korean-town-under-virus-lockdown/story-OnM2rW4LABMObTAwxJ73VJ.html

If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris.”This is being described as an unusual move by observers as the OIC is led by Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Pakistan.Also read: Turkey’s tentacles in India go deeper than thought, says new intel warningIn the TV programme, Qureshi said that if the OIC fails to summon the CFM meeting, Pakistan would be ready to go for a session outside the OIC. In response to another question, he said Pakistan could not wait any further.Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the 57-member bloc of Muslim countries, which is the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN.Qureshi said Pakistan skipped the Kuala Lumpur Summit last December on a Saudi Arabia’s request and now Pakistani Muslims are demanding Riyadh to “show leadership on the issue”.Also read: India pans China after UNSC rebuffs bid to raise Kashmir“We have our own sensitivities.

Later, 23 people were found to have been infected in East China’s Anhui province, state-run Global Times quoted media reports.A woman from Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu, who suffered from the virus showed onset of symptoms such as fever, coughing. Doctors found a decline of leukocyte, blood platelet inside of her body.After a month of treatment, she was discharged from the hospital.At least seven people have died in Anhui and East China’s Zhejiang province due to the virus, the report said.SFTS Virus is not a new virus. China has isolated pathogen of the virus in 2011, and it belongs to the Bunyavirus category.Virologists believe that the infection may have been passed on to humans by ticks and that the virus can be transmitted between humans, it said.Sheng Jifang, a doctor from the first affiliated hospital under Zhejiang University, said that the possibility of human-to-human transmission could not be excluded; patients can pass the virus to others via blood or mucous.Doctors warned that tick bite is the major transmission route, as long as people remain cautious, there’s no need to over panic over such virus contagion, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-dead-60-infected-by-new-infectious-disease-in-china-report/story-ufWdNIYT6FGMDKf1TQMEoM.html
06-08-2020||World||N. Korea’s escalating virus response raises fear of outbreak||North Korea is quarantining thousands of people and shipping food and other aid to a southern city locked down over coronavirus worries, officials said, as the country’s response to a suspected case reinforces doubt about its longstanding claim to be virus-free.But amid the outside skepticism and a stream of North Korean propaganda glorifying its virus efforts, an exchange between Pyongyang and the United Nations is providing new clarity — and actual numbers — about what might be happening in the North, which has closed its borders and cut travel — never a free-flowing stream — by outsider monitors and journalists.In late July, North Korea said it had imposed its “maximum emergency system” to guard against the virus spreading after finding a person with Covid-19 symptoms in Kaesong city, near the border with rival South Korea.State media reported that leader Kim Jong Un then ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong, and said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to South Korea before slipping back into Kaesong last month.North Korea’s public admission of its first potential case and the emergency steps it took prompted immediate outside speculation that Pyongyang may be worried about a big outbreak after months of steadfastly claiming it had no cases. Foreign experts are highly skeptical over the North’s assertion of no cases, in large part because of its long, porous border with China, where the virus emerged, and its history of hiding past disease outbreaks.In a report to the World Health Organization obtained by The Associated Press, North Korea said it has quarantined 64 first contacts of the suspected Keasong case and 3,571 secondary contacts in state-run facilities for 40 days, according to Dr. Edwin Salvador, WHO representative to North Korea.Salvador said in an email to AP that North Korea also informed WHO of the suspected first case, saying that person was tested for Covid-19 but the test results were inconclusive. Salvador said the WHO has requested that North Korea share more information about the person.Salvador said all North Korea’s international borders remain closed, group gatherings are banned, masks are required in public, and all educational institutions, including preschools, are on an extended summer break. Since the end of December, Salvador said North Korea has quarantined and released 25,905 people, 382 of them foreigners.Many outside observers are all but certain the virus already entered North Korea because it closed the border with China, its biggest trading partner, cme weeks after the world’s first known virus cases were recorded in China in December. Monitoring groups in Seoul have steadfastly reported about North Korean virus cases and deaths.A major coronavirus outbreak may cause a humanitarian disaster because of North Korea’s broken public health care system and lack of medical supplies.But it’s unclear how serious the North’s current situation is.“Though a really extensive local outbreak might not have occurred yet, it’s likely that a considerable number of people has been infected,” said analyst Hong Min at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. “Even though North Korea locks itself down, there should be suspected cases there and authorities must aggressively diagnose them. But North Korea has never been transparent about whether it has such a capacity and the will to do so.”The North’s state media have recently churned out articles thick with rallying propaganda that describe the latest anti-virus work as “an all-people’s campaign” that demonstrates the Kim government’s resolve to protect public safety “at any cost.” The articles also say that any individual carelessness or breach of anti-virus guidelines may lead to “critical consequences.”State media said North Korea has deployed more health workers, sanitized personnel and goods, and used loudspeakers to raise public awareness of the virus. The Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that 550,000 aid items have been sent to Kaesong.North Korea’s claimed emergency steps suggest that an outbreak there may have worsened, Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul, said. The North may also aim to win aid from South Korea or others, but wants to save face by saying its suspected Kaesong case is someone who had been in South Korea, he said.Before returning to North Korea, the suspected first case, identified in South Korea as a 24-year-old surnamed Kim, hadn’t tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any patient, South Korean health official Yoon Taeho said.The motive for his return to North Korea isn’t known. More than 33,000 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea over the past 22 years for political and economic reasons, but only a handful of them have returned to North Korea.Police said the man was questioned in June on an allegation that he had sexually assaulted a fellow female North Korean refugee. The man denied the accusation. Last month, the national forensic service told police it found DNA evidence of the assault, and police were continuing to investigate, according to the Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-s-escalating-virus-response-raises-fear-of-outbreak/story-2Xy0go0PtFowALwRgnSotL.html
06-08-2020||World||Human trials of coronavirus vaccine set to begin in Indonesia||Human trials on a potential coronavirus vaccine are due to start in Indonesia next week as part of a collaboration between state-owned pharmaceutical company Bio Farma and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd, a senior researcher said.The launch of the vaccine trial comes as Indonesia has struggled to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, with a consistently escalating number of cases. The phase 3 clinical trial is set to begin on Aug. 11 and will involve 1,620 volunteers aged between 18 and 59, Professor Kusnandi Rusmil, head researcher at Bandung’s Padjadjaran University, told reporters. Half of the participants will receive the vaccine over a six-month period, while the rest will receive a placebo, he said, noting 800 volunteers had been signed up so far. “We want to have our vaccines so we can use it for our people,” Rusmil told reporters. As of Wednesday, Indonesia had recorded 116,871 coronavirus infections and 5,432 deaths - the highest in East Asia. The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a global race for a vaccine, with more than 100 in development and about a dozen already being tested on humans. As Indonesia seeks to stem an ongoing wave of infections, the government has been vocal about the need to secure sufficient supplies of a vaccine amid concerns some nations may miss out.Erick Thohir, Indonesia’s minister for state-owned enterprises, sought to reassure the public this week, saying that Bio Farma would be ready by year-end to produce 250 million doses a year should the Sinovac vaccine prove successful. [L4N2F635B] The Sinovac trial is one of several collaborations to produce a vaccine underway in the world’s fourth-most populous nation.

06-08-2020||World||US sends first shipment of crude to Saudi Arabia in over a decade||The United States sent a shipment of crude to Saudi Arabia in June, data from the US Census Bureau showed on Wednesday, in what appears to be the first such delivery since the US ban on crude exports ended in 2015.The United States shipped about 550,000 barrels, or 18,300 barrels per day (bpd), of crude to Saudi Arabia in June, US Census data shows. The US Energy Information Administration has no recorded instances of a US crude shipment to Saudi Arabia. US Census data shows a miniscule 1,000-barrel shipment to Saudi Arabia in 2002. That was during the four-decade ban on exports. The size of June’s cargo is less than what would be shipped even in the smallest class of crude tankers known as Aframax vessels. Traders said it is possible the cargo was part of another shipment headed to a different country. There are no records of a crude shipment to Saudi Arabia from the United States in Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data.Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest suppliers of crude to the United States. It sent about 1.2 million barrels per day of crude in May, the most in three years, the result of a short-lived oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that erupted just as the coronavirus pandemic was worsening worldwide.That created a major supply glut, which the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and allies agreed to deal with by cutting output by 9.7 million bpd. OPEC oil output rose by more than 1 million bpd in July as Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members ended voluntary additional supply curbs on top of that deal.US crude exports have surged since Washington lifted a ban in 2015, averaging 2.75 million bpd in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sends-first-shipment-of-crude-to-saudi-arabia-in-over-a-decade/story-aVWzaHdlGxsHHp1D4KU6HK.html
06-08-2020||World||US coronavirus fraud losses near $100 million as Covid-19 scams double||US losses from coronavirus-related fraud and identity theft have reached nearly $100 million since the pandemic emerged in March, while complaints of Covid-19 scams have at least doubled in most states, a consumer protection group said on Tuesday.A report from the group, based on government data, highlighted the vast scope of a fast-growing criminal cottage industry - from phony stimulus-check offers to shopping scams and fake cures - preying on Americans already distressed by the pandemic and its economic fallout.Perhaps not surprisingly, the study found California, Florida, New York, Texas and Pennsylvania - the most populous of the 50 US states - to be the five most targeted by coronavirus scams in the country.Together they accounted for about a third of more than 150,000 instances of Covid-related fraud reported nationally by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from mid-March, when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, through July, the report showed.Those cases have cost victims a total of $97.5 million to date, according to the FTC.Even relatively small states saw huge spikes in Covid-related fraud in recent months, led by Maine, whose monthly complaints of coronavirus scams and identity theft quadrupled between March and July, the study said.The report was published by the internet-based group SocialCatfish.com, which helps consumers avoid being defrauded online by determining the true identity of individuals or organizations hiding behind a phony persona.Scams taking advantage of Americans’ desperation in the midst of a deadly pandemic and accompanying economic upheaval “are running rampant,” said Richard Neil, a spokesman for the report’s authors.Several newly flourishing forms of fraud involve fake promises of government stimulus checks, often perpetuated through “robocalls,” texts, or emails seeking personal and financial information the caller supposedly needs to deposit benefits into the victim’s account, according to the report.Price-gouging and other consumer product scams have also become widespread, the study warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-fraud-losses-near-100-million-as-covid-19-scams-double/story-cGEorX7zRxEh3hInoUHKTO.html
06-08-2020||World||Lanka general election: Counting begins, Rajapaksa clan eyes landslide win||The counting of votes in Sri Lanka’s twice-postponed parliamentary election began on Thursday with the powerful Rajapaksa family-run Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) saying it is confident of recording a “historic victory” by securing a two-thirds majority. The election, conducted amidst Covid-19 pandemic fears, concluded in a peaceful manner on Wednesday, with a voter turnout of over 70 per cent, according to Chairman of the National Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya. As the counting of votes began, SLPP founder and its National Organiser Basil Rajapaksa -- who is the younger brother of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa with the eldest being Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa -- said that the party is all set to form a new government, News 1st Channel reported. He said that his party would make history as the only party to come into power within a short span of time since its formation, defeating other old political parties. “We are confident of the SLPP recording a historic victory. We hope for a two-thirds majority at the election but it is up to the people to decide,” he said. He said he is confident that the economy can be revived under the leadership of President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda. The results would be announced by Thursday evening, Deshapriya said. President Gotabaya voted in his Colombo suburb polling station while his elder brother and the prime ministerial aspirant Mahinda voted in his home constituency in the southern district of Hambantota. “We are hopeful of winning two-thirds support,” Mahinda, 74, told reporters after voting. He said his younger brother Gotabaya’s election as president was endorsed by 6.9 million voters last December and that he was hopeful of securing the same support. Former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that only his party, the United National Party, was capable of turning around the economy which is currently in poor state due to Covid-19 and mishandling by the current government. Mahinda’s SLPP is expected to win control of the 225-member assembly by a comfortable margin, according to analysts. President Gotabaya hopes for a two-thirds majority for the SLPP so that he can amend the Constitution to restore presidential powers curbed by a 2015 constitutional change. The president is not a candidate while Mahinda is running from the north western capital district of Kurunegala. Poll stations were manned by over 8,000 health officials who supervised the maintenance of health guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The election, which was postponed twice due to the coronavirus, is to elect a 225-member Parliament for a 5-year term. Over 16 million people were eligible to vote to elect 196 out of a total of 225 lawmakers for the next five years. Twenty-nine others will be named from a national list according to the number of votes received by each party. The election, originally scheduled for April 25, was put off until June 20 as the Covid-19 outbreak hampered the preparations. The August 5 date was later fixed as the health authorities issued guidelines for holding the poll. Some 20 political parties and 34 independent groups are in the fray with over 7,200 candidates from 22 electoral districts. Former president Maithripala Sirisena is running from the north central region of Polonnaruwa under the SLPP banner while former prime minister Wickremesinghe and former leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa are running from the Colombo district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lanka-general-election-counting-begins-rajapaksa-clan-eyes-landslide-win/story-S1F59FLrL9xV3rNYFWwCAK.html
06-08-2020||World||A shattered Beirut leaves Lebanese asking if they have a future||Even before the explosion ripped through his butcher’s shop on one of Beirut’s most fashionable streets, Tony Iyami was just about staying afloat.A lockdown to control the coronavirus pandemic had hit business, compounding a banking crisis that’s left most Lebanese unable to access their savings or borrow. The government is bankrupt, in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout and barely functioning. Then came Tuesday’s cataclysmic blast that erupted out of the capital’s port area shattering all before it, killing at least 100 people and wounding thousands.“We were already hobbling along, surviving step by step, but now we’ve been struck down,” Iyami said in between securing his property and sweeping up debris. “If our officials don’t wake up, we’re already being destroyed, but if they don’t wake up to what’s happening now, this nation is finished.”The explosion, fueled by a vast consignment of ammonium nitrate stored at the port despite repeated safety warnings, couldn’t have come at a worse time for Lebanon, which is enduring its deepest political and financial crisis since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990. As fighting ebbed, former warlords became the nation’s rulers, borrowed up to the hilt and then pillaged state coffers for three decades until there was virtually nothing left. The result is often a state in name only.Daily blackouts last hours, while garbage is left uncollected on the streets. A collapse in the currency has pushed inflation above 50%, erasing life savings. The blast has put the country’s leading port out of action and destroyed the main grain silos, ensuring prices will soar higher as supply chains are disrupted. Weeks of protest that began in October against cronyism and corruption, have fizzled into hopelessness as more Lebanese look to follow previous generations and emigrate.Lebanon has appealed for international help as concerns mount over shortages in a nation that depends heavily on imports. France, Germany and others have offered medical aid and assistance with rescue operations. But decades of corruption and failure to prove that Lebanon’s political class is serious about reform means donors remain reluctant to provide the government with budget support. Any aid is likely to be humanitarian or targeted at specific sectors like health.Unable to generate foreign significant support, oversee an economic recovery or guarantee public safety, Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s administration, cobbled together in January after mass protests brought down the previous government, may not last. Though Lebanon’s problems are an accumulation of nepotistic policies and public mismanagement over the decades, he’s facing criticism for doing too little to manage the country’s multiple crises.“Large elements of the public no longer believes the government is able to manage,” Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at Eurasia Group, said in a note. “The economic crisis will also deepen as the port is the main trade valve and base for many stored goods awaiting clearance.”Talks with the IMF had stalled as it became clear that politicians and bankers could not agree even on the magnitude of financial losses let alone who should pay for them. The government has lost key advisers and officials and the foreign minister resigned this week, frustrated that political elites were too busy protecting their own interests to take the steps demanded by potential lenders to save the economy from ruin.The areas behind the Port of Beirut were some of the trendiest in a politically turbulent city infamous for its nightlife. Packed with bars, restaurants and boutiques as well as residential apartment buildings, Gemmayze, Mar Mikhail and Saifi once throbbed with a mix of fashionable revelers and longtime residents. Beyond the port itself, where the 2,750 tons of hazardous ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse exploded on Tuesday, these old quarters were among the worst hit.Dazed employees picked up broken sheets of metal and glass on Wednesday as volunteers armed with brooms descended on the neighborhood to help with the cleanup. Lebanese Food Bank volunteers handed out water and sandwiches while ambulances sped along streets to pick up wounded people still trapped.“We’ve already been closed for four months by the government because of coronavirus. All they do is fine us. The state doesn’t care. I don’t think they can help us. I don’t think anyone will help,” said Saeed, who owns a bar in Gemmayze that had its windows and doors blown in and kitchen and bar equipment damaged.The blame game has begun. Diab, whose government was appointed in the aftermath of protests demanding the removal of a political elite that had taken Lebanon to the brink, has promised to investigate who was responsible for leaving the deadly chemical pile in storage for six years despite the danger. Critics have demanded an international inquiry into a tragedy they say will otherwise be hushed up.Some port officials have been placed under house arrest pending investigations but the government has yet to say what, if anything, it will do to compensate home and businessowners. That’s left some some facing ruin.Abbas Mattar works in a luxury kitchen showroom near the port that once kitted out high-end homes across Lebanon. Already laid low by the financial crisis, it faces a repair bill running into millions of dollars that may not be fully covered by insurance.“You despair in the end,” he said. “From 1990 to today, all the ministers and MPs need to be killed because you can’t get any dirtier than this. There are people who steal and leave but not to this extent. People are dead and you’re continuing? Still clinging to your chair, to power?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-shattered-beirut-leaves-lebanese-asking-if-they-have-a-future/story-a1mVlAxWlvll80Eg4zk8gO.html

It’s a really big moment for me and for all the Indians across the world,” said a resident. More than a 1,000 people of Indian heritage gathered near the world’s biggest digital billboard displaying images of Lord Ram at New York’s Broadway. Broadway clearly looked like a carnival of sorts.“I am from New Jersey and I am here to be a part of the Ram Janmabhoomi celebration today. It feels great to be a part of it. Our previous generations struggled for over 500 years,” said Manju Nath. Dressed in traditional attire, many Indians travelled from places near and far to celebrate and be a part of the Ram temple celebrations. Many lit candles and earthen lamps, exchanged sweets and savouries. Many among them said they would return to celebrate Diwali each year at Times Square.On Wednesday, New York City witnessed the largest high-definition digital display of Lord Ram and the proposed temple at Ayodhya on Broadway.The digital display of Lord Ram is said to be one of the most expensive digital billboards of the Hindu deity at Times Square. It lit up at 10 am to celebrate the laying of the temple’s foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ayodhya.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, took part in the ‘bhoomi poojan’ at Ram Janambhoomi site.Besides, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Governor Anandiben Patel and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat among several others were present at the ceremony in Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhajans-jai-shri-ram-chants-at-times-square-to-celebrate-bhoomi-poojan-at-ayodhya/story-4m58y9SU3S5uYSpWqlWlhP.html
06-08-2020||World||Fauci expects tens of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses at start of 2021||Drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year, Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases official, said in a Reuters interview on Wednesday, offering a more conservative view of the ramp up than some Trump administration officials.Fauci said there could be a billion vaccine doses available by the end of 2021, and that he is hopeful the world could get past the pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide by then, with the help of a vaccine.US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said last month the US would have hundreds of millions of vaccine doses by early in 2021. Those goals are only possible because drugmakers have agreed to manufacture large supplies of their vaccines even before they know whether they work in order to save time.“The federal government has put more than one egg in the basket,” Fauci said. “We have a pretty comprehensive portfolio that’s going to subsequently be going into clinical trials.”He said there might be an indication that at least one vaccine works and is safe by year end.“I’m cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine that’s effective enough to get approved,” he said.That will not happen because of any pressure to have a vaccine available in time for the Nov. 3 presidential election, he said. Health regulators have promised “they are not going to let political considerations interfere” with the need to deliver a safe COVID-19 vaccine, Fauci said. [nL1N2F72GO]Fauci’s interview with Reuters came on the same day Trump said in an interview with Fox News that the virus is “going away. It will go away like things go away.”Fauci offered a more mixed assessment, saying some parts of the country had done well in containing the spread of the virus, while others were “on fire.”“I hope, and feel it’s possible, that by the time we get through 2021 and go around for another cycle that we’ll have this under control,” he said.The United States is committed to spending billions of dollars on vaccines being produced by companies including Johnson & Johnson

Tokyo has not signed the nuclear weapons ban treaty adopted in 2017, despite its non-nuclear pledge, a failure to act that atomic bombing survivors and pacifist groups call insincere.The US dropped its first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people. The US dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered Aug. 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression in Asia.Survivors, their relatives and other participants marked the 8:15 a.m. blast anniversary with a minute of silence.Thursday’s peace ceremony at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was scaled down because of the coronavirus pandemic. The fewer than 1,000 attendees was one-tenth of those attending in past years.Some survivors and their relatives prayed at the park’s cenotaph before the ceremony. The registry of the atomic bombing victims is stored at the cenotaph, whose inscription reads “Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the mistake.”Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in his speech at the ceremony, said Japan is committed to nuclear weapons ban but a nuclear free world cannot be achieved overnight and that it has to start from dialogue between opposite sides.“Japan’s position is to serve as a bridge between different sides and patiently promote their dialogue and actions to achieve a world without nuclear weapons,” Abe said. Nuclear policies are divided amid a harsh security environment, so it is necessary to create common ground first, he said.An aging group of survivors, known as hibakusha, feel a growing urgency to tell their stories, in hopes of reaching a younger generation.On the 75th anniversary, elderly survivors, whose average age now exceeds 83, lamented the slow progress of nuclear disarmament.They expressed anger over what they said was the Japanese government’s reluctance to help and listen to those who suffered from the atomic bombing.“Abe’s words and actions don’t seem to match,” said Manabu Iwasa, 47, who came to the park to pray for his father, a survivor who died at age 87 in March. “Japan apparently sides with the US and make more effort toward nuclear weapons ban,” he said. “It’s frustrating, but there is not much we individuals can do.”Keiko Ogura, 84, who survived the atomic bombing at age 8, wants non-nuclear states to pressure Japan into signing the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty. “Many survivors are offended by the prime minister of this country who does not sign the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty,” she said.Matsui urged world leaders, especially those from nuclear weapons states, to visit Hiroshima and see the reality of the atomic bombing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survivors-mark-75th-anniversary-of-world-s-1st-atomic-attack/story-qFsEw2rvZv2BRKdsYB9bSJ.html
06-08-2020||World||New drug RLF-100 shows dramatic results for critical Covid-19 patients||Doctors at a hospital in Houston have used a new drug called RLF-100, also known as aviptadil, that has led to rapid recovery from respiratory failure in critically ill Covid-19 patients. The drug has been approved by the FDA for emergency use at multiple clinical sites in patients who are too ill to enter the FDA’s Phase 2/3 trials. Houston Methodist Hospital was the first to report the rapid recovery of patients on ventilators and those with severe medical conditions after three days of treatment.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  Aviptadil is a formulation of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), which is present in high concentrations in the lungs and known to block various inflammatory cytokines. NeuroRx and Relief Therapeutics have partnered to develop the drug. According to a statement from the drug maker NeuroRX, independent researchers have reported that aviptadil blocked replication of the SARS coronavirus in human lung cells and monocytes.Also read: Zydus to start second phase of Covid-19 vaccine candidate trials today According to the report, a 54-year-old man who contracted Covid-19 while being treated for rejection of a double lung transplant came off a ventilator within four days. And, similar results were seen in more than 15 patients. The drug appeared to have rapidly cleared pneumonitis findings on an X-ray, improved blood oxygen and a 50 per cent or greater average decrease in laboratory markers associated with Covid-19 inflammation, the statement said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “No other antiviral agent has demonstrated rapid recovery from viral infection and demonstrated laboratory inhibition of viral replication,” said Prof. Jonathan Javitt, CEO and chairman of NeuroRx. “We are conducting placebo-controlled trials to see whether the observations made in the case-control and open-label studies will be confirmed for less ill patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. Our independent Data Monitoring Committee will be conducting an interim analysis of these data later this month,” Javitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-drug-rlf-100-shows-dramatic-results-for-critical-covid-19-patients/story-wcWIo9Kcez00yTCppoe0lJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Twitter, Facebook block Trump video, citing coronavirus misinformation||Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. blocked a video shared by accounts linked to U.S. President Donald Trump for violating their policies on coronavirus misinformation.The Trump re-election campaign’s Twitter account, @TeamTrump, was briefly banned from sending new tweets after it posted a clip of an interview Trump did Wednesday with Fox News in which he said children were “virtually immune” from the Covid-19 coronavirus. “[Children] don’t have a problem, they just don’t have a problem,” Trump said in the video as part of an argument for why schools should reopen. “It doesn’t have an impact on them. I’ve watched some doctors say they’re totally immune.”Trump posted the same video to his account on Facebook, which removed the clip shortly before Twitter froze the campaign’s account. Both social-media companies have policies that forbid sharing misleading information about the coronavirus that could cause people harm.The @TeamTrump account resumed posting Wednesday evening after the video appeared to have been taken down. “The original Tweet from @TeamTrump is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation, and we’ve required removal,” according to a post from Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio. Though the president also shared the video on his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, that account wasn’t punished because the clip was re-shared from the campaign’s feed instead of uploaded directly, Twitter said.“Silicon Valley is hopelessly biased against the President and only enforces the rules in one direction,” Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a tweet in response to the company’s actions.The Washington Post initially reported that Twitter had barred Trump from posting to his personal account, but later corrected its story to say that the temporary ban had only impacted the @TeamTrump campaign account.Twitter, which had for years been criticized for its lack of action against the U.S. president’s controversial tweets, has taken a more aggressive stand against the U.S. President in recent months. In late May, the company flagged two Trump posts about mail-in ballots, part of a new policy preventing false or confusing information related to voting. Shortly after that, Twitter highlighted another tweet for violating its rules against glorifying violence when Trump tweeted that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a reference to protests against police brutality and racism in Minneapolis.Facebook has also been under fire for what critics say is a failure to enforce its rules against Trump. In early July, an outside auditor found Facebook didn’t enforce its own voter suppression policies against the president when he posted misleading information about mail-in ballots. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has said that fighting misinformation on Covid-19 is easier than on other topics because the company has reliable sources to help determine what is true, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Trump’s comments on children and Covid contradicted what officials at those organizations say about the virus.“Children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease,” according to the WHO website. The CDC says that while children don’t appear to be at higher risk for Covid-19 than adults, there are some children who have contracted the virus, and recommends they follow the same social distancing guidelines as adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-facebook-block-trump-video-citing-coronavirus-misinformation/story-IuvlBZHaSvoDsdvajrtJDJ.html

It said the attackers managed to escape.East senior superintendent of police Sajid Sadozai said two unidentified persons riding a motorcycle threw an RGD-1 grenade at the rally and fled, another report on the Dawn website claimed.One person was stated to be critical while no deaths were reported yet, the Dawn quoted Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator for the Sindh health minister, as saying. He had earlier ruled out that the blast was caused by a planted bomb, the report said.The incident happened near a mosque and shattered windows of cars nearby. A heavy contingent of security forces reached the site after the incident.Eyewitnesses said the blast caused a stampede and severely injured five people on the site, according to the Geo News report. “The banned Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) claimed responsibility for the attack through social media,” the Dawn said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-40-people-injured-in-blast-at-karachi-rally/story-ClUn4vJnfArXHVEBHgySvI.html
06-08-2020||World||Canada signs up with Pfizer, Moderna for 2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine||After having been criticised for reacting slowly to the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in a shortage of personal protective equipment like masks at the outset of the crisis, the Canadian Government is taking steps to ensure an early supply of a vaccine, when available. The Government announced that it has entered into agreements with two companies “to secure millions of doses” of the vaccine.Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand said that after review by the Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force the government had signed agreements with the companies Pfizer and Moderna for the vaccine candidates. Anand said that “if all goes well” Canada could get deliveries in 2021 while adding that the government are in talks with other vaccine candidates. “The Government is negotiating and signing agreements with a number of leading pharmaceutical companies to establish a guaranteed supply base of potential vaccine candidates,” a statement said. Anand, an Indo-Canadian Minister, pointed out that vaccination may not be made mandatory for Canadians, echoing the stand of the country’s public health authorities.“We are now squarely focused on preparing Canada for an eventual vaccine. Given intense global competition, we are taking an aggressive approach to secure access to the most promising candidates so that we will be ready to vaccinate all Canadians as quickly as possible,” Anand said. She highlighted that the initial efforts earlier had been directed at procuring PPE and suppliesThe formation of a Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force was announced at the same time, by Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains.At a media interaction, Anand said, “Canadians are at the front of the line when a vaccine becomes available. Whenever the vaccine does become available, Health Canada will review its safety, efficacy and manufacturing quality before it is approved for use in the country.”Bains noted in a statement that the government was “working hard on all possible fronts to deliver safe and effective treatments and vaccines against Covid-19 for Canadians as fast as possible.”Anand did not disclose the exact number of doses that have been ordered in advanced other than to put that figure in millions. She also would not divulge the names of other pharmaceutical or biotech companies with which the Government is also negotiating for potential vaccine procurement.Canada has so far logged 118,140 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections, and recorded 8962 deaths. The number of fatalities has declined significantly from the peak in April, with only four being reported on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-signs-up-with-pfizer-moderna-for-2-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-mLmbmCFPfachrHa5AmAuhN.html
06-08-2020||World||Common cold infection may help body in recognising Covid-19: Study||The immune system’s memory helper T cells which recognise the common cold virus and help the body fight it off, also identifies some parts of the novel coronavirus, according to a study whose findings may explain why some people have milder Covid-19 cases than others. The research, published in the journal Science, noted that the immune system’s memory T cells keep track of the viruses they have seen before, giving the cells a headstart in recognising and fighting off repeat invaders. However, the scientists, including those from La Jolla Institute (LJI) in the US, cautioned that it is too soon to say whether such pre-existing immune cell memory affects Covid-19 clinical outcomes.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “We have now proven that, in some people, pre-existing T cell memory against common cold coronaviruses can cross-recognise SARS-CoV-2, down to the exact molecular structures,” said Daniela Weiskopf, a co-author of the study from LJI. “This could help explain why some people show milder symptoms of disease while others get severely sick,” Weiskopf said. Alessandro Sette, another co-author of the study from LJI, noted that the reactivity of the immune system may translate to different degrees of protection. “Having a strong T cell response, or a better T cell response may give you the opportunity to mount a much quicker and stronger response,” Sette said. An earlier study by Sette and his team had shown that 40 to 60 per cent of people who were never exposed to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had T cells that reacted to the virus. According to the study, the immune systems in these individuals recognised fragments of the virus it had never seen before -- a finding which was also reported among people in the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, and the UK. In the current research, the scientists assessed samples collected from study participants who had never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. They defined the exact parts of the virus that are responsible for the cross-reactive T cell response. Their analysis showed that unexposed individuals can produce a range of memory T cells that are equally reactive against SARS-CoV-2, and four types of common cold coronaviruses. Based on the finding, the scientists said fighting off a common cold coronavirus could teach the T cell compartment to recognise some parts of SARS-CoV-2 as well. They believe this process provides evidence for the hypothesis that common cold viruses can, in fact, induce cross-reactive T cell memory against SARS-CoV-2. “We knew there was pre-existing reactivity, and this study provides very strong direct molecular evidence that memory T cells can ‘see’ sequences that are very similar between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2,” Sette said. The scientists found that while some cross-reactive T cells targeted the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein -- the region of the virus that recognises and binds to human cells -- pre-existing immune memory was also directed to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Sette noted that the finding is relevant since most vaccine candidates target the spike protein. The findings, according to the researchers, suggest the hypothesis that inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 targets might enhance the potential to take advantage of this cross reactivity, and could further enhance vaccine potency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/common-cold-infection-may-help-body-in-recognising-covid-19-study/story-CPg8Uj0Bn61JEFVMurJmtL.html
06-08-2020||World||8 Western nations urge Russian forces to leave Georgia||The United States and seven European countries marked Friday’s 12th anniversary of the conflict between Russia and Georgia with a call to Moscow to withdraw forces from Abkhazia and South Ossetia and allow medical evacuations and aid deliveries especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.The western nations said after a closed briefing to the UN Security Council on Wednesday by Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca that Russia’s continuing military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and its recognition of “the so-called independence of the regions” violates Georgia’s territorial integrity and undermines its sovereignty.Georgia made a botched attempt to regain control of its breakaway province of South Ossetia during the presidency of Mikhail Saakashvili, sparking the war with Russia that began on Aug. 7, 2008. Russia recognized the independence of South Ossetia as well as the breakaway province of Abkhazia and set up military bases there.The US and European nations said in a joint statement that they are “extremely concerned” about Russia’s “intensification of the so-called `borderization process’ over the past year, including during the global COVID-19 pandemic.”They said Russia’s actions further divide communities and put at risk “the health and lives of the conflict-affected population.”“Throughout this already challenging time, the de-facto authorities exercising effective control over the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have continued the practice of arbitrary detentions along the administrative boundary lines,” the statement said. “De facto South Ossetian authorities have repeatedly denied emergency medical evacuations and incoming humanitarian aid.”The US, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Norway and Ireland also expressed concern about “the ongoing disinformation campaign by Russia about the pandemic and related health issues.”“These acts prolong the conflict, threaten peace and stability, interfere with the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and negatively impact the health and safety of people across Georgia, destabilizing the region as a whole,” the eight nations said.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky responded, tweeting that the joint statement is “A beautiful fiction. But only a fiction.”He made no mention of the pandemic but said Georgia’s “aggression which triggered all the problems for this country & the region was officially confirmed in 2009 by the report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the conflict.”“As a result of former Georgian leadership’s reckless policy unscrupulously encouraged by the US and some of its satellites 2 new independent states have emerged on the global map and this is the reality that cannot be ignored,” Polyansky tweeted.“Politicians promoting selfish geopolitical interests managed so far to drive a wedge between our countries but they failed to do so between our 2 peoples,” he added. “Discussions like today attempt to undermine the ongoing process of reconciliation of Russia and Georgia.”The US and Europeans called again on Russia to fully implement agreements in August 2008 to withdraw its armed forces to positions before hostilities began, and to establish an international security mechanism.Representatives of Georgia, Russia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the United States have held talks in Geneva since October 2008 to address the consequences of the Georgia conflict under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the United Nations.The US and Europeans expressed regret at Russia’s “lack of commitment” in the Geneva talks on the topic of refugees and Georgians internally displaced, and reiterated support for human rights, including for those forcibly displaced during the conflict to return safely to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-western-nations-urge-russian-forces-to-leave-georgia/story-c8PGAqOjyyQcZGs72IxdiO.html
06-08-2020||World||Beirut reels from huge blast as death toll climbs to at least 135||Lebanese rescue teams pulled out bodies and hunted for missing people on Wednesday from the wreckage caused by a massive warehouse explosion that sent a devastating blast wave across Beirut, killing at least 135.Prime Minister Hassan Diab declared three days of mourning from Thursday as early investigations blamed negligence for the explosion at Beirut port, which has left tens of people missing and injured more than 5,000 others.Up to a quarter of a million people were left without homes fit to live in, officials said, after shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland.The death toll was expected to rise from the blast, which officials blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.The explosion was the most powerful ever in Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war that ended three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections. The blast rattled buildings on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about 100 miles (160 km) away.“No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city,” President Michel Aoun said in an address to the nation during an emergency cabinet session.Aoun said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, was stored for six years at the port after it was seized.The government was “determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable,” he said.An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on “inaction and negligence”, saying “nothing was done” by committees and judges involved in the matter to order the removal of hazardous material.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material to be put under house arrest, ministerial sources told Reuters.Officials have not confirmed the origin of an initial blaze that sparked the explosion, although a security source and local media said it was started by welding work.‘COLLAPSE OF LEBANON’For many, the blast was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which had since been rebuilt.Ordinary Lebanese, who have lost jobs and watched savings evaporate in the country’s financial crisis, blamed politicians who have overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance.“This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class,” said Hassan Zaiter, 32, a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut.Relatives gathered at a cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing as the search continued. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour. Some victims were hurled out to sea by the powerful blast.The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed. Health officials reported that hospitals were running out of beds and equipment to attend to the injured.Beirut’s Clemenceau Medical Center was “like a slaughterhouse, blood covering the corridors and the lifts,” said Sara, one of its nurses.Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud told Al Hadath TV that collective losses from the blast might reach as high as $15 billion, including indirect losses related to business.“This is the killer blow for Beirut, we are a disaster zone,” said Bilal, a man in his 60s, in the downtown area.The World Bank Group said on Wednesday it would work with Lebanon’s partners to mobilize public and private financing for reconstruction and recovery. It was unclear what effect the disaster would have on the country’s difficult negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, however.Offers of international support poured in.Gulf Arab states, who in the past were major financial supporters of Lebanon but recently stepped back because of what they say is Iranian meddling, sent planes with medical equipment and other supplies.Turkey said it would send 20 doctors to help treat the injured, as well as medical and relief assistance. Iraq pledged fuel aid, while Iran offered food and a field hospital.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted: “We sympathize with the dear Lebanese citizens and stand by them in the painful tragedy of the Beirut port explosion ... Patience in the face of this incident will be a golden leaf of honour for Lebanon.”The United States, Britain and other Western nations, which have been demanding political and economic change in Lebanon, also offered aid. Germany, the Netherlands and Cyprus offered specialised search and rescue teams.Two French planes were expected to arrive on Thursday with specialist rescue personnel and equipment, and President Emmanuel Macron was due to visit on Thursday.FOOD SECURITY“This is a catastrophe for Beirut and Lebanon,” Mayor Jamal Itani told Reuters while inspecting damage.The port district was left a tangled wreck, disabling the nation’s main route for imports needed to feed a nation of more than 6 million people.The country’s main grain silo at the port was destroyed in the blast and Beirut Governor Abboud said a crisis might develop without international intervention.Lebanon was already struggling to house and feed refugees fleeing conflict in neighbouring Syria and has no trade or other ties with its only other neighbour Israel.“On a scale, this explosion is scaled down from a nuclear bomb rather than up from a conventional bomb,” said Roland Alford, managing director of British explosive ordnance disposal firm Alford Technologies. “This is huge.”The blast also prompted the Special Tribunal for Lebanon on Wednesday to postpone its verdict in the trial over the 2005 bombing that killed ex-Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri to Aug. 18. The tribunal’s decision had been expected this Friday.The U.N.-backed court put on trial four suspects from the Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah. Hariri and 21 others were killed by a big truck bomb in another area of the Beirut waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the U.S. government had not totally ruled out the possibility that Tuesday’s explosion was an attack, and said it is still gathering intelligence on the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-reels-from-huge-blast-as-death-toll-climbs-to-at-least-135/story-4MaHIbo4ZXnLXk6BCHWm8N.html

The person discussed details on condition of anonymity because the fundraiser was closed to news media coverage.President Trump briefly addressed the contributors after he telephoned his daughter during the event and she put the call on speakerphone.Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said proceeds will be used to pay for field work and to highlight Trump’s pro-worker agenda for voters.Ivanka Trump gets the most requests, after the president, to appear at fundraisers and other events, officials said. She plans to appear at another fundraiser next week in Wyoming.“Ivanka is a tremendous voice for the re-election effort,” McDaniel said in a statement. “Supporters across the country are eager to hear from her on issues ranging from the economy to workforce development and paid family leave.” Ivanka Trump campaigned for her father’s 2016 campaign, including before and after the birth of her third child. She works in the White House as an unpaid adviser to the president.The USD 4 million raised Wednesday topped a recent online fundraiser for Joe Biden, Trump’s likely Democratic opponent.Massachusetts Sen.

06-08-2020||World||Drug regulators assured scientists that political pressure wont’ affect approval of a vaccine: Fauci||US regulators have assured scientists that political pressure will not determine when a coronavirus vaccine is approved even as the White House hopes to have one ready ahead of the November presidential election, the country’s leading infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday.“We have assurances, and I’ve discussed this with the regulatory authorities, that they promise that they are not going to let political considerations interfere with a regulatory decision,” Dr. Fauci told Reuters in an interview.“We’ve spoken explicitly about that, because the subject obviously comes up, and the people in charge of the regulatory process assure us that safety and efficacy is going to be the prime consideration,” he said.President Donald Trump, a Republican, is behind Democrat Joe Biden in public opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election. Trump has lost ground in part due to voter concerns over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.A vaccine announcement in October could help Trump’s chances in the nationwide vote.“I’m certain of what the White House would like to see, but I haven’t seen any indication of pressure at this point to do anything different than what we’re doing,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“I mean obviously they’ve expressed: ‘Gee, it would be nice, the sooner the better.’“Trump has suggested publicly that a vaccine could be ready long before the end of the year. In the interview Fauci offered a more conservative view, suggesting drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year.Fauci and other doctors on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, including its coordinator Deborah Birx, have come under criticism from the president for portraying the pandemic in less rosy terms than he has sought to emphasize.Trump said in a recent interview with Axios that the virus was “under control.”Asked if he shared that assessment, Fauci said some parts of the country were more under control than others.“We’re a big country. You can pick out some parts of the country that are looking good and you could say is under control; you could pick some parts of the country that are on fire, in the sense, I mean you’re having outbreaks that you know you don’t get 70,000 cases a day when nothing’s going on.”More than 157,000 people have died in the United States from COVID-19 and more than 4.7 million cases have been reported in the country and its territories, according to Reuters tallies.Earlier this week the president criticized Dr. Birx for giving a sobering description of the state of the pandemic.Fauci said the doctors try to focus on the science rather than political distractions.“What we try to do, you know maybe some could do it better than others, is to focus like a laser on what we’re supposed to be doing: getting this epidemic under control,” he said.Fauci said differences in the seriousness with which people had taken the virus in the United States had hampered the response to the pandemic in comparison to other countries.“We have somewhat of a disjointed approach to things,” he said. “If we had a uniformity of it, and everybody rode together in the same boat, we probably would do much better.”Fauci and other medical professionals have urged Americans to wear masks and maintain a social distance to prevent the spread of the virus. He lamented the fact that mask-wearing had become political earlier in the pandemic.Trump declined to wear a mask in public for months and Vice President Mike Pence faced criticism for not wearing one when he visited the Mayo Clinic in April.“Thank goodness that’s changed,” Fauci said. “I’m very pleased now that we’re seeing the vice president consistently wearing a mask, the president tweeting that you should be wearing masks. That’s a good thing.

06-08-2020||World||Coronavirus testing in United States is dropping, even as deaths mount||US testing for the coronavirus is dropping even as infections remain high and the death toll rises by more than 1,000 a day, a worrisome trend that officials attribute largely to Americans getting discouraged over having to wait hours to get a test and days or weeks to find out the results.An Associated Press analysis found that the number of tests per day slid 3.6 per cent over the past two weeks to 750,000, with the count falling in 22 states. That includes places like Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri and Iowa where the percentage of positive tests is high and continuing to climb, an indicator that the virus is still spreading uncontrolled.Amid the crisis, some health officials are calling for the introduction of a different type of test that would yield results in a matter of minutes and would be cheap and simple enough for millions of Americans to test themselves — but would also be less accurate.“There’s a sense of desperation that we need to do something else,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute.Widespread testing is considered essential to containing the outbreak as the US approaches a mammoth 5 million confirmed infections and more than 157,000 deaths out of over 700,000 worldwide.Testing demand is expected to surge again this fall, when schools reopen and flu season hits, most likely outstripping supplies and leading to new delays and bottlenecks.Some of the decline in testing over the past few weeks was expected after backlogged commercial labs urged doctors to concentrate on their highest-risk patients. But some health and government officials are seeing growing public frustration and waning demand.In Iowa, state officials are reporting less interest in testing, despite ample supplies. The state’s daily testing rate peaked in mid-July but has declined 40 per cent in the last two weeks.“We have the capacity. Iowans just need to test,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said last week.Jessica Moore of rural Newberry, South Carolina, said that after a private lab lost her Covid-19 test results in mid-July, she had to get re-tested at a pop-up site organised by the state.Moore and her husband arrived early on a Saturday morning at the site, a community center, where they waited for two hours for her test. Moore watched in the rear-view mirror as people drove up, saw the long line of cars, and then turned around and left.“If people have something to do on a Saturday and they want to get tested, they’re not going to wait for two hours in the South Carolina heat for a test, especially if they’re not symptomatic,” Moore said.Before travelling from Florida to Delaware last month, Laura DuBose Schumacher signed up to go to a drive-up testing site in Orlando with her husband. They were given a one-hour window in which to arrive.They got there at the start of the window, but after 50 minutes it looked as if the wait would be another hour. Others who had gone through the line told them that they wouldn’t get their results until five days later, a Monday, at the earliest. They were planning to travel the next day, so they gave up.“Monday would have been pointless, so we left the line,” Schumacher said.The number of confirmed infections in the US has topped 4.7 million, with new cases running at nearly 60,000 a day on average, down from more than 70,000 in the second half of July.US testing is built primarily on highly sensitive molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the coronavirus. Although the test is considered the gold standard for accuracy, experts increasingly say the country’s overburdened lab system is incapable of keeping pace with the outbreak and producing results within two or three days, the time frame crucial to isolating patients and containing the virus.“They’re doing as good a job as they possibly can do, but the current system will not allow them to keep up with the demand,” said Mara Aspinall of Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions.Testing delays have led researchers at Harvard and elsewhere to propose a new approach using so-called antigen tests — rapid technology already used to screen for flu, strep throat and other common infections. Instead of detecting the virus itself, such tests look for viral proteins, or antigens, which are generally considered a less accurate measure of infection.A number of companies are studying Covid-19 antigen tests in which you spit on a specially coated strip of paper, and if you are infected, it changes color. Experts say the speed and widespread availability of such tests would more than make up for their lower precision.While no such tests for the coronavirus are on the US market, experts say the technology is simple and the hurdles are more regulatory than technical. The Harvard researchers say production could quickly be scaled into the millions.A proposal from the Harvard researchers calls for the federal government to distribute USD 1 saliva-based antigen tests to all Americans so that they can test themselves regularly, perhaps even daily.Even with accuracy as low as 50 per cent, researchers estimate the paper strip tests would uncover five times more Covid-19 cases than the current laboratory-based approach, which federal officials estimate catches just 1 in 10 infections.But the approach faces resistance in Washington, where federal regulators have required at least 80 per cent accuracy for new Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-in-united-states-is-dropping-even-as-deaths-mount/story-aZ8NBsxDgxNeKuc8fUDhHL.html

They said a Jamaat-i-Islami rally was attacked with a grenade in Karachi on Wednesday evening.The blast took place near the main truck that was part of the rally in the Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, when two persons on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade, according to a Jamaat-i-Islami spokesperson. This was also confirmed by a senior police official Sajid Sadozai, who claimed that it was an RGD-1 grade grenade.Jamaat-i-Islami had taken out the rally to mark the first anniversary of India’s decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019.Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA), a banned outfit in Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack through social media.Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator to the Sindh health minister said one person was in a critical condition and no deaths had been reported so far.She earlier said five of the injured were taken to Al Mustafa Hospital, seven to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), 11 to Aga Khan University Hospital and 10 to Liaquat National Hospital, according to Dawn News website.It quoted Yousuf as saying that a majority of the injured received “very minor injuries”, while some were discharged after preliminary medical treatment.Dawn reported that the explosion, which took place near Bait-ul-Mukarram Masjid, also shattered the windows of nearby cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/39-injured-in-a-grenade-attack-on-a-rally-in-pakistan-s-karachi/story-cAZCJIkkvfHBfsXBOoMOuN.html

In the centre is a huge industrial plant which produces chemicals. One night there is an explosion in the plant. A deadly gas settles over much of the city and the sleeping people. By morning thousands are dead”.“The agony doesn’t stop there: in the decades that follow, many thousands more die from the effects of the gas, or from birth deformities; hundreds of thousands more have their lives ruined; and the land and water around the plant are poisoned. This is not fiction”.“This happened, in 1984 in a place called Bhopal in India. I’ve been to Bhopal and visited the site. The chemical plant is still there, derelict and rusting away. People still live all around it, many of them the victims of the explosion or their children. The land is still poisoned and the water is still undrinkable. Nearly forty years on, no one has been held accountable. The sense of loss and injustice is visceral”.“Bhopal is a textbook example of failed regulation. A hazardous industrial plant was allowed to operate in the middle of one of the most densely populated cities in the world without proper checks and precautions until one day disaster struck”, he said.The Bhopal disaster, Bevan added, is the reason why he believes in regulation of the right kind that has teeth, because not everyone plays by the rules. He cited examples of how regulation has made a major difference in England’s environment.The disaster was caused by chemical methyl isocyanate leaking from the Union Carbide’s plant on the night of December 2 and 3, 1984, killing at least 3,700 people, hundreds of thousands injured and many more adversely affected for life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/case-of-failed-regulation-uk-environment-agency-chief-on-bhopal-gas-horror/story-80faPOYzPjBzl8d9ATKPeJ.html
06-08-2020||World||China, US to review trade deal, air other grievances on August 15: Report||Senior US and Chinese officials will review the implementation of their Phase 1 trade deal and likely air mutual grievances in an increasingly tense relationship during an August 15 videoconference, two people familiar with the plans said.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the principal negotiators for the two countries, will participate in the meeting, an initial six-month review of the pact activated on February 15.The meeting plans were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The US Trade Representative’s office and the US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.Under the Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, China had pledged to boost purchases of US goods by some $200 billion over 2017 levels, including agricultural and manufactured products, energy and services.But China, battered by the global coronavirus recession, is far behind the pace needed to meet its first-year goal of a $77 billion increase. Imports of farm goods have been lower than the 2017 level, far behind the 50% increase needed to meet the 2020 target of $36.5 billion.Beijing has bought only 5% of the energy products needed to meet the Phase 1 first year goal of $25.3 billionOne of the people familiar with the plans said Chinese officials hoped to discuss other issues beyond the Phase 1 trade deal implementation.“It’s both the normal semi-annual review and also comes at a time when the relationship continues to deteriorate. Naturally there is much to discuss,” the person said.China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said on Tuesday that there was always a plan for high-level consultations six months into the pact, but the two sides have remained in regular contact over the trade deal.“If they do have such a meeting I guess it will be very positive,” Cui told a virtual event sponsored by the Aspen Security Forum.Trump has threatened to end the trade pact over China’s handling of the coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, and tensions have risen over US sanctions related to China’s security crackdown on Hong Kong.The latest irritant between the world’s two largest economies is Trump’s threat to ban US use of the Chinese-owned video app TikTok unless it is sold to a non-Chinese buyer.White House officials on Tuesday could not say how Trump’s suggestion that the US Treasury get a significant portion of the proceeds of the sale - potentially to US software giant Microsoft - could be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-to-review-trade-deal-air-other-grievances-on-august-15-report/story-YsK7wN7mWXMIjlZrLEb3BM.html

He told reporters at the White House: “It would seem like it based on the explosion. I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a — some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of a event. ... They seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.”Trump offered condolences to the victims and said the United States stood ready to assist Lebanon. “It looks like a terrible attack,” he said.The explosion flattened much of a port and damaged buildings across the capital, sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky. In addition to those who died, more than 3,000 other people were injured, with bodies buried in the rubble, officials said.The cause of the blast was not immediately known, but initial reports suggested a fire had detonated a warehouse at the port. Abbas Ibrahim, chief of Lebanese General Security, said it might have been caused by highly explosive material that was confiscateWasd from a ship some time ago and stored at the port. Local television channel LBC said the material was ammonium nitrate.Witnesses reported seeing a strange, orange cloud like that which appears when toxic nitrogen dioxide gas is released after an explosion involving nitrates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-generals-feel-beirut-blast-that-killed-70-was-likely-an-attack/story-ydqGeFpouwsAwlB5imNfEN.html
06-08-2020||World||China sentences 3rd Canadian to death on drug charges||China has sentenced a third Canadian citizen to death on drug charges amid a steep decline in relations between the two countries.The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court announced Xu Weihong’s penalty on Thursday and said an alleged accomplice, Wen Guanxiong, had been given a life sentence.Death sentences are automatically referred to China’s highest court for review.The brief court statement gave no details but local media in the southern Chinese city at the heart of the country’s manufacturing industry said Xu and Wen had gathered ingredients and tools and began making the drug ketamine in October 2016, then stored the final product in Xu’s home in Guangzhou’s Haizhu district.Police later confiscated more than 120 kilograms (266 pounds) of the drug from Xu’s home and another address, the reports said. Ketamine is a powerful pain killer that has become popular among club goers in China and elsewhere.Relations between China and Canada soured over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive and the daughter of the founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei, at Vancouver’s airport in late 2018. The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company’s dealings with Iran. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China’s rise as a global technology power.In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Soon after, China handed a death sentence to convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg in a sudden retrial, and in April 2019, gave the death penalty to a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei in a multinational drug smuggling case.China has also placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola seed oil, in an apparent attempt to pressure Ottawa into releasing Meng.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said there was no connection between Xu’s sentencing and current China-Canada relations.“I would like to stress that China’s judicial authorities handle the relevant case independently in strict accordance with Chinese law and legal procedures,” Wang said at a daily briefing Thursday. “This case should not inflict any impact on China-Canada relations.”Like many Asian nations, China deals out stiff penalties for manufacturing and selling illegal drugs, including the death penalty. In December 2009, Pakistani-British businessman Akmal Shaikh was executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin, despite allegations he was mentally disturbed.“Death sentences for drug-related crimes that are extremely dangerous will help deter and prevent such crimes,” Wang said. “China’s judicial authorities handle cases involving criminals of different nationalities in accordance with law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-3rd-canadian-to-death-on-drug-charges/story-h6YLkFAodAJUIMExuZvxMO.html
06-08-2020||World||In a rebuff to Pakistan, UNSC again says Kashmir should be resolved bilaterally||The UN Security Council on Wednesday rebuffed another attempt by Pakistan to raise Kashmir at the body, and made it abundantly clear this is an issue for India and Pakistan to resolve bilaterally, as has been India’s position . Four of the five permanent members — the US, UK, France and Russia — sided firmly with India, as has become a practice.“In today’s meeting of UN Security Council which was closed, informal, not recorded and without any outcome, almost all countries underlined that J&K was bilateral issue & did not deserve time and attention of Council,” said TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, in a tweet. Also read: Imran Khan’s Pakistan might end up regretting its new ‘political map’. Here is whyPakistan had sought a discussion on Kashmir — for the third time since last August — in a letter to the council which, as some diplomats said, “was match-fixed” to coincide with the anniversary of the revocation of the Article 370. And China, batting for its “all-weather friend”, made it happen as it had before, calling for a discussion under Ayn Other Business practice, which allows any member to raise an issue for discussion.But they couldn’t fix the outcome. “They chose the date carefully but it proved to be a short-sighted move as everyone else came to India’s support,” said a UN diplomat ho had monitored the meeting closely. “Most members felt this needs to be resolved bilaterally and it does not deserve to come to be security council, and there was a sense that this was a waste of the body’s time.”This time Pakistan and China had the support also of Indonesia, which holds UNSC’s rotational chair for August. Though Indonesia is among the few countries to side with Pakistan on Kashmir publicly, including Turkey, it may not have had a choice this time though, said another UN diplomat cautioning against smothering it with all the blame.“Once a P-5 member (China) called for discussing Kashmir under AOB, Indonesia was really in no position to prevent it.” Even China, a as a permanent member couldn’t prevent an AOB discussion on Hong Kong in May.Also read: Indian envoy to UN outlines Pakistan’s direct involvement in manufacturing terrorIn the end, however, Indonesia came through for India, according to one of the diplomats cited above, as it agreed with others that the dispute needed to be resolved bilaterally.This was an informal consultation that was held behind closed doors and no records were kept of who said what, which would have happened in a formal and open meeting. Pakistan has sought open and formal meetings of the council to grandstand its Kashmir case, but has had to settle for these closed-door version; now for the third time starting August 2019, shortly after the change in status of Kashmir.The United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia — four of the permanent five countries called for bilateral resolution of the issues, as it Germany. Russia, in fact sought a resolution of the dispute in keeping with the Simla agreement and the Lahore declaration, said the above cited diplomat.The rebuff of Pakistan was born of “less appetite” in the council for what is now widely recognized as a bilateral issue and “systematic” briefing preemptively of the members particularly on the “developmental front” over the last one year and also the “wrong narrative” put out by Pakistan on the domicile issue, in a an April letter to the UNSC.Pakistan had tried to create an impression that under the new domicile rules released in march, people from all over the country will not descent upon Kashmir and change the demographics of the region. Indians briefed members on the rules, the different categories of who can and not settle there.India was elected to the Security Council in June as a non-permanent member. And as is the practice it began receiving documents circulated to member countries from August and it will sit in on meetings from October purely in observer capacity in preparation for the start of its two-year term in January 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-rebuff-to-pakistan-unsc-says-again-kashmir-should-be-resolved-bilaterally/story-QKb9cmcoMarnYU4zJKeAvO.html
06-08-2020||India||Manoj Sinha is new L-G in J&K change of guard||Former Union minister Manoj Sinha, the newly appointed lieutenant governor (L-G) of Jammu & Kashmir, hit the ground running on Thursday, receiving a briefing on the situation in the Union Territory soon after reaching Srinagar.Sinha, 61, a three-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian, is expected to take his oath of office on Friday on the lawns of Raj Bhavan in the city. He is the second L-G of the Union Territory (UT), which was formed last year after the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of J&K. The appointment of a political personality at the helm of the UT is being seen as an indication of the Centre’s will to initiate the political process in J&K, according to a person aware of the details.Sinha takes over from Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Girish Chandra Murmu, who resigned on August 5, exactly a year after the government announced the nullification of Article 370, which conferred special status on Jammu & Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two UTs — J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one — on August 5, 2019.Murmu was appointed the Comptroller and Auditor General of India “with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office”, the government said.In Srinagar, chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam and director general of police Dilbagh Singh welcomed Sinha at the airport, where he landed at around 3pm on Thursday and received a guard of honour. He went straight to the Raj Bhavan and was briefed about the ground situation in the politically sensitive region.“The new lieutenant governor was given first-hand account of the situation by officials... He will be chairing a review meeting of officials only after the oath ceremony,” said a senior J&K official privy to the details.Senior BJP leaders welcomed Sinha’s appointment and hoped that he will usher in economic development. “A gentle, erudite and experienced leader with loads of administrative experience as a minister to head J&K administration. J&K to progress on path of development with renewed vigour,” BJP general secretary Ram Madhav tweeted. Jitendra Singh, minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office, said: “...He [Sinha] carries with him a rich combination of both political as well as administrative experience.”Sinha’s political career began when he was elected the president of Banaras Hindu University students’ union in 1982. He became a Lok Sabha member for the first time in 1996 from Ghazipur, and won election from the seat in 1999 as well.Sinha was elected to the Lower House for a third time in 2014, when the BJP came to power at the Centre with a landslide win, and Narendra Modi became Prime Minister. Sinha held the portfolio of minister of state for railways between May 2014 and July 2016, and was later given the independent charge of the ministry of telecommunications.“Let’s see how things will unfold once he takes over,” said National Conference (NC) parliamentarian Hasnain Masoodi. Earlier in the day, a Rashtrapati Bhavan communique said Murmu’s resignation had been accepted. Murmu, who held the post for just over nine months, left for Delhi from Jammu on a plane around 11am. Murmu’s resignation came in the backdrop of his suggestions to allow 4G telecom services in the Valley and his comments about the timing of elections in the UT that prompted a terse note from the Election Commission of India reminding him to respect the poll body’s remit.Former J&K chief minister and NC leader Omar Abdullah termed Murmu’s exit unceremonious. “In a strange coincidence, both the last Governor of J&K state [Satyapal Malik] & the 1st Lt Governor of the Union Territory of J&K have been removed when they least expected it. They both had a full schedule of meetings planned when they got the order to pack & leave rather unceremoniously,” he tweeted.Noor Ahmad Baba, a political analyst, said the developments are another “experiment” by the Union government. “They begun with a bureaucrat [Murmu], and after one year, when things did not change much on ground, they have experimented with a person with a political background who may try to create his own space and think independently.”He said only time will tell if Sinha is able to make a difference. “Kashmir is not that simple...It is not going to be that easy,” Baba said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manoj-sinha-is-new-l-g-in-j-k-change-of-guard/story-OP2bE65vCaun0kkvrQaCYI.html
06-08-2020||India||In time of Mandir politics, Mandal appeal faces critical crisis||As August 5, 2020, is etched in Indian political history as the day when the politics of mandir (temple) reached its climax after three decades of political mobilisation, August 7, 2020, marks an equally important, and related, anniversary. It was 30 years ago, on this day, that the VP Singh government implemented the Mandal Commission report, which gave 27% reservations in government jobs for Other Backward Classes (OBCs).As the votaries of the politics of kamandal (an oblong water pot used by sadhus), a term often used to describe the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindutva politics, celebrate, the advocates of the politics of Mandal confront their most serious challenge. The two political streams had a fundamental tension — and in fact, many attribute the rise of each as a response to the other. The Ram temple at Ayodhya was one of the main tenets of kamandal politics, through which the BJP sought to consolidate Hindus across castes. Mandal sought to emphasise caste identities, and construct a political imagination based on an alliance of the socially marginalised with religious minorities, particularly Muslims. But 30 years later, the line between mandir and Mandal have blurred — and the advocates of the former have won over a significant segment of the natural constituency of the latter. How did this happen? For one, the BJP tapped into the heterogeneity within OBCs, and leveraged the resentment against dominant OBC groups who are seen as having cornered the benefits that came with reservation and political power. Data shows that intra-OBC inequality is real. In Uttar Pradesh for instance, it is by consolidating the non-Yadav communities that the BJP has scored three consecutive electoral triumphs — in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the 2017 assembly polls. The most tangible manifestation of the BJP seeking to leverage this faultline is the formation of the Commission to Examine Sub-categorisation of Other Backward Classes for OBCs. But it is not just social engineering. A mix of aggressive welfare delivery to members of these communities, substantive legislative positions to portray the party’s commitment to the subaltern, and the co-option of historical figures integral to identity of specific backward groups into a larger Hindutva pantheon — note Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reference to Suheldev in his speech at Ayodhya — has helped BJP cement its base among this section. It is not clear if the politics of mandir has decisively prevailed over the politics of Mandal, for social equations can change, inter-caste contradictions can grow, the ability to reconcile these contradictions may not last, and issues of political representation may once again emerge more sharply. But what is clear is that 30 years later, the politics of mandir and the politics of Mandal have come a full circle in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-time-of-mandir-politics-mandal-appeal-faces-critical-crisis/story-s4xmQXkwno3RMPU0CbcUoL.html
06-08-2020||India||‘Reassure people if error in population count in Ayodhya inadvertent’: Tharoor to PM Modi||Citing United Nations data, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Thursday took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and sought a clarification about his omission of 8 crore people yesterday during his speech when he had congratulated 130 crore Indians on the ‘Bhoomi Pujan’ of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.“PM Modi congratulated 130 crore Indians when he spoke at the Ram Mandir yesterday. But India’s population is estimated at 1,38,00,04,385 in mid-2020, a/c to UN data. An omission of 8 crore people is worrying to many, after CAA/NRC. If inadvertent, a correction would be reassuring,” Tharoor said in a tweet, hinting that the omission may not be a mistake. He stressed that after the new and controversial citizenship law, which had triggered large-scale protests across India; such an omission may be a cause of worry for a part of the country’s population. He urged the Prime Minister to reassure people if the figure had been inadvertent. A day before, the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, had also lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said that neither Lord Ram nor the philosophy of Hinduism belonged to the ruling party alone and the appeal of both was universal. The articulate Congress leader emphasized that Lord Ram belonged to all of humanity and had also invoked Mahatma Gandhi’s idea of the legendary Hindu king, who was born in Ayodhya, according to the epic Ramyana.“He is the ideal man whose image is deeply etched in the hearts & minds of millions. Gandhiji always sang his hymns & died w/ “Hey Ram” on his lips. He talked about a Ram Rajya where all would live in peace & prosperity. Can’t let His name be hijacked!” Tharoor had tweeted on Wednesday.The Congress leader had also clarified that the Congress party had never been opposed to the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, but it was against the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. A day earlier, India witnessed the historic ceremony of the Bhoomi Pujan in Ayodhya with celebrations panning out across states. The much-awaited foundation stone laying ceremony for the Ram Temple in Ayodhya was concluded by PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reassure-people-if-error-in-population-count-in-ayodhya-inadvertent-tharoor-to-pm-modi/story-7Jdn1BcwW0NMaoAwmEwIqN.html

The two-month-old baby in Khajuraho town of Chhatarpur district who tested positive for Covid-19 in the third week of July was breastfed during illness by his mother as per doctor’s advice to boost his immunity. His mother was already Covid-19 positive when she had delivered the baby in Delhi where her husband worked. The family returned to Chhatarpur after the birth of the baby, according to the statement.The 100-year-old woman who belongs to Badwah town of Khargone district also suffers from ovarian cancer. She was kept in home isolation after she tested positive for coronavirus on July 21. During the treatment at home she continued her yoga practice. The state health department was informed of her recovery on Thursday, the statement said.Click here for Covid-19 full coverage.Meanwhile, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who is in home quarantine since Wednesday after his recovery from Covid-19, instructed officials during a review meeting through video conferencing on Thursday night that lockdown will be imposed on districts only on Sundays and the night curfew will remain in force from 10 pm to 5 am instead of 8 pm to 5 am. With his announcement those districts which have lockdown on Saturdays too will have just one-day lockdown on Sundays, the statement said.“The CM directed that efforts should be made to minimize death rate by ensuring best treatment in all Covid hospitals. At present, Corona death rate of the state is 4.32%. Advice must be sought from non-governmental subject experts on how to reduce the death rate of Corona”, the statement said.Chouhan also directed that special attention must be paid to the districts of Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur which have the high numbers of Covid-19 patients.On Thursday Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 tally stood at 36,564 out of which 946 people have died.

Murmu will replace Rajiv Mehrishi, who is set to retire from the key constitutional post on August 8.“By virtue of the power vested in him by clause 1 of article 148 of the Constitution of India, the President has been pleased to appoint Shri Girish Chandra Murmu to be the Comptroller and Auditor General of India with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office,” the finance ministry notification signed by joint secretary Rajiv Kumar Mishra said.Rajiv Mehrshi was appointed India’s top public auditor in 2017 after his retirement from the civil services. Mehrishi - a former IAS officer of the 1978 batch – has previously been India’s finance secretary and home secretary.Murmu had assumed the charge of Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor on 31 October, after the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir got official recognition as a Union Territory. Murmu was the expenditure secretary in the Union finance ministry when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah decided to elevate him to the new Union Territory’s Raj Bhawan. Murmu had then resigned from the IAS a month before his retirement in November-end 2019. Murmu, who is said to have the trust of PM Modi and Shah, had worked with them in Gujarat when he was posted in the home department. After PM Modi came to Delhi in 2014, Murmu moved to the Gujarat chief minister’s office as principal secretary to Anandiben Patel who had succeeded Modi in the state. He joined the central government less than a year later as a joint secretary in the finance ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-jk-lieutenant-governor-gc-murmu-appointed-india-s-new-cag/story-dcWT1btOmHIQWvDPGG6X4I.html

He not only withdrew his complaint, but also deposited the school fee of the girl, police said. The gesture of the 50-year-old private detective Dheeraj Dubey, a resident of Sudama Nagar in Indore is being appreciated on social media and the police have also praised his decision. Dubey’s mobile phone was stolen on August 2 from his residence but instead of complaining to the police he decided to track down the thief on his own. “I checked all the CCTV cameras and found the body language of a 17-year-old daughter of a maid, who works at my home, suspicious. I called her on Wednesday and asked her politely many questions including her performance in her examination of class 11 that she passed this year to be enrolled for class 12. After initial denial during the conversation, the girl confessed to having committed the crime and told me that she had stolen the phone and pledged it with a friend to borrow Rs 2,500 from him so that she could deposit Rs 1600 against her school fee and spend Rs 1200 to purchase books to continue her studies,” Dubey said. “The girl’s parents didn’t have much savings amid the Covid-19 situation to deposit the school fee. I found that the cash of Rs 2,500 was intact with the girl and she had not spent it on any hobby. I inquired with the school and found that she was really supposed to deposit the school fee. I asked the girl to keep the money and I deposited her private school fees. I also repaid the amount of Rs 2,500 to her friend that she had taken in exchange for the mobile phone. As the girl is meritorious and had scored 71% marks in class 11 examination, I promised to bear the expenses of her studies in future also and help her in getting a part-time job after she will completes 18 years of age,” Dubey said. Dwarakpuri police station in-charge Dharamveer Singh Nagar praised Dubey’s gesture and said, “Dheeraj Dubey really did a commendable job by supporting the girl. He informed us about the theft but he only wanted to get back his mobile phone from the friend of the girl with our help. He refused to lodge any complaint with the police in view of the girl’s future. He even paid the Rs 2,500 debt in front of us which was taken by the girl from her friend in exchange for the mobile phone.” The girl said, “I really committed a mistake. But I was desperate to deposit the fee out of fear that my enrolment with the school would be cancelled. I will never commit any crime in future and focus on my studies. I am grateful to Dheeraj Sir that he not only helped me financially, but he didn’t lodge a complaint with the police also.” Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Indore, Harinarayan Chari Mishra said, “Though the girl committed a crime, her motive was continuing her studies. Dheeraj Dubey set an example by supporting her instead of taking action against her.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/girl-steals-cell-phone-to-pay-school-fee-owner-finds-out-and-helps-her-to-continue-studying/story-FmLyity0aTEQKxTbOLmk4K.html

It may also raise the Daniel Pearl murder case.Pakistan has been on the FATF grey list since June 2018.Last month, Financial Monitoring Unit Director-General Lubna Farooq told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the country is still fully compliant on 14 out of the 27-point Action Plan and said it will have to submit an implementation report on the remaining points in the next eight days, reported Express Tribune.Islamabad also has to comply with 30 recommendations of the FATF. The committee expressed serious concern over the non-serious attitude of the government to settle matters relating to the FATF. Pakistan will have to demonstrate the effectiveness of sanctions including remedial actions to curb terrorist financing in the country, it will have to ensure improved effectiveness against terror financing by financial institutions particularly for banned outfits. It is yet to take actions against illegal Money or Value Transfer Services (MVTS) such as hundi-hawala.Pakistan will have to place the sanction regime against cash couriers. The country will have to ensure a logical conclusion from the ongoing terror financing investigation of law enforcing agencies (LEAs) against banned outfits and proscribed persons.Pakistani authorities need to ensure international cooperation based investigations and convictions against banned organisations and proscribed persons.Earlier, India had said that Pakistan continuing to be in FATF ‘Grey List’ vindicates its position that Islamabad has not taken appropriate action against terror financing and safe havens which exist in that country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-fatf-meet-india-likely-to-highlight-pak-s-inaction-to-curb-terror-funding/story-bRbYxLBsJqjzZNu8ijgoZM.html

Be it OTT series, web or feature films, he is enjoying working across mediums and entertaining his fans. Hailing from Delhi and who went to school in Lucknow, the ‘Sultan’ and ‘Breathe’ actor credits his schooling here for shaping him as a person he is today!“I was a boarding student at La Martiniere College, ‘wahin parvarish hui hai aur jo seekha hai wahin seekha hai — tameez, adab, sharafat aur ladai-jhagda bhi’ (I have grown up here and whatever I have learnt is from school...). It was there I learnt to help the less-fortunate, to stand to wrong and respect elders,” said the actor over the phone. He believes all this has contributed to him in playing diverse characters. “The school upbringing helps us throughout our lives. The principle and philosophy of life help you in your craft. I consider myself lucky that I went to such a school and the atmosphere at that point of time was so wonderful that I was able to learn so much as a student.” Remembering one of his favourite cities, Amit said, “One very good thing about Lucknow is that elders there still have upper hand and they take care of youngsters and guide them too. In Mumbai its completely opposite things are not what they should be as relationships are all muddled up. I feel proud coming from such a place and time where elders behave like the way they should and youngsters respect them.” Amit is all over the place with his back-to-back films and series release — series ‘Breathe: Into the Shadows’ and ‘Avrodh: The Seize Within’ and films like ‘Yaara’ and ‘Shakuntala Devi’. Despite having multiple releases, he is most upbeat about his latest series. “I wanted to go into Indian Army but for some reason or other I couldn’t go. Maybe it was not my calling so when I got this opportunity to live my dream, I was absolutely thrilled. With this series, I was able to fulfill my dream and my father’s dream who wanted me to join the armed forces. Wearing a uniform was a dream for me. My father passed away when I was very young so I consider this opportunity as a gift from him.” The actor confesses that this time he got bit nervous about its release. “As it’s based on a best-seller book on Uri attack and special force (surgical) strike so I am bit nervous this time. The nervousness is because of the expectations of the audience that he will do something good. I guess its okay to have such feeling as it’s much better than being overconfident.” Four releases in a month make him happy. “It’s a blessing for your work to come out as we all work so hard every project. I am very fortunate to be part of four different teams and more fortunate that it came at a time when people needed some distraction, fun and objectivity. I hope I am spreading some smiles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/la-martiniere-hostel-days-helped-me-in-my-craft/story-ihIYdlhbhcCLDIcKkpkylM.html

When the meeting was held, the SSB from our side raised the issue before Nepal since omni-directional CCTV cameras pose an obvious risk of monitoring of Indian security agencies.” Also Read: China became ‘more aggressive’ during Covid-19; deployed troops along LAC: US defence chief“The Nepalese authorities reasoned that the cameras were meant to keep an eye on activities on their side of the border but we asked them to replace the 360 degrees cameras with uni-directional CCTV cameras, placed away from the Indian side of the border. They said they will consider the request,” said Pandey.RK Tripathi, SSB Commandant near the Indo-Nepal border confirmed the development and said, “We raised several issues in the meeting but didn’t get any assurance from their side. They just said that they will try to solve them by dialogues.” The informal meeting was attended by district magistrate of Champawat, superintendent of police (SP), Champawat and commandant of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) from the Indian side.

06-08-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan spars with Capt Amarinder Singh over GI tag for Basmati rice||Madhya Pradesh chief minister (CM) Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday condemned his Punjab counterpart Capt Amarinder Singh’s reported letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him not to allow geographical indication (GI) tagging of basmati rice produced in MP for which the state has been fighting a legal battle for several years. The Punjab CM wrote to the PM on Wednesday requesting him to intervene in the interest of Punjab and other Basmati growing states which have GI tag for the agriculture produce. Besides Punjab the other states which have GI tagging for basmati include the states in Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) below the foothills of Himalayas that include Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, as per government reports. Captain Amarinder Singh in his letter reportedly underlined the export of basmati every year worth Rs 33,000 crore from India and also All India Rice Exporters’ Association’s opposition to MP’s claim. He said if MP was provided the GI tagging it would have serious negative impact on Indian export potential and any such dilution in registration of Indian Basmati might give advantage to Pakistan which also produces Basmati. Chouhan, now in home quarantine after being released from hospital on Wednesday following treatment for Covid-19, said the Punjab CM’s letter was a politically motivated one.“I condemn the letter written to the Prime Minister by the Congress government of Punjab. I wish to question the chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, as to what hostility he has with the farmers of Madhya Pradesh? It is not a matter of Madhya Pradesh or Punjab, it is a matter of farmers of the entire country and their livelihood,” he said in a statement.Chouhan said, “The case of Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) with Pakistan has no connection with the claims of Madhya Pradesh because it comes under the GI Act of India and has no connection with the claims of basmati rice within the country. Basmati exporters of Punjab and Haryana are buying basmati rice from Madhya Pradesh. The central government’s export data confirms this. The central government has been supplying ‘Breeder seed’ of basmati rice to Madhya Pradesh since the year 1999.” Chouhan went on to say, “It is recorded in the then ‘Scindia State’ records that in the year 1944, seeds were supplied to the farmers of the state. The Indian Institute of Rice Research, Hyderabad has recorded in its ‘Production oriented survey report’ that basmati rice is being produced in Madhya Pradesh for the last 25 years. The GI tagging to Madhya Pradesh will stabilize the prices of India’s basmati rice in the international markets and boost the country’s export. Basmati is produced in 13 districts of Madhya Pradesh since the year 1908 and has been registered in history. Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh is considered very tasty and is famous both in the country and abroad for its flavour and fragrance.” The state government also issued a statement saying Chouhan has also written to the Prime Minister in this context “referring to the historical connection of Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh. He urged him to grant GI status to the state’s basmati rice to encourage farmers and basmati rice based industries”. Madhya Pradesh has been fighting a tough battle on the GI tagging. On May 28, the state government approached the Supreme Court to challenge a Madras high court’s judgment that rejected the MP government’s appeal and another appeal by a Basmati growers association in March this year. The petitions were filed to challenge exclusion of the 13 districts of Madhya Pradesh from a map submitted by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), a part of union ministry for Commerce and Industries for GI tags.Basmati rice is grown in about 75,000 hectares in 13 districts of Madhya Pradesh as compared to 2.6 lakh hectares in Punjab. The total basmati production in Punjab in 2018 was 1.7 million tonne, almost six times of total basmati production in Madhya Pradesh, according to data provided by the two state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-spars-with-capt-amarinder-singh-over-gi-tag-for-basmati-rice/story-yfzC8aEP7IvUyIiLJz7yxK.html

06-08-2020||India||Telangana offers incentives to private industries providing reservations for locals||Telangana has joined other states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in insisting that private industries in the state should provide reservations to locals for employment. A new draft policy to this effect was approved by the state Cabinet at its meeting held till late on Wednesday. “The Cabinet felt that the locals should have more opportunities in the industries being set up in the state. The cabinet decided to extend incentives to the industries which provide more job opportunities to locals,” an official release from the chief minister’s office said. At present, in Maharashtra, 50 per cent of the jobs among the supervisory staff and 80 per cent of the total jobs in private industries are reserved for locals. Similarly, the reservations for locals in all jobs in private industries are 75 per cent in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and 70 per cent in Madhya Pradesh. However, the Telangana Cabinet decided to adopt a two-pronged strategy to create a favourable environment to ensure that the local youth are employed in industries. First, the government shall ensure availability of skilled manpower through institutions like the Telangana Academy of Skill and Knowledge (TASK), tagging core industries with industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics to ensure continuous availability of skilled man power. Secondly, the industries are classified into two categories-- in category-1, industries could employ 70 per cent of the semi-skilled manpower and 50 per cent of skilled manpower from locals; and in category-II, industries could have 80 per cent of the semi-skilled manpower and 60 per cent of the skilled manpower from locals. “It was decided that industries established in the state need to be facilitated with the employable local manpower through synergy between the government, industry and the academia,” the official note said. The Cabinet proposed that industries which followed this policy of reservations to the locals would be extended additional incentives like VAT, GST, SGST, and lower electricity tariffs and investment subsidies, among others. The Cabinet also decided to decentralise the IT industry in Hyderabad and adopt a grid policy so that the IT companies could spread all over the city. It was decided to give incentives to the IT companies being set up in other areas other than only in Cyberabad in the western parts of Hyderabad. The Cabinet also decided to encourage and promote the use of electrical vehicles to decrease the air pollution in Telangana. It was also decided to encourage the production of electric vehicles in the state by giving them incentives. The Cabinet approved the Telangana State Electronic Vehicle and Energy Storage Solution Policy. The Cabinet has also approved the construction of the New Secretariat Complex and approved the designs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-offers-incentives-to-private-industries-providing-reservations-for-locals/story-ZgbUH01SrC54YheYEnmV4J.html
06-08-2020||India||CBI team that probed Vijay Mallya to investigate Rhea Chakraborty for Sushant’s death||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed a case in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput naming his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty and four other family members or known associates apart from ‘unknown persons’ as accused, officials said. The investigation has been handed over to the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is currently investigating the high profile AgustaWestland scam and bank fraud case against fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya. The SIT, also known as Anti-Corruption-6, is headed by Gujarat cadre IPS officer Manoj Shashidhar. It was formed in June 2016 in the CBI under then Special Director Rakesh Asthana to expedite probe against Mallya and in VVIP Chopper scam.A team of SIT will station itself in Mumbai to begin questioning people connected with the late actor including Rhea Chakraborty, Bollywood producers and others who have given statements after his death or know about the circumstances related to his death of June 14, officials familiar with development said. The decision to hand over the probe to the SIT was taken as CBI’s Special Crimes unit, which usually investigates such cases, currently has its hands full. “The Special Crimes unit is currently probing high profile cases related to custodial death of father-son duo of P Jayaraj and J Bennicks in Tamil Nadu in June as well as the suicide of SHO, Vishnudutt Vishnoi in Churu, Rajasthan, on May 23. In the SHO case, the CBI had last month questioned Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot’s OSD – Devaram Saini,” an official said requesting anonymity. Also, around eight officials of CBI’s special crimes unit who had gone to investigate Tamil Nadu’s custodial deaths are in quarantine right now as a couple of them contracted Covid-19 disease last month. Known for thorough probes in mysterious death cases, suicides, murders and custodial deaths, the CBI is likely to take the help of medical experts from reputed institutions to study the post mortem report of Sushant Singh Rajput, another official said, explaining the investigation techniques and procedures in the agency. If it feels at a later stage that Rhea Chakraborty or others are misleading, then it may even consider conducting lie-detection tests on them as has been seen in the past in several high profile cases investigated by CBI, the officer added. The case was handed over to the CBI by Bihar government after Sushant’s father K K Singh and Bihar police alleged a cover-up by Mumbai police to save ‘influential’ people. They have accused Mumbai police of destroying evidence and deliberately ignoring leads in the case in an attempt to derail it, an allegation rejected by the Maharashtra police even as it questioned the jurisdiction of Bihar police in the matter.K K Singh has alleged that Rhea Chakraborty and her family drove his son to suicide and embezzled his funds. Apart from Rhea and her brother Showik, CBI has named her family members – Indirajeet Chakraborty, Sandhya Chakraborty, Shruti Modi and Sushant’s house manager, Samuel Miranda - as accused for criminal conspiracy, cheating and abetment to suicide. Rhea’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde didn’t respond to HT’s calls.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also investigating the case as it suspects there has been money laundering by some suspects. The ED questioned Samuel Miranda on Thursday while Sushant’s former chartered accountant Sandeep Sridhar was examined on Tuesday. Rhea Chakraborty has been asked by the ED to appear before it on Friday 11 am. The Mumbai police has been probing the death since Sushant’s body was found at his apartment on June 14 but it is yet to register a case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-team-that-probed-vijay-mallya-to-investigate-rhea-chakraborty-for-sushant-s-death/story-tcsaSvRLjObfL4NvQ9xDYK.html

The two leaders agreed to remain in close touch as both countries address the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and also to take “bilateral relations to newer heights in the coming days”, according to a readout from the external affairs ministry on a phone conversation between Modi and Rajapaksa. The counting of votes began on Thursday and SLPP has said it is confident about a “historic victory” with a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Modi commended the government and the electoral institutions of Sri Lanka for effectively organising the elections despite the constraints of the pandemic. He also appreciated the Sri Lankan people’s participation in the elections, and said this reflected the strong democratic values shared by both countries. “Prime Minister Modi noted that the incoming results of the elections indicate an impressive electoral performance by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party, and conveyed his congratulations and best wishes to...Mahinda Rajapaksa in this regard,” the readout said.

06-08-2020||India||Centre may allow Aadhaar authentication for social welfare schemes||The Centre may allow Aadhaar authentication for delivery of the social welfare benefits by government entities to ensure “good governance” and for “prevention of dissipation of welfare benefits” to the people, a government order has said.Till now, the government has allowed seeding of Aadhaar number for delivery of social welfare benefits under some programmes such as Public Distribution System. However, for delivery of the benefit such as food grains under the public distribution system or money under pension schemes, Aadhaar authentication was not needed.This could, however, change with the new rules called the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020.“The Central government may allow Aadhaar authentication by requesting entities in the interest of good governance, preventing leakage of public funds, promoting ease of living of residents and enabling better access to services for them,” the rules notified by the ministry of electronics and information technology on Wednesday said.To be sure, the rules are in consonance with the 2016 Supreme Court judgment that struck down section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, which did not allow private entities to use Aadhaar database for authentication.Social welfare activists, however, said the move could lead to further exclusion of the poor people from getting benefits under the various social welfare schemes without putting any check on corruption and leakages from these schemes.“There is already so much evidence to show that Aadhaar has led to exclusion of poor people in disbursement of subsidised ration in Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar. The decision could lead to further exclusion as in rural areas there is very poor connectivity and biometrics of many people don’t work,” said Reetika Ghera, a development economist working at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.Abdul Lateef Jamil Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) study done in 10 districts of Jharkhand by economist Karthik Muralidharan in 2019 had found that the Aadhaar seeding in the PDS had lead to many genuine persons getting excluded from the PDS scheme without very little benefit of plugging food grains leakages.About six percent of total ration cards in these 10 districts were cancelled between 2016 and 2018, as they could not be linked to Aadhaar. However, after a lot of hue and cry by activists, physical verification of ration card holders was done and many ration cards were restored. “About 88% of the cancelled ration cards were real and qualified to receive ration,” the study had found.According to the new rules, the Central government could allow requesting government entities --- Central and state government departments --- to carry out Aadhaar authentication.For availing authentication services, individual departments will have to seek approval of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which is the statutory body to manage Aadhaar and runs Aadhaar-based services.A Central government official privy to the development said that the purpose of the order is to ensure that “genuine” beneficiaries get benefits of the government schemes in real-time without any delay. “Authentication will also help in plugging the leakages, if any, in the schemes. The rules provide government agencies a framework to seek UIDAI’s authentication services,” the official said.The rules say authentication will be allowed for three purposes --- to ensure good governance, prevention of dissipation of social welfare benefits and enablement of innovation and spread of knowledge. However, innovation and knowledge has not been defined in the rules. The rules say Aadhaar authentication will be voluntary.“If the department says that people will not get the welfare services without authentication, voluntary becomes mandatory,” said development economist Jean Dreze, who has been arguing against making Aadhaar mandatory to avail social welfare schemes.Under the authentication mechanism, the UIDAI from its database verifies whether the Aadhaar number or biometric details given are of a particular person or not. The UIDAI server replies only in “Yes” or “No” without providing any demographic details of the person, whose identity is being verified. Through the Aadhaar seeding system, the verification is done through the department’s database, not Aadhaar. According to Aadhaar Act, a requesting entity means “an agency or person that submits the Aadhaar number, and demographic information or biometric information, of an individual to the Central Identities Data Repository for authentication”.The new rule makes it clear that only the government agencies would be allowed to use Aadhaar authentication services, not any private entity. This is in line with the 2016 Supreme Court judgment that upheld the Aadhaar law but struck down section 57 which allowed private entities to use Aadhaar database for authentication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-allow-aadhaar-authentication-for-social-welfare-schemes/story-0OcD8u2QceEptk2VRzWsyK.html
06-08-2020||India||Address basic issues for review of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s death sentence, India tells Pakistan||India on Thursday asked Pakistan to address several basic issues, including unconditional consular access, so that former naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav could seek a review of the death sentence given to him for alleged involvement in spying. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said no communication has been received so far from the Pakistan government regarding the order by the Islamabad high court to inform India about appointing a lawyer for Jadhav so that a review petition can be filed against his conviction. “Pakistan needs to address the basic issues which pertain to an effective review in implementation of the ICJ [International Court of Justice] judgement, and these basic issues pertain to making relevant documentation available to us, as well as providing unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav,” Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. A two-judge bench of the Islamabad high court directed the Pakistan government this week to again inform Jadhav, 50, of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the ICJ order of 2019, which stayed his execution and called for a review of his conviction. The judges also ordered the formation of a larger bench to hear the case when it is taken up again on September 3. India had said last month that Pakistan has blocked all its efforts to seek legal remedies for Jadhav, who was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. It has also accused Pakistan of violating the ICJ’s judgement. New Delhi has rejected all allegations levelled against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/address-basic-issues-for-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-death-sentence-india-tells-pakistan/story-ViXXGyzgXZOZRsg0WxJ8xN.html

All the posts of merged cadre will be open for all members of IRMS. Fresh recruitment to IRMS will be done from the UPSC Civil service exam. Posts requiring technical expertise like those in RDSO will be filled up by different process like the way it is done in ISRO/DRDO,” another official said requesting anonymity.“Formula for integrated seniority is still under discussion and it is expected that the scheme suggested by the Debroy committee will be adopted…However CRB clearly mentioned that seniority will not be that significant for deciding key positions and some element of merit is being introduced,” the official added.The unification of services had earlier been proposed by various committees that studied ways of reforming the Indian Railways including the Prakash Tandon Committee (1994), Rakesh Mohan Committee (2001), Sam Pitroda Committee (2012) the and Bibek Debroy Committee (2015).In the meeting several services raised concerns over career growth and promotions. According to officials present in the meeting the railway board chairman communicated that seniority will not be that significant for deciding key positions and some element of merit will be introduced adding that “career growth will be liked with the organisation’s growth.“The Railways have also hired consultancy firm, McKinsey, to finalise the modalities of the cadre merger.The modalities and unification of the services will be worked out by the rail ministry in consultation with the Department of Personnel and Training. The process was scheduled to be completed within a year.The proposals will be finalised by an eight-member committee constituted last month by the railway board for looking into re-skilling of the staff. Separately, the Centre had also formed a group of secretaries headed by the cabinet secretary for implementing the exercise of restructuring the board; this committee includes the Chairman, Railway Board, the DOPT secretary and the secretary of the department of expenditure. This committee will assist the group of ministers constituted by the government for formalizing the restructured railway board. The GOM will be formed after the recommendations of the committee.The chairman said that there is a need to change organisational structure and work culture as well as work profile at senior levels. It was pointed out that service specialisation has not been very effective as even with specialists in the railway board and RDSO; we are nowhere near Korean or Japanese Technology. Supervisory cadre needs to be strengthened, while the focus should be on bringing down manpower cost of maintenance,” the official quoted above said.The proposed organizational reforms were aimed at ending the division of the mammoth organisation into different departments. The Indian Railways employs nearly 1.3 million people and its trains carried 2.3 million passengers every day before the lockdown. The government has said the move was aimed at ending a legacy marked by inefficiency in work, infighting over control of assets and resources, and delays in decision-making.Indian Railways is also mulling merging several junior and mid-level posts as part of its plans to rationalize the organisation and making it leaner, following the Union Cabinet’s nod for merging its eight major cadres into a central service-- Indian Railway Management Service, Hindustan Times had reported on June 10.The rail ministry has drafted a proposal based on recommendations from all railway zones for merging key posts in the accounts, commercial, electrical, mechanical, engineering, medical, personnel, operating, stores, and signal & telecommunication departments, and also other miscellaneous posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-set-november-deadline-for-cadre-merger-plan/story-xg7LX9Ss1VnwdK4ddVUMcM.html
06-08-2020||India||On Friday, two Odisha villages will be first in the country to get Tsunami-Ready certificate||More than 15 years after one of the devastating Tsunamis of history killed over 10,000 people in southern India, two coastal villages of Odisha would be declared ‘Tsunami-Ready’, the first in India as well as the Indian ocean region.Officials of Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, the state government body responsible for managing different kinds of disasters, said Venkatraipur village in Ganjam district and Noliasahi village in Jagatsingpur district would be the first two districts in India to get tsunami-ready certificate on Friday in a function.“As these two villages have fulfilled the 11 parameters of being Tsunami-Ready, the local communities of these two villages would get certificate of recognition from Unesco through a virtual event on Friday afternoon. Officials of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System secretariat in Australia and Indian Ocean Tsunami Information Centre at Jakarta along with the National Disaster Management Authority would be present during the event,” said Satya Ranjan Sahoo, chief general manager of OSDMA.The Indian ocean Tsunami, triggered by an earthquake of 9.1–9.3 magnitude on the Richter scale on December 26, 2004, swept through 14 different countries in Indian ocean region killing over 2.3 lakh people, most of them in Indonesia.Also Read: ‘Do we even have an existing govt?’: Siddaramaiah on flood situation in K’takaRecorded as one of the strongest and the deadliest of all time, the Tsunami led to setting up of Indian Tsunami Early Warning System to detect Tsunami-producing earthquakes and to monitor Tsunamis.Sahoo said the ‘Tsunami-Ready’ tag is a community performance-based programme initiated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO that promotes Tsunami preparedness through collaboration of public, community leaders, and national and local emergency management agencies. To implement and monitor the implementation of ‘Tsunami-Ready’, Ministry of Earth Sciences had established a National Board that went around the country and selected 6 villages in Odisha for a pilot programme.Also Read: Mumbai braces for more rains, 16 NDRF teams deployedTsunami-Ready parameters include conduction of community Tsunami-risk reduction programme, designation and mapping of Tsunami hazard zones, public display of Tsunami information, easily understood Tsunami evacuation maps, outreach and public education materials, participation in mock drills, community emergency plans and presence of reliable 24 hours early warning systems, said Dr Ajay Kumar, scientist of INCOIS, Hyderabad.Though Odisha has 328 villages on the coast that are vulnerable to Tsunamis, the OSDMA had chosen 6 coastal villages of which 2 were found to be ready for the ‘Tsunami-Ready certification after a visit by the national board that supervises and monitors the implementation of Tsunami Ready Recognition programme in December last year.“These two villages in Odisha have signages and symbols forewarning its residents about an impending Tsunami. These two villages also have evacuation routes as well as safe places that are clearly marked and made known to all residents of villages. Being aware of these routes and location of safe places will ease the evacuation process in the event of an actual Tsunami hitting the coast,” said Dr Kumar.OSDMA officials said the tsunami hazard zones and mapping of these two villages have been completed.“In order to determine the areas that might become inundated, inundation maps have been developed. The development of these maps are based on Tsunami scenarios that takes into account the location, its surrounding environment, total population, critical services and facilities and possible wave heights, amplitudes and speed. The demarcation of Tsunami hazard zones will serve as a pre-warning to the general public including residents residing within these zones,” said BN Mishra, an official of OSDMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-friday-two-odisha-villages-will-be-first-in-the-country-to-get-tsunami-ready-certificate/story-Ph0LJQ7OewiYey0NDrOhlL.html

The MLA also said Pilot may have taken the decision to go to Gurugram in the “heat of the moment”. Prashant Bairwa, Congress MLA from Niwai, told a local TV news channel that Sachin Pilot didn’t realize he had a big team. “It would have been better that he took advice from us. Somebody else was playing the games for him. He had a big team but he didn’t realize that,” Bairwa said. The Niwai MLA is considered a Sachin Pilot loyalist and was among the four legislators who returned from Manesar to Gehlot camp on July 11. The four – Danish Abrar, Rohit Bohra, Prashant Bairwa and Chetan Dudi – addressed a press conference at the CM’s residence the same day to pledge their support to Gehlot. Bairwa said the people Pilot is trusting will be the first ones to desert him. “He has well-wishers here also but all of us are with the Congress,” he said. The Congress legislators said the BJP was involved in turning Pilot against the government. “If BJP was not involved, why were they staying in Gurugram under the watch of Haryana police? Now they have gone to Gujarat, which is also a BJP-ruled state,” he said. Pilot has denied moving to Gujarat.Bairwa claimed that some legislators from the Pilot camp were also keen to return to the government but they are not allowed. “The dissident MLAs have no freedom. It is possible that they want to return but are being stopped.” When asked why Pilot did what he did, Bairwa said Pilot is short-tempered. “Even we were scared of him when he got angry. He may have taken the decision in the heat of the moment,” he said. “The Congress made him a Union minister and a big leader. He may have felt helpless.” The MLA said he had an emotional attachment with Pilot and it will always be there “but when it comes to politics, he made his moves, I made mine.”Govind Singh Dotasra who succeeded Pilot as the Congress chief in Rajasthan said, “What Bairwa is trying to say is that when Pilot was the state party chief all were with him but now that he joined hands with BJP, those who left with him are regretting.” He also claimed that Pilot took the decision in anger and BJP is behind it.BJP spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma said the allegations are baseless and the opposition party has nothing to do with the problem in the Congress. “It’s an internal fight resulting from lack of coordination among them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-may-have-turned-rebel-in-heat-of-the-moment-says-congress-mla/story-cCIjJwzf8a3mex0SGavmAL.html

They also demanded a CBI probe into the incident that recently killed at least 110 people in three districts of the state. The ministers, in a joint statement, called for cracking the whip on the two MPs without any laxity or delay. “Indiscipline could not be tolerated at any time, least of all when Assembly elections in the state are less than two years way,” their statement said, pointing to the MPs’ repeated attacks on the state government, including chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Also Read: Punjab hooch tragedy: Suspects will be probed irrespective of political affiliation or rank, says officerThe ministers said the two MPs had never, in their Rajya Sabha term, bothered to raise any issue of the interest of the state they represented. “Why did they not press for the completion of the ED probe into the drugs issue during the Akali regime? Why did they not protest in the House against the anti-farm Ordinances of the Union Government? Why did they never speak about the CBI’s failure to probe the sacrilege cases?” the ministers asked.The ministers alleged that the two MPs had bypassed all party and government forums to protest against the handling of the hooch tragedy and by approaching the governor seeking a CBI and ED probe into the matter. The ministers’ joint statement also pointed out that a CBI probe is needed only in cases when the police fail to deliver, which was definitely not true in this case at present. The ministers further alleged that CBI had been inefficient in investigating the sacrilege cases, which is eventually being solved by the state police.The rift within Punjab Congress has again come to the fore in the aftermath of the tragedy and the Punjab Congress leadership is hoping that party high command in Delhi will sanction the two MPs for their alleged dissidence.

Nearly 70% of the deaths took place because people delayed in reaching the hospital,” said Rajiva Sinha, chief secretary of West Bengal. Over the past few months multiple allegations have surfaced against both state-run and private hospitals that they have refused to admit patients because of various reasons including shortage of beds, resulting in the death of some patients. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Sinha, however, said that there is no shortage of hospital beds. At present there are 11,560 beds in 83 Covid-19 designated hospitals out of which 60% are still vacant. In all there are 23,500 beds in hospitals and safe homes. “There is demand for a particular category of hospital which can’t be guaranteed in a pandemic situation. What we can guarantee is a kind of hospital where patients would be provided with adequate treatment by the best experts,” he said. The state government said that the case fatality rate has dropped to around 2.2% in West Bengal. The National CFR stands at 2.7%. At present only 1,144 patients in the state are in critical condition while 1,043 and 1,946 are with moderate and mild symptoms. “This means only two out of 100 Covid-19 patients have died. Out of this, 87% of the deaths were because of comorbidity,” he added. The chief secretary was addressing media persons at the state secretariat. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee was also present. The Covid-1- pandemic has claimed 1,846 lives in Bengal till Wednesday which also saw the highest single-day casualties at 61. On Thursday West Bengal crossed the 25,000-mark of daily swab tests. The state has already done more than one million tests. Veteran CPI (M) leader Shyamal Chakraborty, who had tested positive for Covid-19, died in Kolkata on Thursday.

Chief priest Narayana Achar, his wife, elder brother, and two assistant priests are all said to have been either swept away or buried under the debris after landslides in the Brahmagiri hills adjoining the temple.Rescue teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NRDF) have been battling inclement weather and torrential rains to try and respond to the situation at Talacauvery. According to district officials, neighbouring Bhagamandala alone received a record 486 mm of rain in the 24 hours between August 5-6, as recorded by IMD.Both Cauvery and Lakshma Teertha rivers in the district were in spate, marooning several villages and hampering rescue and relief operations. Kodagu, however, was not alone as across Northern Karnataka districts of Hubli, Dharwad, Belgavi and coastal districts of Udupi, Mangalore, and Karwar also witnessed heavy rains leading to floods.In Uttara Kannada district, for instance, a bridge in Manchikere of Yellapur taluk was washed away due to the heavy inflow of water into the Bedthi River. Leader of opposition in the Karnataka assembly Siddaramiah hit out at what he said was inaction and apathy of the government in ensuring rescue and relief efforts following the heavy rains and landslides across the state.Siddaramiah who is in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19 said in a series of tweets. “There is heavy downpour in various parts of Karnataka, disrupting livelihoods of many people. The government has failed to come to their rescue. Do we even have an existing government?”Asking the government to immediately take decisions to ease the burden on people during these floods, he called upon it to identify shelter homes and relocate people from risky areas. He also asked CM Yediyurappa who is also Covid-19 positive and being treated in the same hospital to distribute work to ministers and officers. Senior JDS leader and former minister Basvraj Horatti also hit out at the government saying “nobody believes that a government exists in the state”. He also said that the CM should immediately direct his cabinet colleagues and the administration to provide relief measures to those affected.Meanwhile, CM Yediyurappa said that Rs 50 crore has already been released for rescue and relief measures and if necessary more funds would be made available. In a statement, he said that ministers had been instructed to tour the damaged areas and undertake relief distribution as well as other necessary measures.Yediyurappa also said that Rs 10,000 would be provided to those families affected by floods and if the full house has been damaged Rs 5 lakh would be paid to help rebuild the houses.Revenue minister R Ashoka said that there was no shortage of funds to undertake relief measures. He said that till now at least 375 homes across the state have been damaged due to rains and floods, also there were 262 people at the 12 relief centres opened across the state. A red alert continues in several districts across the state as rains are expected to only intensify over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-including-chief-priest-of-talacauvery-temple-missing-after-floods-landslides-hit-karnataka/story-R2QOIdok0NatVMgaNtZvqN.html

Roorkee to take up the study of salinity of river Mahadayi and submit a report to this Ministry,” Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, said in a letter to Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant. Sawant had written to Shekhawat in March expressing apprehensions about Karnataka’s plan to fast track the Mahadayi project and had asked Shekhawat not to process any permissions until the matter was finally decided by the Supreme Court where it is now pending. “Karnataka may attempt to seek your approval for such diversion outside the basin relying upon the Award of the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal dated 14.08.2018 In this regard. We wish to state that the Award dated 14.08.2018 is pending before the Hon. Supreme Court of India,” Sawant said in his letter. “Such proposal should not be considered in view of above-mentioned reasons as the same is going to have far reaching consequences on the State of Goa. In any case, if any proposal is submitted by Karnataka, we must be given a copy of the same and our objections should also be considered. Kamataka is likely to submit the proposal which may not be even in consonance with the Award of the Tribunal,” Sawant also said. Shekhawat has, however, declined to specifically assure Goa that no permissions will be processed. “The Government of Karnataka has recently submitted feasibility report of Kalasa Nala Diversion Scheme and Bhandura Nala Diversion Scheme to Central Water Commission (CWC), and these are under appraisal as per the existing CWC guidelines and as per the directions given in the Report cum decision of MWDT (Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal),” Shekhawat said. Quoting the Tribunal itself, Shekhawat said that “the upper riparian States of Karnataka and Maharashtra, though do require requisite clearances and approvals, as required by law and from the Central Government, and the Planning Commission (Now Niti Aayog), but they do not require any prior consent of the lower riparian State of Goa.”But he agreed to share Karnataka’s proposal with Goa since “any project proposed in the river basin for which no tribunal award or inter State agreement exists, will be circulated to the co-basin States by the Project Authority Central Water Commission (CWC).”Goa has opposed any diversion of waters of the River Mahadayi which originates in the Western Ghats in Karnataka takes a detour via Maharashtra and enters Goa as the Mandovi. The Mahadayiriver basin drains an area of 2,032 sq.km., out of which an area of 375 sq.km. lies in Karnataka, 77 sq.km. in Maharashtra and rest in Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-orders-salinity-test-of-mahadayi-after-goa-complains-about-karnataka-s-projects/story-M2Kn47vxWuU1ieSsvDYhIN.html

06-08-2020||India||Tiger reserve in Goa: HC directs Goa govt, NTCA to respond by August 24||The Bombay high court (HC) at Goa has directed the Goa government, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and other authorities to respond by August 24 after Goa Foundation, an environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO), filed a petition that pleaded for setting up of a tiger reserve in the tiny coastal state. The NGO has sought that the state government act on the NTCA’s directive to set up a tiger reserve in the state that was earlier put forth in 2011 and 2016, but the trail went cold, as “no further steps were taken”. In 2011, Jairam Ramesh, the then minister of state (independent charge) of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) --- and in his capacity as the NTCA chairperson --- had written to the then Goa Chief Minister Digambar Kamat to declare the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve. While in 2016, the inspector-general of forests, had written to the then Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Goa, to set up a tiger reserve in Goa. Several successive committees have recommended the setting up of a tiger reserve in Goa. An NTCA panel was also set up to probe the death of four tigers due to poisoning in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. The panel had suggested that the declaration of the tiger reserve would provide much-needed technical and financial help in monitoring the sanctuary. “In view of the unfortunate death of tigers, the state government may take immediate steps for enhancing the legal status of Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary to that of a tiger reserve. Declaring the sanctuary as a tiger reserve will provide much-needed access to technical, financial and monitoring support from the NTCA for safeguarding the conservation values of the sanctuary,” the NTCA panel had said in its report earlier this year. “It will also empower the local communities residing inside the sanctuary by giving access to development opportunities, as they will be able to utilise the voluntary resettlement scheme for joining the mainstream society. Further, after conducting a scientific assessment of remaining protected areas of the state by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the state government may consider bringing the potential tiger habitat of Goa within the tiger reserve network of Western Ghats,” the panel had added. Earlier, the NTCA, in its report titled, Status of tigers, co predators and prey in India, 2010, had described the Goa stretch of the Western Ghats as an important tiger corridor between the Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve and the Sahyadris. The report had stated that Goa could potentially become the home to a small breeding population of tigers that would be sustained by immigrants from Anshi-Dandeli and Sahyadris. Goa Foundation has pointed out that in a document titled, Connecting Tiger Populations for Long-term Conservation the National Tiger Conservation Authority, in collaboration with WII, 32 major tiger corridors inside and outside protected areas (PAs) across the country have been mapped in a bid to formulate a long-term conservation strategy for the big cats. Among the tiger corridors in the Western Ghats landscape, eight have been identified, including the Sahyadri-Radhanagari-Goa corridor, which is adjacent to the Dandeli Anshi-Sharavathi Valley corridor in neighbouring Karnataka. HC will hear the case next on August 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-reserve-in-goa-hc-directs-goa-govt-ntca-to-respond-by-august-24/story-o0E8WhXdfFT26PrFbExT7N.html

The thunderstorm that struck Patna on Wednesday evening did not help the cause either, as the litter flew all over the place on the hospital campus. HT has sourced pictures of disposable PPE kits lying strewn in the open such as outside the autopsy room of the forensic medicine and toxicology department, PMCH, on Wednesday morning, barely two days after the Bihar health department’s principal secretary, Pratyaya Amrit, gave a pep-talk to the state medical college and hospital administrative authorities on Monday (August 3). Safe disposal of medical waste related to Covid-19, sterilisation of waste and incineration are among the 21-point guidelines that the state health department has recommended to tertiary healthcare institutions and medical colleges treating Covid-19 patients. The guidelines suggest a separate set-up for the disposal of PPE kits for private ambulance drivers ferrying Covid-19 patients to the hospital. It has been specifically instructed to keep separate rooms for wearing PPE kits for the hospital’s nurses, ward boys, and hospital attendants. However, the photographs conveyed contrary to what Amrit has prescribed. “I have personally seen drivers of private mortuary vans, who ferry bodies for autopsy, discard their PPE kits at the corner of the autopsy room. We have discussed the issue with the probationary IAS (Indian Administrative Service) and IPS (Indian Police Service) officers deputed for the control room at PMCH and have requested them that armed police personnel is deployed there. I have also urged the medical superintendent to persuade the civic authorities to lift the garbage from there twice a day,” said Dr. Vidyapati Chaudhary, principal, PMCH. At present, the PMCH incinerator, where PPE kits are to be disposed of, is dysfunctional. “We have asked the private agency, which operates the incinerator, to repair it soon. Else, we will dock its charges,” Dr. Chaudhary added. Dr. Bimal Karak, superintendent, PMCH, was not available for comments. On August 2, the state government had sanctioned Rs 252.54 crore as an incentive — equivalent to a month’s basic salary for doctors and employees of the healthcare department, who are at the frontline battling the Covid-19 pandemic. “This (incentive) will boost the morale of the doctors, healthcare, and frontline workers and its good effects will be visible,” said a communique of the state information and public relations department (IPR), quoting Anupam Kumar, secretary, IPR. The PMCH, which is Bihar’s oldest medical college, has earmarked 100 isolation beds for Covid-19 patients.Besides, the hospital has another 1,900 beds for non-Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/used-ppe-kits-dumped-in-the-open-at-patna-hospital-ring-alarm-bells/story-YM8gwCv4hjwvZowGMDcIgK.html

Sandhya Chakraborty, (4) Sh. Showik Chakraborty, (5) Sh Samuel Miranda, and (6 ) Mrs Shruti Modi and others,” the CBI FIR states further. Officials added that CBI’s Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is currently investigating the AgustaWestland scam and bank fraud case against Vijay Mallya, will probe actor Sushant Singh Rajput case.The development comes amid Maharashtra government’s strong opposition to handing over the case to the CBI claiming it was being done for political reasons including the upcoming assembly polls in Bihar. Maharashtra has raised issues of jurisdiction to claim Bihar government or police had no locus standi in the case since Sushant’s death took place in Mumbai.Also Read: Sooraj Pancholi dismisses reports linking him to Sushant Singh Rajput’s deathHowever, the case was handed over to the CBI after Sushant’s father and Bihar police alleged a cover-up by Mumbai police to save ‘influential’ people. They have accused Mumbai police of destroying evidence and deliberately ignoring leads in the case in an attempt to derail it.The Mumbai police and Maharashtra government have vehemently denied the allegations.Mumbai police have been probing the circumstances of Sushant’s death since his body was found at his Bandra flat on June 14 but has not registered an FIR in the case.Sushant’s death has been shrouded in conspiracy theories including him being a victim of an alleged culture of nepotism in Bollywood which shuts out outsiders forcing them to take extreme steps.Also Read: Sushant Singh Rajput couldn’t sleep for 4 nights waiting for Sanjana Sanghi to clear Me Too allegationsAnother theory points to an alleged role of his former girlfriend and live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty, who has been accused by Sushant’s family of abetting his suicide by harassing him and diverting his money among other offences.The focus of CBI’s case will also be on Rhea Chakraborty since the agency has taken over the case registered against her in Bihar. The Enforcement Directorate has also summoned her on Friday for questioning for alleged financial misconduct in the Sushant case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-team-probing-vijay-mallya-case-to-take-over-sushant-rajput-case-fir-soon/story-67nE9Hy6uYJXaZhLo2a1ON.html

The people who queued up outside Ram Janmabhoomi, waiting for their turn to enter, were mostly from neighbouring areas, though some locals were also present. Devotees also visited Hanuman Garhi temple, a few metres from Ram Janmabhoomi. The grand bhoomi pujan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation were the talk of the town on Thursday. With pictures of PM Modi performing bhoomi pujan still fresh in their minds, some of the devotees were expecting major changes at the Ram Janmabhoomi. Diwakar Maurya, 51, who came from adjoining Gonda district, could not wait for his turn to enter the Ram Janmabhoomi. “I saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi performing bhoomi pujan on television (on Wednesday). It was a grand ceremony. Some changes might have been made at Ram Janmabhoomi. Out of curiosity I am here today (Thursday) to see those changes,” he said. Also Read: PM Modi’s Ayodhya ceremony widely watched across the world, highest viewership from US, UKThere were many others like Maurya in the queue who expected something grand at Ram Janmabhoomi. However, Saket Kureel, 55, from neighbouring Basti district, wanted to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at the pre-fabricated temple in which PM Modi had performed ‘aarti’ before bhoomi pujan. When he last visited Ram Janmabhoomi, Ram Lalla was residing inside the makeshift temple inside a tent. “I want to see the temple where Ram Lalla is residing at present. I saw PM Modi performing the deity’s aarti on Doordarshan (national broadcaster),” said Kureel. Next to Hanuman Garhi temple, a group of devotees from adjoining Gonda district were spotted. After paying obeisance to Lord Hanuman, they also planned to visit Ram Janmabhoomi. “Yesterday we watched Modiji on Doordarshan performing bhoomi pujan. My family and relatives wanted to visit Ram Janmabhoomi today (Thursday) itself,” said Radhey Shyam Varma, in his 50s.

We were able to increase our isolation beds more than 34 times and ICU beds over 20 times. From one lab in January, India has 1,370 labs today. Indians anywhere can access a lab within three hours travel time. Thirty-three of the 36 states and UTs exceed WHO’s recommendation of testing 140 people per million per day,” he said.The minister said that telemedicine facilities at AIIMS Delhi helped identify the root causes of mortality and made high-impact interventions possible that significantly curbed the mortality rate from 3.33 per cent on June 18 to 2.11 per cent on August 3.“Within 10 to 20 days, with the help of DRDO, we were able to create 1,000 to 10,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. Right now, on evaluation, we find that the daily handling capacity of Covid-19 cases in our hospitals has increased to almost 35 times,” he said.The meet focused on maintaining essential health services and public health programmes in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-anywhere-can-access-covid-19-lab-in-3-hours-harsh-vardhan/story-PxQ937mA74NUpAPxlqXYpO.html
06-08-2020||India||Draft EIA notification not yet finalized, says Prakash Javadekar||The Centre has not yet finalised the draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020 (EIA), Union environment minister said Thursday.In a letter to Congress MP Jairam Ramesh who heads the Parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment, forest and climate change, Javedekar wrote, “It has not been finalised yet as public consultation is underway.”Earlier in the day, Ramesh had written to the minister saying, “The Parliamentary Standing Committee has been inundated with requests from various stakeholders to give them an opportunity for presenting their views. I am sure you will agree that this is both desirable and necessary. Further meetings of the committee will call non-official witnesses. The Notification may, therefore, be kept in abeyance till the committee completes its deliberations.”Last month, Javadekar had termed Ramesh’s suggestions as “unfounded” and based on “misinterpretation” after the Congress leader raised strong objections to the draft EIA notification.On Thursday, Javadekar maintained that there is no danger that public hearing will be excluded.“Draft environment impact assessment notification does not relax the process of public hearing, but makes it more meaningful,” the minister wrote.He also said that the provision of ex-post facto approval in draft EIA will bring violators under regulatory regime by imposing heavy penalties.“Every project expansion will require submission of an environmental management plan,” Javadekar said in his reply to Ramesh.The Union environment ministry plans to do away with conditions for environmental clearances that cannot be monitored and make the approval time for projects as short as possible.Government documents show that the current auction of coal mines across the country would open up pristine and contiguous forests for mining in parts of central India.In June, the Chhattisgarh government asked the Centre not to allow auction of coal blocks which fall under Hasdeo Arand, Lemru elephant reserve and the Mand river catchment area which are biodiversity-rich forests.Five of the nine coal blocks that will be up for auction for commercial mining fall under this area which includes Morga -2, Morga (South), Madanpur north, Shyang and Fathehpur (east).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-eia-notification-not-yet-finalized-says-prakash-javadekar/story-E8xO9Al3vOksYvNDirWlDI.html
06-08-2020||India||Plasma therapy trial didn’t show benefit in reducing Covid-19 mortality risk: AIIMS||Convalescent plasma therapy did not show benefit in reducing mortality risk among Covid-19 patients, according to an interim analysis of a randomised controlled trial done at AIIMS here to assess the efficacy of this mode of treatment.The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those into an active coronavirus infected patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight back the infection.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria told PTI on Thursday no clear mortality benefit of convalescent plasma therapy was seen during a trial conducted among 30 Covid-19 patients.During the trial, one group of patients was given convalescent plasma therapy along with the standard supportive treatment while the other group only received standard treatment. The number of fatalities recorded in both the groups was equal and there was not much clinical improvement in the condition of patients, he said.“However, this is just an interim analysis and we need to do a more detailed evaluation to see if any sub-group may benefit from plasma therapy,” Dr Guleria said.He also underlined that plasma has to be tested for its safety and should have sufficient antibody to be useful to Covid-19 patients.The efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus-infected patients was discussed in the third National Clinical Grand Rounds (CGR) on Covid-19 held on Wednesday.“Plasma is safe. As far as its efficacy is concerned, we do not have a green signal yet. So the clinical use has to be very judicious and within the ambit of national guidelines,” Dr Monish Soneja, additional professor in the Medicine department at AIIMS, said at the webinar.Convalescent plasma therapy has been listed as an investigational therapy for off-label use in coronavirus infected patients because as of now there is no conclusive evidence for its efficacy, Dr Soneja said.About the initial findings of the randomised controlled trial, Soneja said, “Convalescent plasma is not a magic bullet.” It may be used particularly in early moderate stage of the disease. There may be a subset of patients with certain characteristics who may benefit from plasma, he said, adding, “This is a work in progress as we do not know those characteristics.” The findings highlight that relatives of the patients should not insist on plasma therapy until and unless the treating doctor considers the patient fit for it and where he may think that the mode of treatment would be beneficial, Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate Professor in the department of medicine at AIIMS, said.He said even if the therapy has some role, then that is in the early stage of the disease. But for plasma therapy to be effective, plasma must contain a sufficient amount of neutralizing antibody against that infection, the doctor said.“This therapy also carries risks such as inadvertent transfer of blood-borne infections and reactions to serum constituents, including immunological reactions such as serum sickness, that may worsen the clinical condition,” Dr Nischal said.According to the Clinical Management Protocols for Covid-19 issued by the Union Health Ministry, off-label convalescent plasma may be considered for Covid-19 patients with moderate disease who are not improving, which means oxygen requirement is progressively increasing, despite the use of steroids.The use of off-label convalescent plasma for treating coronavirus patients in the moderate stage of the illness has been included under “investigational therapies”.ABO compatibility and cross-matching of the donor plasma is a prerequisite while considering convalescent plasma, the health ministry has said.The recipient should be closely monitored for several hours after transfusion for any adverse events and its use should be avoided in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency or immunoglobulin allergy.“The dose is variable ranging from 4 to 13 ml/kg -- usually 200 ml single dose given slowly over not less than two hours,” the Clinical Management Protocol stats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-trial-didn-t-show-benefit-in-reducing-covid-19-mortality-risk-aiims/story-xSaKnSQi6GSzkGM8k7bA4I.html

The new proposal has been sent almost a week after the rejection of a similar proposal by the government bringing the differences between the government and the LG’s office into sharp focus.Delhi has witnessed a steady decline in the number of active coronavirus cases and the sharp rise in new cases, which was a cause of worry back in June, has stabilized, easing the pressure on medical facilities and giving the government confidence to seek wider relaxations for further resumption of economic activities. However, the LG’s office has indicated that relaxations such as allowing local weekly markets and gymnasiums to operate may lead to a resurgence in the number of cases and has therefore spurned Kejriwal government’s insistence on that count.The issue has become the latest point of stand-off between the two power centres in the city-state that have often been at loggerheads over various issues.Kejriwal’s deputy Manish Sisodia, had last Saturday, sought home minister Amit Shah’s intervention to force LG Anil Baijal’s hand to allow reopening of weekly markets and hotels citing a need to give economic activities in the capital another shot in the arm.Also Read: Covid-hit private bus operators demand relief from Delhi governmentIn his letter to Shah, Sisodia had cited statistics to claim eight per cent of Delhi’s business and employment was suffering due to the coronavirus disease outbreak.“Due to the closure of weekly markets, five lakh families are sitting at home. Now when they are hopeful that with control over coronavirus in Delhi they will get an opportunity to restart their business, binding them under the decision of closure is unfair to Delhi’s economic situation and hopes of lakhs of people,” Sisodia had written.He had indicated that the Delhi government will resend the proposal to Baijal on Tuesday.“If traders start their business, jobs will be generated, and that the condition of the economy will improve,” the deputy chief minister wrote in his letter.Baijal had rejected the first proposal a day earlier on Friday describing capital’s Covid 19 situation as “fragile” and stating that the threat was still “far from over”.Baijal’s office had claimed that CM Kejriwal had agreed with the LG’s assessment advocating adoption of “a cautious and conservative approach”.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe AAP government has been looking to give further impetus to economic activities in the Unlock 3 phase and has accused LG’s office and the Centre of adopting two yardsticks for Delhi and the rest of the country.A Union home ministry notification has allowed opening of gymnasiums in Unlock-3 while sustaining the restrictions on mass activities including social, political and religious functions. It has also not allowed metro rail services, swimming pools, cinema halls, entertainment parks among other activities that lend itself to mass participation.The Kejriwal government is also pushing for resumption of metro rail services in its bid to revive the Capital’s economy and complete pending projects.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 1,076 fresh coronavirus cases and 11 deaths in the 24 hours period, taking the total number of active cases to 10,072. Delhi had reported less than 1,000 new cases for three consecutive days on July 2 (961), July 3 (805) and July 4 (674).The Kejriwal government has instructed officials to take steps to bring deaths to zero in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-days-after-1st-rejection-kejriwal-govt-resends-lg-proposal-to-reopen-weekly-markets-and-hotels-in-delhi/story-3zjPHiq3WRHTchbVrTrhfN.html

Over 60 villages in its Munsiyari area were cut off due to heavy rains last month. Pradeep Kumar assistant geologist, Pithoragarh district said, “The reason behind the natural tragedies in Pithoragarh seems to be a combination of tectonic activities beneath the ground and incessant rains in the higher reaches due to changing weather patterns.” Kumar had conducted a geological survey of the villages that were hit hard by heavy rain in the last one month.He added, “The areas of Dharchula, Bangapani and Munsiyari which houses most of the affected villages come under earthquake-prone areas in the Himalayas. These areas suffer small earthquakes round the year because of which the soil becomes loose. And when heavy rains lash these areas, landslides happen leading to severe damage to property and life.” Scientists at GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment (NIHE) in Almora corroborated Kumar’s contention and said the changing weather pattern has also contributed to the number of natural disasters happening in Pithoragarh. “The increase in global surface temperature has increased the frequency of cloudbursts and incessant rains in the area. Unfortunately, this seems set to increase in the near future,” Dr RS Rawal, director of GB Pant NIHE. Dr Rawal, however, said that the scientific community needs more time to study and analyse the changing weather pattern in the Himalayan region including that of Pithoragarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/frequent-tectonic-activities-climate-change-causing-landslides-in-pithoragarh-say-experts/story-CVwNidq01STl9m765gDJjP.html

He also said that India was a parliamentary democracy and the decision to abrogate Article 370 provisions, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was taken after detailed discussion in Parliament and with the support of majority of the members. He made these remarks while delivering the first Sushma Swaraj Memorial Lecture, organised by Panjab University, according to an official statement. His comments come close on the heels of China making fresh attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council. The Ministry of External Affairs has said that New Delhi “firmly” rejects Beijing’s “interference” in the country’s internal affairs. According to the statement, “Naidu wanted other nations to mind their own issues rather than interfering in the affairs of other countries.” Referring to the feelings expressed by the late Sushma Swaraj on Article 370 before her death, the vice president said that as the external affairs minister, she used to articulate India’s position quite efficiently and in a “sweet and sober manner”. “But at the same time, she used to convey the stand of the country in a firm manner,” the statement said quoting him. Paying tributes to Swaraj, he described her as an ideal Indian woman. She was an able administrator who left an indelible imprint on every position she had held, he said. Urging young politicians to look up to her as a role model and emulate her qualities, Naidu said Swaraj was a wonderful human being, who was always considerate and prompt in her response to any request, be it friends, supporters or people at large. “The fact that she was elected to Lok Sabha on seven occasions and to the assembly thrice shows how immensely popular she was with the people,” he said. Referring to her qualities, he said her wit, humane nature and promptness in responding to any problem were in full display on the social media when she was the external affairs minister. The vice president said she was loved by millions of countrymen and was one of the most popular Indian foreign ministers in recent times. Naidu said she was a passionate nationalist and always expressed her views in a forthright manner. Describing Swaraj as an epitome of Indian culture, the vice president said she was a blend of modern thinking and traditional values. The vice president said Swaraj used to be like a family member and recalled how she used to visit him and tie rakhi on Raksha Bandhan. “Remembering our cherished bonding, I became emotional when the country celebrated the festival a few days ago,” he said. Swaraj’s daughter Bansuri Swaraj was present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/article-370-nullification-india-s-internal-matter-other-countries-should-not-interfere-naidu/story-aB2GNVrFZagM6rG1k5KFfN.html

06-08-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling accused had good rapport with CM’s office: NIA||In a new development in the sensational gold smuggling case the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday told a special court in Kochi that prime accused in the case Swapna Suresh had a strong connection with Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office. Assistant Solicitor General P Vijaykumar informed this in the NIA court in Kochi while opposing the bail plea of Swapna Suresh. He said she had established a good rapport with the CM’s office through suspended senior bureaucrat M Sivasankar with whom she enjoyed a good rapport and he had helped her get good postings. However, the Assistant Solicitor General said investigation so far showed Sivasankar did not interfere in the release of the consignment when Customs blocked it due to some suspicion despite repeated pleas from Suresh. The case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized from the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. P Sarith, a former employee of the consulate who came to receive the consignment, was arrested by the Customs immediately and two other accused Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was later suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced. Though Sivasankar’s alleged ties with Suresh were doing the rounds for some time this is the first time the NIA has come on record about this. Similarly her ‘close links’ with the CM’s office is also coming out for the first time. Due to this proximity, Sivasankar had gone out of his way to appoint Suresh in a key post in the Space Park controlled by the state government, the counsel told the court. But Suresh’s counsel Joe Paul said she was made a victim in the tug of war between the Centre and state governments. He said a month after the investigation began, the NIA had failed to produce any fresh evidence against the accused. The court later observed it will decide the bail plea on Monday. Earlier the court had asked the NIA how provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) can be invoked against the accused. But it said a good portion of the proceeds from the smuggling were diverted to fund anti-national activities. It also said after preliminary investigation it found one of the accused K T Ramees, who is under NIA custody now, was in touch with some fundamentalist organizations. He also undertook many foreign trips, including to Africa and he was suspected to be a part of an international smuggling and drug racket, the NIA said. When Suresh’s two bank lockers were opened by the probe team ten days back it reportedly found Rs one crore in cash and two kg of gold. These lockers were in the joint name of Suresh and a chartered accountant. The latter reportedly told the team that he was allegedly asked by Sivasankar to help Suresh to open lockers three years ago. After the NIA affidavit came out, the opposition Congress and BJP stepped up pressure seeking the resignation of the CM. “The CM can’t get away by sacrificing his secretary. He should resign at least now,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. The CM is expected to comment during the daily press briefing later in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-had-good-rapport-with-cm-s-office-nia/story-VQMgPg9Hg5XlK0RDYjjIHM.html

The helipad is nearing completion at Narsahi village, a short distance from Thari border outpost (BOP) of Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) near Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in West Champaran district, 80 km from Bettiah, headquarters of West Champaran district. “To the best of our knowledge, construction of the helipad meant for small choppers started a few days back on the disputed area,” said Commandant Rajendra Bhardwaj of 21st Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) Battalion.On August 4, HT had reported that Nepal was planning to construct a helipad at Narsahi village which is a disputed land on Indo-Nepal border and a tender for which had been floated. The SSB had updated the headquarters about the development. However, much to their amazement, SSB officials on Thursday came across the construction of a circular cemented structure at Narsahi village. “We are trying to gather the other related information such as the total area of the helipad and the date on which it came up,” said the commandant. “The construction is at a disputed location. We will update the headquarters with photographs and other details,” said commandant Bhardwaj. Officials blame the changing course of the Gandak river for the controversy around Narsahi. SSB officials said the central part of the Gandak river forms the international boundary between Nepal and India. But with the river changing its course in the 1970s, Narsahi shifted to the other side of the river and later the Indian citizens living there moved to this part of the Indian territory. A video clip of the site in HT’s possession shows the construction with a yellow border around it at a place near an agricultural field. Bricks and water tanks are seen lying on the site and pieces of iron rods and wet ground point it to be newly constructed. The development comes after the relationship between India and Nepal has become strained particularly after the latter’s Parliament approved a new political map, claiming Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand as its territory.There are also speculations about the proposed construction of two more helipads along the Indo-Nepal border. These include one at Triveni near Valmikinagar (West Champaran) and other in Ujjaini (Nawalparasi district of Nepal) sharing border with Uttar Pradesh.“There is a concentrated effort being made by a handful of KP Sharma Oli supporters to provoke us whereas a larger section of the Neplese are in favour to protect their age-old relationship with us. It is high time when New Delhi should break its silence and do the needful,” said Mahesh Agrawal, president of Seema Jagran Manch, Bihar, which works in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-starts-construction-of-helipad-on-disputed-border-area-in-bihar/story-aDtxpzp0GOf9gR5nY6ULjL.html

The bail and parole would be granted to those inmates who are “not dangerous criminals and pose no danger to society,” officials said. There have been about 100 cases of Covid-19 infection among the jail inmates so far. PVK Prasad, Additional Director General (Jail), said, “We have written to the State Legal Services Authority to seek their permission to initiate the process for the same. It is being done to ease the congestion in the jails which at present have about 5,000 inmates against the total capacity of 3,800.” “Once we get permission from the authority, we will initiate the process of identifying the suitable inmates for parole and bail. In this, only those inmates who are not dangerous criminals and are not a danger to society, would be considered,” Prasad said. He said the jail administration is looking to include 500-1000 inmates for the bid to decongest jails.“It will somewhat ease the number of prisoners in jails which is important for proper implementation of the Covid-19 precautions to curb the spread. So far, 100 inmates have tested positive for the virus.

06-08-2020||India||India rejects Pakistan’s criticism of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya||New Delhi on Thursday rejected Islamabad’s condemnation of the construction of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, with the ministry of external affairs (MEA) saying Pakistan should not interfere in India’s internal affairs and refrain from “communal incitement”. Pakistan’s foreign ministry had on Wednesday condemned the building of the temple and described the judgement by India’s Supreme Court (SC) that paved the way for the construction as “flawed”. Responding to these remarks, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “We have seen the press statement by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on a matter internal to India. It should desist from interfering in India’s affairs and refrain from communal incitement.” Also read: Ayodhya basks in Diwali-like glow after temple ceremonyHe added, “While this is not a surprising stance from a nation that practices cross-border terrorism and denies its own minorities their religious rights, such comments are nevertheless deeply regrettable.” The development came against the backdrop of Pakistan mounting a campaign on the Kashmir issue on the first anniversary (August 5) of India’s move to scrap the special status of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and to split the erstwhile state into two union territories (UTs). India-Pakistan ties have been at an all-time low since last year’s stand-off over Pulwama terror attack on February 14 blamed on the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), an outlawed outfit. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had said: “The flawed judgement of the Indian Supreme Court paving the way for construction of the temple not only reflected the preponderance of faith over justice but also the growing majoritarianism in today’s India, where minorities, particularly Muslims and their places of worship, are increasingly under attack.” Also read: Ayodhya marks the twilight of the first Republic | OpinionThe statement said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) had passed resolutions condemning the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was constructing the Ram temple as part of an agenda “of converting India into a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ ”. It criticised the haste in starting construction of the temple amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the controversy over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), as well as measures that “demonised, dispossessed, marginalised and subjected” Muslims to targeted violence. It also criticised what it described as India’s “systematic human rights violations” in J&K and a “design to change the demography” of the region. India and Pakistan have had several testy exchanges in recent months over the treatment of minorities in both countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pakistan-s-criticism-of-ram-mandir-in-ayodhya/story-mBHI5NjxnxWx8mZ5MmjFUP.html

We have detected several such incidents in the past,” Singh told PTI here.The police chief said such incidents of Pakistani UAVs carrying weapons were detected in Kupwara, Heera Nagar, Kathua and Rajouri.Another modus operandi of Pakistan to dispatch weapons through trucks to Jammu and Kashmir was unearthed in Punjab in the past, he said.“There has been a huge shortage of weapons for the militants operating here,” the police chief said.The DGP said Pakistan has intensified cross-border firing this year so that terrorists could be pushed into Jammu and Kashmir.“There has been 75 per cent more firing from across the border in the first seven months of 2020. There were 487 incidents of firing from Pakistan till July this year in comparison to 267 such incidents in the same period in 2019. The firings are cover to infiltrate militants. So far, just 26 militants could infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.Singh said due to sustained anti-militancy operations, the security forces have been able to curtail the number of active militants in Jammu and Kashmir to less than 200 now from 300 to 350 terrorists a few years ago.Referring to local youths joining militancy, the DGP said 80 such youths have joined different terror groups this year of which 20 are now active and the self-life of such militant is now a maximum of 90 days.“Eighty local youths have joined militancy this year so far of which 38 were killed and 22 arrested. Just 20 of those who have joined militancy are active now,” he said.The police chief said as many as 150 militants were killed in 2020 so far, of which 30 are foreigners and another 39 are top commanders. “The terrorist groups are leaderless and facing a huge shortage of weapons,” he said.Claiming success of the anti-militancy operations in last two years, the DGP said it has happened as the security forces have gone against the terrorist support structure -- the Jamaat-e-Islami (JK), Hurriyat and their members and the Over Ground Workers (OGWs).Most of the leaders of the Jamaat and Hurriyat and OGWs are under custody and their funding has been halted, he said.Singh said a Terror Monitoring Group (TMG) has been set up with representatives from the Jammu and Kashmir Police, Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department and a few other organisations, and the body is continuously working to curb funding of terrorists and their supporters.“Almost all links of sending money through hawala, western union money transfer and in tiffin boxes of couriers were shut,” he said.The police chief said security grade has been improved along the International Border and the Line of Control and as a result, six encounters have taken place along the borders so far this year.He said there were 76 casualties and 107 injuries in the security forces in first seven months of 2019 in Jammu and Kashmir, while there were just 36 casualties and 102 injuries in the security forces in the same period in 2020.Terror incidents were also down by 70 per cent -- from 198 in first seven months of 2019 to 124 in the same period in 2020, the DGP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-trying-to-sneak-weapons-into-j-k-using-uavs-dgp-dilbag-singh/story-oMYIEqPDEGhuNTQBmvQ7iL.html

06-08-2020||India||India-UK project to study impact of drug-resistant bacteria in Musi, Adyar rivers||The release of antibiotics into India’s rivers by manufacturers and its impact on the spread of potentially fatal drug-resistant infections is the focus of a new £1.2 million research project, the University of Birmingham announced on Thursday.The project, jointly funded by the UK and India, will be conducted by the university with experts at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad. An estimated 58,000 babies die in India every year from superbug infections passed on from their mothers.The project is part of a £8 million package of UK-India government-backed research aimed at deepening existing scientific research collaboration with five new programmes to tackle anti-microbial resistance (AMR).Supported by the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council and India’s Department of Biotechnology, the cross-disciplinary team also includes researchers from Newcastle University, the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, IIT Gandhinagar and IIT Madras.Experts will sample and model the two contrasting river networks in India, the Musi river in Hyderabad, which has high concentrations of antibiotics released from production facilities, and the less polluted Adyar river in Chennai.The team aims to learn how far resistant bacteria travel before they die or are eaten by other organisms in a unique combination of experiments, field sampling and mathematical modelling of resistance dynamics and water flows.Jan Kreft from the University of Birmingham said: “We don’t know how quickly antibiotics are degraded in the environment and how much they are diluted by rainfall and by entering larger rivers.”“In our AMR flows project, we will learn how antibiotics from manufacturing and the resistant bacteria they select will flow through river networks and how far they can be transported in rivers, from where they can spread onto fields and into communities during floods - allowing us to make a quantitative risk assessment to help create environmental standards for safe concentrations of antibiotics in water bodies.”Indian project lead Shashidhar Thatikonda of IIT Hyderabad added: “We know from previous research that the River Musi is now a factory of superbugs. Modelling water flows will be crucial in predicting the fate of resistant bacteria in the environment and we aim to create models that will be applicable in other rivers and countries.”The scientific advances will also allow the team to compare the effectiveness of different interventions such as separate treatment of waste streams from manufacturing of antibiotics, decentralized sewage treatment or containment reservoirs, the university said.“The recommendations we will produce will help bring down the levels of resistance in the environment. This will contribute to reduce the abundance of resistant pathogens that make infections untreatable,” Thatikonda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uk-project-to-study-impact-of-drug-resistant-bacteria-in-musi-adyar-rivers/story-zH4SEnbBs4keUTkiPN2zJN.html

As per rules, we have applied for a PAN card in its name and awaiting its delivery, after which we will be meeting online and pass a resolution for opening a bank account of the Trust,” IICF Secretary Athar Hussain told PTI.“We had met last month online. As of now, we have identified office space and renovation work is going on there. It will take 10-12 days for the work to complete. After which our office will be functional,” he said.The state government has allotted five acres of land in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village for the construction of the mosque on the directive of the Supreme Court. The IICF will oversee the construction of a mosque, Indo-Islamic research centre, library and hospital in the land.A member of the Trust said, “Ayodhya District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha has formally handed over the possession of the land for the mosque to the Trust members. We have got a certified copy of the revenue record.” The Supreme Court had in November last year paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple by a Trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The residents of Dhannipur, where the land has been allotted, are eagerly waiting for the Trust to start construction of a mosque.Mohammad Izhar, a resident of Dhannipur village, said, “It’s good that the land was allotted here. We are happy and hope that the work will start soon. Finally, our village will develop. We hope so.” Another resident, Mohammad Imran also expressed similar views saying it is good that besides a “mosque we will also get a hospital”.The Trust will have 15 members, of which names of nine have been declared and rest will be finalised soon. “We will co-opt the remaining six trustees. The secretary of the Trust will also be its official spokesperson,” a member of the Trust said.Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday laid the foundation of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. The programme was organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trust-for-building-mosque-on-five-acre-land-in-ayodhya-in-process-of-setting-up-office/story-mlyMMnZWuT1Wdt5UkW8gxK.html

Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-on-aug-20-mallya-s-review-plea-on-transfer-of-usd-40-mn-to-his-children/story-WxN1DC2lzbMMLG4uurMYiM.html

06-08-2020||India||Goa: Incessant rains damage tunnel along Konkan railway; six trains diverted||Incessant rainfall over the past 48 hours has damaged a tunnel along the Konkan railway route in Goa, leading to the diversion of six trains that were en route to and from Kerala. The six trains have been diverted via the Madgaon-Londa-Miraj-Pune-Panvel line. Konkan railway officials said the Pernem tunnel, located between Madure station in Maharashtra and Pernem station in Goa, collapsed at 3 am on Thursday that led to the suspension of train services on the route. No casualties or injuries have been reported. The rail authorities said an early restoration of the train service is in progress. The Pernem tunnel, one of the most treacherous tunnels on the Konkan railway route, is also the longest in Goa. Earlier in the 1990s, six workers had died during the tunnel’s construction. This was the second rail-related incident that affected rail traffic in and around Goa on consecutive days.On Wednesday, a landslide had disrupted the movement of a Karnataka-bound train at Castlerock, which is located beyond the state’s border on the Konkan coast. India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Goa observatory has recorded over 100 millimetres (mm) of rainfall on Wednesday, which is only the second time to have breached the 100-mm mark since 2013. Large parts of the coastal state have reported flooding, as rivers breached their banks washing away coconut groves, fields, and farms. However, the IMD forecast has said the intensity of rains would lessen on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-incessant-rains-damages-tunnel-along-konkan-railway-six-trains-diverted/story-mJ5JSJAZAuJKB4KoUyibyM.html

The bench further directed the state to bring on record the enquiry conducted against the policemen allegedly involved in the offence and the action, if any, that was initiated against them. The matter has been posted for hearing after 3 weeks.The order came on a petition filed by advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha who demanded a CBI probe into the incident. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, pointed out that if the court comes to a conclusion stating police’s involvement in the offence, it must order a CBI probe.Other seers of the Juna Akhara, to which the deceased sadhus belonged, also approached the apex court seeking a fair probe in the case.Earlier in July, two charge sheets were filed in the case before a Dahanu court. A total of 126 accused were named in the two charge sheets.According to the charge sheets, the incident took place amid rumours of kidnapping for illegal sale of organs and child-lifting in the area which led to the mob mistaking the seers and their driver as child-lifters. The case relates to the incident that took place on April 16 when two sadhus and their driver - who were heading towards Surat to attend a funeral - were stopped at Palghar, Maharashtra, and beaten to death on suspicion of being thieves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-calls-for-charge-sheets-in-palghar-lynching-case-to-be-produced/story-w4m7vyxupvYau61k6fTNBL.html
06-08-2020||India||India again rejects China’s interference in internal affairs||New Delhi on Thursday rejected Beijing’s interference in the country’s internal affairs after China backed a move on behalf of its traditional ally Pakistan to discuss the Kashmir issue at a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council. China’s pushed for the discussion at the UN Security Council to coincide with the first anniversary on Wednesday of India’s decision to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and to split it into two union territories. Pakistan had pulled out all stops to rake up the Kashmir issue and observed Wednesday as a “day of exploitation”. The external affairs ministry said in a statement that “China initiated a discussion in the UN Security Council on issues pertaining to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir”. “We firmly reject China’s interference in our internal affairs and urge it to draw proper conclusions from such infructuous attempts,” the statement said. The statement further noted that this “was not the first time that China has sought to raise a subject that is solely an internal matter of India”. It added, “As on such previous occasions, this attempt too met with little support from the international community.” The statement came a day after New Delhi tersely asked Beijing on Wednesday to keep out of the internal affairs of other countries after China contended that India’s “unilateral” changes to the status of Jammu and Kashmir were “illegal and invalid”. Responding to comments by the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesperson, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said: “The Chinese side has no locus standi whatsoever on this matter and is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations.” This was the third time within a year that China raised the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council using what is known as the “any other business” (AOB) item of the agenda, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. China brought up the issue in August last year and in January. Prior to this, the last time the Kashmir issue was on the Security Council’s agenda was in 1971. Such items are taken up during informal, closed-door consultations of the Security Council and there are no records of the discussions or formal outcomes, the people said. However, such moves by China in the past have been opposed by France, the US and other permanent members of the Security Council, who have said Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. India’s permanent representative to the UN, TS Tirumurti, tweeted: “Another attempt by Pakistan fails! In today’s meeting of UN Security Council which was closed, informal, not recorded and without any outcome, almost all countries underlined that J&K was bilateral issue & did not deserve time and attention of Council.” The people cited above said members of the Security Council usually do not oppose AOB items as they produce no outcomes. This was the route adopted by Security Council members to discuss the situation in Hong Kong in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-rejects-china-s-interference-in-internal-affairs/story-SfvaRBmV2WewBr8Kcx9OvI.html

06-08-2020||India||On first anniversary of abrogation of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir witnesses sudden exit of GC Murmu||With sudden exit of Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu in a late night development on Wednesday, President Ramnath Kovind has appointed former Union minister and three-time BJP MP Manoj Sinha as the new incumbent to the constitutional post.Sinha is considered to have a close rapport with National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah.“The President has accepted the resignation of Girish Chandra Murmu as Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir,” said an official spokesman of the Rashtrapati Bhawan.“The President has been pleased to appoint Manoj Sinha, to be the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office vice Girish Chandra Murmu,” he added.It is not the first time that Murmu, a 1985-batch IAS officer from Gujarat cadre, has resigned ahead of his tenure.He was the expenditure secretary in the finance ministry when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah decided to elevate him to the new union territory’s Raj Bhawan. Murmu had then resigned from his post a month before his retirement last year in November.Lieutenant Governors of union territories, quite like governors of states, are appointed for a five-year term.Murmu, who is said to have the trust of PM Modi and Shah, had worked with them in Gujarat when he was posted in the home department. After PM Modi came to Delhi in 2014, Murmu moved to the Gujarat chief minister’s office as principal secretary to Anandiben Patel who had succeeded Modi in the state. He joined the central government less than a year later as a joint secretary in the finance ministry.Varied reasons are being attributed to Murmu’s sudden exit. Recently, the Election Commission had taken exception to his comments to the media on the timing of assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.The EC had said that all decisions on the conduct and timing of elections are its “sole remit” and that L-G should refrain from commenting on issues that are not in his domain. Another reason being cited is Murmu’s statement on restoration of 4G network in the union territory. Murmu had reportedly said that he didn’t see any problem in the restoration of 4G network Jammu and Kashmir.The apex court is adjudicating a writ petition over continued suspension of 4G internet in Jammu and Kashmir since August 5 last year when Centre had revoked its special status and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two union territories.People aware of the developments in Jammu and Kashmir said that since there had been differences between Murmu and chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, administrative work was not hassle free.“Then there was a lobby in the bureaucracy, which had not been working the way Murmu wanted. He wanted the entire machinery to reach out to the people in right earnest and ensure speedy development which was not the case,” they said.On Wednesday, Murmu had reviewed security scenario in a meeting with Northern Army commander, Lieutenant General YK Joshi.Murmu had assumed charge in October last year and his stint in Jammu and Kashmir lasted just nine months.There is speculation that he may take over as the next Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) of India this week after present incumbent Rajiv Mehrishi attains superannuation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-first-anniversary-of-abrogation-of-article-370-jammu-and-kashmir-witnesses-sudden-exit-of-gc-murmu/story-ZoXwBhTpcKO8emEwLu53mM.html
06-08-2020||India||‘Don’t interfere’: India pans China after UNSC rebuffs bid to raise Kashmir||India on Thursday lashed out at China after its failed attempt to raise Kashmir at the United Nations Security Council on behalf of Pakistan, rejecting the attempted by Beijing to interfere in India’s internal affairs.China had backed Pakistan’s request to the UNSC to discuss Kashmir on Wednesday to coincide with the first anniversary of the revocation of the special status extended to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. But four of the five permanent members — the US, UK, France and Russia — sided with India.In a statement, the external affairs ministry underlined that this wasn’t a first for China.“This was not the first time that China has sought to raise a subject that is solely an internal matter of India. We firmly reject China’s interference in our internal affairs and urge it to draw proper conclusions from such infructuous attempts,” the ministry statement said.TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, said “almost all countries at the UNSC underlined that J&K was a bilateral issue and did not deserve time and attention of Council”.“Another attempt by Pakistan fails!” he tweeted after a high-profile joint effort by Pakistan and China - their third over the last one year - to discuss the Kashmir issue at UNSC was blocked.Back home in Islamabad, Pakistan got down to celebrating its third attempt to raise Kashmir at the UNSC as a huge achievement. “This 3rd meeting in a year by the UN Security Council serves as a stark repudiation to the Indian claim that Jammu and Kashmir is an ‘internal matter’,” tweeted Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the message directed at its domestic audience.Prime Minister Imran Khan and Qureshi’s narrative in Pakistan around its campaign on Kashmir is that Islamabad has globally suceeded in isolating New Delhi over the Kashmir issue. At a recent sitting of its parliament during the budget session, PM Khan told lawmakers that he considered Pakistan’s foreign policy its biggest achievement.At the UNSC meeting, China and Pakistan did initially appear to have the support of Indonesia, which holds UNSC’s rotational chair for August. In the end, however, Indonesia came through for India and agreed with others that the dispute needed to resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan, people familiar with the development said.This was an informal consultation that was held behind closed doors and no records were kept of who said what, which would have happened in a formal and open meeting. Pakistan has sought open and formal meetings of the council to grandstand its Kashmir case, but has had to settle for these closed-door versions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-interfere-india-pans-china-after-unsc-rebuffs-bid-to-raise-kashmir/story-Kh07JDTfvSfMLmO7t8UHlO.html
06-08-2020||India||Villagers tie ‘rakhis’ to trees in protest against setting up of IIT-Goa campus||In a unique symbolic protest, villagers in Goa’s Melaulim opposed the setting up of an IIT campus in a thickly forested stretch of land and tied rakhis to the trees that are earmarked to make way for the project.The protest against the IIT campus has been gaining momentum since February after it became clear that the government was planning to finalise 10-lakh square metres of land in Melaulim village for the IIT campus.Located in Goa’s eastern corner at the foothills of the Western Ghats, the land chosen is thickly forested, interspersed with cashew trees that the villagers claim to have sustained them for generations. The locals have been demanding a new proposed site for the IIT campus, one which will come at less of an environmental cost.“Around 300 villagers in batches tied rakhis to the trees that have been marked or enumerated by the government for felling for the proposed IIT Goa project. It’s not that we don’t want the IIT in Goa, we want it but just not at this location,” Shubham Shivolkar, one among many who have been opposing the move, said.Also read: Goa launches online ITI admissions, student data management systemThe IIT Goa, which was allocated to the state in 2014, has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College. Two sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub-districts, for the setting up of a permanent campus but were scrapped on account of protests from local residents and pressure from the Opposition. The Opposition had alleged a land scam in shortlisting of sites for the top technology institute.“The local communities of Melaulim village are totally dependent on the economic and environmental resources provided by the lands. The lives and livelihoods of the 2,500 local people is directly dependent on their agricultural, grazing and forest lands as well as local water resources,” the villagers stated in their letter marked to various representatives. A copy was also sent to the President of India.Goa’s Melaulim village falls in an eco-sensitive zone but hasn’t been formally declared so. The land on which the IIT campus is scheduled to come up is a revenue land belonging to the government but the villagers have said that the situation has persisted only because they did not have the required documentation to prove that they have rights over it.“The indigenous local communities of Sattari taluka are the most oppressed in Goa. Most of the people of the villages surrounding Melaulim don’t have any documentation of their rights over the lands on which they live and cultivate. Most of the lands in this region are wrongly recorded in government records as occupied by the ruling class families or by the Government of Goa, though the indigenous communities have lived on these lands, cultivated them and occupied them continuously and without any interruption for thousands of years,” Shashikant Sawardekar who leads the opposition said in a letter addressed to MLAs in Goa.The villagers further added that besides helping them sustain their families, the area is rich in biodiversity with populations of bison, leopards, pangolins, slender loris, species of deer civets, giant squirrel, flying squirrel all kinds of rare birds and other fauna endemic to the Western Ghats.Villagers have been drumming up support for their cause with the vruksha bandhan protest being the latest in a series of protests. Previously, the villagers had organised a ‘mandd’, or a traditional gathering of villages, in an open space to denounce the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-tie-rakhis-to-trees-in-protest-against-setting-up-of-iit-goa-campus/story-gE2q5mCbId7E1yh5FvlNeM.html

06-08-2020||India||China became ‘more aggressive’ during Covid-19; deployed troops along LAC: US defence chief||The world has seen China become “more aggressive” during the Covid-19 pandemic, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said, asserting that the country has deployed troops along the Line of Actual Control with India and is acting out in a way that is “inconsistent” with international norms. Esper said Beijing was trying to use the coronavirus tragedy to their advantage for “propaganda purposes”. “What we have seen with regard to what happened in the last seven months coming as part of Covid, if you will, we’ve seen China become more aggressive, trying to use the tragedy, of Covid-19 to their advantage for propaganda purposes. They have really overplayed their hand and we’ve seen them continue to try and exercise this muscle in the South China Sea,” he said on Wednesday. Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, claiming that the ownership of territory belonged to China for hundreds of years. Responding to a question during Aspen Security Forum discussion, Esper said that the Chinese sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel a few months ago. “They continue to twist the arms of others. They’ve deployed troops along the line of actual control in India. We see them acting out in a way that is inconsistent with, you know, international norms, rules of behaviour, if you will, and many of our allies and partners are reacting as well,” he said. His remarks came amid the border face-off between India and China in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian army personnel were killed during the clashes with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties in the clashes but it is yet to give out details. The number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35, according to a US intelligence report. The Defense Secretary praised Australia and the UK for pushing Huawei out of their systems or lauded the Australians for a brand-new defense strategy that has long-term commitment to funding. According to Esper, the best way to take on the Chinese aggression is to multilateralise efforts against Beijing. “...The US being unable to travel, we found new ways to communicate and to do it in a multilateral way. We need to continue to advance that. We need to multilateralise those. Maybe not officially, right? But in terms of knitting things up so we talk more as a group,” he said. “That’s the best way to push back against China and its bad behaviour in the Pacific. And I see that as another positive outcome, if you will, of us being unable to travel. We found new ways to communicate and to do it in a multilateral way, and I think we need to continue to advance that,” Esper said. The threat posed by China is not region, but global, he said. “The China competition, by the way, is not limited to Indo PACOM, it is a global competition so we see them in all parts of the world. So it’s multifaceted and it requires tough decisions and look, we are making those tough decisions as best we can,” Esper said. Responding to another question, Esper said that he did not see China right now as an inevitable threat that the US is going to have a fight with. “But we do have to compete, and we have to be much more vigorous in all domains if you will whether it’s again diplomatic, informational, military, political,’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-became-more-aggressive-during-covid-19-deployed-troops-along-lac-us-defence-chief/story-CVDGF9KzDf9Yqs7r3JsfcO.html

The move invited protests from the doctors and medical staff.Dr Uttam Bhattacharjee, an assistant professor of Ophthalmology department of the Agartala Government Medical College (AGMC), was suspended under sub-rule (I) of Rule 10 of the Central Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 and a disciplinary action is contemplated against him, according to an order served by joint secretary Debasish Das. Dr Bhattacharjee was asked not to leave the capital city without permission of the concerned authority. Doctors from Indian Medical Association (IMA), Tripura chapter, AGMC Teachers’ Forum and All Tripura Government Doctors Association (ATGDA) termed the suspension as “unjustified”. They demanded immediate withdrawal of the suspension order.“We don’t know why Dr Bhattacharjee was suspended. But this kind of decision is an attack on the medical community. His suspension is unjustified,” said Dr Rajesh Choudhury, secretary of ATGDA.However, he added that there was a rumour that Dr Bhattacharjee was suspended in connection to a recent visit of a legislator to the Covid care centre. “We have heard about the rumour. But we don’t know whether it is true or not,” he said. A case was lodged against BJP legislator Sudip Roy Barman for entering a Covid care centre in Agartala on Sunday “without any authorisation” and thus violating Epidemic Diseases Act and under Section 3 of Tripura Medical Service and Protection of Property Damage Act.Dr Bhattacharjee could not be contacted for his reaction, but an official of hospital claimed that he is yet to receive his suspension order. Moreover, Dr Bhattacharjee was on duty at the Covid care centre entire day on Sunday, the official said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-doctors-stage-protest-over-suspension-of-colleague-posted-at-covid-care-centre/story-j3GtH60vkhtx0hvFHoPeTO.html

Movement of persons without special permission from the district magistrate shall not be permitted with effect from 10 pm of August 5,” Sonitpur deputy commissioner Manvendra Pratap Singh tweeted. Also read: Why Opposition is caught in a bind on the Ram Mandir issueThe decision to impose the curfew was taken after the locals in Thelamara, belonging to a particular community, objected to a bike rally being taken out by Bajrang Dal activists to mark the Ram Mandir event, an official said refusing to be quoted. “The bikers were playing loud music and were headed to a temple in Thelamara when local residents objected to the rally being organised at the time of Covid-19 pandemic and when there was a ban on such activities,” he said. This led to arguments and clashes in which several persons were injured and some bikes were damaged. The police had to resort to firing in the air and bring in additional forces to bring the situation under control. “I am of the opinion that there exists a grave law and order situation due to present scenario… whereas the groups are trying to indulge in violence in the name of protest and in view of the present event, there is apprehension of grave risks and danger to human lives and properties if persons are allowed to move freely,” Singh said in his order. The curfew will continue till further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curfew-imposed-in-assam-s-district-after-clashes-over-ram-mandir-celebrations/story-5EzJ6YeQWh9hiAYuDCXghJ.html

06-08-2020||India||Mutilated carcass of leopard in Odisha triggers suspicion of poaching||The mutilated carcass of a leopard was found in Odisha’s Sundergarh district on Wednesday, triggering suspicion of poaching by villagers.Forest officials in Sundargarh district said the caracass of the leopard with its lower limb severed was found near a railway track at Badarampia village under Hemagir forest range. Sundargarh District Forest Officer (DFO) Sanjay Swain said as the leopard had attacked and injured five villagers of the area on Tuesday evening, there is possibility that the locals killed the animal.“We are investigating into the issue and would take action against anyone who is found to have killed the leopard,” he said. The Hemgiri Forest Range is reportedly home to many big cats including leopard, tiger and black panther. Leopards are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Over the last 10 years, at least 155 leopards have been poached across Odisha. The killing of the leopard came days after the all India Tiger Census 2018 conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority revealed that the number of tigers in Odisha have remained static between 2014 and 2018. Wildlife conservationists of Odisha blamed poaching for the lack of rise in tiger numbers.In last two months, forest department as well as special task force of Crime Branch of Odisha Police have seized five leopard skins indicating its largescale poaching. Last month, a joint team of Chhattisgarh Police and Odisha forest department had arrested a person on charges of leopard skin trade in Nuapada district on the Odisha-Chhattisgarh border. A bag containing leopard skin was seized from his possession.In June, the Special Task Force of Odisha Crime Branch has seized four leopard skins and arrested three people in Nayagarh district who were engaged in trading of leopard skin.“Odisha has been losing both tigers and leopards due to poaching despite the state having excellent habitat and vast forests for the big cats to flourish. The forest department has miserably failed to control poaching even in tiger reserves like Simlipal and Satkosia,” alleged wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mutilated-carcass-of-leopard-in-odisha-triggers-suspicion-of-poaching/story-lAGVUQajbfAioinkzfuDVK.html

Four people of Beldih village of the district were arrested by the forest department and were booked under Wildlife Protection Act. “The accused laid live wires in which electricity was flowing in Chhindauli village under Pithora forest range. Two sloth bears came in contact with the wire and were killed,” Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Arun Kumar Pandey told Hindustan Times. The officers said that the incident took place on Monday evening and forest department started investigating the case after the carcasses were found. “The wire was laid to hunt wild animals just outskirts of the village. We were suspicious about some people of the same village and hence we called sniffer dogs to locate the accused. On Sunday with the help of dogs, the department raided some houses and found some wires. Four persons were arrested and were booked under Wildlife Protection Act,” said Pandey. The accused were identified as Ramji Nishad (65), Nainsingh (38), both from Chhindauli, Devlal Chakradhari (30) and Jaiprakash, natives of Beldih. Meawwhile, a deer was also killed in Garyiband district on Tuesday evening with arrows and the department has started investigating the case. “We have some leads and dog squad has been sent on the spot on Wednesday,” said Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-sloth-bears-killed-by-poachers-in-chhattisgarh-4-arrested/story-TDcxMBIBvztYRAHNCJPHAN.html

Writing jointly to demonstrate the strong bipartisan support for the US-India relationship, the chairman and ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar said members of both the parties recognise the impact that a strong US-India partnership will have on the trajectory of the 21st century. “As Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi said in February of this year, our ties ‘are no longer just another partnership. It is a far greater and closer relationship’“, said the letter signed by Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Michael T McCaul, its ranking member. “This closer relationship is all the more important as India faces aggression from China along your shared border, which is part of the Chinese government’s consistent pattern of unlawful and belligerent territorial aggression across the Indo-Pacific,” the two powerful Congressmen said. Their remarks came amid the border face-off between India and China in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian army personnel were killed during the clashes with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties in the clashes but it is yet to give out details. The number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35, according to a US intelligence report. The United States will remain steadfast in support of India’s efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, said the letter dated August 5 and was tweeted by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “As champions of the US-India relationship, we have been delighted to see our countries’ close cooperation on issues from defense to climate change. It is because of our support for the bilateral relationship that we note with concern that conditions in Jammu and Kashmir have not normalised one year after India’s repeal of Article 370 and the establishment of Jammu and Kashmir as a Union Territory,” they wrote. “We acknowledge the ongoing serious security and counterterrorism concerns in the region and look forward to working with your government to address these concerns while upholding our shared commitments to the democratic values and freedoms on which our countries’ bond was built,” the lawmakers wrote. “As Prime Minister Modi said earlier this year, ‘Unity in diversity and unity’s vibrancy is the key to a strong relationship between India and America’. We look forward to working with you to continue to strengthen and advance this vibrant and consequential relationship,” Engel and McCaul wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closer-india-us-ties-important-amidst-chinese-aggression-us-lawmakers/story-0gLgluXcYkPtoLc6yMrKJM.html
06-08-2020||India||PM Modi uses silver brick to lay the foundation stone of Ram Mandir||Loud cheers of Jai Shri Ram, the chanting of Vedic hymns and the blowing of conches greeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi as stepped into the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Uttar Pradesh Ayodhya town at 12.07pm on Wednesday. Inside, 175 guests waited patiently in chairs spaced two-feet apart under a waterproof canopy in shades of red, gold and yellow. Outside, in the temple town, people thronged shops with television sets to watch the event, and rooftops of houses near the temple site became vantage viewing points as people jostled to get a glimpse of the Prime Minister. “Bhoomi pujan (the ground breaking ceremony) is a new beginning for us and end of a bitter past,” said Sujeet Bahadur, 65, a local resident who is old enough to remember the movement for the Ram temple. Dressed in a traditional silk dhoti and gold-coloured kurta, Modi offered prayers to the infant deity, Ram Lalla, at the makeshift temple and performed a circumambulation, before planting a sapling .He then participated in the ground breaking ceremony. The Vedic ceremony, presided over by Senapati Shastri of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham in Tamil Nadu, began with prayers to Ganesha, the Hindu god of beginnings. Hymns dedicated to Lord Hanuman, Kaal Bhairav and Goddess Kali, the clan deity of Ram, were also recited. A 40kg silver brick donated by temple trust chief Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, was used for the ritual.The main foundation-laying event began at 12.45pm, a pre-ordained time decided by astrologers and seers. The priests dug a pit in the sanctum sanctorum of the proposed temple, the silver brick was removed and nine other bricks, engraved with the words ‘Jai Shri Ram’ [Hail Lord Ram], placed instead. All the bricks were donated by devotees around the world in 1989, when Hindu groups started mass mobilization to build the temple in what they believed is the birth place of Lord Ram.A lotus and the PM’s personal offering, a kalash (holy pitcher) made of five metals sacred in Hindu traditions (gold, silver, copper, iron and zinc) was placed on the bricks. A copper plaque donated by Shankaracharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham, one of Hinduism’s holy seats, inscribed with Sanskrit hymns was also laid at temple’s foundation. As the PM offered prayers, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Salil Singhal, nephew of late Vishwa Hindu Parishad chief Ashok Singhal, and his wife looked on. All were wearing masks.Soil from at least 2,000 Hindu holy sites and water from at least 100 sacred rivers were used for purification and other rituals. The 175 guests included 135 seers from various spiritual traditions and eminent people from Ayodhya. “Nine bricks are kept here... these were sent by devotees of Lord Ram from around the world in 1989. There are 2,75,000 such bricks, out of which 100 bricks with ‘Jai Shri Ram’ engraving have been taken,” said a priest officiating the ceremony.The ceremony lasted 40 minutes, after which the PM released a postage stamp on the Ram temple designed by the Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan, an organisation of the Uttar Pradesh government’s culture department. Adityanath presented a three-feet high statue of Kodanda Ram carved from rosewood to PM Modi. Kodada (literally, with bow) Ram represents the deity from the period during which Ram was looking for Sita after her abduction in the epic Ramayana.In the evening, fireworks lit up the sky and tens of thousands of earthen lamps glittered across the town as locals said they hoped the ceremony marked a new beginning. Authorities said 100,000 lamps were lit along the banks of the Saryu river. “Lord Ram belongs to everyone. Ram temple will also bring overall development to Ayodhya,” said Iqbal Ansari, son of the oldest litigant in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit decided by the Supreme Court last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-uses-silver-brick-to-lay-the-foundation-stone-of-ram-mandir/story-SdjaznicaNTMBh4WSxk8OK.html
06-08-2020||India||Manoj Sinha appointed as new lieutenant governor of Jammu and Kashmir||President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday appointed former Union minister Manoj Sinha as the next Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. He will replace Girish Chandra Murmu who resigned on Wednesday.In a release confirming the same, the President house said, “The President has been pleased to appoint Shri Manoj Sinha, to be the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office vice Shri Girish Chandra Murmu.”President Kovind accepted Murmu’s resignation on Thursday. There is buzz that he is going to be the next Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India.The move to appoint Sinha as the next Lieutenant Governor is aimed at reaching out to the people of the union territory with a soft political touch, something that Murmu, a former bureaucrat, could not achieve during his nine-month tenure.After Satyapal Malik, who was governor of erstwhile J&K state, Sinha is the new political touch to the Valley - both Malik and Sinha are grassroot politicians with the latter an alma mater of IIT-BHU, Varanasi. He lost the last Lok Sabha election to strongman and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Afzal Ansari.Sinha has represented the parliamentary constituency of Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh thrice in the Lok Sabha. He has also served as minister of communications and minister of state for Railways.After the stunning victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, Sinha’s name was among the contenders for the post of chief minister. He eventually lost the post to Yogi Adityanath, a five-time MP from Gorakhpur.He was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1999. During his student days, Sinha was the students’ union president in the Banaras Hindu University.As minister of state for Railways, Sinha handled key assignments including the task to connect several cities in eastern Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manoj-sinha-appointed-as-new-lieutenant-governor-of-jammu-and-kashmir/story-KB2e86D0DRNUdneNrTmhTI.html
06-08-2020||India||From habeas corpus to 4G services in Jammu and Kashmir: Pleas in Supreme Court||August 5 marks the first anniversary of the effective abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution that conferred special status on Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and the reorganisation of the state into two Union territories. Numerous petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court against the changes. Here is a look at where those cases stand.Challenge to revocation of Article 370At least 23 petitions are pending before the Supreme Court challenging the Centre’s decision to end the special status of J&K by revoking the article. These petitions were heard in December 2019 and January 2020 by a five- judge constitution bench headed by justice NV Ramana.Certain intervenors in the case then requested that the case be referred to a larger bench. This, they argued, was because two earlier SC judgments, Prem Nath Kaul (1959) and Sampat Prakash (1968), are in conflict with regard to the scope and intent of Article 370 and whether the provision was intended to be a temporary or a permanent one. Since both those judgments were delivered by benches of five judges, the intervenors asked the court to refer the issue to a bench of seven or more judges.Also read: J&K decision a strategic blunder for India, says Pak PM Imran KhanThe central government and the Union territory of J&K opposed the reference and submitted that there was no conflict between the two judgments.The Constitution bench heard the parties with regard to the reference and delivered its verdict on this limited aspect on March 2. It declined to refer the matter to a larger bench. The case has not been heard after that.Petitions against lockdownThe abrogation of Article 370 was accompanied by a total shutdown of Kashmir to forestall protests. Telephone lines, mobile communication and internet services were stopped and restrictions imposed on the press and transport within the valley.A slew of petitions were filed before the SC challenging such restrictions, which the petitioners argued were in violation of their fundamental right to speech and expression and the right to move freely under Article 19 of the Constitution. The petitioners included editor of Kashmir Times newspaper, Anuradha Bhasin, and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad.A three-judge top court bench comprising justices NV Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai heard the case and ruled on January 10 that all restrictive orders should be reviewed by the government.Also read: In a rebuff to Pakistan, UNSC says again Kashmir should be resolved bilaterallyImportantly, it held that freedom of speech and expression and freedom to carry on trade or profession through the internet was a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution and any order suspending internet services can be only for a temporary duration and not for an indefinite period. Such orders should indicate the reasons for the necessity of such a shutdown and they should be put in the public domain, the court ruled.While the court did say that prohibitions on free speech and movement will be violative of fundamental rights, it did not strike down such prohibitions. Instead, it asked the government itself to review such restrictions. The practical impact of this judgment was little although the government subsequently eased many restrictions in the Valley.Plea for restoration of 4G servicesA petition was filed before the SC in April challenging the order issued by J&K administration in March restricting the internet speed in mobile data to 2G. The petition by the NGO, Foundation for Media Professionals, prayed that 4G internet services be restored in J&K taking into account the Covid -19 pandemic.The Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on May 11, refrained from passing directions to restore 4G mobile internet services in J&K, instead constituting a special committee to take a call on the issue and examine the necessity to allow faster internet in certain areas of the newly formed UT. Subsequently, a contempt of court petition was filed by the petitioner in June pointing out that no action had been taken yet to comply with the SC’s judgment. The Centre told the SC that a special committee was constituted to review restrictions on mobile internet in J&K and it decided against offering any relaxation for the time being. The case is due to come up for hearing on August 7.Habeas Corpus petitionsVarious Habeas Corpus petitions were also filed before the SC against detention of individuals. Four such petitions:Omar Abdullah: Former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah’s detention was challenged in February by his sister Sara Abdullah Pilot. The top court on February 14 issued notice to the J&K administration but the petition became infructuous (pointless) after Abdullah was released on March 24.Mehbooba Mufti: Iltija Mufti , the daughter of former CM Mehbooba Mufti challenged Mufti’s detention under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) Act, saying that it was based on vague and slanderous grounds that demonstrated personal and political bias against her.In her petition, Iltija Mufti said that the February 5 order shifting her mother from preventive custody to detention under the PSA was based on a dossier prepared by the superintendent of police, Srinagar, replete with personal remarks and in bad taste. The court issued notice to the Centre on February 26 but the matter has not been heard after that. Saifuddin Soz: This would be the most noteworthy of all the Habeas Corpus pleas from J&K in Supreme Court.Congress leader and former union minister Saifuddin Soz’s detention was challenge before the Supreme Court on June 1 by his wife Mumtazunnisa Soz.Soz, an octogenarian, has been under detention since August 5, 2019.When the petition came up for hearing on June 8, the SC sought the response of the Centre and J&K. The Centre filed an affidavit in July stating that Soz was never under detention and the petition was frivolous. It was stated that Soz has been given security personnel for his protection and he is free to go anywhere.The SC disposed of the case on July 29 after recording the centre’s stance. There was a twist in the tale as Soz was captured on video by TV channels stating that he was under house arrest. Interestingly, the order passed by the Supreme Court on July 29 disposing of the petition is yet to be uploaded on the website of the court.Mian Abdul Qayoom: President of the J&K high court bar association, Mian Abdul Qayoom was detained on August 5, 2019 under the PSA. He was subsequently shifted to Agra the same month and then to Tihar jail in January 2020.Qayoom’s plea challenging his detention was turned down by the J&K high court on May 29. The high court held that Qayoom’s ideology was like a live volcano. Qayoom then appealed to the top court. A three-judge bench ordered Qayoom’s release on July 29 after the central government agreed to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-habeas-corpus-to-4g-services-in-jammu-and-kashmir-pleas-in-supreme-court/story-Oxo1KT4fACr1N3XCPk1UWK.html
06-08-2020||India||J&K decision a strategic blunder for India, says Pak PM Imran Khan||Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Wednesday his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi’s action to scrap the special status of J&K was a “strategic blunder” based on four miscalculations.Addressing a special session of the legislative assembly of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in Muzaffarabad on the first anniversary of India’s action, Khan said the first mistaken assumption was to expand his Hindu vote base by revoking Kashmir’s status. The second assumption, he said, was that Pakistan would remain quiet “because we were trying to become friends with them”. The third assumption was the world would stay silent because other countries want to use India to counter China, he added. The fourth miscalculation, he said, was that India thought it would be able to crush the Kashmiris by posting hundreds of thousands of troops in the Kashmir Valley and then change the region’s demography. All these assumptions had proved wrong, Khan said.Also read: In a rebuff to Pakistan, UNSC says again Kashmir should be resolved bilaterallyThere was no immediate reaction from the Indian side to Khan’s comments, which came a day after Islamabad issued a new political map that depicted the Indian union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and parts of Gujarat state as Pakistani territories.India had dismissed the map as an “exercise in political absurdity” with no legal backing.Khan told his audience that his government had reacted strongly to India’s actions last year. “The UN discussed the Kashmir issue thrice during the last year for the first time since 1965. It also published two reports on human rights abuses in...Kashmir,” he said.He said he personally spoke to world leaders about the issue. “I explained to [US President Donald] Trump twice how Kashmir was a flashpoint. I talked to [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel, [UK Prime Minister] Boris Johnson, [French President Emmanuel] Macron, explained to them, made them understand,” he said.“Today, Modi is exposed in front of the world, the biggest result of which is that people are [now] looking towards [the situation in] Kashmir. India is now in a blind alley and there’s no way out from this situation,” he said.Explaining the reasoning behind the new map of Pakistan, Khan said he wanted to show to the world Kashmir is a disputed area. “We have said at every forum the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to resolutions passed by the UN Security Council and we have written this on the map as well,” he said.He announced his government will confer its highest civilian award, the Nishan-e-Pakistan, on Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani.Also read: Imran Khan’s Pakistan might end up regretting its new ‘political map’. Here is whyMeanwhile, Pakistan’s foreign ministry clarified that the new map reaffirmed the country’s commitment to finding a solution to the Kashmir through “the realization of the Kashmiris’ inalienable right to self-determination through a free and impartial plebiscite” under the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-decision-a-strategic-blunder-for-india-says-pak-pm-imran-khan/story-Qy90EKUzAwl43eUkGJDuIN.html
06-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, the number of cases in Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, which drove up the number of India’s coronavirus disease infections for much of April, May, and June, accounted for just 26.5% of the total 50,777 cases in the country, according to the HT dashboard. On Monday, the corresponding proportion was 31% of 49,401 cases. On Sunday, it was 30.7% of 53,112 cases. And on Saturday, it was 30% of 55,617 cases.This writer has been saying it for some time, but the epicentre of the pandemic in India is moving further into the hinterland and to parts of the peninsula where it did not previously seem to be very prevalent. To be sure, while Delhi has seen a sharp fall in cases, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have not – so the new wave is being driven largely by states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. On Saturday, these five states accounted for 43.4% of all cases in India; on Sunday, this proportion was 44.17%; on Monday, it was 44.6%; and on Tuesday, 47.6%. Also read: Zydus to start second phase of Covid-19 vaccine candidate trials todaySome final numbers to close the argument: while these five states account for 29.7% of all cases, they account for 40.7% of active ones currently; and while they account for just about a fifth of all deaths, over the past four days, they have accounted for a third of the deaths (which are continuing to rise). There are other states whose numbers are also a cause for concern (Telangana, for instance, where the testing is also low), but these five are the states where immediate intervention is required.New Delhi, we have a problem – and it is not in New Delhi.The trajectories – of the two states and the Capital ravaged by the virus through April, May, and much of June, and of the five states that are now seeing a spike in cases – are telling.Of the five states, three have already crossed the 100,000 mark in terms of number of cases. The others will, especially as they increase testing (indeed, the efforts to fight the pandemic, of at least three of these five states, have been hobbled by inadequate testing). Some of these states are looking at antigen testing as a quick fix. Uttar Pradesh, for instance, has conducted large-scale testing camps using these testing kits that give results within the hour. Many of them are simply following the Delhi model, one element of which was a sharp increase in testing using rapid antigen tests. These tests respond to the protein on the surface of viruses (unlike molecular tests, which respond to viral RNA, or antibody tests, which respond to antibodies generated by the body to fight the virus), and their biggest advantage is that they are quick. As this column has suggested previously, it makes sense to use them when a large number of people have to be tested in a very short time – for instance, in a containment zone where cases are peaking, but it definitely does not make sense to use them as a substitute for gold-standard molecular tests such as the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) one.Indeed, given that other parameters (such as the occupancy of hospital beds) clearly establishes that the Capital is on the mend, Delhi should probably stop using antigen tests altogether and use only RT-PCR ones. Neither time nor capacity is a constraint (the first is reason enough to use antigen tests; the second, not so – the only way to deal with inadequate testing capacity is to rapidly acquire it).If antigen tests have to be used – they have to be used the way they were meant to be. Scientists recommend that negative antigen tests be followed up by molecular tests. The Indian Council of Medical Research also suggests that this be done. That’s because these tests are very accurate in identifying positive cases, but some of the cases they identify as negative are positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-0uoJjdHgCYn7GpHeIvOjwO.html

People across all sections of the society said they felt construction of Ram temple would bring development not only to Ayodhya but also to the adjoining regions.After sunset, Ayodhya’s skyline was aglow with fireworks. All houses were illuminated with earthen lamps, candles and rangoli. Temples across the town were decorated.The entire Ram Janmabhoomi campus and Hanuman Garhi temple shimmered in the light of earthen lamps.The majestic Ram Ki Paidi ghat on the Saryu riverbank looked splendid when over a lakh earthen lamps were lit.

In the coming days, Ayodhya will witness a lot of activity. I am unable to decide what business I should do. But I will not seek a job. Instead, I will run my own business,” said Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-basks-in-diwali-like-glow-after-temple-ceremony/story-Qi5ujGQCK7URMPp3WGessI.html
06-08-2020||India||Ayodhya’s tryst with destiny||Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the first brick of the Ram Mandir at a grand “bhoomi pujan” ceremony in Ayodhya on Wednesday, and said that August 5 will stand as a symbol of the commitment of several generations that devoted their lives to the construction of the temple, just as August 15 symbolises the sacrifices of countless Indians for Independence.Modi spoke of Ram as a thread of India’s unity in diversity, referring to the multiplicity of Ramayanas across the country, highlighting Ram’s appeal across the world, and distilling Ram’s messages — of social harmony, non-discrimination, care for the poor, protecting those who seek refuge, and commitment to the motherland. He also said that the more power a nation has, the greater is its capacity for friendship. These were all messages widely read in sync with India’s contemporary governance and security priorities.Also read: For once, saffron cuts across political divide with Ram temple event celebrations in MPIn the backdrop of the protracted political, social and legal dispute that has marked the issue of the Ram temple, Modi added that the temple should be constructed on the foundation of mutual love and brotherhood, and it was only through everyone’s participation (“sabka saath”) and with everyone’s trust (“sabka vishwas”) that India can achieve development for everyone (“sabka vikas”). He also pointed to the economic benefits of the temple for the wider Ayodhya region, where pilgrims from across the world would come to pray. The beginning of the construction comes after a 135-year-old legal dispute culminated when the Supreme Court, last November, awarded the disputed land to Hindu parties. It also comes in the wake of a three-decade-long mobilisation by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological affiliates, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 -- an act declared illegal by the same SC verdict -- that led to communal violence and deaths in various parts of the country. The event was preceded by days of preparation and festivities in Ayodhya. Modi landed in the town on Wednesday morning, visited the Hanuman Garhi temple, planted a tree, participated in the rituals associated with bhoomi pujan, and then released a special postal stamp on the occasion. He then addressed a select audience, carefully curated due to pandemic-related restrictions, but his speech was beamed across the country. The event also saw the participation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat as a special guest — a rare occasion when the PM and the RSS chief shared the stage and spoke on the same platform. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and the head of the Ram Temple trust, Nritya Gopal Das also spoke at the function following the bhoomi pujan ceremony.Also read: Golden chapter, says PM Modi after laying foundation stone for Ram templeAdityanath welcomed the guests, highlighted how this day had arrived after waiting for five centuries, and emphasised that it had come through peaceful, constitutional and democratic methods. The wishes of India’s 135 crore [1.35 billion] people and the Sanatan Dharma followers have been fulfilled,” he said. Bhagwat spoke of a sense of satisfaction and joy at seeing the temple being constructed. “Today is a new beginning of a new India,” he said. “There is a wave of joy in the country now...” Modi used a 40kg silver brick, donated by Das, for the ceremony and presented a kalash (holy pitcher) made of five metals for the ceremony. The event happened under a canopy decorated in shades of red, yellow and gold. In the audience sat 175 guests, drawn from 135 spiritual traditions and eminent citizens from Ayodhya. Of the three Muslim invitees, only Iqbal Ansari -- the son of the oldest litigant in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit, Hashim Ansari -- attended the event. “Lord Ram belongs to everyone. Ram temple will also bring overall development to Ayodhya,” said Ansari. In his address, Modi spoke of how it was an emotional day for all Indians, many of whom could not believe that they could see this moment in their own lifetime. He said that “Ram Lalla” (the child deity), living in a tent, will finally find a home in a grand temple, and Ram Jamnabhoomi would finally be free of the cycle of breaking and rebuilding. The PM spoke of the power of Ram, and in what appeared to be a reference to the belief that a temple was demolished to construct the Babri mosque, he said, “See the power of Ram. Structures got demolished; every effort was made to erase his existence; but Ram is still etched in our minds. He is the basis of our culture.” The Ram temple, Modi said, was a “modern symbol”, a symbol of faith, a symbol of national sentiment, a symbol of the collective power of the people, and the process of temple construction was a process of bringing together and uniting the people of the nation, and connecting the past with the present. Alluding to the diverse appeal of Ram, he referred to the different Ramayanas read and recited across the country, and the intersection of Ram with Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism. Modi spoke of Ram’s following globally, spanning from the Muslim-majority Indonesia to neighbours such as Nepal and Sri Lanka and even Iran and China. He said, “Ram belongs to everyone; Ram is present in everyone.” The PM highlighted Ram’s qualities of truthfulness and bravery, and claimed social harmony constituted the basis of his rule, and there hadn’t been an ideal ruler such as Ram in the world. He said Ram had espoused the values of mutual love and brotherhood — and this should be the basis of the construction of the temple. He praised the dignity with which everyone had followed and abided by the SC verdict last year, and the need to respect everyone’s sentiments. Chronicling the messages of Ram’s rule, Modi spoke of how this was Gandhi’s ideal of Ram Rajya and it was what India was following. These included how no one should be left poor or unhappy; how men and women should be equally happy, without discrimination; how farmers and those engaged in livestock farming should be happy; that elders, children and medical personnel should be protected (a message he said was reinforced by the coronavirus pandemic); that those who seek refuge must be protected — a possible reference to CAA; and that through power and fear, the capacity for peace increases. “That is why the stronger our nation becomes, the more secure it will be and there will be peace and friendship.” The Congress said it was a day for people to come together. “Congress consistently believed in resolving the Ayodhya issue either through dialogue or through acceptance of the verdict of the court. That’s the only way in which mature democracies and multicultural societies resolve conflict...today is a historic day when India is witnessing a closure to the issue,” said Congress’s Pawan Khera.Also read| Bhoomi poojan in Ayodhya will establish self-confidence for making India self-reliant: Mohan BhagwatWhile Congress president Sonia Gandhi did not comment on bhoomi pujan, she asked party leaders to speak on it on all media platforms so that the party’s message reaches out to the people, people familiar with the development said. “Moreover, the CWC resolution is already there and that is the official stand of the party,” a party leader said on the condition of anonymity.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said he hoped future generations would tread the path shown by ‘maryada purushottam’ (an adjective for Ram referring to his commitment to justice and dignity for all). Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati said it was unfortunate that Ayodhya, a city of many religions, was in the news for the dispute for years.“However, it is nice that the Supreme Court ended the dispute and this also, to some extent, stopped politics that some parties were indulging in,” she tweeted. All India Muslim Personal Law Board secretary Zafaryab Jilani said the ceremony won’t change the reality and that, for the board, the site would continue to be treated as mosque land. “We are quiet because we had said that we would respect the law of the land and go by the court’s verdict,” Jilani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-s-tryst-with-destiny/story-KZEJAHsUK1CWUAmw4iZZjJ.html

06-08-2020||India||Congress looks to alter perception on Ram Mandir issue||The apparent shift in the Congress’s stand on Ayodhya -- evident in its bid to outdo political rivals in hailing the construction of Ram temple -- is widely attributed to its attempt to change the perception of being a pro-Muslim party -- one reason for the party’s poor performance in the 2014 general elections according to a panel led by former defence minister AK Antony. The panel’s report concluded that fighting elections on the plan of secularism (versus communalism) hurt the Congress because it identified the party as pro-Muslims, resulting in substantial gains for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress, which has since been trying hard to change the image, maintained , in the run-up to the 2019 elections, that it would will abide by the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Ayodhya issue or support any negotiated settlement. The party was accused of practising soft Hindutva during this campaign, with then party President Rahul Gandhi’s temple runs seemingly proving this point. Still, the Congress has never really been vocal in its support for the temple construction. Now, barring a few Congress leaders who have expressed reservations, albeit in private, most have struck a conciliatory tone. In a tweet (in Hindi) on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi called Lord Ram the ultimate embodiment of supreme human values and said that he stands for love, mercy and justice. He did not mention the bhoomi pujan (ground breaking) ceremony that marked the beginning of the temple construction in Ayodhya on Wednesday.Rahul Gandhi’s sister and Congress general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, on Tuesday hoped the groundbreaking ceremony in Ayodhya would be a celebration of national unity, brotherhood and cultural harmony.In November, the Congress welcomed the Supreme Court verdict that paved the way for the temple construction and also sought to take credit for it. It insisted the Congress government at the Centre in 1993 acquired 67-acres of land near the disputed 2.77-acre site in Ayodhya. The Congress also highlighted that it was the Rajiv Gandhi government that allowed a shilanyas (ground-breaking ceremony) for the temple at an undisputed site close to Babri Masjid and also opened its doors in 1986.The Congress’s stand was in line with a view of a section of leaders, especially from North India, that the party should talk openly about the 1986 shilanyas and the acquiring of the land to counter the BJP.The PV Narasimha Rao government acquired the disputed site and the 67 acres around it through the passage of a law in 1993 after the demolition of the Babri Masjid.The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, in November unanimously passed a resolution, welcoming the Supreme Court judgment for the temple construction.The issue came up for discussion at a meeting between Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the party’s Rajya Sabha members on July 30. Deepender Singh Hooda, a Rajya Sabha member, cited the sentiments of millions of Indians at the meeting and argued Congress leaders should speak in one voice and stick to the CWC resolution.Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and Congress workers across the state recited Hanuman Chalisa, or devotional hymn to Lord Ram’s companion Hanuman, on Tuesday. The Congress government in neighbouring Chhattisgarh announced the development of three tourist circuits linked to Ram’s exile.A Congress leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, dismissed the suggestion that the party has moved from soft- to hard-Hindutva, saying Lord Ram “is a unifier, the protector and the voice of the oppressed and the deprived and assimilation of all cultures, castes, class and religions”.“The nation and its people must now decide who depicts these values – the assimilating, cohabitating, all-inclusive ideology of the Congress party or the inherently divisive, hateful and parochial ideology of the BJP-RSS,” he addedPolitical analyst Professor Rajendra Sharma said the Congress lacks consistency in its stand. “The best course for the Congress should have been to stick to the CWC resolution which seemed to be well balanced. But it wants to be a part of majoritarian politics and was feeling left out,” said Sharma who heads the political sciences department at Rohtak-based Maharishi Dayanand University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-looks-to-alter-perception-on-temple-issue/story-Wf6QsKu40HJwgTUmUABmfL.html
06-08-2020||India||RSS aims to cast Ram Temple as symbol of cultural revival||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is making a conscious effort to project the Ram temple as a symbol of cultural and national renaissance, functionaries aware of the matter said, asking not to be named. In line with this attempt, Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS chief, on Wednesday said the temple construction in Ayodhya is the beginning of a new India and will serve to establish the self-confidence needed for making India self-reliant. Bhagwat’s speech at the temple’s groundbreaking ceremony sought to de-link the shrine from religion and focused on Lord Ram’s values and teachings and how imbibing those could help India regain the past glory.“It is a matter of joy that the auspicious beginning of building a Bharat [India] which is prosperous and ensures the welfare of all, starts at the hands of those who are at the helm of affairs in a system that is entrusted with the responsibility to bring this change.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the first brick of the temple at a grand bhoomi pujan (ground breaking ceremony) in Ayodhya on Wednesday.The reference to the temple as a cultural icon and a unifying edifice, and Bhagwat’s assertion that Ram belongs to everyone are a continuation of the RSS’s outreach, the functionaries added. RSS does not want the issue to be seen as communal or polarizing, they said.Ahead of the Supreme Court’s verdict in November that paved the way for the construction of the temple, the RSS launched a massive exercise to reach out to Muslims. Bhagwat met Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Arshad Madani to ensure peace and harmony following the verdict. Other senior leaders travelled across the country to meet a cross-section of people. After the verdict, Bhagwat said it should not be seen as a victory or defeat for anyone.Referring to the temple’s cultural connotations, Manmohan Vaidya, RSS’s joint general secretary, said it will help people connect with their roots. “Till now the realization of the self was not allowed.”Vaidya said the Ram temple, besides a holy shrine, is a symbol of India’s “glorious past, the epitome of cultural values and economic prosperity”. He added it “will help people connect to our cultural roots to prosper economically and expand culturally as a model to guide humanity how to live together in harmony, peace, and prosperity in this ethnic, religious, culturally diverse world”.RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi last week said the groundbreaking ceremony at Ayodhya marks the completion of one part of the struggle but is also “a new beginning of a new era.”BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Rakesh Sinha said Ram transcends the limits of geography and time and RSS’s definition of secularism consists of culture, which is historic and progressive in nature.Still, it is difficult to overlook the religious aspect of the event an expert said. According to Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ajay Gudavarthy: “Construction of a temple does bring a sense of cultural celebration among a large section of the Hindus but one cannot deny a sense of humiliation among the Muslims and this is what makes religion a political ideology.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-aims-to-cast-temple-as-symbol-of-cultural-revival/story-g060wM09ne4Vsi0CbB1c7O.html
06-08-2020||India||Conches, lamps mark festivities across India to celebrate laying of foundation stone of Ram Mandir||People lit earthen lamps in different parts of the country to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, as government functionaries, irrespective of political affiliations, termed the event as a “historic moment” for every Indian.There was an air of accomplishment as workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Rashtryia Swayamseval Sangh, and other affiliates of the latter blew conches when Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed ceremonial rituals at the sanctum sanctorum of the makeshift temple and placed a silver brick as the foundation for the new one. BJP offices in various states were decorated and large screens were installed outside the offices to show the telecast of the ceremony -- carried live by almost every news channel in the country. Party workers raised Jai Shri Ram and Jai Siya Ram slogansand after the ceremony, ladoos were distributed among people in several statesRam temples across India were done up for the occasion too, with even the streets leading to some in the country’s Hindi heartland decorated; special prayers were held in most. Rains in several parts of the country including Ayodhya on Wednesday dampened the celebrations but not the sentiments. In Raj Bhavans (the residence of the governors) in l states such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, earthen lamps were lit and special prayers were held.Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, a former BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh, hosted a recitation of the Sundara Kandam, one of the books of the Ramayan, and Sundarkand with his family members and lit 101 earthen lamps at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur. He said the commitment to build the Ram Temple has been fulfilled. “The temple will be established as a symbol of cultural and national unity and with the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family)’.”Governors of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Anandiben Patel and Baby Rani Maurya congratulated the Prime Minister. “The dream of all Hindu believers has moved towards reality today,” Maurya said.Rajasthan chief minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot expressed hope that the temple would become a symbol of unity in the country.“His (Ram’s) life teaches us the importance of truth, justice, equality of all, compassion and brotherhood. We need to focus on establishing an egalitarian society based on the values espoused by Lord Ram,” Gehlot tweeted. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh also tweeted a congratulatory message and said the temple would bring unit and prosperity in the country.West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who ordered complete lockdown in the state on Wednesday, citin the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic said, “Our country has always upheld the age-old legacy of unity in diversity, and we must preserve this to our last breath!”West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed that several of its workers were arrested when they violated the lockdown restrictions to visit local temples in Bengal. At Kharagpur in West Midnapore district police resorted to lathi charge after minor clashes with BJP workers. “Mamata Banerjee is anti-Hindu,” Ghosh added. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khatter and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan termed the day , historic. “This happy moment is historic for every Indian,” Khatter said; Chouhan added that the “dream of 500 years” has come true.The Ram temple will strengthen peace and humanity in the country, said Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal. “There was a long and hard struggle for 500 years. But the power of Indian democratic values, judiciary and executive, under the leadership of PM Modi, has shown the world how solutions to problems can be found peacefully through democratic and constitutional means,” said UP chief minister Yodi Adityanath.(With state bureau and agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conches-lamps-mark-festivities-across-india/story-4sWZf5fsVIjbX60pL9k6DN.html
06-08-2020||India||BJP, RSS hope for consensus on Uniform Civil Code||The Bharatiya Janata Party has fulfilled two of the three-long-standing items on its manifesto and on the wish list of its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya and the revocation of Article 370 that conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir. Now, there is just one item left -- a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) -- and the leadership if both the BJP and RSS are clear that a “consensus” should emerge before this can happen, people familiar with the matter in both organisations said.In the case of Article 370, the BJP pushed the move through parliament. In the case of the temple, a Supreme Court ruling set the stage for it. But the UCC, people in both the Sangh (RSS) and the BJP say, is different. The demand for a UCC, which had been articulated by the Sangh and later the Jan Sangh, the BJP’s political precursor, was made part of the BJP’s election manifesto starting 1998. In that document, the party sought to entrust the Law Commission with the task of formulating a code that would ensure property rights for women and incorporate the right to adopt children and equal guardianship rights; and remove discriminatory clauses in divorce laws apart from making the registration of all marriages mandatory. One of the directive principles of the Constitution, the UCC has been a core issue of the RSS . The bill to outlaw the Muslim practice of itriple talaq, which allowed a man to divorce his wife by uttering the word talaq thrice, which was passed by Parliament last year, is seen in some quarters as a precursor to the UCC . . In the case of Jammu and Kashmir, Parliament gave its nod, and the government received the support of several opposition parties as well. As for the Ram temple, it was a long-drawn legal battle, which was resolved by the highest court of law. As far as the UCC is concerned, while it is the need of the hour; there is a clear understanding that all sections of society must agree to it and their concerns{should be} addressed,” said a senior functionary of the RSS, requesting anonymity. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, for instance, has expressed concern over the proposed UCC and in a statement last year said India has a multicultural and multi-religious society and each group has the constitutional right to maintain its identity. It referred to the concept of UCC as a threat to the diversity of India. Objection to the UCC does not come from Muslims alone. The RSS functionary said while the government will take measures to introduce a bill on the UCC, it also has to carry along with civil society organisations and address misgivings about the proposed code. “We are aware that even among Hindus there are some sections who have concerns. But just as their concerns were addressed when reforms such as the Hindu Marriage Act, the Succession Act and the adoptions and maintenance laws were changed; there is a need to address their current concerns as well,” the RSS functionary said. BJP MP Kirori Lal Meena’s attempt to introduce a private member’s bill on the UCC in the Rajya Sabha last year was stalled by the opposition on the grounds that it could lead to communal tensions at a time when protests were being staged against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which intends to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to minorities from Muslim-majority Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Pakistan . But the BJP has been unambiguous about wanting to pursue the issue. Union home minister Amit Shah said in an interview to a television channel in January that UCC is a part of the party’s manifesto and how and when it will be implemented will be decided in consultation with everyone. “I believe any country should not have any law based on religion and there should be a single law for all the citizens,” he said. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha said there is a need to address the “delusion” that some people have “encouraged” that UCC is against the rituals and core practices of any religion. “It is a scientific and modern way of achieving the goals of gender justice. The law ministry has made progress on the issue but how it will be implemented will depend on the emerging consensus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-rss-hope-for-consensus-on-ucc/story-ASFagZCCQPEIfQT59HMgkK.html

The SC verdict came on November 9, but it’s also a fact that the Supreme Court had held that Babri mosque was illegally demolished and that it was a shameful act and the same view was repeated on November 9,” Jilani said.He was referring to the November 2019 judgment of the top court on the title suit that cleared the way for the Ram temple. “As far as we are concerned, we also didn’t agree with the Prime Minister and the chief minister participating in the event,” Jilani said.But another litigant – Iqbal Ansari, the only one among three Muslim invitees who attended the event – said he respected the top court’s judgment and that the dispute was over. “Lord Ram belongs to everyone. Ram temple will also bring overall development to Ayodhya,” he added.In Ayodhya, a section of Muslims said they were ready to leave behind decades of communal strife and move forward.Athar Jamal, a 25-year-old student at the city’s Saket PG Degree College, said his generation yearned for development. “Now, with construction of Ram temple, I think big companies will also set up their offices in Ayodhya, generating job opportunities for youth.”Another local resident, Amzad Ali, hoped the temple will usher in opportunities for him to start his own business. “I want to do my own business. In the coming days, Ayodhya will witness a lot of activity,” said Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respect-sc-order-but-mosque-demolished-illegally-aimplb/story-oOnXGfrDjv9WzVGn2nxHSK.html
06-08-2020||India||Ram Temple marks the end of 500-year wait : UP CM Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the ground breaking ceremony, or bhoomi pujan, that marked the beginning of the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya on Wednesday has ended a 500-year-long wait and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for paving the way for it through a democratic and constitutional process.“A 500-year-long wait for this historical day has come to a culmination today because of Prime Minister Modi. The wishes of India’s 135 crore [1.35 billion] people and the Sanatan Dharma followers have been fulfilled,” said Adityanath in his address at the ceremony. He added the power of Indian democracy and the judiciary has shown the world how solutions to problems could be found through democratic and constitutional means.The Supreme Court in November ended the decades-old dispute over the contested Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya by allowing the temple to be built there after years of litigation. The Babri Mosque at the site, which Hindus believe is the birthplace of Lord Ram, was built in 1528 and demolished in 1992.Adityanath said Modi’s foresight and wisdom paved the way for a peaceful resolution of the issue. “In this 500-year-long struggle, many brave men and women laid down their lives. The struggle went on for this goal [of temple building]. Prime Minister Modi showed that the resolution of the problem through peaceful means was possible. We could fulfill the dream of Ram temple because we abided by the constitution.”Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat called the ceremony the beginning of a new India. “Our country believes in Vasudev Kutubhkam that is the world is one family. We believe in taking everyone along. Today is a new beginning of a new India,” he said in his address to the gathering. “There is a wave of joy in the country now...”Bhagwat referred to late former RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras and said the latter told him around 30 years of hard work was required for the temple’s construction. “The Ram temple construction is not like the construction of any other temple.”Bhagwat recalled the sacrifices of people such as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) patriarch L K Advani for the cause. “So many people sacrificed [for the cause but] they could not be here physically [for the ceremony]. There are some who could not come here. Advani ji must be at his home watching this. There are some who should have come but could not because of the situation [Covid-19],” he added.Advani was the face of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and is an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case. On Tuesday, Advani said he feels humbled that during the movement, destiny made him perform a pivotal duty in the form of the Ram Rath Yatra from Somnath (Gujarat) to Ayodhya for the temple construction.Bhagwat also remembered late Vishva Hindu Parishad president Ashok Singhal and late Mahant Ramchandra Paramhans Das for their roles in the movement.Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the head of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust that is overseeing the temple construction, spoke about its early completion. “The wishes of Ram bhakts [devotees] living across the globe have been fulfilled with the Shree Ganesha [beginning] of the construction.”Champat Rai, the Trust’s general secretary, presided over the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temple-marks-the-end-of-500-year-wait-says-yogi/story-oEgWPZpEmTRjkx8svKCifP.html
06-08-2020||India||Bishop Franco Mulakkal to face rape charges as Supreme Court dismisses plea||The Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the way for deposed Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal to stand trial in a rape case involving a Kerala nun. The Court dismissed his plea seeking discharge from the case on a claim that he was being falsely implicated after he initiated disciplinary proceedings against the nun for financial irregularities. Appearing for Mulakkal, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi sought to convince a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde that his client was being made a victim for action taken against the nun. The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was not convinced.“You don’t have a case, We do not see any merit in your petition,” the bench said, dismissing the plea filed by Mulakkal, who now must stand trial. Mulakkal, while serving as Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, was accused of raping a nun belonging to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation in a complaint filed with the Kerala Police in June 2018.Mulakkal was accused of raping the 43-year old nun on 13 occasions during his visits to the Kerala convent between 2014 and 2016. Mulakkal was later removed from the charge of the Jalandhar diocese. He first approached a local court in Kerala praying for his discharge. In his plea, he claimed that he was being falsely implicated by the victim after he initiated disciplinary proceedings against her for alleged financial misdemeanour. His plea was dismissed in March this year following which he approached Kerala high court. His petition before the HC stated, “Due to the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the petitioner (Mulakkal) against the sister, she has maliciously and falsely implicated him with an ulterior motive to wreak vengeance on him and cooked up this story just because of her personal grudge towards him, without any justification.” After examining the evidence against him, on July 7, the high court dismissed his petition, noting, “Rape is the most revolting, cruel and hated crime to a woman… Thus when the records indicate that prima facie materials are available to show that the Sister was subjected to sexual assault including rape from the hands of the superior authority who is the Bishop of the Diocese, it is not possible to infer that this Bishop was falsely implicated by the Mother Superior of the Home functioning under him, on mere enmity as contended by him.”  The Kerala government had filed a caveat in Supreme Court anticipating an order on his plea. The state police filed a charge-sheet in April 2019 naming Mulakkal. Even the Kerala high court had said that the antecedents of the victim do not make out a case to doubt the prosecution story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mulakkal-to-face-rape-charges-as-sc-dismisses-plea/story-I25kW2M5YmZlNwhcXjcUJP.html
06-08-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty asked to appear before ED this Friday||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has asked Rhea Chakraborty, actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s girlfriend, to appear before it on Friday for questioning, officials familiar with the developments said. Chakraborty, a film and TV actress, has been told to present herself at the agency’s Mumbai office at 11am on Friday along with documents pertaining to her investments, said the officials. The summons is linked to a case by ED — which investigates money laundering and foreign exchange violations — on July 31 on the basis of a Bihar Police FIR that followed a complaint by Rajput’s father, KK Singh. He accused Chakraborty and her family of abetting the Bollywood actor’s suicide and siphoning of his money. The ED case was registered under the prevention of money laundering act (PMLA). The development comes on the day the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) got approval to join the investigation into the 34-year-old actor’s suspected suicide. The Mumbai Police, too, are probing the case. Officials said as CBI takes over, the probe by the Bihar Police will be null and void since it was Bihar that recommended the CBI probe. Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has responded to a Bihar Police letter seeking relaxation of the home quarantine period of Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Vinay Tiwari, who has been put in isolation by Mumbai civic authorities after he reached there to supervise a Bihar Police investigation. While Bihar says Tiwari is “forcibly quarantined” for 14 days, BMC says it is just following the Maharashtra government’s guidelines. On Wednesday, BMC advised Tiwari to use digital platforms to interact with Bihar officials, for now. Further, BMC also said the IPS officer will have to follow all rules and regulations in Maharashtra. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, confirmed issuing such a letter to the Bihar Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chakraborty-asked-to-appear-before-ed-this-friday/story-6jxDsXh3Br7mzdZWtUVgEK.html
06-08-2020||India||China calls article 370 move illegal; keep out of our internal affairs, says MEA||The government on Wednesday tersely asked Beijing to keep out of the internal affairs of other countries after China contended that India’s “unilateral” changes to the status of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir were illegal and invalid. As the Pakistan government observed Yaum-e-Istehsal, or a “day of exploitation”, to protest India’s decision last year to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and split it into two union territories, Beijing called on New Delhi and Islamabad to resolve the dispute over Kashmir through dialogue and consultations. India’s decision on August 5, 2019, had triggered a strong response from China, mainly because it believed the move would affect its territorial claims in Ladakh region. Responding to a query from Pakistan’s state-run APP news agency about the impact of India’s move, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a regular news briefing that Beijing is closely following the situation in Kashmir. He said: “Any unilateral change to the status quo is illegal and invalid. This issue should be properly resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultations between the parties concerned.” China’s position on the Kashmir issue, Wang said, is “clear and consistent”. He added: “This issue is a dispute leftover from history between Pakistan and India. That is an objective fact as laid out by the UN Charter, UN Security Council resolutions and the bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India.” External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responded to Wang’s remarks though a brief statement: “We have noted the comments of the Chinese MFA spokesperson on the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The Chinese side has no locus standi whatsoever on this matter and is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations.” Wednesday’s developments also came against the backdrop of the months-long India-China border standoff in Ladakh, which has taken bilateral relations to a new low. India has accused China of failing to deliver on commitments to withdraw its troops from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and asked it to sincerely implement measures for disengagement and de-escalation.Wang described Pakistan and India as neighbours who “cannot be moved away”. He said China hopes the two sides can properly handle differences through dialogue, improve relations and jointly safeguard peace, security and development of both countries and the wider region. “Coexistence serves the fundamental interests of both and the common aspiration of the international community,” Wang added. Pakistan on Tuesday released a new “political map” in which it claimed all of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and parts of Gujarat – a move that India described as “an exercise in political absurdity”. In August last year, China had described the move to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status as “unacceptable”, and urged India to respect Chinese territorial sovereignty and uphold peace and tranquillity in the border areas. China had referred to the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which China controls but India claims as part of the new union territory of Ladakh. India had then rejected China’s criticism, saying the proposal to form new union territories was an “internal matter” that had no implications for the country’s external borders. New Delhi also pointed out that India and China had agreed to maintain peace along their disputed border until a mutually acceptable solution is found. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, during a visit to Beijing last August, explained India’s position, saying the change in administrative status of the region wouldn’t impact the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-calls-art-370-move-illegal-keep-out-of-our-internal-affairs-says-mea/story-M26DdQNqclN1rZju0iIwfP.html
06-08-2020||India||CBI to probe Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case: Centre to Supreme Court||The Union government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it has accepted Bihar’s recommendation for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, which has sparked a debate on mental health issues, how the film industry treats outsiders, and also the circumstances that led to his suspected suicide on June 14.The court was hearing a plea by Rajput’s girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty, who sought the transfer of a first information report (FIR) against her from Patna to Mumbai in the wake of a jurisdictional dispute between police forces in Bihar and Maharashtra. The July 25 FIR — based on a complaint by KK Singh, Rajput’s father — accused Chakraborty of abetting the 34-year-old actor’s suicide.A single-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which observed that the truth behind the death of the “talented artist” should come out, asked Maharashtra and Bihar as well as Singh to file their replies on Chakraborty’s plea within three days. Justice Hrishikesh Roy did not pass any protective order in Chakraborty’s favour.The court also asked Maharashtra to inform the court about the status of investigation by the Mumbai Police. The case will come up for hearing next week.During the hearing through video-conferencing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre, told the court: “The Union of India has in principle accepted the request by Bihar to have a CBI probe.” Later in the day, the department of personnel and training issued a notification to this effect.At the heart of the case is a question of who the case originally belongs to — Maharashtra or Bihar. Chakraborty’s legal team says the Bihar government cannot recommend a CBI probe since police from that state do not have any jurisdiction to even investigate the case.On Wednesday, the Maharashtra government, through senior counsel R Basant, too, contested the Bihar Police’s jurisdiction to first register an FIR, and then to recommend a CBI probe. He argued that the Bihar government’s actions went against the principles of federalism and that the state where the incident took place had the authority to investigate. “The cause of action was in Mumbai and Mumbai Police are investigating [the matter]. This person [Rajput’s father], without even filing a complaint before Mumbai Police, says Mumbai Police are not investigating properly. Mumbai police have done very professional job,” Basant argued. The incident is being used to score political points, he added.The court told Basant that it was “not professional on the part of Mumbai Police to confine an officer who came from Patna on the ground of Covid”. He was referring to civic authorities in Mumbai quarantining a senior police officer who arrived in the city to supervise the Bihar’s Police’s investigation. “Quarantining of Bihar Police officer has not sent good message,” the court said.Senior counsel Shyam Divan, who represented Chakraborty, prayed that no coercive action should be taken against her. “A protective order needs to be passed in favour of the petitioner,” Divan said. The court did not grant his request.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, who represented Bihar, opposed Rhea’s transfer plea and asked the court to adjourn the matter. “Keep the matter next week. Do not pass any orders and no one will be prejudiced,” he said.Senior counsel Vikas Singh, who represented Rajput’s father, expressed concerns that the Mumbai Police were destroying evidence, an allegation that Maharashtra rejected.The court observed that a serious allegation has been levelled against the petitioner. “She has sought transfer of proceedings from Patna to Mumbai. Whether there is criminality involved needs to be investigated. In a high-profile case, everybody has an opinion. But we have to proceed on the basis of law,” the court said.Rajput, who had a short but promising career, was found hanging at his Bandra residence in suburban Mumbai. The mystery surrounding Rajput’s death has moved on from theories on and investigations into how nepotism in Bollywood may have claimed his life to allegations of a criminal conspiracy involving Chakraborty.The Mumbai Police found the cause of death as “asphyxia due to hanging”, filed an accidental death report (ADR) and began an investigation. Chakraborty, an actress herself, has been questioned by the Mumbai police.Meanwhile, the Bihar Police filed an “abetment to suicide” case on the basis of a complaint filed by Rajput’s father. In the complaint, he accused Chakraborty of having befriended his son in May 2019 with the intention of furthering her own career. The matter was then sent by the Bihar Police to the additional chief judicial magistrate, Patna.Chakraborty moved the top court on July 29, challenging the jurisdiction of the Bihar court, saying the incident took place in Mumbai. She submitted that Rajput was suffering from depression and that she was in deep trauma due to his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-to-probe-sushant-s-death-case-centre-to-sc/story-cKqwgy5tleM8NDBH1nmIpK.html
06-08-2020||India||Indian ventilators will be geo-tagged to prevent misuse: Health ministry||The indigenously manufactured ventilators are being embedded with Global Positioning System chips to track if their locations in hospitals change as part of efforts to prevent their misuse, the Union health ministry has said. The ministry has created a dashboard for tracking the real-time status of ventilators dispatched, delivered, and installed for monitoring and feedback.“We can track the location of each of these devices as each ventilator is geo-tagged. We will get to know in real-time if a ventilator is changing location,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan.The government has constituted an empowered group to address issues and encourage the domestic industry to manufacture ventilators and ramp up their production.Also read: Zydus to start second phase of Covid-19 vaccine candidate trials todayBased on expert projections in March, the health ministry decided to procure about 60,000 ventilators for Covid-19 patients. About 18,000 ventilators have been so far supplied to states, central government hospitals, and Defence Research Development Organisation facilities. They have been installed in at least 700 hospitals across the country. Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) rolled out the first locally-made ventilator on May 30.Officials said about 96% of the 60,000 ventilators being procured are indigenous and most of them have been sponsored by the PM CARES Fund established to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.“Of the 60,000 ventilators, 50,000 are being funded by PM CARES Fund which comes to about Rs 2,000 crore in monetary terms,” Bhushan said at a media briefing on Tuesday. “The Make in India [indigenous] ventilators have a share of more than 96% by volume and more than 90% by value.”Just about 0.27% of total active Covid-19 cases are on a ventilator across the country, according to government data. “At any given time, not more than 1% of patients are sick enough to need ventilator support,” said Bhushan.The ministry’s technical expert committee has come up with minimum essential specifications for the basic ventilators manufactured in India. All the procurements are made based on the committee’s recommendations.Public sector BEL has manufactured 30,000 ventilators and Andhra Med-Tech Zone 13,500. The prices of locally-made ventilators range between Rs 1.5 and Rs 4 lakh per unit. Imported ventilators cost between Rs 10 and 20 lakh.A critical care expert at a prominent government hospital said a ventilator is a complex machine with several features meant to perform specific functions. “It is not only about pumping in the air. There is much more to this machine. Having said that, it is better to have something to use in an emergency situation than nothing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-ventilators-will-be-geo-tagged-to-prevent-misuse-health-ministry/story-YelSyGN6mv8W56qCXlyJ4L.html
06-08-2020||India||Constitution bench of Supreme Court to study EWS law||The Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to form a five-judge Constitution bench to scrutinize a Central law introducing 10% reservation in government jobs and college admissions for the poor among the general category of citizens. The law titled Constitution (One Hundred and Third) Amendment Act, 2019 was passed by Parliament in January 2019 and made applicable to even private, unaided educational institutions. It introduced two new clauses - Articles 15(6) and 16(6) -- by which the Government extended a helping hand to the economically weaker sections (EWS) in the general category of citizens.Dealing with a host of petitions challenging the validity of the 2019 law, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde felt it appropriate to refer the matter to a Constitution bench. The bench was of the view that the petitions raised a substantial question of law as to whether reservation could be granted on an economic criterion alone. No interim stay was ordered by the court, meaning that the states will be free to implement the 10% EWS quota. A quota based on economic grounds had never been provided in the past. Beneficiaries of the 10% EWS quota were identified based on criteria set out by the government to identify the so-called creamy layer among reserved categories of citizens. This included households earning less than Rs 8 lakh annually. They were to own not more than 5 acres of agricultural land, or a residential flat with an area of 1,000 square feet and above, or residential plots not more than 100 yards in notified areas and 200 yards in non-notified municipal areas. The bench, also comprising justices R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai, said, “By virtue of the impugned amendments, very Constitution is amended by inserting new clauses in Articles 15 and 16 thereof, which empower the State to make reservations by way of affirmative action to the extent of 10% to economically weaker sections….we are of the view that such questions do constitute substantial questions of law to be considered by a Bench of five judges.” The lead petitioner, the non-government organisation Janhit Abhiyan, demanded that the law be referred to a Constitution bench for an added reason. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the NGO, submitted that the 10% quota will breach the existing ceiling of 50% on reservation fixed by a nine-judge bench of the apex court in the 1992 Indra Sawhney case. Other petitioners argued that extending reservation benefits to private, unaided institutions violated Article 19(1)(g) which gives citizens the right to carry out any trade or profession. Attorney general KK Venugopal submitted for the Centre that the 50% rule can be breached in extraordinary situations. Presently, there exists a 49.5% reservation in admissions and public appointments, apportioned between Scheduled Castes (15%), Scheduled Tribes (7.5%) and Other Backward Classess (27%). The bench said, “It is the case of Union of India that though ordinarily 50% is the rule but same will not prevent to amend the Constitution itself in view of the existing special circumstances to uplift the members of the society belonging to economically weaker sections. Even such questions also constitute as substantial questions of law to be examined by a Bench of five Judges as per Article 145(3) of the Constitution read with Order XXXVIII Rule 1(1) of the Supreme Court of Rules, 2013.” Following the three-judge bench order, the batch of more than 20 petitions will be placed before the CJI on the administrative side to form a five-judge bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-bench-to-study-ews-law/story-I4ob6ut9S9St6JPXclJ9DI.html
06-08-2020||India||Supreme Court reserves verdict in Prashant Bhushan case||The Supreme Court, on Wednesday, reserved its verdict on the contempt case initiated against lawyer Prashant Bhushan for posting two tweets in June, one of which accused the judiciary of destroying democracy and the other criticised Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde for keeping the courts shut during the Covid-19 lockdown.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra heard Bhushan’s counsel, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, before reserving its order. Attorney general KK Venugopal was also present at the hearing although he did not make any arguments.“Heard the senior counsel appearing in the matter. Arguments concluded. Judgment reserved,” the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, said.The court also dismissed a petition filed by Bhushan against the secretary general of the Supreme Court alleging that court procedures were not followed while listing the contempt case against him. This petition was heard on Wednesday along with the contempt case.The apex court , on Tuesday, heard and reserved its verdict in another contempt case against Bhushan over a statement made in 2009 that many past CJIs had been corrupt. That case was listed by the top court after more than eight years.The top court had issued notice suo motu (on its own) to Bhushan on July 22 over the two tweets and directed him to respond by Wednesday. The first tweet of June 27, which was reproduced in the court order of July 22, said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.”The second tweet of June 29 referred to CJI Bobde. It was also cited in the order and said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Bhushan filed an affidavit on August 2, stating that his tweets fell within the domain of free speech and expression of opinion, however outspoken, disagreeable or unpalatable to some, cannot constitute contempt of court.Dave argued on Wednesday that Bhushan was exercising his freedom of speech and giving his opinion about the functioning of the court and that would not amount to obstruction of justice necessitating contempt of court proceedings.“Neither of the tweets can be said to cause interference or obstruction to administration of justice,” Dave said.Dave also referred to Bhushan’s contributions towards public interest litigation and his role in exposing various corruption scandals before the court.“Hundreds of cases have been brought to court’s notice by Mr. Bhushan. This court has appreciated his work on so many occasions — 2G licenses, coal block allocation, mining in forests etc. If he (Bhushan) makes a mistake, will you initiate contempt proceedings against him? His remarks are only for betterment of court,” Dave submitted.With specific reference to the June 27 tweet, Dave argued that it was not contemptuous but was only Bhushan’s opinion about the court which is widely held by many people.“It is his opinion. In that regard I would say that the four CJIs were conservative in their approach towards executive actions,” Dave said.“But it was not a criticism of any judgment of court , which is permissible. It is about the Supreme Court and four CJIs. It said that we have lost our independence,” justice Arun Mishra said.“The tweet is about the judicial approach adopted by the Supreme Court and the four CJIs,” Dave responded.Regarding the tweet of June 29 about CJI, Dave said that scores of people had tweeted the photograph of the CJI on the bike. “Somebody said ‘Justice is riding on a bike’. Are Your Lordships going to call them all?” Dave asked.Dave also made some critical submissions on the functioning of the court.“If judges (of Supreme Court) can criticize the institution, then why not Mr Bhushan?,” he said in a veiled reference to the press conference held by four judges of the Supreme court in January 2018 against the functioning of justice Dipak Misra, who was then the CJI.“Are you referring to the press conference?” justice Arun Mishra queried.“Holding of press conference was justified. Can you hold the judges (who held the press conference) in contempt?” Dave responded.Dave also referred to the sexual harassment case against former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, pointing out that the victim, a Supreme Court employee who was terminated from service after she complained against Gogoi in 2019, was subsequently reinstated by the Supreme Court with full back wages.“Does that not mean she was speaking the truth? The judge sat on a Saturday to hear the case on sexual harassment against himself. Judgments like Rafale and Ayodhya are delivered and the CJI later gets a Rajya Sabha seat and plush bungalow. What impression does it give?” Dave askedThe top court in December 2018 dismissed petitions seeking a court-monitored probe into the Rs 59,000 crore contract for Rafale fighter planes made by Dassault Aviation of France. In November last year, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at a disputed site at Ayodhya. Dave also demanded to know why certain judges of the Supreme Court are never assigned politically sensitive cases.“Justice Rohinton Nariman, for example, never gets assigned such matters,” Dave saidJutice Mishra pointed out that justice Nariman has been part of many Constitution bench cases.“I meant politically sensitive cases. Not Constitution bench,” Dave said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reserves-verdict-in-prashant-bhushan-case/story-8IJ6qtScQyKSEeV2zZHefL.html
06-08-2020||India||Extra funds for states that carry out agricultural reforms||The 15th Finance Commission, the constitutional body that devolves five-yearly financial resources and taxes to states, will for the first time give out extra funds to states if they carry out agricultural reforms to boost exports.By setting farm-sector reforms as a parameter for the award of performance-based incentives, the 15th Finance Commission seeks to spur investments to boost India’s exports of primary farm produce, finance commission and Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand told HT.The agriculture sector, which supports half of all Indians, has not been generating enough revenues to keep farming profitable for nearly two decades due to lack of reforms and low export volumes, according to a 2018 Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) study.India is the second-largest producer of cereals, sugar, fruits, and vegetables. It is also the world’s largest producer of milk, according to official data. However, the country ranks 11th globally in terms of farm exports.The 15 Finance Commission incentives will be linked to two recent ordinances passed by the Narendra Modi government to liberalise agricultural markets and boost private investments.Discussions are being held to finalise “performance-based incentives” and their guidelines in six areas based on the 15th Finance Commission’s terms of reference.These are the implementation of agricultural reforms, development of aspirational districts and blocks, power sector reforms, boosting trade including exports, incentives for education, and promotion of domestic and international tourism. The grant amounts will be provided in the final report.A separate expert panel will come out with export-oriented reform for states. In February, the 15 Finance Commission had set up an eight-member experts’ group headed by ITC chairman Sanjiv Puri to recommend measures to boost farm exports.States will be eligible for financial incentives if they implement all features of The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, an official familiar with the matter said.The Constitution, through Article 280 to 281, provides for a unique mechanism in Finance Commissions for the division of taxes and revenues vertically — between the Centre and states, and horizontally— among all states, based on their levels of development, prosperity and regional needs. Finance commissions are set up by an order of the President of India.The final report of the 15th Finance Commission is also likely to give incentives to states that implement a reformed land leasing law.The Union Cabinet on June 4 had passed far-reaching steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector, approving amendments to the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act and pushing two ordinances, one aimed at freeing up farm trade from all restrictions and the other guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices to farmers.“These are major reforms that will ultimately liberalise the farm sector and free it from dated rules. We need to corporatize agriculture and these moves are aimed at getting more investments and reducing dependencies on the government,” said NR Bhanumurthy, the vice-chancellor of Bengaluru’s Dr BR Ambedkar School of Economics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extra-funds-for-states-that-carry-out-agri-reforms/story-caim6XU148JCaIWnCgySGL.html

The company will now commence Phase II clinical trials from the 6th of August, 2020…the doses of the vaccine administered to healthy volunteers in the Phase I clinical trial, which began on 15th July 2020, has been well tolerated,” Zydus Cadila said in a statement.The vaccine was found to be safe, immunogenic and well tolerated in the pre-clinical toxicity studies conducted on animals. The vaccine was able to elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies in animal studies.The company received the central drugs controller’s approval for human trials on July 2“The Phase I dosing to establish the safety of ZyCoV-D is an important milestone,” said Pankaj R Patel, chairman, Zydus Cadila.“All the subjects in Phase I clinical trial were closely monitored in a clinical pharmacological unit for 24 hours post dosing for safety and for 7 days thereafter and vaccine was found to be very safe. We now begin the Phase II clinical trials and look forward to evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in a larger population,” he added.The company has not made the trial results public yet.The Phase II study of ZyCoV-D will be conducted in over 1,000 healthy adult volunteers. “The 7 day safety of the vaccine in all the subjects enrolled in the Phase I clinical trial has been endorsed by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which has been constituted to oversee the safety aspects of the clinical trial,” the company said. According to the company, the vaccine candidate is safer because of its DNA vaccine platform, which requires injecting genetically engineered plasmid (small DNA molecule) containing the DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought.“…the platform provides ease of manufacturing the vaccine with minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1). The platform is also known to show much improved vaccine stability and lower cold chain requirements, making it easy for transportation to remotest regions of the country. Furthermore, the platform can be rapidly used to modify the vaccine in couple of weeks in case the virus mutates to ensure that the vaccine still elicits protection,” the company said. The plasmid DNA, when introduced into the host cells. would be translated into the viral protein and will elicit a strong immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from disease as well as viral clearance.The vaccine candidate was developed indigenously at the company’s Vaccine Technology Centre in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.Experts in the government have maintained that India will take the lead in manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine when it is developed. “There we will take the lead as we have the requisite manufacturing capacity,” says Dr VK Paul, member, Niti Ayog, and also chairman of one of the national task forces on Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-to-start-second-phase-of-vaccine-candidate-trials-today/story-AkiC1iDUI9azdTSVbDFOQM.html
06-08-2020||India||J&K marks a year without Article 370 amid Covid-19, other curbs||Most residents of Srinagar and rural districts in the Kashmir valley stayed indoors on Wednesday, the first anniversary of the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, as security forces kept a high profile,clamped restrictions on public movement, blocking many roads with concertina wire, and thwarted a meeting of mainstream political parties.Although no curfew had been enforced at any place in the valley, only people with special passes were permitted to move on the roads. The streets of Srinagar were deserted and the police and Central Reserve Police Force reinforced their presence to implement restrictions, ostensibly because of the Covid-19 outbreak . Also read| From habeas corpus to 4G services in Jammu and Kashmir: Pleas in Supreme CourtLal Chowk, the business nerve centre of Srinagar, was also closed, with barbed wire and barricades erected to prevent entry into the neighbourhood.Police vehicles fitted with public address systems went around Srinagar soon after daybreak, announcing the imposition of restrictions for combating the spread of Covid-19. “There is a ban on assembly of more than three persons and people are requested not to violate the law and stay indoors,” the police said. On August 5 a year ago, the Centre pushed through key constitutional changes to revoke Article 370 that had conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir and Article 35A that allowed its legislature to define permanent residents for whom government jobs and property ownership were reserved. The state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh.The main road leading towards the house of Srinagar MP and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Gupkar road was blocked by the police and no one was allowed on the road. Abdullah had called a meeting of mainstream leaders at his house.Former J&K chief minister and his son, Omar Abdullah, wrote on Twitter: ‘’One year on, this is Gupkar road today- police vehicles opposite our gates, concertina wire strung across the road at regular intervals & no vehicles allowed. My father had called a meeting of leaders of mainstream parties to deliberate on the current situation;’’‘’Clearly the meeting is not being allowed to go ahead. The BJP {Bharatiya Janata Party} gets to announce a 15-day celebration to mark 5th August & a handful of us aren’t allowed to meet in my father’s lawn. So much for BJP national leaders wondering why there is no political activity,’’ he added. Peoples Democratic Party leader and Rajya Sabha member Fayaz Mir told reporters that he was not allowed by the security forces to move towards the house of Farooq Abdullah. Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, who lives close to the house of Farooq Abdullah in government accommodation, said the gates to the Abdullah/or his own residence had been locked. ‘’Lockdowns as celebrations and lies as defences have been the hall mark of the last year. Today, political leaders were supposed to meet at Dr Farooq Abdullah’s residence to discuss the political challenges region is facing. But unfortunately, we were not allowed,” Tarigami said.The Congress party said an “undeclared curfew” had been clamped in the whole of Kashmir and alleged that several Congress leaders in the had been arrested or detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-on-normalcy-yet-to-return/story-8Qvd5Spnf5WtvAC0kjUyzH.html
06-08-2020||India||Kashmir Lt Governor GC Murmu quits amid buzz that he could be next CAG||Girish Chandra Murmu, the former bureaucrat appointed as Jammu and Kashmir’s first Lt Governor, has resigned, public broadcaster All India Radio said on Wednesday evening. Murmu was appointed Lt Governor on 31 October, Jammu and Kashmir’s first when the union territory carved out of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was notified.There has been no official word on Murmu’s exit from Kashmir’s Raj Bhawan. But there is speculation that he could be in line to be the next Comptroller and Auditor General when Rajiv Mehrishi completes his term this week on 7 August.Rajiv Mehrshi was appointed India’s top public auditor in 2017 after his retirement from the civil services. Before this, Mehrishi - a former IAS officer of the 1978 batch - has been India’s finance secretary and home secretary. Mehrishi can hold the CAG’s office till he turns 65, on 8 August.There is buzz that Mehrishi could be appointed as Jammu and Kashmir’s Lt Governor.There have been no formal orders about the changes but as the first news about the changes in Jammu and Kashmir emerged, National Conference leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah took to Twitter. “What’s with all this chatter surrounding the LG of J&K? Came out of nowhere a few hours ago and suddenly it’s all over social media and WhatsApp in J&K,” Abdullah wrote on Twitter.This is not the first time that GC Murmu, a 1985 batch IAS officer from Gujarat cadre, is resigning ahead of his tenure. Lt Governors of union territories, quite like governors of states, are appointed on a five-year term.Murmu was the expenditure secretary in the Union finance ministry when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah decided to elevate him to the new union territory’s Raj Bhawan. Murmu had then resigned from the IAS a month before his retirement in November-end 2019.Murmu, who is said to have the trust of PM Modi and Shah, had worked with them in Gujarat when he was posted in the home department. After PM Modi came to Delhi in 2014, Murmu moved to the Gujarat chief minister’s office as principal secretary to Anandiben Patel who had succeeded Modi in the state. He joined the central government less than a year later as a joint secretary in the finance ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-kashmir-l-g-gc-murmu-resigns-reports/story-IS9FpegmeYasSkmGh0CNFL.html
06-08-2020||India||Keep off: India’s terse counter to China after its Kashmir barb||New Delhi on Wednesday tersely asked Beijing to keep out of the internal affairs of other countries after China contended that India’s “unilateral” changes to the status of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir were illegal and invalid. As the Pakistan government observed Yaum-e-Istehsal or a “day of exploitation” to protest India’s decision last year to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and split it into two union territories, Beijing had also called on New Delhi and Islamabad to resolve the dispute over Kashmir through dialogue and consultations. India’s decision on August 5 last year had triggered a strong response from China, mainly because it believed the move would affect its territorial claims in Ladakh region. Also read | ‘India’s move in J&K illegal’: China on one year of Article 370 abrogationResponding to a query from Pakistan’s state-run APP news agency about the impact of India’s move a year later, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a regular news briefing that Beijing is closely following the situation in Kashmir. He said: “Any unilateral change to the status quo is illegal and invalid. This issue should be properly resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultations between the parties concerned.” China’s position on the Kashmir issue, Wang said, is “clear and consistent”. He added: “This issue is a dispute leftover from history between Pakistan and India. That is an objective fact as laid out by the UN Charter, UN Security Council resolutions and the bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India.” External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava responded to Wang’s remarks through a brief statement: “We have noted the comments of the Chinese MFA spokesperson on the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The Chinese side has no locus standi whatsoever on this matter and is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations.” Also read | PLA drags its feet over disengagement. Stalemate at Ladakh continuesWednesday’s developments also came against the backdrop of the months-long India-China border standoff in Ladakh, which has taken bilateral relations to a new low. India has accused China of failing to deliver on commitments to withdraw its troops from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and asked it to sincerely implement measures for disengagement and de-escalation.Wang described Pakistan and India as neighbours who “cannot be moved away”. He said China hopes the two sides can properly handle differences through dialogue, improve relations and jointly safeguard peace, security and development of both countries and the wider region. “Coexistence serves the fundamental interests of both and the common aspiration of the international community,” Wang added. Pakistan on Tuesday released a new “political map” in which it claimed all of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and parts of Gujarat – a move that India described as “an exercise in political absurdity”. In August last year, China had described the move to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status as “unacceptable”, and urged India to respect Chinese territorial sovereignty and uphold peace and tranquillity in the border areas. China had referred to the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which China controls but India claims as part of the new union territory of Ladakh. India had then rejected China’s criticism, saying the proposal to form new union territories was an “internal matter” that had no implications for the country’s external borders.New Delhi also pointed out that India and China had agreed to maintain peace along their disputed border until a mutually acceptable solution is found. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, during a visit to Beijing last August, explained India’s position, saying the change in administrative status of the region wouldn’t impact the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-off-india-s-terse-message-to-china-after-beijing-s-kashmir-barb/story-AEuki8GBaKPqhmC8XkAGHL.html
06-08-2020||India||Security situation in Kashmir better: Officials||A year after Jammu & Kashmir was divested of its special status and split into two union territories, the security situation in the region has not only stabilized but also progressively improved with more support from the people, multiple army, police, and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officers said.According to government data, the number of violent incidents in Kashmir was down to 120 from January to July, compared to 198 during the same time last year. The stone-throwing incidents--102--have also significantly reduced this year. As many as 532 such incidents were reported in 2018 and 389 in 2019.Officials said terrorists are unable to carry out grenade attacks due to a robust presence and better coordination between security forces. Only 21 grenade attacks have been reported so far this year as compared to 52 during the same period in 2019.There may have been a significant decline in terror-related incidents as well as local terrorist recruitments but Pakistan has ramped up its activities considerably since the nullification of Constitution’s Article 370 that stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its special status on August 5 last year, one of the army officers cited above said.A heightened infiltration activity and the Pakistani army’s cease-fire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) and targeting of civilians by terror groups remain areas of concern for security forces.Officials cited intelligence inputs and added they suggest all terror launch pads across the LoC, or the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Jammu & Kashmir, are active with close to 250 terrorists waiting to sneak into Kashmir.The tempo of anti-terror operations in the hinterland has denied terrorists space to operate even as soldiers deployed along the LoC are in a high state of alert to thwart Pakistan’s attempts to push in infiltrators, a second army officer said. The officer added counter-terror operations based on accurate intelligence have yielded results during the last one year and the security forces have killed 136 terrorists, including 14 Pakistanis, till July-end.A third officer said the local terror recruitment remains confined to four districts of South Kashmir. Only 67 young men are believed to have joined terrorist ranks since January compared to 105 during the same time last year. The number of terrorists active in the Valley is estimated to be below 200.There has also been a drastic reduction in improvised explosive device (IED) blasts and only four such low-intensity attacks have been reported since August 5 last year. In 2019, eight IED blasts were reported in the first seven months of the year. They included the Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in February 2019 and brought India and Pakistan on the verge of war.Officials said the influence of separatists or terror groups in calling for bandhs has also diminished with only four strike calls this year compared to 30 in 2019. “Fewer protests have taken place this year compared to the previous two years, with the security forces being able to counter disinformation campaigns run by inimical elements by engaging with the local population,” said a fourth officer.Officials said Pakistan-backed terrorists were trying to mount attacks on civilians to intimidate them into following their so-called Azadi narrative and to create unrest. But coordinated operations have significantly degraded their ability to carry out attacks, they added.CRPF special director general (Jammu & Kashmir Zone) Zulfiqar Hasan said: “The security forces have been on the top in the Valley. Most of the militant leadership has been eliminated, which is a huge setback for them. Significantly, there have been very few civilian killings and recruitments of locals have come down.” He added there is better coordination between security forces and the public now. “The terrorists are not getting any support from locals.”Hasan said the law and order incidents connected with the counter-terror operations have come down as now people do not come out in numbers to disturb the security forces. “We have not had any big such incident of locals hindering our operations.”The fourth officer cited above said the situation has improved but warned Pakistan is likely to step up efforts to create instability in the region. “The Army’s focus is on strengthening its anti-infiltration measures to prevent Pakistan-based terrorists from sneaking into Kashmir. Our soldiers are ready to deal with any Pakistani misadventure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-situation-in-kashmir-better-officials/story-Y4Y1aMEnsCUZMmt80rIJNN.html

An FIR was filed at the Porvorim Police Station by the brigadier’s brother after the servant noticed that the house was broken into. According to the FIR, the home was broken into on the intervening night of June 20-21 and goods -- mainly jewellery -- worth Rs 9-lakh have been stolen. Police have made little headway in the case. “We had an electronic safe embedded in a wall in one of our wardrobes that they levered out with a crowbar and carried it away. It had my wife’s valuable jewellery in it. The cops brought sniffer dogs and lifted prints etc, but so far no leads. We are not hopeful of recovering anything, and have reconciled to our loss,” Brig NH Braganza (retd) said.He said among the jewellery that was stolen was one traditional ancestral necklace belonging to his wife’s family.“One item of jewellery in the electronic safe was a traditional ancestral necklace worn by matriarchs in my wife’s state, Meghalaya, handed down over generations, that she inherited in 2013.That necklace has immense sentimental value for the family,” the brigadier said. The family has launched an online appeal for any news of the stolen heirloom, hoping that if the thieves attempt to pawn it off, it will trigger red flags among those seeking to buy it.The Brigadier, who fought in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, retired from the Indian Army in 2003 and has been living at Defence Colony in Goa since then. He along with his wife and family had travelled to Canberra, Australia in what was expected to be a brief holiday with them scheduled to return home by the last week of March. But the lockdown imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic laid waste to their plans.M Braganza, who hails from Meghalaya, is hoping that if nothing else, the necklace can be found. “To me, the necklace is priceless. It is a family heirloom. It belonged to my grandmother, who would have got it from her mother. I inherited it from my mother who died at the age of 95. According to family tradition, it should go to my youngest daughter and then to her daughter (who is now 11),” she said.“Such a necklace will very conservatively cost about Rs 3 lakh. The value is not just of the gold but the size and quality of its coral beads. You rarely get beads of this quality and size anymore. In fact, it is near impossible to find a necklace such as this in the market,” she said. The necklace is called a “U Kpieng paila” in Khasi. It forms part of Khasi traditional attire. In most old photographs of Khasi families in Meghalaya, the matriarchs can be seen wearing this necklace. At traditional Khasi festivals and dances such as the Nongkrem festival (usually held in November) or the Shad Suk Mynsiem festival in Shillong (held in April), both male and female dancers can be seen wearing several strands of this necklace. It is said to symbolize the wealth of the family or clan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goan-family-away-from-home-during-lockdown-finds-centuries-old-heirloom-stolen-upon-return/story-yxgUWNy6UT670QjVMFvBTM.html

Though this is the factual position, I noticed a strange scenario yesterday. Several industries have started slashing salaries of workers or are sacking them,” he said.The chief minister said that migrant workers, who had returned to their home states due to the nationwide lockdown, had started coming back to Maharashtra gradually after the state government allowed resumption of business activities.“The sons of the soil or the migrant workers, who had not returned to their states and were reporting at workplaces, are being sacked. This is not right,” Thackeray said.He said the issue needs to be discussed with industrialists as the state government is putting in a lot of effort to solve the difficulties that industrial units are facing.The chief minister on Monday also launched the state government’s MahaJobs portal—an online platform that aims to make job opportunities available to the “sons of the soil” or domiciled people.The MahaJobs portal is the need of the hour, Thackeray said, adding that the system works in a transparent manner.The chief minister also directed the authorities to take regular stock of how useful the portal turns out in terms of how many of the applicants actually get jobs using the online platform. The portal will be run by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation.State Industries Minister Subhash Desai, Labour Minister Dilip Walse Patil, Skill Development Minister Nawab Malik and Minister of State for Industries Aditi Tatkare also attended the launch of the portal held via video conferencing.According to the Industries Minister, there are 17 sectors for which job seekers can apply through the portal, including engineering, logistics, textiles and pharmaceuticals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-correct-to-sack-workers-when-industrial-activities-have-begun-thackeray/story-ok3UH3mda3OKzW1jq7nOUM.html
