10-08-2020||News||On foreign policy, revive tradition of bipartisanship||In 1994, Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto cut off all meaningful interaction with India. The freeze continued till Nawaz Sharif won the February 1997 election and immediately signalled a desire to resume diplomatic and political contact. Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and external affairs minister IK Gujral decided to reciprocate positively, but, before doing so, Gujral held quiet and separate conversations with leaders of the ruling alliance but, significantly, also with the main Opposition parties.Gujral went personally to some of them, taking his officials along so that if matters of detail arose during these discussions, they were on hand to answer them. I recall that I accompanied Gujral to a meeting with the then Congress president Sitaram Kesri who, like all political leaders, endorsed the view that India-Pakistan dialogue should resume.The purpose of my recounting the political spadework undertaken by Gujral is only to emphasise that despite the political contestation, there has been a tradition of trying to forge a consensus or, at a minimum, bridge differences on crucial foreign policy and security issues. This was accomplished through out-of-the-public-eye contacts and briefings, either directly between political leaders or through contacts of officials and professionals whom the Opposition leaders trusted. It would seem that this tradition continued, at least, for some part of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government on matters relating to Pakistan and the India-United States (US) nuclear deal. In keeping with the same spirit, Opposition political leaders sometimes reined in their colleagues from probing too deeply on sensitive information on national security and foreign policy matters. Again, an incident related to Gujral comes to mind. He was then no longer PM, but a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs. The then foreign secretary was before the committee on the Afghanistan situation. Committee members began to raise questions about the nature and extent of our assistance to the anti-Taliban forces. This was sensitive information and it would have been detrimental to India’s interests if it became public. Gujral intervened. He said that he knew what India was doing and it should not be openly discussed. The subject was immediately dropped.It was good that PM Narendra Modi convened an all-party meeting after China’s dastardly action of June 15 in the Galwan Valley. Obviously, he did so, among other reasons, to show the nation’s resolve to resolutely respond to the Chinese strategic challenge, especially its designs on Indian territory. Notwithstanding the controversy that emerged from some of Modi’s remarks, the essential message that emerged from the meeting was one of the nation’s firmness to confront China’s actions. Such signals are important but cannot be a substitute for the development of a consensus on broad and enduring strategy. That can only come through quiet and confidential dialogue within all sections of the country’s political and strategic classes. Naturally, this does not mean that the government of the day does not have the right and the responsibility to design and execute foreign and security policies. To think otherwise would be to question its popular mandate and its constitutional functions. But there are some issues of such surpassing significance to the national interest that every endeavour has to be made by the political class to forge understandings through quiet and purposeful conversations, which would lead to a toning down of the sharp, often vitriolic rhetoric — the staple fare of spokespersons of all political parties in the electronic media. The process naturally would have to be government-led but the main Opposition parties would bear an equal responsibility in making it a success. After the trauma of Partition, there has not been as difficult a time for the country as now. The Covid-19 health crisis, by itself, is daunting for India’s society and polity. The migrant labour movement brought about great distress and its impact continues in some spheres. The economy, which was already in a slowdown, is now contracting. It will take time to be restored to the path of sustained growth. It is at this stage that India has been confronted by Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control, necessitating a complete re-look at India’s China policy since 1988.The question that the political class has to ask itself whether the nation can afford normal ebb and flow of politics at this stage or if it is a time to reach out to each other. Is this a time for the political parties, whether in the ruling alliance or the Opposition camp, to score points on national security and foreign policy concerns, even if, unlike the past three and a half decades, there is one single party under a leader with a decisive electoral mandate? The answer cannot but be to seek a build a unified national policy approach to begin with on China. And, give politics and the ideological divides a rest.Vivek Katju is a former diplomatThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-foreign-policy-revive-tradition-of-bipartisanship/story-Z6gv3RtmCE0FgCVPqVnUSI.html
10-08-2020||News||Politicians will pose the biggest challenge to NEP||The New Education Policy (NEP) presented by the government recently is being described as a progressive and forward-looking document. There is little to quibble with the broad recommendations in the document. The deeper question to pose is whose interests the reform is going to hurt, and whether this class has enough power to circumvent the reform measures.Outside the educational hubs of Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, it is not professional educationists, but politicians and their supporters who own and run a large segment of private schools and colleges. Thus, NEP is likely to hurt political class the most. What will happen to various recommendations of NEP when it meets political obstacles in these carefully-built fiefdoms? Will NEP become like many other documents that had the potential to revolutionise things in theory, but failed to accomplish its intended outcomes in practice?The rapid expansion in the number of colleges and universities in India in the past two decades, as scholars Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Devesh Kapur note, was not because of some huge middle-class pressure or demand, but was driven by the entrepreneurial zeal of politicians. On an average, six new colleges were opened every day including weekends between 2000 and 2015. To put this in a comparative perspective, with way greater resources, the United States (US) was opening only one new college a week at this time. And this has happened when India has one of the most regulated higher education systems. This means that many of these colleges were opened only after the exchange of kickbacks and bribes.For example, politicians in Uttar Pradesh (UP) have invested heavily in the education sector over the past few years. More than 30% of elected politicians in the state either own a school or a college or both. I collected this data during the fieldwork for my PhD dissertation that examines the power base of political families. The analysis suggests that a politician with 20 years in active political life is three times more likely to own a college. Many of them mention owning colleges in their official biodatas. For example, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha member proudly claims on his official website that he runs more than 45 colleges in his district. But this is not unique to either the BJP or UP. What is happening in UP and other north Indian states now has already happened in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, where politicians in the late 1990s and early 2000s invested heavily in setting up engineering and medical colleges.Why have politicians invested so much in the education sector? First, some politicians genuinely feel the obligation to help their constituency, especially when the State has failed to deliver. Second, opening schools and colleges increases their social and political prestige. Many of the college buildings I observed during my fieldwork are on illegally occupied prime land that either belongs to the government, the gram sabha or is the disputed property of private individuals. Opening a school or college mitigates some of the bad reputation that comes with illegal occupation of the land. Third, schools and colleges function as sources of patronage for politicians. This patronage can vary from the allocation of admissions to teaching jobs to janitorial positions.Fourth, educational institutions in smaller towns continuously supply politicians two important instruments to maintain power — money and muscle. Colleges typically function under trusts and are, therefore, not required to follow the same transparency rules as companies. Politicians often give large amounts of money and provide resources to the trusts of their loyalists. Anyone who has read Shrilal Shukla’s classic Raag Darbari will attest to this. As researcher and scholar Philip Altbach notes that politicians use educational institutions as a base for their operations. In smaller towns and poorer parts of the country, a college is likely to be the most important institution in the area. All those who receive such favours then oblige politicians by helping their campaigns by mobilising resources and manpower.Fifth, and more importantly, these private school and college premises not only serve as examination centres for students studying there, but also as centres for various competitive examinations conducted by the state. And this is where the deep nexus of politics-crime-bureaucracy operates. Many of us are familiar with the “nakal mafia” (a nexus that thrives on providing cheating materials for a fee). Two years ago, a mass cheating incident was recorded on the cellphones in Bihar in which parents and friends of students were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answer sheets. The images captured a cruder form of the organised business of cheating in examinations, where the whole centre is designed to facilitate this illegal operation. This well-oiled business operates not only with the collusion of the local police, as was attested to by the video from Bihar, but also with the collusion of political officials, whose patronage is essential in everything from allocating the examination centre to protecting the mafia by holding off the police.And that is why one is sceptical of this much-touted policy document, not because one doubts the intent of those who have laboured hard to design it, but because New Delhi continues to be in denial of ground realities in the education sector in large parts of the country.

10-08-2020||News||A blueprint to counter CCP and Xi||This is ideology, group and politics neutral — its non-neutral only on the India-China equation. What follows is a comprehensive wish list, intended to recalibrate, re-imagine and reinvent that equation. If two swords — India and China — are to coexist in the Asian scabbard, reluctant respect and forced likability are required and these are the consequences of fear. While China has engendered that fear in India, it is time to reciprocally implant India’s fear in China. This alone will reset the equilibrium.For this we need less talk, more action; consistency of application over years; taking care of the small things so that the big things take care of themselves; and a holistic, multipronged and preventive, not merely curative, approach. It requires a fundamental attitudinal change. Finally, it requires teamwork, a broad consensus, bridging the trust deficit, transparency and participatory approaches.The military option is of least importance, in view of China’s size and might, but still vital to outstare the enemy. The appearance (not actual use) of India’s military might is vital to eventually restore status quo ante, since the so-called buffer zones are on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The Mountain Strike Corps, inexplicably downgraded, must be exponentially enhanced. The defence budget, below 1.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), must be pulled above 2%, preferably 3%, despite Covid-19 and economic woes. Open interoperability military exercises with the United States (US) and other big powers must accompany the accelerated completion of the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road and building others on our northern and Arunachal Pradesh flanks. China has effectively deployed a mammoth drone armoury and we must significantly enlarge that arsenal.The diplomatic option is highly underestimated. A blitzkrieg of naming and shaming China for its ruthless expansionism must accompany regular meetings and exercises of groupings such as an expanded Asean, Quad, Malabar, G10 and Democracy 10. The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance of the European Parliament, with more than 100 members, is against expansionist China and India should seek consultative status on it.Consistent China-critics such as Japan, the United States, the Philippines, Vietnam, Mongolia, Indonesia and Australia have to be continuously leveraged. The current unprecedented global anti-China sentiment has to be exploited. The Philippines won significant maritime arbitral awards against China, and Vietnam fought China over the Spratly islands. India’s place at the high table of G10 cannot be delayed. These multilateral groupings have another unnoticed benefit: They turn India’s focus seawards, where Chinese military asymmetry qua India is much less than on land.The two Ts — Tibet and Taiwan — old Chinese bugbears, need to be exploited much more. The Dalai Lama and persons like Richard Gere qua Tibet and Dolkun Isa qua Xingjiang must be allowed to travel and speak on Indian soil without restriction (subject to no violence and no official Indian government participation). India and Taiwan must have full diplomatic relations and Taiwanese companies must be wooed qua import substitution. Parliamentary alliances such as Friends of Tibet or of Uighurs must be allowed free play. We need to oppose the Belt Road Initiative and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) much more vocally at all forums. Buddhist diplomacy has great resonance across Asia. Both Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh occupy pole positions in this regard, but they remain underused by India internationally.If Pakistan deters the Indian elephant by displaying the Chinese dragon in India’s backyard, India must flaunt the super dinosaur Russia overlooking the dragon’s own backyard. I deprecate India’s unfortunate dilution of its close ties with its oldest all-weather ally, Russia. The latter has to be immediately reassured that closer Indo-US relations do not affect our deep bond with Russia. Countering the latter’s newfound closeness to China and worse, even to Pakistan, should be the government’s top priority.Turning to economic options, first, some Chinese investments can be terminated. The fear of breach of the Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) is exaggerated, since most have clear derogation clauses allowing invocation of the Essential Security Interest (ESI) exception. Second, while import substitution is not easy, we must snap the perfect symmetry between China as an export-driven engine and India as a domestic demand-driven economy.Third, since China is a controlled economy, with land frequently being free with heavy subsidies built-in, India must use anti-dumping levies much more along with a judiciously-crafted and targeted mix of import substitution, discriminatory tariffs, steep duties, and bans in certain areas.Above all is the most important facet which we ignore at our peril: The persona of President Xi Jinping. In eight years, he has risen from general secretary to the supreme autocrat of China. His journey to unquestioned leader status has included arrests of opponents, purging hundreds of officials close to his predecessors, bringing the security agencies and the army under his direct command, removal of the two-term limit on his presidency, his “New Guidelines for Political Life” replacing Deng’s 1982 ones and new courses in universities on Xi’s “China Dream”.In one of his rare interviews, he said: “If you want to be a general, you must be able to win a battle. We do not have battles every day, especially in times of peace...Only battles can give an opportunity to show success...”A man looking to leave his personal stamp on China and globally is hardly going to be content with jhoola diplomacy. He has to be retaught Mao’s dictum that power comes through the barrel of a gun, whether it is a military, economic or diplomatic gun. We should never forget: China is not the problem, but the Chinese Communist Party is and, more than that, Xi Jinping is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-blueprint-to-counter-ccp-and-xi/story-mdwdAlPBWMDGw9IL00SRGK.html
10-08-2020||News||India is a constructive, dependable actor globally, writes Harsh Vardhan Shringla||Covid-19 continues to exact a heavy toll worldwide. In India too, positive cases are rising. However, our effective domestic response has led to a significant improvement in our recovery rate, which is now 68.78%. The case fatality rate at 2.01% remains one of the lowest in the world. High recovery and low-fatality outcomes can be attributed to proactive measures taken to deal with the outbreak from its early stages. We started screening Covid-19 cases a full 13 days before the first case was detected in India. We implemented full lockdown on the 55th day of the outbreak when we had only around 600 cases. Our public health response has been appreciated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The government took rapid steps to augment health infrastructure. As Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi noted, India now has over 11,000 Covid-19 facilities and 1.1 million isolation beds. We have ramped up testing to over half-a-million tests a day, to be scaled up to a million.India’s response has not been confined to meeting our domestic requirements. We have been significantly engaged with the international community in providing the leadership that the global situation demanded. As a responsible stakeholder in global health supply chains, we ensured timely access to essential drugs and medical items for over 150 countries, while meeting our own domestic requirements. We reaffirmed our position as the first responder to humanitarian crises in the region by deploying medical teams to help Maldives, Mauritius, Comoros and Kuwait deal with the pandemic. India also dispatched naval assets to the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles to deliver assistance. This demonstrated our strong commitment to the PM’s vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).From being a net importer of Covid-19-related medical items, we have emerged as a net exporter. Today, we are manufacturing over 500,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and over 300,000 N-95 masks every day. Our system has shown the necessary adaptability and agility to significantly ramp up production to go beyond our domestic requirements.The repatriation of Indian nationals stranded abroad and the evacuation of foreigners from India to their home countries have been among the most successful aspects of our response. In the initial days, the ministry of external affairs had promptly set up a Covid cell and a 24x7 control room to assist Indian citizens abroad. The PM had also personally directed our heads of missions to extend all possible assistance to our nationals stranded abroad. Subsequently, the Vande Bharat mission, launched to repatriate our nationals stranded overseas, has been the largest exercise of its kind ever undertaken by the government and has demonstrated our capacity to effectively carry out complex humanitarian missions. Over one million Indians have returned under the Vande Bharat mission so far through flights, across land borders and on naval ships. We have been able to bring home Indian nationals from distant locations, and also facilitated the return of Bhutanese and Nepalese nationals stranded in third countries to their homes on Vande Bharat flights.Rigorous screening of returnees by our diplomatic missions has ensured that the proportion of positive cases remains extremely small (less than 0.2%). Testing on arrival by the health ministry and state governments has helped detect these cases. The mission just doesn’t end with the arrival of our nationals. We are also mapping their skills on arrival to link them with companies for job opportunities.There has also been no let-up in our diplomatic outreach during the pandemic. We have initiated and been part of several important conversations globally. Our Neighborhood First policy was on full display when the PM hosted a video conference of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) leaders early in the crisis — our first such engagement on Covid-19. He announced a series of measures to deal with the pandemic, including the creation of a Covid-19 emergency fund with a commitment of $10 million from India. We have also called for a better multilateral response to global crises in the future. The PM has, on several occasions, including in the G-20 and Non-aligned Movement virtual summits, proposed the reform of multilateral cooperation by bringing people to the centre of our efforts. Our own initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure are prime examples of this approach. The decision of the G-20 on debt service suspension for developing countries, which India fully supported, reflects this people-centric approach. At the virtual Global Vaccine Summit, the PM highlighted how India’s contribution to the global response in terms of sharing medicines was guided by our philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbkum. The PM also hosted the first virtual bilateral summit with Australia, which was followed by the India-European Union summit. In addition, the PM has spoken to his counterparts from 61 countries during this period. The external affairs minister has spoken to foreign ministers from 77 countries. We have kept open channels of virtual communication to strengthen partnerships and deal with situations that require diplomatic engagement.We have been constantly adjusting, adapting and innovating to deal with the changed reality, particularly in our engagement with the world. And in the process, we have been successful in elevating India’s profile as a constructive and dependable actor on the global stage.Harsh Vardhan Shringla is foreign secretary, Government of IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-is-a-constructive-dependable-actor-globally/story-QSoRIxr4QtmaDAIBAOCYuN.html
10-08-2020||Gurugram||Inspections reveal inadequate fire safety measures at two Covid hospitals in Gurugram||After incidents of fire were recently reported at Covid-19 facilities in Ahmedabad and Vijaywada, the Gurugram fire department on Monday conducted an on-site inspection at Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and ESIC (Employees State Insurance Corporation) Hospital in Sector 9, and found that they do not have a valid no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department. Furthermore, both the hospitals were found to be violating fire safety norms. Both hospitals are being used extensively for Covid-19 operations. While the ESIC hospital has 58 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 has been designated as a centre for testing suspected patients through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.Two fire safety officers from the fire department, Sunil Adlahka and Ramesh Saini, conducted on-site inspections at both the hospitals. At the Sector 10 Civil Hospital, Adlakha said, the fire-fighting system was yet to be properly installed, while the building had never obtained a fire safety NOC.“The Sector 10 Civil Hospital has not obtained even the first fire NOC certificate. They had obtained the fire scheme only last year. Upon inspection, a lot of items were found to be non-functional or improperly installed. Both the fire pumps and fire hydrants were not properly installed, while the smoke detector system, although present, was found to be in a dysfunctional condition. Additionally, the sprinkler system was also found to be missing,” said Adlakha.Adlakha further said that the officials at the ESIC hospital had applied for a fire NOC renewal in 2018 but upon a visit by fire officials at that time, shortcomings were found and subsequently, objections were raised. However, the hospital staff never solved the discrepancies, neither did they reapply for an NOC once again.“ESIC hospital has a fire-fighting system but it was found to be largely in a dysfunctional condition. We found the smoke detector system and the hydrant system to be non-functional, while a few fire extinguisher cylinders were found to be empty. We have informed the concerned staff members of these hospitals to get their fire-safety and fire-fighting measures in order,” said Adlakha.Adlakha further said that he is compiling a report on the team’s visit to the hospitals and will be submitting a report to Satyavan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer, for further action.“Based on the findings of the report, fresh notices will be issued to the respective in-charges of both the hospitals on Tuesday. Even after repeated notices if they fail to comply, we will issue a notice to their respective headquarters to take action and caution them that further failure to get the fire-fighting systems in place will lead to the hospitals getting sealed,” said Samriwal.Samriwal said that the action was initiated in the wake of the fire incidents in Ahmedabad and Vijaywada. He added that since most isolation centres in the city are situated in one-storey structures the chances of fire violations are low. Nonetheless, routine inspections for checking the presence of fire extinguishers will be conducted soon. Dr Shubra Gupta, medical superintendent, ESIC Hospital, said, “The fire NOC has to be renewed. Certain changes have been suggested for the revised NOC after the expiry of the previous one. The regional director’s office in Faridabad has already been informed about the NOC and they are likely to float a tender of ₹40-50 lakh for adequate arrangements at the hospital.” Gupta further said that the issue of fire NOC issue was also raised with the Gurugram administration when the facility was being declared as the designated Covid-19 hospital for the city in April.At that time, due to poor infrastructure and medical facilities at Sector 10 Civil Hospital, the ESIC Hospital had to utilise its 58-bed facility for Covid-19 patients, despite having improper fire safety measures.In the case of Sector 10 Civil Hospital, Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said that a file has been sent to the Public Works Department (PWD) for upgrading the existing fire system.“The main shortcoming at the Sector 10 Civil Hospital is of the absence of a sprinkler system. We have sent estimates and the projected cost to the PWD for this, and they will soon be floating requisite tenders for it,” said Yadav.Dr Deepa Sindhu, principal medical officer of Sector 10 Civil Hospital, was unavailable for further comments on the matter.On Sunday, at least 10 people died and 20 injured following a fire at a hotel in Vijaywada, which was being used for isolating Covid-19 patients. On Thursday, eight Covid-19 patients died in a fire at the ICU of a Covid-designated hospital in Ahmedabad. Besides the two hospitals, fire department officials also visited the practically defunct Civil hospital in Civil Lines, opposite the old Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) office on Monday. Since the building will be soon demolished and currently serves limited functions, inspections will be carried out once the new building is constructed, said fire department officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/inspections-reveal-inadequate-fire-safety-measures-at-two-covid-hospitals-in-gurugram/story-LZTb3EbN97PIlZAhUM0HwL.html
10-08-2020||Gurugram||Industries in Manesar asked to get 10% of workers tested in August||The district administration has made it mandatory for all the industrial units in the district to get 10% of their employees tested in August, and thereafter 5% tested for every subsequent month. In a notification issued by the district administration on July 31, the cost of the Covid-19 test will be borne by the industrial units, most of which are located in Manesar. As per the notification, the first round of testing must start by August 15. Industries will be free to choose between Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test and the rapid antigen test. The antigen test, however, would be conducted by the health department for which different industrial units will have to procure the kits and hand them over to the health department’s Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) in Manesar. Currently, only health department can conduct antigen test. Manmohan Gaind, general secretary, Manesar Industries Welfare Association, said, “Industries have been asked to place bulk orders of antigen kits with the health department. We have been asked to place an order of more than 1,000 kits for which we will be bearing the cost. As per the notification, the first round of 10% testing of the manpower has to be conducted by August 15.”According to him, more than 650 industrial units under the association have so far given a lukewarm response to the testing of their workers as they are already struggling to run their units. They are in the favour of enforcing social distancing norms instead. “Till now, 30 industries have collaborated to place the requisition for Covid-19 antigen detection kits. Each of them has placed an order for only 15 to 20 kits for the first round of testing,” said Gaind, adding that industries can also opt for RT-PCR and get it done via private labs. The RT-PCR which is the gold standard of frontline testing is much more expensive than antigen test. The state government has fixed the charges for RT-PCR at ₹2,400, while an antigen detection kit can cost nearly ₹540. As per the notification, industrial units cannot deduct wages or remove an employee for testing positive. Positive cases will have to be shifted to isolation facilities. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said, “The expenses for the test have to be borne by the respective industries to avoid undue financial pressure on the workers. The plan is to test a minimum of 500 people and a maximum of 1,000 people by organising camps. The department will deploy sufficient number of teams for conducting screening of workers in the industrial areas. The process will start once we receive the kits.”Under Manesar, there are three UPHCs, namely Bhangrola, Kasan and Aliyar. Health officials said that testing camps have been organised in the past, which have helped in bringing down the positivity rate to less than 2% in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industries-in-manesar-asked-to-get-10-of-workers-tested-in-august/story-NmroVA7c8P5sps368o85cI.html
10-08-2020||City||Amandeep murder case: 2 police officials acquitted||After 11 years of trial, a local court on Monday acquitted two police officers allegedly involved in the fudging of evidence in murder case of son of a National Conference politician, was shot dead in Jammu’s Shastri Nagar in 2009. The then senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manohar Singh and Gandhi Nagar police station’s SHO Sultan Mirza were both acquitted in the murder case by second additional sessions judge Jammu Virender Singh Bhau. The deceased, Amandeep Singh, son of former NC MLA Deepinder Kour was shot dead in Shastri Nagar on August 29, 2009 outside his residence. A third policeman, sub-inspector Satnam Singh, who died during trial, was also acquitted. Jatinder Singh alias Raja, son of a government contractor Choudhary Nagar Singh aka Nago, was the prime suspect in the case but he also died under mysterious circumstances in Udhampur jail in 2017. However, the court held Jatinder Singh alias Raja, and another suspect, Royal Singh, guilty for murder. While Raja died in Udhampur prison during trial, court awarded life sentence to Royal Singh. The judge in his lengthy 178 page verdict was furious over the ‘botched up’ investigations. “This Court has no hesitation to observe and say that investigators while conducting proceedings and collecting evidence have acted as if they were writing script of a movie and were conducting shooting of a suspense movie and, thus, indulgence in twisting of true facts and use of false facts to convince and persuade this Court to come to false conclusion cannot be ruled out and, thus, this Court cannot resist to observe and place on record the conduct, behaviour and role of the investigators and sound a note of caution for all the investigators, who are in service to be attentive, vigilant, careful, fair and professional in their dealings in future lest they should be put to task for their wrong doings,” observed the judge. “Further, prosecution has miserably failed to prove the relevant facts leading to the occurrence and role played by other accused persons in conspiracy of swapping of alleged weapon of offence to screen the main accused and also for changing the bullet during investigation on the basis of evidence, which is conflicting, contradictory and suffers from factual gaps, loopholes and missing links, beyond reasonable shadow of doubt, so the benefit of doubt goes to accused, namely, Nagar Singh, Jagar Singh, Rakesh Singh, Manohar Singh, Sultan Mehmood Mirza and S.H. Bukhari. Resultantly, the challan (charge sheet) against these accused fails and is accordingly dismissed so far it pertains to these accused persons. He further directed that DGP, UT of Jammu and Kashmir is notified regarding this observation of the Court to seek an explanation from all the investigators, who are in service regarding lapses and gaps left in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amandeep-murder-case-2-police-officials-acquitted/story-den2hBIZbLy414OMhi5ixL.html
10-08-2020||Gurugram||15 teams formed to keep a check on Gurugram farmhouses for hosting parties amid pandemic||The police on Monday identified over 400 farmhouses in the Aravallis and Sohna to keep a check on group parties being organised in these areas, despite a ban on public gathering due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said the police. The commissioner of police, KK Rao, said that they have formed 15 teams, including three from crime units, for this purpose. The move comes in the wake of a raid that was conducted on Saturday night on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road. “We have directed our teams to also keep a check on the sale of liquor in the nearby liquor shops to get an idea if any party is being organised,” he said. The police have identified the nearby liquor shops in the area and have started deploying personnel in plainclothes outside these shops late in the evening to keep a watch on the buyers. “We have received information that people who organise these parties are advertising on social media and asking people to pay online for such events. People from Delhi-NCR are coming to Gurugram for the last few days for such parties since the pubs and the bars are still not serving liquor,” Rao said. As per government guidelines on Unlock 3.0, only 50 people can gather for a wedding ceremony and 20 people at a funeral. No other gathering is allowed.However, party organisers are hosting pool parties at some of these farmhouses, taking advantage of the absence of their owners. They are advertising online, hiring musicians and young men and women to manage such parties, said the police. The police said the organisers have fixed a minimum entry price of ₹500, while at many places they are charging ₹1,000, depending on the number of people attending the party. “During the questioning of people who were arrested on Friday night from a party place, it was revealed that young men and women are earning well by inviting their friends from Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad to attend such parties. They get a 20% share of the bill raised by their friends, while the charges for their entry, food, and liquor are waived off. Due to the coronavirus crisis, many have lost their jobs and are finding it difficult to make their ends meet,” said Rao. The police said they have received information on several such parties being organised on the weekends in areas such as Gurugram-Faridabad Road, Sohna Road, and the Aravallis. However, during the raid, only one was found to be operational on Friday night. The officer said that the initial investigation has revealed that the party was convened over social media and was pitched as a 12-hour weekend celebration that went by the name, ‘Weekend Pool Party’. “The organiser who was arrested from Gururgam-Faridabad Road has confessed to having organised at least 50 such parties in Gurugram in the last three months,” said Rao. The investigation has also revealed that girls are hired for the “entertainment” of the guests at such parties. They are paid ₹5,000 per party, while musicians are paid ₹10,000 for a six-hour-long party, said the police.Rao said strict action will be taken against the organisers of such parties as well as the owner of the farmhouses, where such events are hosted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/15-teams-formed-to-keep-a-check-on-gurugram-farmhouses-for-hosting-parties-amid-pandemic/story-zHeePR4TDniXRnLqXBJYAI.html

On July 8, the district had crossed the 3,000-mark.As per the daily health bulletin released by the state control room, a total of 5,041 people have been cured or discharged, including 71 on Monday, in the district so far. “So far, 43 Covid-19 positive patients have lost their lives in the district. As a result, the district now has 932 active cases,” the bulletin stated.Meanwhile, the GB Nagar district has received 35,000 tablets of ivermectin—a tablet used to treat parasitic infections—from the state government after the latter decided to replace anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment of Covid-19 in a decision announced on August 4.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said these tablets will be effective not only in the treatment of Covid-19 patients but will be used as a prophylactic for preventing large scale infection among front line health workers engaged in the treatment and handling of Covid-19 patients.“There were some concerns about HCQ from the beginning. That’s why we have now been instructed to use ivermectin in its place. We’ll soon start distributing this medicine to front line health workers. This medicine will also be distributed to those who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients,” he said.The CMO further said that for Covid-19 patients, ivermectin will be administered along with doxycycline— a broad-spectrum antibiotic. “For front line healthcare workers, ivermectin will be given on the first, seventh and 30th day and then once a month,” the CMO said.In another development, deputy commissioner of police (Greater Noida) Rajesh Kumar Singh had tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.

His body has been sent for an autopsy. The deceased was identified as Sandeep Kumar, from Behraich, who worked as a security guard at the unit on night duty.According to the police, the fire was discovered by a patrolling PRV vehicle around 2am who then alerted the authorities.“The deceased was the only person in the three storey building and it seems that he never got the chance to escape. His body has been sent for an autopsy and will be handed over to the family afterwards. No complaint has been filed in the case yet,” said Amit Kumar Singh, station house officer, Phase 3 police station.He said that although the cause of the fire is not absolutely clear at the moment, a short circuit seems to the probable reason.According to officials of the fire department, it took 14 fire tenders nearly three hours to control the blaze.“We got the information around 2.10am and by the time our teams rushed to the spot, the blaze was already raging across all three floors. The basement was the only portion of the building that was not completely damaged in the incident,” said Arun Kumar Singh, chief fire officer of the district.He said that the presence of flammable materials like thinners used in the manufacturing firm led to the fire spreading in such a manner. It is suspected that the losses sustained in the incident go up to several lakhs.“It seems that the fire had already been going on for a while. The victim’s body could be pulled out only after the fire was controlled,” said the CFO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-security-guard-dies-in-fire-at-ball-pen-factory-in-sector-63/story-Q51upN0DKvOcC3UhN41G6L.html

The quality of construction here is extremely poor,” said Pandey.He said that on Monday his five-year-old son was sitting for his online classes when the incident occurred.“He is scared at the moment. He was uninjured but the laptop he was using was destroyed. A similar incident occurred today morning itself in another block of the building. This is becoming a scary situation for residents with no action being taken despite several complaints,” he said.The family has filed a complaint with the sector 49 police against the builder and society management but an FIR is yet to be registered.“A probe in the matter is underway which will be conducted by the city magistrate. Due legal action will be taken if lapses are found,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, sector 49 police station.The management has however, denied, negligence.“A small portion of the upper POP layer fell down.

10-08-2020||City||Construction still continues in Shahberi, alleges developer||Greater Noida: A 45-year-old real estate developer, who was arrested for his alleged involvement in illegal construction in Shahberi and charged under the Gangster Act, has alleged that his former business partners continue to carry out the construction in the village, despite the high court’s stay on it. The developer, Anil Kumar Chauhan, who has filed a complaint with the police, said that his former partners framed him in several cases and he was sent to jail. Chauhan, a resident of Noida Sector 73, said that he worked with Shakir Akil and two other partners. “But in 2017, I quit the project in Shahberi after I came to know that the Allahabad High Court has stayed construction in the village,” he said.Chauhan, who has been released on bail, claimed that his former partners have developed the project, despite the court stay. “I had sold my share in the property to my then business partners and opted out. However, in July 2018, two buildings in Shahberi collapsed and the police and the administration launched a crackdown. My partners hatched a conspiracy and framed me in illegal construction cases. I was arrested in April last year and served three months in jail,” he said. Chauhan said that he had visited the site in Shahberi when he was released on bail. “I found that my ex-business partners were developing the building despite the court stay,” he said. The complainant said that he visited the contested site last week and made a small video of the project and circulated it on social media to highlight the illegal development. “My ex-business partners had given a cheque for my share in the property that I sold off. But the cheque bounced. I want my money and also want the police to probe the matter and take action against the erring developers,” he said. However, Shakir Akil refused the allegations and said that Chauhan’s all the dues were cleared, and he has the proof. “We have developed one-storey apartment and not a multi-storey buildings. We have not violated any court order or guidelines,” Akil said. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Noida Central, said that the police have received the complaint. “The complainant, Chauhan, is also accused in some cases of illegal construction. We need to investigate his contract with his ex-partners. We have assigned an assistant commissioner of police to probe the matter in two weeks,” Chander said. The construction of illegal flats in the Shahberi village had come to fore after twin buildings collapsed in July, 2018, in which nine people were killed. Chander said that a police team visits the area to check illegal construction on a regular basis. So far, FIRs have been registered against 181 developers, out of which 19 have been listed as gangsters and two have been booked under the National Security Act, the police said.Rajeev Rai, Dadri SDM, refused to comment on the issue.In 2014, the high court had passed an order to put a stay on any illegal construction in Shahberi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/construction-still-continues-in-shahberi-alleges-developer/story-QXqlZo2vEzv0xilGRCpnqM.html

10-08-2020||City||Charge-sheet against 5 ex-revenue officials for fraudulent sale of temple land in Jammu||The Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Monday produced a charge-sheet against five former revenue officials and two others for disposing of 150 kanals (7.58786 hectares) of land belonging to a temple in Jammu. The accused have been identified as the then Muthi patwari Dalip Singh of Trikuta Nagar, the then Muthi tehsildar Manohar Singh of Talab Tillo, the then tehsildar Shanti Saroop of Peermitha, the then Jammu tehsildar Surinder Gupta, the then Muthi patwari Babu Ram, Mahant Bawa Ram Milan Dass of Ram Janki Temple in Udheywala and Damodar Dass of Basti in Uttar Pradesh. The three revenue officials Shanti Saroop, Surinder Gupta, and Babu Ram are no more. The case was registered on February 21, 2011. During the investigation, it was established that Baba Ram Milan Dass (mahant), custodian of Thakur Dwara Shri Ram Janki Pracheen Mandir, Udheywala, Jammu, had no authority or competence to alienate or transfer or lease out the land belonging to the said temple but to take undue benefit to himself and wrongful loss to the temple, he hatched a criminal conspiracy with the accused revenue officials, said a spokesman. The accused revenue officials issued the revenue extracts for the execution of the sale and lease deeds illegally and later entered and attested mutations of different pieces of land, he added. This action on their part individually as well as collectively was found to be illegal and sheer abuse of their official positions and powers to confer an undue benefit to Mahant Bawa Ram Milan Dass and wrongful loss to the temple which fully constitutes the commission of criminal misconduct as defined under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The accused officials disposed of 150 kanals of land belonging to the temple situated in villages Muthi and Paloura, said the spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/charge-sheet-against-5-ex-revenue-officials-for-fraudulent-sale-of-temple-land-in-jammu/story-778f827hRTN6hVNPkFoS6N.html
10-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad increases RT-PCR testing in high incidence areas||Ghaziabad: In the wake of the fact the rapid antigen tests are not always reliable when it comes to testing to detect the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, the Ghaziabad district officials have now started deploying more reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in areas such as Indirapuram and Vaishali as well as city areas from which high numbers of cases have come up. Rapid antigen testing was started in the district on June 26.According to official records, areas of Indirapuram and Vaishali, among others, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Indirapuram police station, had about 84 containment zones with 151 active cases till August 7, while other localities in city areas under the Sihani Gate and Kavi Nagar police stations had 68 and 57 containment zones with 163 and 162 active cases, respectively, till August 7.“A lot of tests have been conducted in the district with the help of rapid antigen kits. Since areas from where a lot of cases were reported are still topping the charts, we have decided to focus increasingly on RT-PCR testing. This is because RT-PCR tests are more reliable than rapid antigen tests. So, to find out more suspected cases we have decided to increase the daily number of RT-PCR tests in such areas,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “Rapid tests will continue but the number of RT-PCR tests will be increased to find out positive cases from suspected cases such as influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among other high risk groups,” he added. According to officials, the district has been taking up about 1,500 rapid tests and another 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day, currently.The high risk groups include close contacts of Covid-19 positive cases as well as persons with co-morbidity and old age, among others.According to figures of the health department, the district till August 7 conducted a total of 1,24,639 tests out of which 73,966 were through rapid antigen kits which were roped in on June 26. Out of the total results from the rapid tests, only 1,853 came out positive, at a rate of 2.5%, while the rest, 3,813 of a total of 5,666 total cases on August 7, came out positive with the help of RT-PCR tests at a rate of about 7.5%.“Since positivity rate through the use of rapid antigen kits is lower than the RT-PCR tests and the fact that cases are still rising from the high incidence areas, we have decided to deploy about 500 more RT-PCR tests daily at our two centres in Indirapuram and Vaishali and more will be done soon in other high incidence areas. With this, we will be able to find out positive cases from the suspected cases better,” said an officer from the district health department, who wished not to be named. To gauge the difference, a total of 73,966 rapid tests yielded 1,853 positive results. Out of those turning negative, 26,056 tests were conducted through RT-PCR tests to find true negative status of those who tested negative through rapid kits. Out of the 26,056 subsequent RT-PCR tests, 22,444 tests have been conducted so far and resulted in 1,097 positive cases while the result of the rest, 3,612, is awaited. The subsequent RT-PCR tests are taken up only for symptomatic patients and also for all patients having comorbid conditions. Experts said an increase in the number of RT-PCR tests will yield better results. “Since the RT-PCR test is more reliable, an increase in these tests will help us find out more positive cases. This will help for better detection in suspected cases and once positive, they can immediately be sent for treatment. On the other hand, the rapid kits have low positivity but their high use will bring down the overall test positivity,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. According to the official records of the health department, during the week from May 31 to June 6, the test positivity in Ghaziabad stood at 9.19% while it increased to 15.33% during the week, June 21 to June 27. However, ever since the rapid kits were deployed on June 26, the positivity is on decline with more number of tests. During the week June 28 to July, it stood at 5.29% and has now come down to 2.97% during the week August 2 to August 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-increases-rt-pcr-testing-in-high-incidence-areas/story-YdtQYlK4z3qUgUtO76ShwI.html
10-08-2020||Chandigarh||Mohali gets two Covid-19 testing laboratories||Countering the surge in Covid-19 cases, the Punjab government has upgraded facilities to 20, 000 tests a day, OP Soni, the state’s medical education and research minister said on Monday.He was inaugurating two testing centres at the Punjab Biotechnology Incubator (PBI) Agri and Food testing Laboratory in Phase-5 and the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory (PFSL) in Phase-4 of the city with Balbir Singh Sidhu, state health minister.Each lab, expected to test 1,000 samples a day, had been set up with approvals from the Indian Council of Medical Research. PBI had been given 25 and PFSL33 samples, respectively, for testing on Monday. Of the four laboratories starting operations from today, the other two are the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, and the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana. In his address, minister Sidhu stated that the surge in Covid-19 cases showed that large scale testing was being done and infected people were being isolated from others, thus preventing further transmission. Pertinently, Punjab has become “first state in the country” where apart from the departments of health and medical education and research, the facilities of the home department (Forensic Science Laboratory at Mohali); animal husbandry department (Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar; GADVASU, Ludhiana; and Science and Technology Department (Punjab Biotechnology Incubator, Mohali) would be put to use for viral testing.The four laboratories which started operations on Monday are each equipped with 16 pieces of equipment, including refrigerated centrifuge, fully automated biosafety cabinet and other testing tools, costing Rs 1 crore per lab.About 83 staffers, including microbiologists, research assistants, medical laboratory technicians, data entry operators and other ancillary staff, had started working in the labs, minister Soni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-gets-two-covid-19-testing-laboratories/story-uGSVnw2TSnjBgDs9l3TwsI.html
10-08-2020||City||Glitches mark day 1 of DU’s online open-book exam||New Delhi: Day 1 of the first online open-book examinations (OBE) held by Delhi University for its final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students on Monday was marked by glitches that ranged from downloading question papers to submitting answer sheet.The online exams, being held as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, will continue till August 31 for around 240,000 students of the university– including those enrolled in non-collegiate courses of School of Open Learning (SOL) and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB).Social media platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp were flooded with complaints of glitches, including alleged cases where students received question papers four hours before the stipulated time and confusion over the number of questions to be attempted.“Our Technical Writing paper was supposed to start at 3.30 pm but we got it at 11 am. Not knowing what to do and with no help from the grievance cell, we started writing our papers. At 3 pm, we received another question paper,” said Deewansh Khatri, a final-year BA programme student. “We had to discard what we wrote earlier and begin afresh. There were also conflicting instructions in the general guidelines and the question paper on how many questions we had to attempt.”For Avijit Singh, a PG student of History, the problem was entirely the opposite. “We received the question papers an hour late on our email accounts and could not finish on time. Some couldn’t submit their papers on time. A friend who received the question paper first shared on our class WhatsApp group but we could not be sure it was our paper. There was so much anxiety.”Poor internet connectivity in several parts of the country did little to help DU students – many of whom had gone back home due to Covid-19. Abhay Krishna, an undergraduate student of Physics, who is in flood-hit Kerala, said, “Data connection here is very poor. I struggled to upload my answer sheets using my phone on the website and ultimately had to take a friend’s help using WiFi. To be sure, I emailed my answers to the university.”Maria, a final-year Chemistry student from Jammu and Kashmir, said she faced more hassles than her peers in other states. “Students with 4G connection could not upload their answers on time. It can be well imagined what we might have gone through having a 2G internet connection. We ran out of time and had difficulty in even writing the answers since we could not prepare enough due to lack of resources,” the student said. She said Covid-19 concerns prevented her from going to Common Service Centres in the region.Common Service Centres are facilities created under the ministry of electronics and information technology to access government services online. But due to lack of awareness, many students were not able to avail of the facilities on Monday.Students from the School of Open Learning complained of a host of issues. Bhim, a final-year student of political science at SOL, said, “Apart from the upload and download issues, which took up more than the designated time, a few papers were not bilingual like previous years, which might be a disadvantage to some people.”Sanjeev Singh, head of DU’s Computer Centre, said, “Around 35,000 students appeared for their exams on Monday. It will be difficult to compile the actual data because students also submitted their answer scripts through e-mails. The grievance cell is active and we have been responding to students’ queries. As far as question papers are concerned, all papers are available on the website and students can go and download it session-wise.”Professor KS Rao, deputy chairperson of the grievance redressal committee reconstituted by Delhi High Court, which is hearing a plea on the matter, said, “There is a set procedure for the exams. We are compiling the complaints we received and will submit them in court. If there are any complaints, students have the option of taking physical exams later. The decision will be taken by the court because it will look at the data and pass the final order.” Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “We got positive feedback from students and other stakeholders that the exams were conducted in an excellent manner. Students who weren’t able to able to upload their answers resorted to alternative system to email their answers, which worked for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/glitches-mark-day-1-of-du-s-online-open-book-exam/story-GkgXqcp27AtyzaH1TFXUSO.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||TISS defers admissions to MPhil after NEP calls for its discontinuation||The National Education Policy (NEP) has invited mixed reactions from the stakeholders across the country. While the implementation of the policy is still unclear, the admissions to the Master of Philosophy (MPhil) course at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) for their 2020-21 batch has been stalled for now.In a short clarification on their website, the TISS administration has stated that “In light of the recent changes proposed in the National Education Policy (NEP) concerning the MPhil program, the admissions for 2020 batch are deferred until further notice.”As per NEP 2020, MPhil courses are to be discontinued, and students are worried about its immediate implementation.Admissions to MPhil courses had already kicked off and personal interview (PI) rounds were conducted between June 22 and July 17, 2020. However, the final list of candidates has not been revealed as yet. In June this year, with several parts of the country in lockdown due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation, the TISS administration had started conducting online interviews of candidates interested in MPhil or PhD courses for the new academic year. These interviews were conducted separately for candidates opting for a seat in either course at any of the four TISS campuses - Mumbai, Hyderabad, Guwahati and Tuljapur.“Most of us have applied to other institutes as well, but TISS would be our first preference. We’ve been waiting to hear about admission confirmation for weeks now, but nothing has been confirmed by the institute as yet,” said one of the applicants. The NEP 2020 was approved by the Union cabinet in the last week of July, but the implementation of the policy remains unclear to states as well as institutes. “When the government itself has not clarified how and when the new policy needs to be implemented, why is the TISS administration jumping the wagon and deferring admissions? What’s worse is that the institute has not even informed us about this delay, we had to find out by reading their one-line explanation of the same,” said another candidate.A senior official from TISS refused to divulge details on this matter but reiterated that MPhil admissions have only been deferred for the time being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiss-defers-admissions-to-mphil-after-nep-calls-for-its-discontinuation/story-YZEAB5hnjoD2N9I1E8N3CJ.html
10-08-2020||City||Online portal activated to issue digital degree certificates: DU to HC||New DelhiDelhi University (DU) on Monday informed the Delhi High Court that it had activated an online portal for the issuance of digital degree certificates, which students can get in a week after verification of records.The university informed this to Justice Pratibha M Singh, who was hearing a bunch of pleas filed by 21 doctors who had not received their degree certificates to date as DU’s contract with the printer had expired. The university said students have to register on www.digicerti.du.ac.in, and submit details, including academic qualification and name of college. After verification, DU will issue digital degree certificates within a week.On the court’s earlier directions, DU had prepared a sample digital degree with help from officials from Digilocker, an initiative by the ministry of electronics and information technology, and the high court’s IT department.“The court perused the digital degree certificate which has been sent by e-mail and is satisfied with the contents ... The issuance of similar digital degree certificates duly verified by two officials of the DU and digitally signed by the authorised officer of the DU would, in the court’s opinion, satisfy the purpose of the petitioners,” Justice Singh said.The court directed that digital certificates would be issued to the petitioners by email, on or before August 13, as they wished to apply for residency programmes in the US and to sit in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).The court said the doctors, represented through advocate Sarthak Maggon, are free to use the digital degree certificates for their ECFMG applications. It said if the ECFMG authorities need any clarification, they may write to the email IDs of DU officials, Sanjeev Singh or Vinay Gupta.The court asked DU to see if mark sheets and transcripts of students can be issued digitally and asked the university to deal with this aspect in its affidavit, while listing the matter for further hearing on September 7.It asked the ministry/Digilocker to list what steps DU has to take to ensure the data is made available to the students through the online platform.The court was earlier unhappy with DU for not taking proper steps to issue digital degrees to students who had graduated, saying there was a “complete collapse of administration” and reflects a “sorry state of affairs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/online-portal-activated-to-issue-digital-degree-certificates-du-to-hc/story-DPItoPN5fnTIPemJhFQxqO.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||FYJC aspirants can fill college preference forms from tomorrow||Students applying to first-year junior colleges (FYJC) can start filling Part 2 of the forms, which consists of their college preferences, from Wednesday, August 12. The state education department declared the admission schedule for FYJC on Monday. As per the schedule, admissions under management, in-house and minority quotas will be held between August 12 and 22. The first merit list would be declared on August 30. Until Monday, around 2.50 lakh students registered for admissions in colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), while 1.84 lakh students got their forms verified. The education department earlier asked students who did not lock Part 1 of their admission forms to do so at the earliest. Similarly, many students, whose forms are pending for verification at schools or guidance centres, are asked to revise the forms as per requirements. “Several students of ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) have entered their total marks out of 600, which is not the mandate. As per the government resolution dated June 29, 2019, they are supposed to enter total marks out of 700 or their best-of-five scores. Students can convert their scores on the website itself. Similarly, for CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) students, marks of five subjects are to be considered, and students who have entered marks out of 600 need to resend their scores,” stated the circular. Students who confirm their admission under the various quotas or the merit lists will be out of the admission process. Similarly, students who are allotted the college of their first preference, have to take admission for the college. If they fail to do so, they will have to wait for special rounds. Meanwhile, Pune-based think tank SYSCOM urged the education department to take action against aided junior colleges which are charging more than the government-approved fees. “Some colleges are charging 10 times the permissible fees and parents have no idea that they are being cheated. The government should act against such colleges,” said Vaishali Bafna from SYSCOM.

10-08-2020||City||Palghar lynching: 28 accused get bail as CID yet to gather evidence||The Dahanu court on Monday granted default bail to 28 accused in the Palghar lynching case as the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is yet to collect evidence against them.However, only 10 will be released on bail, as the other 18 accused are named in the third charge sheet filed by CID on August 6, which includes names of 47 accused. On April 16, Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushilgiri Maharaj, 35, and Nilesh Telgade, 30, were killed when a mob of locals attacked them at Gadhchinchale, approximately 140 kilometres from Mumbai. The trio was on their way to Surat and Telgade had been driving the car. Five police personnel were also injured in the attack. According to CID, the lynching was caused by rumours that were circulated using Whatsapp, which warned against a group of organ and child traffickers passing through the area. The gathered mob had mistaken the two travellers and their driver to be the traffickers. “We had the right to apply for default bail, as it was a clear case of illegal detention. All the accused were in judicial custody and were lodged in Thane, Taloja, Palghar, Boisar and Wada jails, for more than 90 days,” said Amrut Adhikari, counsel for the accused.RB Walvi, public prosecutor, opposed the bail citing that the CID was gathering evidence against the accused in the case. However, judicial magistrate MV Jawale granted bail to the accused on a personal surety bond of ₹30,000 each. “We will also apply for bail before the Thane court for the remaining accused next week,” said Adhikari.So far, 226 witnesses have been interrogated and over 808 suspects are detained, mentions the charge sheet. The state CID had last week filed a report before the Juvenile Justice Board, Bhiwandi, against two juveniles arrested in the April 16 lynching case. “Though there are 11 juveniles involved in the case we have filed a charge sheet against only two of them. Another charge sheet will be filed against the remaining nine,after collecting evidence,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-28-accused-get-bail-as-cid-yet-to-gather-evidence/story-OylZR5yRtniZ4VKF4dNU9L.html
10-08-2020||City||Civil Defence volunteer’s body found||New DelhiThe body of a 26-year-old Civil Defence volunteer, who worked in containment zones, was found in a forested area in outer Delhi’s Samaipur Badli area on Friday, two days after he mysteriously went missing from Swaroop Nagar. The police are yet to register a case in connection with the man’s disappearance and recovery of his body. “We are waiting for the autopsy report of the man to ascertain the cause of death. Accordingly, we would take further action,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma. The Civil Defence volunteer, identified by his first name Dinesh, lived with his relatives at their home on Kushak Road in Swaroop Nagar. He had joined Delhi Civil Defence a year ago and he was on Covid-19 duty in containment zones, his co-worker Anuj Pratap Singh said. According to Singh, Dinesh went missing on August 5 and a missing complaint was lodged at the local police station the following day. “On August 7, Dinesh’s body was found in a forested area in Samaipur Badli. His cellphone and a wallet containing money were missing. There were injury marks on his body,” Singh said. DCP Sharma said in Dinesh’s missing report filed by his family, it was mentioned that he had gone out with two known persons – Nitu and Tinku – around 4 pm on August 5 but did not return home. “Nitu and Tinku told the police that they had gone for an outing with Dinesh on August 5. After having dinner, the duo dropped Dinesh in Swaroop Nagar and returned to their respective homes. Nothing suspicious emerged during the duo’s interrogation. We are now exploring other possibilities,” Sharma said. The police are looking into the case from personal enmity and robbery angles. The Civil Defence comes under the Delhi Government, which refused a comment. It was not clear whether the incident happened when Dinesh was on duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-defence-volunteer-s-body-found/story-fXVXTAN4i9PbHsfPQndoZP.html

Besides, in view of the night curfew that starts at 10pm, temples in the city will close their doors by 9pm, said BP Arora, president of the Sector 40 temple and chief of the Hindu Parv Mahasabha in the city.He added, “To ensure distancing, we will allow only a certain number of people within the temple premises at a time.

Even during the holy month of ‘Saavan’, nobody came to offer prayers at the temple. With the rise in Covid cases, people are scared to venture out.”Saurabh, who runs a shop near the three temples in Sector 20, said that their sales are virtually non-existent this time so they are not stocking up anything, not even balloons or toys for kids.ISKCON TO OFFER DIGITAL DARSHAN The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is likely to keep their gates closed this year and offer digital darshan through the Zoom app. Nand Maharaj, the head of ISKCON Temple in Sector 36, said, “We get thousands of visitors during Janmashtami and maintaining social distancing won’t be possible. Due to this, we won’t open doors for devotees this time. There are a few people who live inside the temple. They will carry out a pooja, which will be livestreamed and shared among devotees through the Zoom video conferencing app.”He added that the celebrations will go on for two days, with decorations starting from Monday night itself. “We have asked people to make idols for Krishna and offer him home-cooked sweets to celebrate the festival,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/janmashtami-celebrations-in-chandigarh-to-be-toned-down-this-time/story-431Tcf5WarI9iURVE16OSL.html

10-08-2020||Mumbai||Passengers take to road as Delhi to Shirdi flight remains grounded||Passengers on IndiGo’s Delhi-Shirdi flight took the road on Monday to reach their destinations after the airline’s A320 Neo aircraft operating 6E 2019 flight remained grounded at the Mumbai airport. On Sunday evening, the flight had made priority landing in Mumbai due to hydraulic failure. Despite repeated attempts, IndiGo did not provide the status of the aircraft and the passengers. However, sources from Mumbai airport confirmed that the aircraft stayed grounded, and unable to let stranded passengers continue their air travel to Shirdi.“Due to the limited number of flight operations from Mumbai’s CSMIA (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport) flights from Mumbai to Shirdi are not being operated daily,” said a Mumbai airport official.HT had reported that the Shirdi- Delhi flight had made a prioritylanding at CSMIA at around 7pm on Sunday. The IndiGo pilot had requested Mumbai air traffic control (ATC) to provide towing assistance for vacating the runway. This was done as the aircraft witnessed hydraulic failure. IndiGo, on Sunday, had said the flight had a caution message on one of the hydraulic systems and as a precaution, the pilot diverted to Mumbai. An airline source said, “With no other option left, all the 64 passengers were taken to Shirdi by road.”Budget carriers- IndiGo and GoAir have been facing issues with its A320Neo aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney engines both mid-air and on-ground since 2017 following which DGCA at the end of 2019 had directed that the two low-cost airlines replace them with a modified version by May 31 this year.Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on June 1 extended its May 31 deadline to refurbish engines in A320Neo fleet to August after supply chains and production lines were hit owing to the ongoing pandemic.The airline is expected to finish replacing its last batch of 14 A320Neo engines by August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/passengers-take-to-road-as-delhi-to-shirdi-flight-remains-grounded/story-IpaD4hNAng7XEzgY8wiqoI.html

10-08-2020||Delhi||Ambience Mall case: CBI raids chairman’s office||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday conducted raids at the premises of Raj Singh Gehlot, chairman of realty firm Ambience Group, and others after registering a case in the alleged illegal conversion of residential land to raise the swanky Ambience Mall in Gurugram, officials said. The agency has acted on the orders of Punjab and Haryana high court, which last month asked it to probe the irregularities. CBI Spokesperson R K Gaur said, “The case is related to alleged illegal construction of commercial building at approximately 18.98 acres of land in Gurugram by blatantly flouting the building by-laws and statutory provisions in collusion with others.” Those named in CBI FIR include Raj Singh Gehlot, and companies Ambience Ltd and Ambience Developers and Infrastructure besides unidentified officials of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and Town and Country Planning (TCP) departments. The raids were carried out at Gehlot’s residence in Hauz Khas, company’s office at Green Park, HUDA office in Panchkula and TCP office in Sector 18, Chandigarh. A spokesperson for the Ambience Group refused to comment. The high court had sought a separate investigation by the CBI to probe alleged illegal actions, if any, and possible collusion between the builder and state authorities. The Ambience Group runs Ambience Malls in NCR and luxury hotel The Leela Ambience Convention Centre in east Delhi among other real estate properties. The petitioners in the case had alleged before the high court that 18.98 acres of land on Delhi-Jaipur National Highway in Gurugram earmarked for Ambience Lagoon Island Residential Complex was reduced to just 7.9 acres and a commercial complex was built on the remaining land. It was further alleged that such violation of the builder-buyer agreement and provisions of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Area Act, 1975 was not possible without the collusion of officials and builders. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had raided Ambience Group and Raj Singh Gehlot on July 31 in a separate case of money laundering against a company run by Gehlots – Aman Hospitality Pvt Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambience-mall-case-cbi-raids-chairman-s-office/story-iQDB2qRFpL5bHXupnLNqVI.html

10-08-2020||Delhi||Will take over MCD schools if they fail in duties: Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday asked the state urban development department to submit a proposal so that the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE) can take over schools run by the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations in case they failed to “perform their primary duties” such as paying salaries to teachers and distributing textbooks to students. The minister, who also holds the education portfolio, said the civic bodies were “diverting” funds provided for education by the Delhi government for other purposes.In a letter to urban development minister Satyender Jain, Sisodia said, “I have received complaints that the schools run by municipal corporations, especially North Delhi Municipal Corporation, have not yet distributed textbooks to school children. The allegations against the civic body, if found true, are serious and no one can play with the lives of young children... It is unfortunate that even after a lapse of five full months during the academic year 2020-21, textbooks are yet to be provided to children, which can play havoc with their lives.”Sisodia alleged that the municipal corporation had failed to pay salaries to its teachers and issue books to students even after the Delhi government gave them the required funds. “The Delhi government has paid Rs 853 crore for primary school education to the three municipal corporations and bulk of the share, i.e Rs 393.3 crore, has been provided to North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The money was to be spent on the salary to the teachers and providing textbooks to the school children. There are several news reports that neither the teachers got their salaries nor the students got their textbooks,” he said.“If for some reason, the municipal corporation is unable to perform their primary duty, steps are to be taken by the urban development department for taking over the schools by the directorate of education, Delhi government. Instead of paying huge grants to the municipal corporation, which divert the funds provided by the Delhi government for other purposes, it would be appropriate in the interest of students and teachers that the schools are taken over and run directly by the DoE,” Sisodia said in the note.“An action taken report to be submitted at the earliest in the matter,” he added.Senior officials in municipal corporation said the allegations of “diversion of funds” were baseless and the delay in distribution of books happened due to the lockdown between March and June.Ira Singhal, spokesperson of the north corporation, said, “Before Covid-19, we had placed an order to purchase books but it turned out that the rates had been revised. We again submitted the proposal for approval from the education committee and the mayor. This was stalled due to nationwide lockdown owing to the coronavirus pandemic. The new purchase order has now been approved by the mayor and the education committee. Books will be distributed to the students latest by the first week of September,” she said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said, “This has been one of their agendas ever since they came to power in the Delhi government...they are struggling to provide essential facilities and infrastructure. The government should tell people of Delhi why funds have not been released to the three civic bodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-take-over-mcd-schools-if-they-fail-in-duties-sisodia/story-CsVFjlqgeCYJJW2yfpn6PM.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||Work on installation of smog tower has started: Centre to SC||The central government told the Supreme Court on Monday that work had started on the installation of a smog tower at Anand Vihar in east Delhi according to its directions.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, informed a three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra that survey of the site for constructing the tower was complete and that the installation was being done in collaboration with IIT Bombay.“Collection of soil samples is in progress and we are in the process of appointing an architect to make site drawing, etc. IIT Bombay and TATA projects have tied up with University of Minnesota as it is a patent-protected innovation. University of Minnesota has agreed to share the technology,” Mehta submitted.The development came after the Supreme Court had, on July 29, threatened contempt of court action against IIT Bombay after it expressed unwillingness to take responsibility for the project and proposed to back out.The proposal to construct a smog tower in collaboration with IIT Bombay was put forward by the Centre in December 2019 after the Supreme Court raised serious concerns about the rising pollutions levels in Delhi.The court in January 13 had given the green signal for the proposal and asked the Centre and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to install a smog tower at Anand Vihar in east Delhi in three months. The project got delayed after IIT refused to take overall responsibility, including verification of works carried out by Tata Projects Limited (proposed to be involved by IIT for construction, operation and maintenance of the smog tower).The CPCB initiated various rounds of talks with IIT Mumbai regarding the project and three versions of MoU were exchanged between them. But the talks bore no fruition. When the court was informed on July 29 about IIT backing out, a livid justice Mishra had threatened to initiate contempt action against the institute.“How can they back out from a central government project after this court passed orders? Is it a child’s game? We will not tolerate this nonsense. We will draw contempt against them,” he said.The Centre then informed the court on August 4 that the smog tower will be built under IIT’s supervision.The court on Monday also refused to entertain a plea to reconsider the proposal and recall its orders directing installation of the smog tower. The plea filed by an intervener in the case, KK Mishra, said smog towers were not effective and there was no scientific basis to validate the claim that they would reduce air pollution.“We are not recalling our order. The plea is without merit,” the court said.Besides the smog tower, the issue of stubble burning in the north Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, a major contributor to air pollution from October to November, also came up Monday’s hearing .The court asked the three states to file reports regarding the steps taken by their panchayat departments to educate public and spread awareness about the ill-effects of stubble burning. It asked Delhi government to look into pollution hot spots identified by IIT Delhi and file a status report regarding steps taken to deal with these places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/work-on-installation-of-smog-tower-has-started-centre-to-sc/story-shlTUUipud8hIOrnePoVdN.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||CBI should probe Justice Loya, Munde death cases too: Sena||The Shiv Sena has now hardened its stance on Sushant Singh Rajput death case citing that even the deaths of Judge BH Loya and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Gopinath Munde should be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Former Union minister and Sena leader Arvind Sawant said, “Even we demand CBI inquiry into the death of Justice Loya. What about the death of Gopinath Mude? The CBI should investigate that too.”Sawant said that the whole attempt was made to subvert the Constitution of India which emphasised on the federal system of Governance.This move is seen as an attempt to embarrass the BJP as a Union minister’s name was allegedly dragged in the Loya case. Though Munde had died in a road incident, there were some murmurs of foul play in the incident. However, no one has so far, demanded any such inquiry.Sena was pushed on the back-foot after a troll raised the name of a leader in the Rajput case. The BJP said that the whole attempt was being made to divert attention from Rajput’s death. “Why is the Sena afraid of a CBI probe? Is it an attempt to save a Sena minister,” BJP legislator, Ram Kadam, said.“The Supreme Court of India has already given a judgement in the Justice Loya case in 2018, wherein it ruled out any foul play, and the Sena needs to clarify whether it respects the decision of the highest court of the land,” said Kadam.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbi-should-probe-justice-loya-munde-death-cases-too-sena/story-W0YTjS6W6Y0CbwReEOivTO.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||Netizens, NGOs donate smartphones to help marginalised students with online classes||Fourteen-year-old Yuvika, a Class 10 student of a Delhi government school in Dakshinpuri, was worried when her online classes began. “I have two other siblings and one of them is in Class 8. Sometimes we have our online classes at the same time and there is only one low-end smartphone in the family. Due to this, we end up missing classes and often can’t interact with our teachers,” she said.As the Covid-19 crisis caused classes to move completely online, school-going children from marginalised backgrounds were left in the lurch due to lack of devices and Internet access. While the Delhi government has announced a semi-online education model keeping such students in mind, they are still facing issues as they often receive notes on WhatsApp and need them for assignments.Yuvika’s father, who worked as a ward boy at a hospital in Malviya Nagar, has been unemployed ever since the lockdown came into effect. Her mother also lost her job as a domestic worker. “We were missing our online classes but buying another phone was not on our priority list,” said Yuvika. “I borrowed notes from friends but it was not a permanent solution.”On Saturday, she received a new smartphone after a group of strangers raised money for her on the Internet. “Now I can take time to focus on the lessons instead of worrying about finishing them quickly. I think it will help me learn better,” she said.For the past couple of weeks, Ankit Gupta, a content writer and an Urdu poet based in Delhi, has been raising money to get smartphones for marginalised children to ensure their studies are not disrupted. “Help has poured in from various sources and we have been able to arrange smartphones for 36 students so far. We got to know about most of them through common contacts or news stories. As many as 18 smartphones will be delivered after August 15 since they are for students in Srinagar where the lockdown has been extended till August 15,” he said.Gupta is not the only one attempting to bridge the learning gap by providing smartphones to students. Saajha, a non-governmental organisation which works in the public schools’ sector, also started a collaborative initiative asking people to donate their extra smartphones and deliver them to needy students after refurbishing them.“While surveying over 2,000 parents, we found out that nearly 40% did not have access to even WhatsApp. The first phase of our campaign lasted less than a week and we were able to collect 12 phones through Cashify, a platform that deals with used phones. These phones will be delivered to female students as their education is often not prioritised. If there is one phone in the family, it is often used by male students,” Saransh Vaswani, the director of Saanjha, said.Vikaspuri resident Rajni, a Class 12 student at a government school nearby, is one such student. “I have to go to my friend’s place to attend classes. My brother, who is in Class 10, has borrowed a smartphone from our neighbour for his studies. I get to use that phone sometimes. But if I get a phone of my own, accessing the Internet anytime and going through my lessons will be easier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/netizens-ngos-donate-smartphones-to-help-marginalised-students-with-online-classes/story-nNgi00TV2gL6aqgQ14DKGP.html

On Sunday, the team seized 27,600 litres of illicit chemicals with spirit from three industrial units in Dera Bassi in what it claimed was the biggest such haul in Punjab. The spirit was recovered at Om Solvi Trading, which had been raided on Sunday too The raids followed the recent tragic deaths of more than a 100 people, mostly in the Majha area, after drinking hooch. SIT head, deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Hardyal Singh Mann, said around 875 litres of raw spirit recovered from Om Solvi Trading had been sent for analysis at a forensic laboratory. SIT would investigate the source and customers of the units which had been raided.However, it was suspected that most of the spirit was being sold to illicit liquor manufacturers, Mann added. The SIT raiding team headed by deputy superintendent of police Bikram Singh Brar said that in disclosures of four persons arrested after Sunday’s raids revealed that they had hidden raw spirit in small 25-litre and 50-litre drums within the “inner circle” of the factories.“Searches (on Monday) led police to the small drums with 875 litres of raw spirit. These have been seized and handed over to the excise department,” the DSP said. The four men arrested after Sunday’s raids, namely AK Chaudhary and KP Singh, directors of Allychem Laboratories Pvt Ltd, Gaurav Chaudhary, proprietor of Om Solvi Trading Co and Jagmohan Arora, proprietor of Pure Solutions, were produced in the local court of Dera Bassi on Monday and sent to two-day police remand. The joint commissioner of the excise and taxation department Naresh Dubey said a detailed report on whether the spirit was being used to manufacture illicit liquor would be out in some time after the remand period (of the four men) was over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/more-raids-in-dera-bassi-875-litres-of-illicit-raw-spirit-seized/story-8Jsh09cmkxOhl6CAuJYgzH.html
10-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ambala DC favoured BJP in forming panel on MC ward delimitation: Cong||The Haryana Congress has levelled allegations of misconduct in the constitution of an ad hoc committee for the delimitation (wardbandi) of wards in the Ambala city municipal corporation, following which a party delegation led by treasurer Rohit Jain met deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma on Monday. Sharma, who has been accused of favouring the BJP in setting up the committee, which allegedly did not give due representation to the Congress and other opposition parties, has refuted the charges. All rules have been followed, he has said. Handing over a memorandum to the DC at his office, the Congress members requested him to stop the delimitation process and set up another panel following mandatory protocols with other party members of the dissolved MC.‘Five members out of four in panel have links to BJP’ Rohit Jain, who is also the Ambala Bar president, said, “The rules say that the committee has to comprise five members belonging to various interests/groups out of the sitting members of the corporation or out of the members of the dissolved municipality. But the present committee is illegal as out of five members, four have links to the BJP and one has been a nominated corporator. This happened despite Congress being in majority in the last municipal body that was dissolved in 2018. Interestingly, only one out of those included as the members is a corporator of the last body (2013-18) and most others don’t have any link to the MC, which is also against the rules.”Jain alleged that the aim of the existing committee was to deprive the strong prospective candidates of Congress and other opposition parties a right to contest in the upcoming MC elections and to divide the pre-existing wards in such a manner as to give an edge to the prospective candidates of the BJP. Commenting on the matter, Haryana Congress president and ex-MP from Ambala, Kumari Selja, who has also emailed a letter to the DC, said “This is a clear case of bias towards the ruling party... no representation has been given to any opposition party, including the Congress. All the members in the committee are from the BJP and this could have happened only at the behest of the government.”‘Rules have been followed’In his defence, Sharma, however, said all rules had been followed and “representation has been given to every group.”According to the names forwarded by the MC, “we have given proper representation to every group in the committee. We have to include a representative from women, reserved castes and others, and this was done. The process is in the draft stage, even if there is any objection from anyone, 10 days will be given to file it,” Sharma added. On being asked about the political links of the members, he said, “We have no issues with any party and while constituting the committee we don’t check which party the member is from.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambala-dc-favoured-bjp-in-forming-panel-on-mc-ward-delimitation-cong/story-U1sbDuuIBrcw6hfVDT0A1L.html

10-08-2020||City||Ludhiana civil hospital operating without fire safety certificate||Day after a deadly fire engulfed a Covid treatment facility in Andhra Pradesh, it has come to light that the Ludhiana civil hospital is running without a fire safety certificate.As per the fire safety department officials, besides the civil hospital, the authorities have also failed to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) for the community health centres (CHCs) being run in Jawaddi and Chandigarh Road near Vardhman Mills.Covid-19 patients are being treated at the civil hospital and CHC on Chandigarh Road, while infection testing is done at the CHC in Jawaddi area. Hundreds of residents visit the hospital and CHCs daily.A fire brigade official not wanting to be named revealed that the old building of the civil hospital lacks proper fire safety arrangements, and though there is safety equipment at the Mother Child Hospital situated within its premises, it is mandatory to get a certificate issued after thorough inspection.The official added the hospital authorities have not even applied for the NOC in the past, and it is supposed to be renewed every year.A city resident, who works with an NGO associated with the civil hospital, said the authorities need to work on the infrastructure as by not paying heed to issues like fire safety, they are putting hundreds of lives at risk. If needed, the NGOs can also help, but the health department should take steps in this regard, the resident added.Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “The state government had recently issued directions to the districts to make proper fire safety arrangements in civil hospitals. The circular has already been forwarded to senior medical officers (SMO) of the respective hospitals and centres. Now, it is their responsibility to apply for the fire safety certificates.”A fire broke out at a hotel being used as a Covid-19 treatment facility in Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada early on Sunday. As per the reports, 10 people died in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-civil-hospital-operating-without-fire-safety-certificate/story-GmeKHFc30x1FKhCLLi8U9H.html

While no one was hurt, the residents’ welfare association blamed the DDA for poor design and construction.According to the RWA, the society was constructed in 1997-98 by DDA. They said residents of the flats had a narrow escape.Arvind Rudhra, secretary of the RWA, said a first-floor balcony collapsed on the ground floor after a second floor balcony fell on it. “Thankfully, the residents were not in the balcony when the incident took place,” said Rudhra.The RWA filed a complaint with DDA and Delhi Police regarding poor construction.A DDA official said the residential complex is not covered under its 30-year maintenance policy. “The maintenance of these flats is with the RWA. These are not covered under our 30-year maintenance policy. These flats were constructed in 1997 -98. No such complaint was received in the past,” said a DDA official.The society has 228 flats of which 140 are two-bedroom flats. The building where the accident took place has three-bedroom flats.Residents say it is not a maintenance issue but a structural flaw. “This is nothing but a major design and construction flaw. These houses are not very old. How can the entire balcony collapse?” said Rudhra.A team of DDA officials visited the site on Monday evening. But RWA members said they had not ordered any action or asked anyone to clear the debris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/balconies-collapse-in-dwarka-dda-flats-no-one-hurt/story-8950GcrSr0KGpwjrGfONvK.html
10-08-2020||City||Dedicated biomedical waste collection for home-isolated Covid patients: Mohali DC||Allaying people’s fear of catching infection from those in home-isolation, deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan informed that no critically ill or serious Covid-19 patient is put in home quarantine.Doctors analyse the patients for co-morbidities and if they seem fit enough to recuperate at home, they are allowed to isolate there. Similarly, after recceing the locality, availability of separate room and washroom for the patient at his home, he/she is granted the permission, he said.Urging people not to panic over home-quarantined patients in their neighbourhoods, the DC said such persons are not supposed to come out of their premises so no direct threat of spread of infection exists. However, for the collection of biomedical waste of Covid-19 patients in home isolation, the district administration has passed orders assigning the responsibility to various government departments, he said.Giving details of the initiative, Dayalan said the municipal corporation and nagar councils would be responsible for collecting waste from the Covid-19 patients’ homes falling in their respective jurisdictions. Block development and panchayat officers will cater to villages, while GMADA will collect biomedical waste from urban areas outside the municipal limits. Each of these departments would provide yellow-coloured waste disposal bags in sufficient quantity to the patient as soon as he is home quarantined and thereafter arrange for daily garbage collection and disposal through the agency roped in by them.The DC said a person who does not require direct medical care can recuperate best in his/her house, thereby making room for critical patients in hospitals. “It is a well-deliberated mechanism adopted on the directions of the Centre and state governments for ensuring right persons in the right place,” he said, adding, “We need not panic on this account. This crisis period is a test of human empathy and brotherhood.”Adequate sanitisation arrangements are also in place, Dayalan informed.Besides dedicated medical follow up of home-quarantined patients, he said, the administration will provide a kit containing vitamin supplements, antipyretic medicine and a pulse oximeter to measure the blood-oxygen level. The pulse oximeter would however be given only for the quarantine duration and the patient would have to return it upon recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dedicated-biomedical-waste-collection-for-home-isolated-covid-patients-mohali-dc/story-yuHmri0kI2DNGUlpu3ZOKI.html

10-08-2020||Pune||For the first time in 127 years, Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati to hold Ganeshotsav within temple premises||In light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganapati, set up by the Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust and Suvarnayug Tarun Mandal will for the first time hold the 10-day celebrations within the temple premises instead of their traditional location at the Kotwal Chawdi, near Dutt Mandir. The decision was announced after a meeting between Ganesh mandals, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pune police. The decision was taken by the trustees of the mandal in the interest of the health of thousands of devotees who visit the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati during Ganeshostav. “To curtail the spread of Covid-19 during the festival which draws more than 20 lakh devotees every year, and to continue with the public sentiment for the celebration of Lord Ganesha, we have decided to celebrate the 10-day festival within the temple premises. This is the first time that we have broken the 127-year tradition. There will be no processions on both the first and the immersion day,” said Ashok Godse, president of Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Public Ganpati Trust. The trust is celebrating its 128th year and is looking at strengthening their online darshan services. The trust has also arranged for online prayers, darshan of Lord Ganesha through the trust’s website, app, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts. Devotees will be able to avail live darshan of Lord Ganesha at the following portals www.dagdushethganpati.com, http://bit.ly/Dagdusheth-Live, iOS: http://bit.ly/Dagdusheth_iphone_App. “We are also in talks with the police to maintain social distancing and a protocol for those who visit the temple for mukh darshan. When we celebrated 100 years of Ganesha with online seva, we had 7.5 crore devotees who performed their puja,’ said Mahesh Suryavanshi, a trustee of the mandal. The popular draw for devotees and the main attraction of the festival at the Dagdusheth Ganpati is the recitation of Atharvashirsha by women and school children, however, both the recitations have been cancelled for 2020. The trustees have appealed that all other religious rituals be conducted online. “Devotees will be able to avail darshan of bappa from outside via LED screens that will put up at Belbaug chowk and Budhwar chowk. We will also not accept garlands, flowers or coconuts,” added Hemant Rasne, a trustee of the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati mandal. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohal who was present at the interaction said, “Pune has around 5 lakh Ganapatis for visarjan which includes both mandal as well as home idols. This year, the PMC will not be building any ‘hauds’ for visarjan and I appeal to everyone to have their Ganpati immersion at home while the mandal will hold it within their mandal premises.” There are 50 mandals in the city who have agreed to hold Ganesha celebrations within their temples which include Shrimant Bhausaheb Rangari Ganpati Trust, which is celebrating its 129th year. “The trust has organized their first online cultural festival for Ganesha devotees from all over the world, on the official website of Shrimant Bhausaheb Rangari Ganpati Trust, Pune www.shrimantbhausahebrangariganpati.com,” said Puneet Balan, festival chief of Shrimant Bhausaheb Rangari Ganpati Trust.

10-08-2020||Pune||SPPU puts Shivaji’s war tactics in the classroom||The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will be the first academic institution to introduce a post-graduate diploma course on the life and teachings of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The program will begin starting this academic year. SPPU’s defence and strategic studies department has initiated this course and students can now apply for it. A special quota has been reserved for international students for this unique one-year full-time diploma course. “As we all know Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj established Swarajya in our country and to study his life, war strategies, management skills, the formation of a nation, guerrilla warfare and how he built huge forts, this course came into existence. The name of the course is PG diploma in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a nation builder. There are lessons about Shivaji Maharaj in schools but until now there was no detailed study programme about his entire life. So we decided to design and start a one-year full-time PG course on him,” said Vijay Khare, head of department of SPPU’s defence and strategic studies department. “This is a unique and first-ever course started by any university in the country. The SPPU’s management council and the academic council has given sanction to this course. It will not only be theoretical studies but students will be taken to study tours at Shivaji Maharaj’ forts and other historical places. A graduate from any stream can take admission for this course, for the first-year 20 seats are available. And we have kept some seats reserved for international students too. Students can take admission for this course through SPPU’s online admission process.” added Khare. Talking about this new course, city-based senior historian Pandurang Balkawade who is also a selected member on SPPU’s academic council said, “First of all I welcome this decision of SPPU which has started this course through which now we can learn more about Shivaji Maharaj. It is really a deep subject to study about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his empire, his management and most importantly how he developed each person for his kingdom. His work is so huge that till now we are not able to take up it in front of the world in a proper manner. Shivaji Maharaj does not belong to any religion, caste, region or nation but he is a universal leader and across the world, his life is being studied by experts. So I am extremely happy now SPPU has started this course and now students can learn more about him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-puts-shivaji-s-war-tactics-in-the-classroom/story-2gO5CD17AyWNvKSp4RMalN.html

10-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC allows termination of 22 weeks pregnancy of Chandigarh woman||The Punjab and Haryana high court has allowed a 22 weeks pregnant Chandigarh woman to terminate the foetus.The termination was allowed after a medical report from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) showed non-development of kidneys in foetus, a serious congenital malformation which it said is not compatible with normal life.The woman has been asked to undergo the procedure at PGIMER within five days.It was on August 6, that the woman had approached the high court seeking termination of her pregnancy. On that day, acting on her plea, the HC had taken suo motu note and issued a notice to the Centre on ‘flaws’ with the pregnancy termination law.Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, does not permit termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The law allows termination of pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner, where the duration of the pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks. If the duration is up to 20 weeks, the pregnancy can be terminated on doctors’ opinion that its continuance would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or can cause grave injury to her physical or mental health.The bench had said the law does not provide any remedy for termination of pregnancy beyond twenty weeks even as science and technology has not been so advance as to prevent the development of any deformity in the foetus after a period of 20 weeks. Due to this, people have to approach courts. Centre has to respond on the issues raised by the high court by November 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-termination-of-22-weeks-pregnancy-of-chandigarh-woman/story-iUu44kR3bT1CSCJ2F4jXOM.html

The skinners had also stopped lifting the carcasses in June, following which some of their representatives met mayor Sandhu to discuss the matter.

10-08-2020||Chandigarh||Semester fee row: Now, online classes at Panjab University to begin on September 1||Even as students continue to demand semester fee waiver, Panjab University (PU) on Monday decided that no online classes will be conducted till August 31 for the first semester of 2020-21 academic session.Online classes for the ongoing batches began on August 3 at PU and its affiliated colleges.The decision was taken by a special panel constituted by the university syndicate for academic session, online teaching and examination-related issues. It was headed by syndic Navdeep Goyal. However, online classes will continue at the affiliated colleges of the university.This has come after PU students held a protest on the campus on Monday for the second time, seeking semester fee waiver amid the Covid-19 pandemic.A member of the syndicate panel said, “The online classes will start from September 1 in the teaching departments of the university. Till then, the students will take admission and pay fee.”In an official communiqué, the university has stated that the faculty will engage students in online mode for clearing doubts or covering leftover topics of previous semester subjects from August 11 to August 31, 2020.The last date for depositing the semester fee has been extended till August 31. Earlier, the panel had fixed August 10 as the last date for depositing the fee.ANOTHER PROTEST HELD ON CAMPUSVarious student organisations on Monday once again protested outside the PU administration block demanding semester fee waiver. Earlier, they had lodged a stir on the issue on Friday which had led to a scuffle between students and security personnel at the university.The student leaders have urged everyone not to pay semester fee till August 31. “Students should not pay the semester fee till a final decision is taken by the university,” said Chetan Chaudhary, former president of PU students’ council.In a joint release, the student organisations said postponing of fee submission is a deceptive step against the actual demand of the students and all student organisations are determined to continue the protest till the semester fee is waived off.RECOMMENDATION FOR GENUINE CASESMeanwhile, the syndicate panel has also recommended the vice-chancellor to constitute a committee under PU’s Dean Students Welfare (DSW) to look into the genuine cases of students who cannot pay fee amid the pandemic. Students who are not able to pay fee, can write to the university. “A policy is being framed to help the students who are not in a position to pay fee due to the pandemic,” said Dean University Instructions R K Singla.MATTER MAY BE TABLED IN SYNDICATEThe protesting students said the authorities have assured them that fee waiver issue will be discussed in the next syndicate meeting of the university. DSW S K Tomar said, “I have forwarded the representation given by the students, regarding their demand, to the vice-chancellor. It may be taken up in the syndicate meeting for discussion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/semester-fee-row-now-online-classes-at-panjab-university-to-begin-on-september-1/story-4fsrqs2yz9aYOeBYpkE9XI.html

10-08-2020||City||Delimitation of wards for civic body polls begins; opposition objects to process||Chandigarh The Punjab local bodies department has started the exercise of delimitation of wards in at least 50 civic bodies, including seven municipal corporations. Amid the covid-19 pandemic, the state government was reluctant to hold the polls. Finally, October was chosen as there was no alternative, with the law dictating that the civic body polls be held within six months of the expiry of the term of the elected body. The opposition parties, particularly the SAD-BJP alliance, have objected to the delimitation process. “I have got to know that the state local bodies department has disturbed limits of all wards without a justified reason, as neither the population has increased nor the civic body has expanded limits. We are waiting the final draft, on the basis of which, we may take legal recourse,” said Kulwant Singh, a former mayor of Mohali. Sources in the department added that polls might be pushed back, with delimitation work of 20 civic bodies still pending. Of 167 civic bodies, 129 are scheduled to go for polls, the list of which has nine municipal corporations: Mohali, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, Moga and Phagwara. The other three are Abohar, Kapurthala and Batala, which recently has been elevated to corporation level from municipal councils. There are total 13 municipal corporations in the state and elections in four: Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala and Ludhiana are not scheduled as their general Houses have not completed the five-year tenure. Balwant Rai, former Bathinda mayor, who represented the SAD-BJP, objected to delimitation alleging that the ruling party has favoured its own party men. “We are ready. It is just a matter of time when we would complete delimitation,” said local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, clarifying that the outer boundaries of the civic bodies cannot be altered, but boundaries of the wards are changed as population imbalance is reported after five years. HOW DELIMITATION IS DONE? Any resident or the elected representative of a ward can report population imbalance and seek delimitation. The proposal received by the local bodies department is referred to a delimitation board of the particular civic body. This board comprises sub-divisional magistrate, executive officer, commissioner – the executive head of the civic body, deputy director and director of the department along with two private members from the ward. Then, a week is given for objections. After clearing objections, the matter is referred to the secretary of the department for final nod. Finally, notification is done to seal boundaries and population of the ward. The department decides the ward numbers. Of these, some are reserved for females and SC contenders. In 2017, after assuming power, the Congress government had announced giving 50% reservation to women. To ensure this, all even wards in all civic bodies have been allotted to them. CENSUS OF INDIA POSTPONES FREEZE ORDERS The Census of India that functions under the Union ministry of home affairs, which had earlier asked the states to freeze the boundaries of wards, constituencies etc by Dec 31, 2019, owing to the covid-19 pandemic lockdown has postponed the freeze orders to December 31, 2020, via a communication dated July 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delimitation-of-wards-for-civic-body-polls-begins-opposition-objects-to-process/story-quQjh1mdZE7FQdf70mPgWM.html

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who had made a proposal to the central government in regard to the NIV Centre some weeks back in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, welcomed the approval. The NIV Centre would prove to be a milestone to boost research in the field of virology and make India future ready to predict and detect viruses at the earliest so that necessary preventive steps can be taken, he said. Singh said that this centre would also go a long way in addressing the requirements of the northern region, including states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Union Territories of Chandigarh and Jammu and Kashmir. The spokesperson said that the Centre’s letter of in-principle approval had been received by the Punjab Chief Secretary from the Secretary to the government of India’s Department of Health Research and Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Prof Balram Bhargava. He has requested the state government to identify about 25 acres of land on long lease so as to enable the ICMR to set up this prestigious centre at the earliest. Singh had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 10 requesting him to direct the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to set up the proposed centre, which would focus on addressing regional, national and global needs in virology, diagnostic, research and therapeutic evaluations to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. Approximately Rs 400 crore would be required for the centre with BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Lab) facility and an additional Rs 150 crore would be needed for the BSL-4 facility excluding the land, which would be provided by the government of Punjab. The chief minister hoped that this centre would be instrumental in providing diagnostic support, undertake research in basic virology and build capacity in the field of virology to promote universal health coverage. Singh also pointed out that the NIV Centre will help develop rapid and affordable quality diagnostic assays for viral diseases, besides introducing teaching courses for M.Sc Medical Virology and DM, Virology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/centre-has-given-in-principle-approval-for-niv-centre-in-punjab-cmo/story-SoZggie7B1fHwNzw2Smt0I.html

The Union Food Processing Industries minister said Kisan trains with refrigerated bogies should run during the harvest season between December and March for ‘kinnows’, a type of fruit. Harsimrat, in a letter to Railways minister, said the cluster of ‘kinnow’ cultivation, which included adjoining areas from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, is spread over one lakh hectares. She said the Abohar town in Punjab functions as the focal market for aggregation of ‘kinnows’ and handles twenty-five lakh metric tonnes of produce every year. She said Kisan trains originating from Abohar can take ‘kinnows’ to the southern and eastern states where there is a big market for the fruit. She said the biggest market for the fruit is in Bangalore and Kolkata even as a significant quantity is exported to Bangladesh. She said due to the highly perishable nature of the fruit, only 35 to 40 per cent of the produce presently reaches the end consumers. “The rest gets wasted due to high temperatures during the road transport over long distances leading to the loss to farmers,” she said. She said the problem gets even more acute during the peak harvesting months of February and March as the temperature starts rising in the southern and eastern states. The Union minister sought to assure the Railways minister saying that she has been made to understand by farmers and traders of the area that Kisan trains would be utilized to full capacity and would be a viable venture for the ministry of railways as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/harsimrat-kaur-badal-wants-dedicated-kisan-trains-for-kinnow-growers/story-ekoqYYtIHgqleViRpJtWvK.html
10-08-2020||City||Kerala air mishap: Families should get adequate compensation||As the families that lost their dear ones in the Kerala air mishap on Friday slowly come to terms with the reality, Air India Express, whose Dubai-Kozhikode flight overshot the table-top runway and fell into a deep gorge 35 feet below, has announced interim relief and assured all crash victims that the airline would pay compensation in accordance with the applicable law.The applicable law is the Carriage by Air Act and hopefully, the probe into the mishap as well as the final settlement of the claims of the passengers and their families will be completed expeditiously. Out of 190 passengers on board, 18, including the pilot and the co-pilot died in the crash, while 149 are being treated for various injuries. Twenty-three have been discharged from the hospital. While determining the compensation, two crucial decisions of the Supreme Court will come into play. Both cases have their origin in the almost identical air mishap at the Mangalore’s table-top runway 10 years ago, resulting in 158 deaths and both pertain to enhancement of compensation paid under the law . While in one case, the apex court, in its order delivered on March 3 this year, has laid down the principles that govern the calculation of compensation (Triveni Kodkany Vs Air India, Civil Appeal No 2914 of 2019) in the other, involving the interpretation of certain rules in the third schedule of the Act, the Apex Court’s verdict is awaited ( S.Abdul Salam Vs National Aviation Company of India Ltd , SLP ( C ) No 009895-009898/2013). An early decision by the Apex Court in this case will go a long way in bringing clarity into a crucial issue pertaining to quantum of damages paid by airlines.Following the Mangalore air crash, Air India paid advance amounts as required under the law and subsequently, started paying compensation on the basis of the claims made, through negotiated settlement. The airline had paid Abdul Salam, who lost his 24-year old son in the air crash, Rs 20 lakh as advance and offered as ‘full and final’ settlement, a total of Rs 35 lakh on the basis of various parameters, including monthly salary of Rs 25,000 drawn by him in Dubai.Salam, in his writ petition before the Kerala High Court, argued that as per the third schedule of the Carriage by Air Act, the minimum compensation payable by an airline in case of death of a passenger was 1 lakh Special Drawing Rights , irrespective of his/her age, income and such factors otherwise relevant in determining compensation in a tort. The single judge bench of the court , in a detailed judgment, upheld this interpretation, thereby extending the benefit of the verdict to other claimants as well. .However, a division bench of the Kerala High Court, before which Air India appealed, set aside this order and said neither Rule 21(1) of the Third Schedule to the Act nor any other provisions of the Act or Rules provided for payment of any minimum compensation for death or injury and compensation was based on the actual damages proved by claimants. Salam’s special leave petition filed against this order is pending before the Supreme Court. In Triveni Kodkany Vs Air India (Civil Apeal NO 2914 of 2019), the wife and two children of Mahendra Kodkany , who died in the Mangalore air crash, challenged the quantum of compensation paid by the airline -- Rs 4.7 crore. While substantially enhancing the compensation, the apex court said while calculating the earning of a victim, the entire ‘cost to company’ or the total salary package, including all allowances, should be taken into consideration, without any deduction. This pronouncement would go a long way in improving the compensation package in air accidents.Drawing on some of its earlier judgments, the Apex Court also brought clarity into the deductions made on account of personal living expenses, besides the additions in calculating future prospects. The detailed order will be helpful to the victims of the Kozhikode air crash when they file claims for compensation before the airline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-air-mishap-families-should-get-adequate-compensation/story-nrtHRpDuVYeOdyy1tk0mdJ.html

Hence, the city will have an additional 1,200 oxygenated and 400 ICU beds in the next few days. With private hospitals releasing more beds for Covid treatment, it was decided to keep the setting up of third facility on hold.” With residents complaining of bed shortage amidst rising cases of Covid-19, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar told officials to erect jumbo hospitals for Pune like Mumbai and Delhi.

10-08-2020||City||Inquiry ordered into land deals made during previous Cong regime||Shimla The Himachal Pradesh government has ordered an inquiry into alleged benami (proxy) land deals during the previous Congress regime, suspecting that these agreements were done in violation of Land Tenancy Act, 1972. The government will inquire into whether the deals violated section 118 of the 1972 law, which bars all non-agriculturist Himachalis, including bona fide Himachalis, from purchasing land in the state without the government’s permission. State jal shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur after getting additional portfolio of the revenue department, has directed deputy commissioners in all 12 districts to collect details on land deals made during the Congress regime. Thakur has also ordered the DCs to gather details on the change of the land use, made during the Congress regime, particularly the estates in Palampur and Dharamshala. The Congress government during its regime from 2015-2019 had granted 468 permissions for different purposes that included industries, hotels, tourism projects, power projects and for other business purposes in Kangra, Una Sirmaur and Solan districts. Over 200 permissions were granted to set up tourism projects in all districts of the state. The BJP, itself, since assuming power had granted 204 permissions in 2019 for extension of land use and other purposes under Section 118 of the act. In 2012, before the assembly election, Congress had launched a ‘Himachal for Sale’ campaign against Prem Kumar Dhumal-led BJP government. This was after the BJP regime (2011) tried to find a way out to allow the sale of tea gardens and change their land use. In 2015 and 2016, the Congress also placed the matter before the cabinet twice, but there was no consensus among ministers. Previously, former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal had set up a commission comprising a retired high court judge, DP Sood, to inquire into such deals. The panel was asked to probe ‘benami’ deals that took place between 2003 and 2011 and look into violations of provisions and administrative procedures regarding issuance of “essentially certificates” since the HP Apartments & Property Regulation Act, 2005, came into force. On assuming power, the Congress dumped this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/inquiry-ordered-into-land-deals-made-during-previous-cong-regime/story-AxLhTaNXSchFoRufZrOWiL.html

The municipal corporation’s ill-preparedness for the monsoon was for all to see as sewer pipelines blocked with plastic waste and the lack of storm water drainage led to flooding on most roads and low-lying areas of the city. The worst-hit areas were 120 Feet Road, Sodal Road, Preet Nagar Road, Ladowali Road, Basti Adda Road, Football Chowk, District Administrative Complex, Domoria Bridge, Basti Sheikh, Basti Bawa Khel, New Railway Road and Phagwara Gate. The main highway was also water-logged, leading to traffic jams. “Water took hours to recede and made it impossible for pedestrians to walk. Motorists waited in long traffic jams to reach their destinations,” said Pawan Luthra, a resident from Basti Sheikh. Due to the rain, roads in town have developed potholes, adding to the woes of commuters who failed to locate them in flooded stretches. Jalandhar was included in the smart city list in September 2016, but the MC has covered only 8% of the area with storm water drainage. The existing sewage pipes can’t drain the heavy flow of water. Jalandhar mayor Jagdish Raja said that work to clean pipes and the sewerage system is on. “Road repair will begin after the monsoon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-rain-leaves-punjab-s-jalandhar-in-deep-waters/story-NAAO0H9buTI44J6e8CjIKN.html

An Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson said: “It is not the time to respond to it. It would be inappropriate on our part.” An advisor to the chief minister said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on something that’s only an idea. Currently, there are divisions in the Muslim community and stakeholders over the utilisation of the land. Let’s wait and watch.”The mosque complex, to replace the Babri majid that was demolished on December 6, 1992 by Hindu activists, is due to come up in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village. The Waqf Board has formed a trust called the Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation to oversee the construction of the mosque.SM Shoeb, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Sunni Waqf Board, said: “We would like to invite the PM and the UP CM to lay the foundation of establishments of public utilities like the community kitchen, hospital, museum, library, etc. The list of invitees would be finalised in the board meeting after a discussion with the other members. It would be a matter of pride for the board if PM joins us for the inaugural programme.”The CEO said there was no provision for any groundbreaking ceremony for a mosque in Islam. Such a ceremony can only be held for the planned public facilities, the Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation said.“In all schools of thought, no ulema (cleric) has confirmed a provision for any ritual and groundbreaking ceremony for a mosque. Hence, there is no point in organising any such event or inviting anyone for such an event (for the mosque),” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for the foundation.Adityanath, in an interview to a TV channel on August 5, the day the bhoomi pujan for the Ram temple took place, said: “I am not a party to it (mosque) in any manner. So neither will anyone invite me nor will I go. I know I am not going to get any such invitation. If I get any such invitation, then secularism of many people will be in danger. So I better work silently and send benefits of the government schemes to all without any discrimination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/let-s-wait-and-watch-up-cm-s-office-on-waqf-offer-to-invite/story-mQrkmcBiEyVLMZO3b1e5EL.html
10-08-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot questions shifting of BJP MLAs to Gujarat||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot questioned on Sunday the herding of BJP MLAs and shifting of some of them to Gujarat, saying that the opposition party was ridden with factionalism. The BJP has shifted at least 17 of its Rajasthan lawmakers to Gujarat since Friday. “They (BJP) have been exposed. We are in government and kept our MLAs together because of horse-trading attempts. But what are they (BJP) worried about? They are herding their MLAs at three-four places. A huge divide among them can be seen,” Gehlot said. “BJP leaders were making tall claims but today they are exposed as they have hired a charter plane to send their MLAs (to Gujarat). Such practices aren’t good for democracy.” Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said, “I think Gehlot should first take care of his house... It started with him taking oath as CM and the other (referring to Pilot) as the deputy CM. The state saw differences among them... he should handle his home affairs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-questions-shifting-of-bjp-mlas-to-gujarat/story-uiwRtaiQB7yOoIHJKNA4NL.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||A housekeeper’s book plans||He is in his early 50s and wishes to write a book. He has already started preliminary work. “It will be a book on housekeeping ethics and style,” says Ashu Prashar, an assistant manager, soft services, at a city mall where he administers the housekeeping staff.For 10 years, Mr Prashar has been making the excruciatingly long commute from his home in east Delhi’s IP Extension to Gurugram’s South Point Mall on Golf Course Road. It takes him about two hours one way and “just before the (coronavirus-triggered) lockdown began, I started to write ideas for my book on the mobile phone while travelling to office.”A father of two, Mr Prashar was formerly working in the insurance industry as an adviser, “which I didn’t enjoy at all.” His long years as a housekeeping manager introduced him to a “workforce” comprised of people whose lives and hardships he wasn’t intimately familiar with—migrants from other states who were obliged to move to big cities like Delhi and Gurugram to envisage a different future. “Over the years, I have come across people who have remained houseboys, cleaning the floor or rest rooms or staircases all their working lives.” This makes the manager uneasy. Ideally, he wants the folks starting as “houseboys” to move up in life, to graduate to supervisors and eventually—why not—to his own designation. “So I’m hoping to write a book that may help the young staffers to grow professionally.”It was during his commute in the metro that Mr Prashar laid the foundation of his book-in-progress. He started by putting his own spin on the word ‘house keeping’; he got that ready in two weeks of shuttling between IP Extension and Golf Course Road. The author feels no hesitation in sharing it publicly:H is for honest O for observer U for unique S for supportive E for efficientK for knowledgeable E for energetic E ‘encouragable’ P for punctual I for innovative N for neatly G for gentleIndeed, Mr Prashar is already sharing this “formula” with his mostly young staff of men and women. Since a great number of them, he says, are from backgrounds where basic education is tough to access, the gentleman himself give them lessons in maths, English and Hindi—“most of our folks have arrived newly from West Bengal and don’t know the North Indian languages that well.”Almost all of his recent housekeeping staff left for their villages during the lockdown and the team that newly assembled following the mall’s reopening on July 1st comprises of fresh arrivals. “A lot many live nearby, in Chakarpur and Sector 56 areas... they arrive in the city with only their spouses, leaving the children behind, with their families, back home.” Both “Mr and their Mrs” pick up work, with the “Mrs usually becoming household cooks in apartments,” informs the manager. In his book, Mr Prashar confides, he will also lay out tips on the new ways of housekeeping “because that old way of jharoo-pocha is over and things are now more mechanised.”Since his days — like for most people who have to shuttle daily between Delhi and Gurugram — are so hectic, he has decided to write a major portion of the book during the course of his working day. “I’ll carry a pen and notepad in my pocket, and as soon as a line or an idea strikes my mind I will immediately jot it down.”Mr Prashar gives himself a couple of years to finish this project. “After which I will try to get it published both in Hindi and English.”He now formally poses for a portrait with a part of his team, who probably will learn the tips of the future book in real time, and even before the author pens them down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-housekeeper-s-book-plans/story-MTvIzFEyecJkfwz6UtCCLP.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||Heavy spells of rain likely in Delhi today||Parts of Delhi recorded light rain and thunder on Sunday afternoon. The Regional Meteorological Centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said rain is likely to increase on Monday and Tuesday, and the city can expect a few intense spells.Delhi, as on Sunday, had a monsoon deficiency of 33% since June 1. But this number is likely to fall by Monday evening. The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is passing over Delhi and a low-pressure area has developed over Bay of Bengal, together creating favourable conditions for moderate to heavy rain in northwest India.“The monsoon trough is passing along Ferozepur, Delhi and Fursatganj towards the Bay of Bengal. During the next two days, southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal will reach Haryana, Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) and west UP in lower levels. There can be a few intense rain spells too,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. Parts of Uttarakhand have already recorded extremely heavy rain (over 20cm) since Saturday evening.A low-pressure area is lying over northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha-Gangetic West Bengal coasts. A trough is also running from southeast Rajasthan to cyclonic circulation associated with low pressure over northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha-Gangetic West Bengal coasts at 3.1 km above mean sea level. The monsoon trough is active and its western end lies north of its normal position and eastern end is south of its normal position, IMD said in its Sunday bulletin.Under its influence, heavy to extremely rain is likely to continue over Kerala and Mahe, coastal and south interior Karnataka on Monday; heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Odisha , Chhattisgarh, Vidharbha, Telangana, coastal Andhra Pradesh and east Madhya Pradesh. Rainfall activity over northwest India is likely to increase from Sunday onwards with heavy to very heavy rain likely over Western Himalayan region and adjoining northern plains till August 12.Moderate to severe thunderstorm with lightning is likely over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan, Bihar and Jharkhand, with lightning and gusty wind (of speeds between 30-40kmph) in some areas of west Rajasthan during the next 24 hours.“The low-pressure area is over north Odisha coast. We are not expecting extremely heavy rains in Konkan and Gujarat like last time. But we have issued a heavy to very heavy rain warning for northwest India, particularly for Uttarakhand, south Haryana and west UP. There may be extremely heavy rains in Kerala, coastal and south interior Karnataka for another day,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/heavy-spells-of-rain-likely-in-delhi-today/story-mcLdqDXh3f88OMiubiPT9O.html
10-08-2020||Ranchi||6 people die while cleaning septic tank in Deoghar district in Jharkhand||Six people died on Sunday after inhaling poisonous gas in a septic tank in Jharkhand’s Deoghar district, a senior police officer said.Two labourers - Govind Manjhi (53) and Leelu Murmu (24) -- got into the septic tank to clean it in the morning in Devipur village of the district, officials said.When they failed to return, house owner Rajesh Barnwal’s two brothers - Brajesh (54) and Mithilesh (43) -- entered the tank to check on the labourers, the officials said. When all four of them failed to respond, one by one Manjhi’s two sons, both in their 20s, went in, they said. “Local villagers broke open the tank and found all six lying unconscious. They were taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared them ‘brought dead’. All of them died after inhaling toxic fumes inside the tank,” Deoghar deputy commissioner, Kamleshwar Prasad Singh said.The circle officer (CO) of Devipur, Sunil Kumar said, “They were immediately rushed to Sadar hospital where they were declared brought dead”.

10-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana excise officials admit to shortfall in liquor stocks before SET||Seven deputy excise and taxation commissioners (DETCs) from various Haryana districts had admitted to substantial variation in the liquor stocked by the contractors during the lockdown period. The admissions were made by the excise officials on the basis of their checking on April 30 and also by teams constituted by deputy commissioners. The information was shared by the DETCs during a May 29 interaction with the special enquiry team (SET) formed by the state government for inquiring into the instances of pilferage of liquor from warehouses. The SET report said that, however, when the DETCs were asked to furnish data to this effect in their written submissions, none except DETC (E), Fatehabad, VK Shastri did so. “Except DETC (E), Fatehabad, all the DETCs reported that wholesale godowns of Indian made foreign liquor and country liquor were inspected by the deputy commissioners and the report was directly submitted to the state government,” reads the SET report. Shastri, however, sent a written submission on June 6 stating that huge shortages were observed on physical inspection of liquor stocks. Stating that there was unauthorised removal of liquor deliberately from an IMFL and a country liquor wholesale godown of Shree Vinayak Associates, Fatehabad, and a country liquor wholesale godown of Discovery Sales, Fatehabad, Shastri wrote that it appears that the licensees had taken away and disposed of the liquor stock in a clandestine manner without the knowledge of the excise department. “It’s a cognisable and non-bailable offence punishable with both imprisonment and fine. The licensees have thus committed not only a criminal act but also an act punishable under Punjab Excise Act,” the Fatehabad excise official wrote. After going through the liquor shortfall data, the SET in its report said that this is a huge shortage during a brief period. “It is also learnt that huge shortages have been reported by other districts as well. But the information was not being provided by the excise and taxation department for reasons best known to it. It is evident that there was huge unauthorised movement of liquor during the lockdown,’’ the inquiry report said. While the SET report had blamed excise and taxation commissioner for only giving verbal instructions to order the closure of liquor vends during the lockdown, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala defended the move to “successfully close down” liquor vends during lockdown without issuing written instructions. The department in its response to SET though admitted that 29 permits authorising contractors to procure IMFL and country liquor supplies from wholesale godowns and 90 passes for transporting liquor were issued online by the officials in several districts during the lockdown. Dushyant, however, said it happened because the software was designed to be operational till March 31 and could not have been interfered for security reasons by officials. “No vehicle left any distillery premise on basis of these passes. We have sought explanation of officials responsible for issuing of these passes,” Dushyant said. Liquor deficit found at Fatehabad godowns: 1. Vinayak Associates (country liquor godown): 9,503 cases 2. Discovery Sales (country liquor godown): 10,505 cases 3. Vinayak Associates (IMFL godown): 456 cases of beer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-excise-officials-admit-to-shortfall-in-liquor-stocks-before-set/story-zDqQG3JGkNZsvLZfIforyL.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Seven booked for duping bank of ₹1.18 crore||Borivli police registered a complaint against seven people for allegedly submitting fake documents and fraudulently obtaining vehicle loans to the tune of ₹1.18 crore from Canara Bank.Akshata Walanju, 53, manager of Canara Bank’s Borivli (West) branch, lodged a complaint against seven employees of a car dealership firm. The accused named in the complaint are Raghunath Rane, Ganesh Ubhare, Rahil Khan, Avidh Gharat, Z Madraswala, Shahi Alam and Vishal Tiwari.Walanju, in her statement, said that Rane, an agent of the car dealership firm, approached her in December 2018 saying his company wants to sell a Mitsubishi Pajero to a customer named Avidh Gharat and wanted the bank to sanction a ₹30-lakh car loan for the same.After the bank’s circle office gave a go-ahead, Walanju verified the documents and processed the loan file, following which ₹29.60 lakh was transferred to the bank account of the car dealership firm. However, Rane failed to submit the registration number of the vehicle to the bank. On being asked about the same, he told the bank the buyer was waiting for the desired registration number which was leading to the delay.Later, Rane and Ganesh Ubhare, CEO of the firm, approached the bank to apply for vehicles loans for three more customers, namely Z Madraswala, Shahi Alam and Vishal Tiwari.After due verification of their documents, loans of ₹29.34 lakh, ₹29.55 lakh and ₹29.55 lakh were sanctioned for the three customers and the amounts were transferred to the firm.All four customers paid monthly installations for first three months but later defaulted in payment while the car dealer firm failed to deposit vehicle documents to the bank, the FIR states.Upon re-verification of the credentials on the documents submitted by the customers, some discrepancies were found and some turned out to be fakes. The bank then checked transaction details and found that the accused diverted the funds from the company’s account to their personal accounts and used it for other purposes, said an officer from Borivli police station.When the bank got in touch with the customers and the car dealership, the complainant was told the customers cancelled the deal as they didn’t like the cars. They also assured her that they would sell the vehicles and repay the bank.However, after the accused failed to repay the four loans to the tune of ₹1.18crore, the complainant approached the police.The police have booked the accused under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of document purported to be a valuable security) and 471 (using forged document as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code.

10-08-2020||Mumbai||Malad man arrested for making obscene calls to corporate firms||Andheri police on Saturday arrested a 38-year-old driver for allegedly abusing women over phone calls. The accused used to call on landlines of renowned companies and would use obscene language if a woman received the call. A case of stalking was registered at Andheri police station after which police laid a honey trap to arrest him.Vijay Belge, senior inspector, said, “We have arrested the accused and are investigating the case.”On March 12, police received a complaint from a 32-year-old woman stating that a person was calling on the office landline number and using obscene language. Following the complaint, a case was registered against an unknown person under sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (Stalking) and 509 (word, gestures or act to insult modesty of a woman) of the Indian Panel Code.As part of the investigation, police sought caller details from the telephone network provider and learnt that the accused was using someone else’s SIM card, which he had probably stolen. Three different SIM cards were used in the crime.“As he was not reachable, we laid a honey trap. We took help from a woman and asked her to call him and insist to meet at Bandra Bandstand. While he refused to meet the first two times, he showed up for the third meeting at Andheri MIDC, from where he was nabbed,” said sub-inspector Digambar Pagare.The arrested accused, Henry Micheal Nader, 38, is a resident of Malad and a driver by profession. During questioning, Nader revealed that he got the numbers from Google. According to Nader’s call detail record (CDR), he had called more than 350 companies, of which more than 100 calls were answered by women. Nader, however, refused to disclose the reason behind his actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/malad-man-arrested-for-making-obscene-calls-to-corporate-firms/story-abdhCCEpW5cqxpFJjcmcqO.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Shivaji statue row: Lead agitation in Belgaum, Raut dares Fadnavis||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut took a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the opposition party in Maharashtra, on the silence over the removal of Shivaji’s statue in Mangutti village of Karnataka’s Belgaum district. Raut said the “conspiracy” by the BJP government in Karnataka to remove the statue in the night is “condemnable”.The Sena leader challenged the Leader of opposition in Maharashtra and former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis to lead an agitation in Belgaum and promised support from the Shiv Sena. “The manner in which the Karnataka police removed the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is condemnable. Nobody from Maharashtra’s opposition party is ready to talk about it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid respects to Chhatrapati Shivaji during the foundation laying ceremony of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The same party’s government in Karnataka removed the statue in the night by switching off the lights,” he told reporters in Mumbai.He further said, “Maharashtra government should take serious note of this incident. Without indulging in politics, the opposition party in the state should be taken in confidence. If needed, we are ready to go to Belgaum and agitate under the leadership of the opposition leader. Ask him, if he is ready.” Belgaum district of Karnataka, which has a sizable Marathi-speaking population, has been the subject of a protracted boundary dispute between the two states.On Saturday, Maharashtra minister and Sena leader Eknath Shinde demanded that the Karnataka government reinstate the statue of Shivaji Maharaj which was allegedly removed by the authorities in Belgaum district.In a letter to Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa, Shinde, who is the coordinator minister for border areas along Karnataka, claimed that a life-size statue of the warrior king was removed at Mangutti village by the police and district authorities. The statue had been installed with the permission of the gram panchayat, but the administration removed it deliberately, claimed the minister and demanded action against the officials involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shivaji-statue-row-lead-agitation-in-belgaum-raut-dares-fadnavis/story-4ObJbCjHMT39G8ya5eUTsO.html
10-08-2020||City||Amid Covid, Ganpati mandals to tone down the celebrations||For more than hundred years, Ganeshotsav celebrations at Thane’s oldest pandal, Lokmanya Ali Ganeshosav Mandal in Charai, had one of the biggest traditional processions to install the Ganpati idol. The mandal, started by freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak in 1919, is currently in its 101st year and had hoped for a similar celebration, but the members have decided to tone down the festivities in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state and Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) have released a safety protocol and guidelines for the 10-day festival, to be followed by the mandals.Like Lokmanya Ali, most mandals in Thane have decided to keep the celebrations to a bare minimum, some are even taking to technology to live stream aarti and other events online in a bid to avoid crowding and maintain social distancing norms. Dipesh Joglekar, secretary of Lokmanya Ali Ganeshotsav Mandal, said, “We put efforts to continue the traditional celebrations every year, for which we get contribution from around 300 residents in the vicinity. The highlight of our celebration is the colourful procession to welcome the idol. However, this year keeping in mind social distancing norms, we shall keep it to the bare minimum. Only a few members will install the idol while the priest will perform daily rituals. We will not allow many people inside. On the last day, we shall immerse the idol.” Shivgarjana Mitra Mandal in Uthalsar has used the Ganeshotsav funds for Covid-19 relief work; they distributed food, masks and other essentials to the less privileged. This year, mandal members have decided to conduct only basic rituals without much decorations or processions. Sudhir Kadu, a mandal member, said, “During lockdown, our volunteers came together and helped those in need. We do not have much fund left to conduct grand celebrations. Moreover, we are keen on observing social distancing norms. We intend to collect money from the volunteers and ensure basic rituals and daily pooja of the idol is done.” Last year, the mandal used more than 30,000 crayons, 15,000 sketch pens and 10,000 colour pencils as a part of pandal decoration. Pramod Sawant, member of Shreerang Sahaniwas Ganeshotsav Mandal, said, “This is our 50th year and we are trying to make use of technology and will provide online darshan or conduct interactions online for devotees. It is still in the planning stage.” Meanwhile, Jai Bhavani Mitra Mandal in Gokul Nagar has cancelled all cultural celebrations. “As we have been celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi since the past 34 years, we will install the idol in Jari Mari temple in the vicinity, sans pandal or decorations. Only daily pooja will take place. We will put up awareness posters about need to wear masks and ensure social distancing, at the spot where we set up the pandal every year,” said Aadesh Sonawane, member of Jai Bhavani Mitra Mandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-ganpati-mandals-to-tone-down-the-celebrations/story-6vdKxZlt5avzYOOWz6LIWO.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha reports record 390 Covid-19 deaths in a day||Maharashtra on Sunday reported 390 Covid-19 deaths, highest in a day, taking its death toll to 17,757, health department data stated. However, from the deaths reported on Sunday, 260 fatalities were from the previous 48 hours, 76 were from the previous week and the remaining 56 deaths were from a week before. Maharashtra also recorded its second-highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases with 12,248 new infections, taking the state’s tally to 515,332. The highest one-day spike of 12,822 cases was recorded on Saturday.According to official data, 78,070 samples were tested, of which 12,248 samples were positive, translating to a positivity rate of 15.68%. The overall positivity rate of the state improved marginally and stood at 18.91%. The state also recorded 13,348 discharged patients on Sunday, taking the tally of recovered people to 351,710. The recovery rate of the state stood at 68.25%.A day after the state crossed the grim landmark of 500,000 cases, state health minister Rajesh Tope declined to comment if the state had reached the community transmission stage. “So far, 60 to 70 per cent of the cases that are reported are from high-risk contracts and from quarantine facilities. It is not the case that people who randomly get tested are positive.Therefore, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and WHO only should respond to the issue of community transmission after careful study. We have been transparent in the data; they have all the data with them,” he told reporters in Satara.The rising number of deaths is a concern for the state government and the health department, officials said. The district authorities have been directed to emphasise on the reduction in the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which stood at 3.45%, against the national rate of 2.04%.Maharashtra, which has the highest number of fatalities due to the coronavirus disease in the country, stands second to Gujarat in terms of the CFR. However, the gap between the two states is narrowing. As per the data of state Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) released on July 28, the CFR of the state was 3.62%, while Gujarat’s mortality rate is 4.13%, which is a difference of 0.51%. Gujarat’s mortality rate has dropped faster in comparison to Maharashtra. During the period, Maharashtra saw a drop of 0.17%, while Gujarat saw 0.37%.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, admitted that though the CFR is decreasing gradually, the absolute number of deaths reported is high. “The absolute number of deaths that are reported daily is high, but the focus of the entire administration is on reducing the fatalities. We have modified out standard operating procedures with experience in these months,” Awate said.The Central government too, in a review meeting held last week, expressed concern over the high number of Covid-19 deaths and has listed 10 districts that need to do more to tackle the cases and fatalities. The 10 districts include Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Sangli and Nagpur. Spread in rural parts of the state where the health infrastructure is weak has made it difficult for the authorities to control the fatality rate.Tope, who was in Satara to review the Covid-19 situation in Kolhapur and Satara, said, “The number of cases [reported] daily are going up, but the recoveries are over 3.50 lakh with a rate of 68%. Our focus is to keep the deaths lower. Early detection is important. For instance, in Satara and Kolhapur, the deaths are seen between one to five days after hospitalisation. We are working to bring it down.”Kolhapur and Satara districts have seen a surge in cases last month, while the CFR is also on the higher side at 2.45 and 3.02%. Kolhapur has 5,320 active cases, while Satara has 2,024 active cases. Satara district added 257 new cases, while Kolhapur city and district added 137 and 307 new cases on Sunday.“These districts have a high positivity rate of around 35%. The public representatives from the district have said that the cases increase with people coming in from hotspot areas into the district and now it has spread. But this is the nature of this virus. There is a need for more tracing and testing. House-to-house surveillance will be started and people with co-morbidities will be set aside,” he told reporters in Satara after the review meeting.He added that the district administration is also looking to set up a jumbo facility to augment bed capacity. A new testing laboratory will be set up in Satara district to reduce the turnaround time as currently, the samples went to Pune, the minister said.Meanwhile, Pune city topped the state with the highest number of cases on Sunday with 1433 new infections, taking city’s tally to 70,933. Mumbai reported 1,066 new infections, taking city’s tally to 123,382. Pune recorded 58 fatalities while Mumbai reported 48, taking their tallies to 1802 and 6799, respectively.Pune district reported 517 new cases, and Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 1,066 cases. Another hotspot in the state, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, reported 2,183 new cases. The region contributed 17.82% of the total caseload reported on Sunday. The MMR, in June and July, contributed around 40% of the state’s daily caseload.Nashik city reported 807 new cases, while Nagpur city reported 488 new cases. The state’s second capital is nearing 6000 Covid-19 cases. Beed, Osmanabad, and Latur districts reported 235, 161 and 297 new infections, while Aurangabad district added 280 new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-reports-record-390-covid-19-deaths-in-a-day/story-a1vxWhrDODgHDTGA2WJCuL.html

The fishermen allegedly drowned after their boat ‘Lucky Star’ carrying 13 people, capsized around 10 nautical miles off the Gorai coast on August 4.Another fishing boat ‘God King’ had rushed to their help and was able to rescue 11 fishermen. The two others were missing, said senior inspector Sanjeev Narkar of Gorai police station.The deceased have been identified as Mangesh Kadam, 24, and Satish Jagtap, 25, both residents of Gorai.Soon after the incident, the Indian Coast Guard and the Navy were informed, and a search and rescue operation was launched for two days. However, due to rough weather and strong winds, the missing fishermen were not found. On Sunday morning, a Dahanu resident spotted a body lying on the shore. He informed another resident Manoj Raut and the police. Another body was spotted on the seashore in Gholvad, said Narkar.Local police alerted Gorai police station, suspecting that the bodies were of the two missing fishermen. The missing fishermen’s families were informed and they identified the fishermen based on their clothes as the bodies were partially discomposed, said Josef Kolaso, vice-chairman of Gorai Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-missing-gorai-fishermen-s-bodies-wash-up-at-dahanu/story-0ynjV0upr2vLiuV322taFI.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||IndiGo’s Delhi-Shirdi flight makes priority landing at Mumbai||An IndiGo A320Neo aircraft, flying to Shirdi from Delhi, made priority landing at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on Sunday around 7pm owing to hydraulic failure. It had to be towed from the runway to the bay. However, the status of the passengers was not clear till the time of going to press. “An IndiGo A320, operating a Delhi- Shirdi (6E-2019) flight, received a caution message on one of the hydraulic systems. So as a precaution, the pilot diverted to Mumbai. The aircraft is currently at Mumbai and shall be back in operation after necessary inspections,” an IndiGo spokesperson said. Airport sources said that the pilot requested Mumbai air traffic control (ATC) to provide towing assistance on landing. “The flight with 64 passengers on board landed safely at 7pm, around an hour after it took off from Delhi. The runway was vacated after the narrow body aircraft was towed away to the allotted bay. All the operations however remained unaffected,” said an airport official. The airport at Shirdi is not equipped with night landing facility, owing to which flight operations do not take place after sunset. IndiGo has been facing snags with the A320Neo aircraft since 2017, following which Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in December 2019 directed that the two airlines replace them with modified versions by May 31 this year. The deadline was extended to August after supply chains and production lines were hit owing to the ongoing pandemic. On July 29, IndiGo’s chief operating officer Wolfgang Prock-Schaeur informed analysts that the airline will finish replacing its last batch of 14 A320Neo engines by August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indigo-s-delhi-shirdi-flight-makes-priority-landing-at-mumbai/story-iT0dsq8TGtt1tacL6bIuYJ.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||After Kerala plane crash, experts stress need for pre-monsoon training||As investigations into the Air India Express plane crash at Karipur airport in Kozhikode began on Saturday, aviation experts have raised questions on the status and implementation of annual refresher, called Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR), that pilots irrespective of seniority have to mandatorily undergo before the onset of monsoon every year. ALAR, a theoretical exercise, is part of the syllabus, designed with a set of approach and landing briefing notes with an aim to help reduce the frequency and severity of approach and landing incidents and accidents. ALAR refresher is deemed to be important during monsoon on account of low visibility, wet runways and engine performance which play a critical role during landing. Also read: All we know is that the touchdown was late, says DGCA chiefMohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert specialising on wet runways, said airlines complete the mandatory annual training for pilots only on paper. “Many pilots skip the mandatory monsoon training, and it has just become an on-paper training for airlines, especially Air India. Hence, the approach-and-landing accidents training is not attended by various pilots. And DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) has just been turning a blind eye to the non-compliance,” said Ranganathan, a former instructor pilot of Boeing 737. A senior Air India pilot, who is not authorised to talk to the media, said, “The airline has been completing the training in a haphazard manner. DGCA is aware of it. For instance, a pilot who last completed his set of trainings in September is made to undergo ALAR refresher a year later in September, and not before the monsoons which defeats the purpose of the ALAR training.” Air India officials did not respond to calls or texts. Also read: Civilians rushed to save lives after plane crash, honoured with special gesture“An overhaul of the whole system is needed instead of a reactive change. It’s a systemic issue with bureaucrats at the helm of technical organisations such as DGCA. After the accident, the most they will do is add a test to the ALAR programme which doesn’t serve the purpose,” said a pilot from one of the leading airlines. Another pilot, requesting anonymity, said the training is conducted to not only fly during monsoons but also to deal with worldwide airports and their extreme weather conditions like snowfall. Also read: Ex-air marshal, who probed Mangaluru accident, lists reasons for Kozhikode crashHowever, a former DGCA official said, “ALAR is part of the syllabus, which is in their training manual, and not specific training. There is a checklist that they have to tick off once pilots complete the refresher. So if they have tick-marked, we assume they have completed it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-crash-experts-stress-need-for-pre-monsoon-training/story-MyQB33wXefnPsblX6knvNN.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Sero survey in Mumbai: ‘6% residents in slums who had Covid-19 antibodies diabetic’||Six per cent of slum residents, who were detected with Covid-19 antibodies during the first serological survey last month had a pre-medical history of diabetes. In non-slum areas, 9% of the respondents who were found having antibodies during the tests, had diabetes, researchers from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) said. Doctors from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) health department claim that 20% of Mumbai’s population, mostly from the affluent sections of the society, has diabetes. The state Covid-19 task force said that as per the city’s total diabetic population, the number of residents detected with the antibodies and are diabetic is quite less.As people suffering from diabetes are among the groups that are more vulnerable to the infection, the researchers, through questionnaires, conducted a research to determine the medical history of the residents who were carriers of the antibodies.Around 4,218 slum residents were tested during the survey, of whom 2,387 had the prevalence of antibodies. According to TIFR researchers, 144 residents who were detected with antibodies, had a medical history of diabetes. In non-slum areas, the researchers found that 30 residents of the 358 who tested positive in the antibody test, were diabetic. However, the survey’s principal investigator Ullas S Kolthur and researcher Sandeep Juneja from TIFR, said they believe that the prevalence of the lifestyle disease could be more in non-slum areas, as many residents may not have given the right information. “Many may have provided incorrect information about their medical history as they may have feared that they would be quarantined or it could be due to other concerns rising out of lack of proper knowledge. There is a need for further studies to establish proper facts,” said Juneja.The sero survey was conducted in M-West (Tilak Nagar and Chembur), F-North (Matunga, Sion and Wadala) and R-North wards (Dahisar and Mandapeshwar) to detect the presence of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibody, produced by the body’s immune system on being exposed to a virus. A sero survey helps in identifying individuals who were previously infected with the virus but have later recovered. Although the estimated target was 10,000 blood samples, the only 6,936 samples were collected owing to the lack of cooperation from residents in non-slum areas. The civic body has also conducted the antibody test on 1,000 health workers, and is awaited the results.Diabetologist Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a part of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said almost 50% of patients who died of Covid-19 in Mumbai had a medical history of diabetes. “For an observation, the researchers have recorded the medical history of the participants. This can’t be considered as a parameter to base any theory,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sero-survey-in-mumbai-6-residents-in-slums-who-had-covid-19-antibodies-diabetic/story-QKOonYj0v3iegNaolih5RO.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||₹1,000-crore heroin seized at Nhava Sheva||In the biggest ever seizure of narcotic drugs in Maharashtra in recent years, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Mumbai in a joint operation with the customs department busted a major international drug cartel and seized 191 kilogram (kg) heroin, estimated to be worth around ₹1,000 crore, from Nhava Sheva port in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, sources in DRI told HT. Two people have been arrested so far.The consignment had arrived from Afghanistan and the declared cargo was of Mulethi, a traditional herb which is extensively used in several traditional ayurvedic formulations to treat respiratory problems, obesity, skin infection, liver disorders, gastric problem, hormonal regulation, etc.Packets of heroin were concealed inside the pipes in the cargo, sources part of the operation said. The seized heroin is of high quality with a market value of around ₹5 crore for each kg. Mulethi is in demand in India, especially in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, as it is used in making immunity boosting ayurvedic medicines. “There is possibility that the cartel was using this opportunity to smuggle in heroin through cargo of Mulethi. The cartel may have links with narcotic rackets in Afghanistan,” DRI sources said.Following specific information about the consignment, DRI and customs department jointly launched the operation to bust the racket. The two arrested accused are linked to the paperwork for facilitating smooth movement of the cargo. The owner of the company which had ordered the cargo is also under scanner.The two accused have been booked under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. An official said sections of the Customs Act would also be added in the case later. The accused will be produced in the court on Monday.Further investigation would be carried out by the Mumbai DRI officials.“More accused may be arrested soon and investigation will be carried out with all angles including narco-terrorism angle. Further details cannot be shared at this time as the operation is going on,” said a DRI official requesting anonymity. In July 2019, the special cell of Delhi Police had seized 130kg heroin from Nhava Sheva port and that consignment, too, had links with drug cartels in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-000-crore-heroin-seized-at-nhava-sheva/story-6JC4UyhFzVnOk1ApM8n2jM.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||In former Covid-19 hot spots of Mumbai, over 40% residents have antibodies, revealed data from private lab||Of the 8,376 samples collected across the city between July 3 and August 7 by a private lab, 2,420 or 28.89% were detected with Covid-19 antibodies.A high ratio of the antibodies was developed among citizens from Govandi (57%), Dharavi (54%), Worli (42%), Chembur Extension (48%) and Mazagaon (40%) – all of which were earlier the city’s Covid-19 hotspotsThe prevalence of Covid-19 antibodies was relatively lower in certain areas of suburbs and south Mumbai, varying between 20-40%, data from Thyrocare Technologies Limited revealed. According to data, the antibody presence was above 30% in areas within Bandra-Kurla Complex (30%), Ghatkopar West (34.59%), Mulund East (38%), Tilak Nagar (36%), Charkop (31%), Kandivli East (37%), Jogeshwari West (36%), Vikhroli (33%) and Kurla (32%). In central and south Mumbai, 38% of Sewri residents and 37% of residents from Colaba had Covid-19 antibodies, while 30% of Prabhadevi residents had antibodies. Dr A Velumani, founder and managing director of Thyrocare, said, “The virus is active in a small number of population at every geographical area regardless of the presence or absence of antibodies. The spread of the virus, however, becomes slow when the antibodies are present in around 25% of the population and the virus becomes ineffective or less effective when 50% or more citizens develop antibodies. For instance, in the case of Dharavi, our results say that over 50% of the residents who were tested, developed the antibodies, and this could be one reason for the lower number of cases which are being reported now from Dharavi as compared to what was being reported earlier.”According to Velumani, the government can give more relaxations to areas where more than 25% of the population develops antibodies.“If a body develops antibodies, it is considered to be a good sign, and based on the data on the presence of antibodies, the government can also take decisions on imposing the lockdown or easing it. I guess people develop more immunity if they are exposed more. Also, having antibodies does not mean one should not take precautions. Wherever more than 25% population has developed immunity or antibodies, I feel the government can give more relaxations. We may not open schools and colleges, but industries and services can be opened up to boost economy,” Velumani said. Commenting on the findings, Daksha Shah, deputy health officer of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) public health department, said, “I can’t comment on the findings of a private laboratory as I am not aware of the methodology it used for the tests. However, generally if a particular area has a higher number of individuals who have developed antibodies, then the spread of the virus may slow down. We have seen the same trend in the city with our findings. The slum areas are now witnessing fewer cases, as they are more individuals developing antibodies as compared to residents from non-slum areas. Currently, the maximum number of cases is from non-slum areas. Hence, when the non-slum areas start having higher presence of antibodies, the pattern of spread may change.”Earlier, the BMC also tested more than 6,900 people in its sero surveillance, in which 57% residents from slums were detected with antibodies, while 16% of residents from non-slum areas were found with the antibodies. Private health consultant, Siddarth Paliwal, said, “Our track record of conducting sero surveillance test has been poor. The BMC has conducted tests on less than 10,000 samples. We should aim to cover around 1% of the total population of the city to understand the spread of the virus. If the BMC cannot test that many people, it should tie up with private labs for the purpose.”Meanwhile on Sunday, Mumbai recorded 1,066 cases and 48 deaths, taking the city’s total case count to 123,382 and death toll to 6,799 (5.51 fatality rate). The total number of patients discharged after recovery stands at 96,586, and the city recorded a recovery rate of 78.2%. Currently, total active cases stand at 19,700. Dharavi, a former hot spot which is showing drastic improvement, recorded only five cases on Sunday, after which its total case count stands at 2,617, of which 2,271 have recovered. On Saturday, Mumbai conducted 7,561 tests. The total tests undertaken in the city surged to 5.99 lakh with an overall positivity rate of 20.4%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-former-covid-19-hot-spots-of-mumbai-over-40-residents-have-antibodies-revealed-data-from-private-lab/story-ODVhbJaF2rDo5LkcbRQl3N.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA plans green corridor along MTHL||In what can be called a much-needed intervention for the city, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has planned a green corridor along the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL), connecting Mumbai to Navi Mumbai.The “urban ecological corridor” would consist of urban forests, wetlands, mangroves, walking and bicycling trails, amusement and activity zones, eateries, cafes and children’s play areas among other attractions. It will also act as a connector to the Karnala Bird Sanctuary in Navi Mumbai. More than 75,000 trees are expected to be planted for the project.Known to be the brainchild of MMRDA metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev, the ecological corridor will stretch for 5.5 kilometre (km) on both sides of MTHL landside portion at Chirle in Navi Mumbai. The 22-km sea bridge, of which 16.5km is on sea, stretches from Sewri in Mumbai to Chirle in Navi Mumbai.Amid the raging debate over developing infrastructure at the cost of the environment, MMRDA said the ecological corridor will prove to be a “pioneering project in the field of highway ecology to achieve MMRDA’s objective of developing sensitive urban infrastructure”.Rajeev said, “Apart from increasing green cover significantly, the project will boost the liveability index, reduce pollution in the vicinity and also eliminate barrier effects.” He added that the project will be implemented in coordination with the state forest department.The project is modelled based on eco-motorway in France, Miami Metro-rail, Richmond Bridge in Virginia and Shenzhen-Huizhou Expressway in China which boast of thick green cover along the corridor.On the drawing boards since the 1980s, MMRDA started construction for MTHL in 2018, but the ₹17,843-crore project is hit by delays owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to officials, the project will face a six-month delay owing to shortage in manpower and machinery. MTHL was estimated to be operational by September 2022. However, as of June 2020, only 27% of the overall work has been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-plans-green-corridor-along-mthl/story-ix6tV3CSE5XLkvvEk5V11O.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Not Maharashtra case, but one in Patna transferred to CBI: State||Claiming that the case filed in Bihar in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Maharashtra government maintained that the Bandra police’s probe into the accidental death report (ADR) was going on. The state will oppose the transfer plea in the Supreme Court during its hearing on Tuesday. Rajput, 34, was found dead in his apartment in Bandra on June 14. A month later, his father, KK Singh, in his complaint, alleged there were some unexplained transfers from his son’s bank account, involving actor Rhea Chakraborty and others. The Patna Police then filed an FIR in the case. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is looking into the money laundering angle. The state government has, in its affidavit in the top court, contested the jurisdiction of the Patna Police in the case and pointed at the haste in which CBI registered an FIR in the case in Patna. “The Central government told the top court that it has transferred the case to the central agency, but the court has not given its nod. We have contested the registration of the FIR and its investigation by the Patna Police has been contested by us. Both the acts are bad in the law and against federal structure as well as the Ministry of Home Affairs’ circular issued in 2013,” an official from the home department said. Home minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday said the SC was yet to decide on the transfer of the case and they were awaiting the top court’s decision. The state government’s contention is that as per section 177 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), every offence has to be probed by the police in whose jurisdiction it has been committed. It has also said that the offences registered by Patna Police on the complaint of Singh have taken place in Mumbai. It has also stated the FIR registered at Patna should be transferred to Mumbai and the decision on the transfer should not be taken without the consent of Maharashtra government, as per provisions in section 3 of the Delhi Special Police Establishments Act. The affidavit submitted in the Apex court, through its standing counsel Sachin Patil on Saturday, also stated the act of filing an FIR was politically motivated and revelation of the details to the media by the investigating officers visiting Mumbai jeopardised the investigation by the Mumbai Police. The home department officials, however, are sceptical about the delay by Mumbai Police in filing an FIR in the case. “The Mumbai Police should have either converted the ADR into FIR or closed the case if it did not get any significant proof on the allegations. They did not act swiftly even after the demand for CBI probe was raised first. The act of stamping Patna DCP Vinay Tiwari [who had come to the city and was forced to home quarantine] is likely to go against us as it is seen as hindrance in their probe. Also, the precedent verdicts on transfer of probe to the CBI are contradictory,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-maharashtra-case-but-one-in-patna-transferred-to-cbi-state/story-k4ejB0cyR15Vq7wsEf7VnN.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai exceeds average annual rainfall with 50 more monsoon days to go||The city on Sunday surpassed its annual average rainfall of 2,514mm, despite little rain over the weekend. Mumbai received 2,526mm rain from June 1 to August 9, with 50 more days for the season to end on September 30.Last year, the city had crossed its annual mean tally on August 25 and received 3,670.2 mm rain over four months. In 2018, Mumbai had not crossed the annual average rainfall mark, with 2,239.6mm rain from June to September. In 2017, the city had recorded 2,946.3mm rain in the entire season.On Sunday, between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm, no rain was recorded either in the suburbs or south Mumbai. However, the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 18.4 mm rain over 24 hours (8.30am Saturday to 8.30am Sunday) while Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 6.2mm of rain.The weather bureau has issued a yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for Mumbai and Thane. “Weather models have indicated active monsoon conditions over the west coast from August 10-11 onward, with weather factors contributing to enhanced rain activity. Mumbai and surrounding areas are also likely to witness an increase in rain intensity from Tuesday onwards, through the week,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Independent experts said the city is expected to witness more frequent light to moderate showers in the coming week. “However, there won’t be any severe weather threat until August 14, beyond which there might be some rain enhancement,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.This year, the monsoon onset was declared on June 14. However, it was followed by scattered showers through the month, leading to 395mm of rain for June against its average of 493.1mm, making it the lowest monthly rainfall in five years. However, a contrast in rain activity was witnessed in July, with the month ending with 1,502.7mm rain — it’s highest monthly record since readings began being collated by the weather bureau.Subsequently, the city and suburbs had both surpassed their seasonal rainfall target on August 5. In the first seven days of August, Mumbai received more rain than it generally receives in the entire month. August rain tally stands at 628.4mm, against mean rainfall of 585.2mm.IMD classifies 15.6-64.4mm as moderate, 64.5-115.5mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, and over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain for 24 hours. Through the season, Mumbai (Santacruz observatory) witnessed seven ‘very heavy’ rain days so far (five in July and two in August) with maximum rain recorded between August 3 and 4 at 268.6mm, followed by July 4 and 5 at 200.8mm. Additionally, five ‘heavy’ rain days were recorded, with three in July and two in August.IMD director-general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said, “Mumbai’s performance in July was due to factors like the active offshore trough, embedded vortex [localised circulation], and a mid-tropospheric cyclonic system over Gujarat region. However, enhanced rain activity in August was led by the low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal region and associated weather systems over south Gujarat and the Arabian Sea, which led to intense showers helping the city break rain records.”Meanwhile, the highest 24-hour rain for weather stations in the Mumbai region was recorded in Colaba between August 5 and 6 at 332mm — the second-highest all-time monsoon rain for the region. This helped south Mumbai cross its annual average rain (2,184.1mm) last week. Rain tally for south Mumbai so far stands at 2,447.2 mm.Light to moderate rain has been predicted for Monday, and heavy rain across isolated areas is expected from Tuesday onward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-exceeds-average-annual-rainfall-with-50-more-monsoon-days-to-go/story-0suaIFalW1pvYc13Rxi3VN.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Handing over Sushant Singh’s death probe to CBI a conspiracy against state: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut slammed the Centre for handing over the death case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and claimed that the move is a “conspiracy against Maharashtra” and an attack on the state’s autonomy. The decision is taken for political gains, as a part of the pressure tactics to save somebody, because the Mumbai Police accessed some “sensational information” related to the case, the senior party leader claimed.Raut, who is the executive editor of party mouthpiece Saamana, wrote in his weekly column Rokhthok, that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politicised the case by linking a state minister with it. Pointing out at the “misuse of the central agencies” such as the CBI, the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament said that the Centre’s intervention in the case is an “insult” to the Mumbai Police. He added that though the CBI is a central agency, it has been proven time and again that it is not independent and impartial. “Many state governments banned the CBI. People in West Bengal took to the streets against the agency when it tried to intervene in the Saradha chit fund case,” the Shiv Sena leader stated in his column.Raut claimed that when Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah were also opposed to the transfer of the Godhra riots probe to the CBI when they were the chief minister and the Gujarat home minister, respectively.“Even PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah were of the same opinion about the CBI when they were active in Gujarat politics. They opposed the transfer of Godhra riots and the subsequent killings [in Gujarat in 2002]. What is wrong if the [state] expresses the same apprehension over the transfer of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case to the central agency,” he questioned.Raut also accused the BJP of defaming the state government, headed by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, with the help of a section of media. “A section of media has support from the Opposition party, which wants to destabilise the government. One channel has been using derogatory and threatening language for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. This has anguished many people, including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar,” he said.He also criticised the media for being “insensitive” over the Disha Salian death case. Salian was Rajput’s manager and reportedly died of suicide six days before the latter’s death and a section of the media has tried to draw links in the two deaths.“The Opposition has been linking state minister Aaditya Thackeray with the case only because he shares cordial relations with some of the Bollywood actors. More disturbing is the Opposition’s stand as they have stood firm in support of the Bihar Police. The Opposition and some news channels have been insensitive and inhuman about Disha Salian and her family members, who have been going through tremendous trauma,” Raut said. Raut said that Aaditya Thackeray shares cordial relations with actor Dino Morea who had hosted a party at his residence before Rajput’s death, but linking it with the case was wrong. He also raised questions over the delay in the investigation by the Mumbai Police and said that it needs to be probed if the case was used to “terrorise” Bollywood. “Sensing the high-profile character of the case, they [the police] should have ensured briefing of the case to the media every day. By inviting Bollywood stars to record statements, the police gave room to gossips,” the column read.Later on Sunday, Raut told reporters that the state has “information” which will be revealed at an “appropriate time.” “It appears that the screenplay of the entire Sushant episode was pre-determined. We have firm information that to save somebody from being exposed in the case and to put pressure on the police, the conspiracy is being hatched. We will reveal the information at an appropriate time,” he said. “The Thackeray government is trying to save one person and it is sinking in the quicksand of lies, every day. I only want to say that if they do not respect the Supreme Court order [to hand over the probe to CBI], then it is not going to take time to suspend the entire state government,’’ said BJP MLA and leader Atul Bhatkhalkar. Bhatkhalkar had sent a letter to chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday asking him to suspend the two police officers investigating the case. He also demanded that the city police chief Param Bir Singh be sent on mandatory leave for negligence in the case. The BJP has been consistently demanding a CBI probe in the Rajput case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/handing-over-sushant-singh-s-death-probe-to-cbi-a-conspiracy-against-state-sanjay-raut/story-gusqQ4kwTy1Io5424538DJ.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||3 kidnap, rape 15-year-old in moving car, held||Mankhurd police on Saturday arrested three people for allegedly kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl in a moving car on July 29. According to the police, the girl was walking on the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd link road around 11am, when a silver-coloured car intercepted her and the occupants inside it pulled her inside and drove off. In her statement, the survivor told the police that though she attempted to get out of the car, the accused overpowered her and kept driving. When they reached somewhere between Chembur and Wadala, the accused touched her inappropriately and threatened her with dire consequences if she opposed their act. They then gang raped her in the moving car and dropped her near the Eastern Express Highway. Before letting her go, they threatened to kill her if she disclosed the incident to anyone. Senior police inspector Prakash Chougule, from Mankhurd police station, said, “The survivor went home and shared the incident with her aunt, after which they approached us to file a complaint. We then registered a first information report and conducted the investigations. The survivor and accused are not known to each other. Based on technical intelligence, the three accused were arrested from Mankhurd. Two of the accused are aged 25, while the third one is 24 years old. The police charged the trio under sections 376 (punishment for rape), 376 (D) (gang rape), 376 (3) (commits rape on a woman under sixteen years of age), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 (A) (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault), 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-kidnap-rape-15-year-old-in-moving-car-held/story-A8TyElxjKNguXOfMXWhC5J.html
10-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s lake level up to 50% but water cuts remain||reWith a good amount of rainfall in Mumbai and its surrounding catchment areas in the past week, the useful water content in the seven lakes supplying water to the city rose to 50.53% on Sunday. However, the level is lower than that of 2019 and 2018, when at this time, the total lake levels were at 91.48% and 85.08%, respectively.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) already levied a 20% water cut since August 5. In a statement released a week ago, BMC said it is imposing the water cut in order to ensure that there is enough water supply until July 31, 2021. BMC had appealed to citizens to use water wisely, and avoid its wastage. It had earlier decided to impose water cuts from August 1, but it was postponed owing to festivals during the first three days of the month.In 2014, BMC had imposed a water cut of 25% followed by 20% in 2015-2016. Later, in 2018, the civic body had imposed a 10% water cut followed by no water cut in 2019 owing to good rainfall in catchment areas.A BMC official from the hydraulics department said, “Two lakes – Tulsi and Vehar – have overflowed but both contribute to only 3-4% of the city’s annual requirement. Hence, filling the other five lakes is equally important. The remaining five lakes including Tansa, Bhatsa, Modak Sagar, Upper Vaitarna and Middle Vaitarna are half full, and we are hopeful that in the coming days the rainfall is sufficient in the catchment areas.Of the total required rainfall for the year, 15% is expected in June, 35% in July and August, followed by 15% in September. The civic body manages to supply 3,750 million liters of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million liters.According to data shared by the BMC, the seven lakes supplying water to the city have 7.31 lakh million litres or 50.53% as recorded on Friday against the full capacity which is around 14.47 lakh million litres. The Bhatsa dam, which caters to 55% of the city’s total water requirement, stood at 52% of the total capacity compared to 88.25% at this time in 2019. The lake level has gone up from 34% to 50% in the last 20 days owing to heavy rainfall in the city and surrounding areas.Meanwhile, the seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems — the Vaitarna system supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs.

10-08-2020||Mumbai||‘Captain Sathe: Air India’s all-rounder pilot’||While wing commander Deepak Sathe’s mortal remains were brought to the city on Sunday, his colleagues from Air India recalled their “all-rounder pilot” who died in the plane crash in Kozhikode on Friday. The mortal remains were taken to the morgue of Bhabha Hospital in Kurla, as the funeral will be held on Tuesday, after Sathe’s elder son who works in Seattle reaches Mumbai. The Air India Express plane with 190 on board from Dubai overshot Karipur’s table top runway and dropped about 35ft into a gorge, killing at least 19. As Captain Sathe’s wife, his younger son, sister and brother-in-law reached the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) around 3pm with the mortal remains, at least 100 pilots, cabin crew, management and other members of both the airlines – Air India and Air India Express – gathered at gate 5, Air India’s triangular plot as a mark of respect. The family had flown down from Mumbai to Kozhikode after hearing of the mishap. “We are not able to sleep since Friday night,” said an AI pilot, requesting anonymity. “I consider myself to be privileged that I got to work with Captain Sathe, who was extremely good with his decision-making.” “All of us have been disturbed after the accident. Anyone of us could have been in the cockpit. We hope to know what went wrong,” said an Air India Express pilot. Another senior Air India pilot said, “Captain Sathe and I have been together since NDA days and he had always given his best in his work. He was the person with great precision.” Members close to the family said that the elder son has left San Francisco on Sunday and is expected to land in Delhi by 4pm on Monday. He will then take a connecting flight to Mumbai and is expected to be home by Monday night. “The time of the funeral will be decided once he reaches Mumbai,” said one of the airline employees close to the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/captain-sathe-air-india-s-all-rounder-pilot/story-ndMhuxr45ayYyzUXkbYQ8I.html

10-08-2020||Delhi||Facebook, Delhi, Mumbai cops join hands to save man from taking his life||A coordinated effort between an Ireland-based official of a social networking site, Facebook, and officers of Delhi and Mumbai police on Saturday helped saving the life of a man in Mumbai who was allegedly contemplating to take his own life.The man, a resident of east Delhi, had gone to Mumbai after having an argument with his wife a fortnight ago. He started working as a cook in a hotel and living in a rented home in Bhayandar area, a suburb of Mumbai, said the officers in Delhi Police. The incident started around 7.51pm on Saturday, when deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime unit, CyPAD) Anyesh Roy got a call from Ireland. The operation lasted for around five hours and it involved as many as 50 officers from various units, including cyber crime cells of the Delhi and Mumbai Police. It all started at 7.51 pm on Saturday, “The caller, a Facebook official, informed me that their systems have identified activity that could be deemed alarming on a Facebook account belonging to a Delhi resident. She sent the details of the account on my official email. The details were that a woman’s Facebook account and had a mobile number registered with it,” said DCP Roy. Roy and his team immediately got cracking and traced the address attached to the phone number provided. The information was passed to DCP (east) Jasmeet Singh, who immediately sent the SHO of Madhu Vihar to the said address.“Our team was relieved when they found that the owner of the phone number, a woman, was completely fine and oblivious of the hue and cry that her Facebook account had caused,” said DCP Singh. But panic soon returned after the woman, on further enquiry, told the police that her Facebook account was being used by her husband, who had left for Mumbai a fortnight ago following an argument they had. She gave the police his contact number but was unaware of his residential address and the hotel in Mumbai where he was working as a cook.DCP Roy next got in touch with his counterpart in Mumbai -- Bal Singh Rajput and Dr. Rashmi Karandikar, DCP (Cyber, Mumbai). A team was formed to trace the man’s location, “Through technical assistance, our team members managed to get the man’s alternate phone number and his location was traced to Bhayandar area. I spoke to the man, who was in psychological distress and crying, and counselled him, even as a local police team rushed to the address. Around 1 am, the local police found the man safe,” said DCP Karandikar, when contacted on phone. “I am happy that we could save the man’s life. We are thankful to Facebook, its official in Ireland who alerted us on time about the man’s suicidal tendency and to the Delhi Police official, who in turn informed us about it. The operation was tough because we had limited information. The end result was heartening,” she added. A spokesperson for Facebook said, “We want Facebook to be a platform where everyone feels safe and empowered to communicate. Our Community Standards include policies on self injury or suicide. We have built these policies and enforcement approach with help from experts in suicide prevention and safety. When there’s risk of imminent harm, we work with emergency responders who can help. We also provide people who have expressed suicidal thoughts, or are worried for friends with such tendencies, with support options and resources.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/facebook-delhi-mumbai-cops-join-hands-to-save-man-from-taking-his-life/story-QStCmsoXD8EMtlYHvPTodJ.html

In one month from July to August (till August 7), the state has witnessed a 17 per cent drop in recovery rate. On July 7, the recovery rate in the state was 81 per cent while it has come down to 63.42 per cent now. The recovery rate in the state is 4 per cent lesser than the national average. The three hilly districts of Rudraprayag, Almora and Tehri have recorded highest recovery rates in the state, while Udham Singh Nagar and Pithoragarh have recorded the lowest recovery rate. Anoop Nautiyal, from NGO Social Development for Communities Foundation, who has been analysing the Covid-19 data in the state said that hills are performing better in terms of recovery in the state, as opposed to the plains. “Recovery rates have dropped by 17 per cent during the last one month. On July 7 the recovery rate in the state was 81 per cent compared to 64 per cent on August 7. In general, hill districts have much higher recovery rates than plain districts in the state. However, the recovery rates in Haridwar have improved to 59 per cent from the lows of 33 per cent around two weeks ago on July 23,” said Nautiyal. Meanwhile, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Saturday during a review meeting on Covid-19 epidemic situation in the state with district magistrates and health department, released guidelines for home isolation of Covid-19 patients in Uttarakhand. “Home-isolation should be arranged as per the advice of doctors, following all the norms, however, priority should be given to treatment in hospitals and Covid-19 care centres instead of home-isolation,” said the chief minister. He added that testing of samples should be increased even more. The state has so far tested over 2.05 lakh samples while 9,200 results are awaited. “The surveillance system needs to be strengthened further in the state. Elderly, children and people with co-morbidities should leave their houses only when it is very necessary. Every effort should be made to improve the Covid-19 recovery rate and reduce the death rate in the state,” said Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/covid-19-cases-rise-in-uttarakhand-recovery-rate-plunges-by-17-per-cent/story-AQDRc4yqHpGjcl0eGCB39M.html

Three pistols and 10 cartridges were recovered from them, they said.One of them, identified as 36-year-old Rishi Raj alias Lambu, had been extorting jewellers and property dealers in areas of southwest Delhi such as Najafgarh and Bindapur and would demand protection money, said senior police officers.“His associates, on his direction, would fire at shops and make extortion demands. His gang had committed three back-to-back firing and extortion attempts at two prominent jewellery showrooms in Najafgarh and a property dealer’s office in Bindapur on June 23. Two persons involved in the firing incidents were later arrested after a brief shootout on July 1,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse.DCP Alphonse said that Raj was wanted in a case registered under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). “A reward of ₹1 lakh was announced on Raj’s arrest,” said the DCP, adding that the other arrested man, 10-year-old Love Kumar Tomar was wanted by the Uttar Pradesh Police in a murder case and was previously involved in eight crimes.In December last year, the DCP said, Tomar’s friend Nishu was allegedly murdered by his step-mother and her brother over some dispute at their village in Uttar Pradesh’s Baraut . Tomar decided to take revenge and, within a fortnight, he and his associates went to the village and opened fire at the duo, killing the woman and injuring her brother.“While his associates were arrested by the UP Police, Tomar had been evading his arrest since then. He is a close associate of Raj and supplies illegal firearms and ammunition to him,” DCP Alphonse said.Officials said that Raj and Tomar were arrested on Saturday morning after they received a tip. Raj’s interrogation, an officer said, revealed that he was first arrested in 2004 in a theft case.In 2019 while lodged in Bhondsi jail, Raj came in contact with gangster Naresh Shetty and they planned to extort jewellers and property dealers in Najafgarh and adjoining areas. After Raj came out of jail early this year, Shetty arranged his key associates for him and execute the extortions.“The associates of Shetty and Raj fired at the showrooms to terrorise the owners. They used to throw paper slips containing names of the gang leaders and demanded ₹1 core or ₹50 lakh as protection money,” said an officer from the team that arrested Raj and Tomar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-wanted-men-arrested-for-terrorising-najafgarh-businesses/story-2PKclu9PphXUQA1ub6OdRK.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||Man rapes 16-yr-old girl in Delhi’s Netaji Subhash Place, arrested after three days on run||A 16-year-old girl was raped and attacked by a man known to her in northwest Delhi’s Netaji Subhash Place on Wednesday, a day after another 12-year-old had been sexually violated and brutally attacked in Paschim Vihar.The condition of the Paschim Vihar rape victim is stated to be critical as she undergoes treatment in AIIMS.In the Netaji Subhash Place case, police said they had arrested a 24-year-old suspect from northwest Delhi after three days of search. The man, police claimed, had taken the victim to a private hospital after the crime, got her admitted there and fled. The girl’s condition is out of danger, the police said on Sunday.Investigators said the suspect is a driver by profession and lives in the same neighbourhood where the girl lives with her parents. He had befriended the girl through a social networking site. The girl in her statement has told the police that she knew him for the past one month, said a police officer, quoting the girl’s statement.On Wednesday morning, the officer said, the suspect contacted the girl on her cellphone and told her that he wanted to meet, but she refused. Around 2pm, he came to her home and managed to convince her to come to his house on he pretext of discussing something with her.“At his home, he pushed her and raped her. When the girl sustained injuries and started bleeding, he panicked and took her to a private hospital, where the girl informed her mother on phone. He fled, even as the girl’s mother reached the hospital,” the officer, quoting her statement, said. The girl’s mother later informed her husband and they shifted their daughter to a government hospital, where she underwent a surgery.Police statistics show that 636 cases of rape were registered in Delhi till June 30 this year. Though, this figure is 338 cases less than what was reported during the same period last year, it is still alarming in a city that is infamous as the rape capital of India.

10-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi Fire Service hires 500 personnel on contract||For the first time, Delhi Fire Service (DFS) is hiring private firefighters on contract to make up for the lack of manpower. On Monday, 500 professionals from a private firm, trained in firefighting and carrying out rescue operations, will join the DFS, top officials said.Senior officers from the department said all the 500 personnel are trained and match the DFS’s standards of training in firefighting. The 500 were selected through a stringent process, they said.Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service, said a firefighter should be able to bravely, and at the same time efficiently react to a situation when lives are at stake. “Even though these new cadets have been hired after a detailed process to check their proficiency in firefighting, they will be under continuous supervision of senior officers,” Garg said.Garg said this is the first time that DFS is hiring private firefighters. “It is a temporary arrangement. Despite recruiting around 600 men last year, we were still short of 706 firefighters. With these 500 men, we will be able to fill more than 80% of our vacancies.The process of recruitment is also underway. Because it is a long process, these contractual employees will fill in till the time the government’s recruitment is completed,” he said.“These men will play role of support staff for us. While our regular firefighters have a 24-hour shift, the contractual staff will have only eight-hour shift. We will provide them with all the safety gear, uniforms and other equipment when they’re at work. They will also assist our staff in maintenance of equipment and conducting awareness programmes,” Garg said.He said the contractual firefighters have been taken from the private firm, Digitek, via GEM (government e-market place) - a central government owned e-portal where common user goods and services can be procured. The DFS will pay the Digitek which will pay salary to its staff, he added.Former chief of Delhi Fire Service, AK Sharma, who led the department for six years between 2010 and 2016, said it is a good way to fill in for pending vacancies. “Since these professionals are already trained the training part is also done away with which saves DFS’s time and resources. DFS requires skilled professionals which have not been provided for long time. If the manpower requirement is being met using other avenues there’s no harm in this,” Sharma said.Officials at the Digitek did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-fire-service-hires-500-personnel-on-contract/story-cG0EtT3mVBaKCpxTio1iHJ.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||In revamped Delhi unit, AAP to have more workers on the ground||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday appointed new communication in charge in all seven Lok Sabha segments in the city, along with presidents and coordinators in 14 districts demarcated by the party and observers in all 70 assembly segments.The AAP had announced a comprehensive revamp of the party unit in Delhi with focus on the municipal elections which are due in 2022.“The restructuring of the party’s organisational structure is being done in the light of the municipal elections in 2022. Volunteers and party workers have been shortlisted on the basis of their performance in the 2020 assembly polls and covid management,” said Gopal Rai, the party’s Delhi convener and employment minister in the Delhi government.While the AAP has won three consecutive terms in Delhi government, it has failed to unseat the Bharatiya Janata Party in the three municipal corporations.Rai said the revamp exercise is being done in three phases. In the first phase, the party appointed presidents and coordinators in all 14 political districts, communication in charge in all seven Lok Sabha segments and observers in 70 assembly segments in the city.“In the second and third phases, more office bearers would be appointed in the 70 assembly segments and 272 wards in the city,” said Rai, adding that the primary agenda would be local civic issues, anti-corruption and the quality of primary education in schools under the municipal corporations.On Sunday, Rai announced names of those appointed under the first phase of the exercise.The Lok Sabha segment communications in charge and the district presidents would report directly to the top leadership of the party, of which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is the national convener. Assembly segment observers would report to the communications in-charge of the Lok Sabha segment concerned – each seven of them have 10 assembly segments under them. The district coordinators are primarily entrusted with being a helping hand to the presidents, senior AAP functionaries explained.As communication in charge in Lok Sabha segment, the party appointed Neeraj Kaushik (north-east), RR Pathania (north-west), Ranjit Singh (East), Vinod Kumar Piplani (New Delhi), Dipankar Pandey (South), Anil Malik (West) and Sandeep Lohan (Chandni Chowk).The appointed district presidents Narender Kumar (Karawal Nagar), Shahnawaz (Babarpur), Raj Shokeen (Badli), Dhanmender Kumar (Rohini), Munish Kaushik (Patparganj), Dr Sanjit Acharya (Shahdara), Dr Yuvraj Bharadwaj (Karol Bagh), Ramesh Jhankar (New Delhi), Rita Dagar Godara (Mehrauli), Dharmraj Bharti (Sangam Vihar), Alok Singh (Tilak Nagar), Surender Lakhda (Najafgarh), Sanjay Garg (Adarsh Nagar) and Zakir Khan (Chandni Chowk).Praveen Rai, political analyst with the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said: “Avoiding confrontational politics with the top BJP leadership over the past few years, has already yielded dividends for the AAP. So the fight in the next municipal elections is likely to be tough. But, one must also note, the BJP has a very strong grassroots presence. For the AAP, the best thing now would be to ensure that the grassroots workers in the assembly, district and ward levels go door-to-door highlighting how their development agenda can help resolve civic issues under the municipal corporation’s domain and stress on the work which the AAP government in Delhi has done in Covid management. That can give them an edge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-revamped-delhi-unit-aap-to-have-more-workers-on-the-ground/story-2zEsx7IBq7RaX4EnfrxJrI.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police promise promotion to junior cops for tracing missing children||The Delhi Police have announced quick promotions to constables and head constables who will find missing children in a bid to incentivise and encourage efforts at reversing the trend of disappearance of kids in the national Capital. According to a report by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) released last year, 17 children go missing every day in Delhi and at least two of them remain untraced. As per police statistics, at least 22,567 children went missing in 2019 from across the city, of whom police traced 12,996(57.58%).To remedy the situation, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava on Friday issued an order, saying any constable or head constable who finds at least 50 missing children aged below 14 (of whom at least 15 children younger must be eight-years-old) in a year would be eligible for an out-of-turn promotion. HT has seen the order.  On Sunday, Shrivastava also tweeted about it. “In the last two months only, 724 children aged below 18 years, have gone missing. Of these 537 have been rescued. Those police officers who rescue 50 missing children in 12 months will be given out of turn promotions. It will help in preventing such crimes,” the commissioner tweeted in Hindi.Usually, constables are eligible for promotion after five years in service, that too only if they clear a test. If the person does not take the test, it takes around 10 years to become a head constable.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that two months ago, Shrivastava told the force that finding missing children must be a top priority at all police stations. During the weekly law and order meetings, all district police chiefs are asked about the untraced kids and the recovery rate of missing children in their area. “Of 724 children who went missing in June and July this year, we have traced 537. This recovery rate [over 74%] is far higher than the average. It will only increase after this initiative. The annual recovery rate is always around 50℅ every year,” the officer said. The police chief in his order also said those who recover at least 15 missing children below 14 years (of whom five children are less than eight-years-old) in a year, they would be considered for the Asadharan Karya Puraskar (AKP). Officials said the emphasis is on children below 8 because though more children -- especially those in their teens are reported missing -- the young ones(below 8) fall prey to trafficking gangs. In many cases police have found that those between 15-18 often leave homes on their own and refuse to return when traced by the police. The AKP is a medal awarded to city police personnel that also carries a cash reward of Rs 20,000. It is awarded to those who go beyond their line of duty by risking their lives or cracking complex cases.Many police officials said the initiative is intended to be a morale booster, because it takes several years for a constables or head constable to be promoted. Retired Delhi police officer Amod Kanth, who also runs Prayas — an NGO for children, said, “This initiative can get remarkable results because investigating missing children can help in recovering most. There is an award system among the police to track proclaimed offenders (fugitives), which has yielded remarkable results. This shows that a similar system will help in tracking children.”Proclaimed offenders are those declared fugitives by a court. In some cases, they carry a reward for their arrest. Sanjay Gupta, director, Chetna, an NGO that works for children’ welfare, said such incentives were welcome and would likely lead to an improvement in the number of missing children rescued from across the country. “If officials are encouraged, then we are sure to have a better rescue chances in missing cases. However, when being evaluated, all aspects of a police personnel’s work on the case should be considered. The case does not end at rescue, the police is also responsible for taking such cases to its fruitful end. An official should be judged on their overall performance in such a case; from filing the case report to sensitivity in handling the rescued children and busting the culprits,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-promise-promotion-to-junior-cops-for-tracing-missing-children/story-YStzkDQwTSdvjVOCWpX2hM.html
10-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi University kicks off online exams amid digital divide concerns||From arranging power backup to borrowing mobile devices, from moving to relatives or friends’ houses to planning a visit to neighbourhood cyber cafes, students of Delhi University (DU) are taking several measures to appear for the online open-book exams (OBE), which will begin Monday as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite opposition from students and teachers, the University will conduct the exams between August 10 and August 31 for 240,000 final year students, including those enrolled with the School of Open Learning (SoL) and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). The University on Friday got the green signal from the Delhi high court to conduct the online tests. Amal K Simon, a final-year student of Ramjas College, said he and his friends are stuck in parts of rain-hit districts in Kerala and have tried to make arrangements to ensure their exams are not hindered. “Many of us have arranged power banks for mobile phones, because we face regular power cuts due to the rain. Many of my friends have moved to their relatives or friends’ houses in the city for better internet connectivity. I will go to my friend’s house on Monday morning because they have power backup and Wi-Fi,” he said.  Upon the HC’s directions, the University will give students four hours to complete the examination. Students will, within this time, have to download question papers, complete the test and scan and upload the answer scripts. Students with disabilities will get two additional hours to complete the exam instead of one. However, many students remain concerned over the feasibility of the exams. Mohit (who goes by a single name), 21, a final-year BA (prog) student at SoL, said the poor internet connectivity at his Sangam Vihar home does not allow him to even upload and email answer scripts. “I do not have a laptop at home, so I will either go to a cyber cafe or borrow my neighbour’s laptop,” he said. Hitesh Sharma, 20, a final-year student of BA (Hons) in Political Science at Rajdhani College, said he is stuck at his house in Jammu’s Kathua district. “We only get 2G connectivity here. It takes us so long to even download pictures on WhatsApp. How will I download the question paper and upload the answer scripts from here? My parents have not allowed me to go to the common service centre (CSC) due to the prevailing situation,” he said. CSCs are facilities created under the ministry of electronics and information technology for users to access government services online. Despite several attempts, DU dean of examination Vinay Gupta did not respond for comment. A member of the University’s examination department, who asked not to be named, said, “The university is prepared for the smooth conduct of the online examinations. We have appointed nodal officers in all colleges who will assist students. Students can approach them for help throughout the exam. The colleges and departments also have their separate email IDs, on which students can directly send PDFs of their answer scripts. Additionally, in case students are unable to reach these officials, the university has also issued a centralised email ID to help them out.” The official added that the OBE is “purely optional”. “It’s an opportunity for students to complete their course at the earliest. Students who can’t take the exams now will get an opportunity later to appear in the usual pen-and-paper exam.” Several colleges in the university also said they expect some students to make use of their information and communications technology (ICT) facilities during the exams. Pratyush Vatsala, principal, Lakshmibai College, said, “Some staff members will be in college from tomorrow to help students via email or over calls. We have also set up an OBE control room to assist students. We have received some requests from students for the college’s ICT facility to upload their question papers.” The University had asked the college principals to get applications from students who need ICT infrastructure for the exams. The students can inform the colleges beforehand and visit the campus to use their facilities. Some students, however, said they will still be left out. Deepak Gupta, 23, a visually impaired student pursuing and MA in English from St Stephen’s College said he could not arrange for a scribe. “I am stuck at home [in Bihar’s Rohtas district] due to the lockdown. The University administration had said they can only arrange scribes for students in Delhi. I could not find anyone to help me write an exam here. I have already cleared the PhD entrance test for IIT Delhi. I am scared of losing this opportunity due to the delay in getting my masters degree,” he said. DU faculty members too expressed apprehensions about the process. Pankaj Garg, an associate professor at Rajdhani College, said, “Students have faced a lot of problems in downloading question papers and uploading the answer scripts during the mock tests. Even though the university said it will conduct another round of exams for students who will not be able to attend now, their results will get delayed, which might affect many opportunities for them.” DU teachers association (DUTA) member Abha Dev Habib said, “Not even half of the students could register online during the mock tests and the university is still going ahead and conducting the exams. We just hope our students do not get demoralised if they aren’t able to write the exams now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-kicks-off-online-exams-amid-digital-divide-concerns/story-oed8ljy4FSvha3TMZD9x7I.html
10-08-2020||City||Cycling in Delhi rides high in Covid-19 era, but safety still a concern||Vipin Bhati (25), who works with a private firm in Delhi, is part of a cycling group and loves to ride long distances. Over the years, he has learnt how to negotiate high-speed traffic on roads, but many in his group find it difficult. “Negotiating high-speed traffic, especially at intersections, is difficult. While more people are cycling now, road safety is a concern,” he said. Delhi’s streets have seen a surge in cycle-use since lockdown norms were relaxed in mid-May, and increase that has brought provisions for cyclists’ safety under the scanner. Transport experts and cycling enthusiasts said measures should be taken to ensure the safety of cyclists and turn the “craze” into a “culture”. Shreya Gadepalli, who leads the South Asia Programme of Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), said, “Cities should create a safe infrastructure for cyclists, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19.” A survey conducted by her team in May 2020 shows a 50-65% increase in cycling after the lockdown, especially for work trips. In response to strong citizen interest in cycling, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry in July this year launched the India Cycles4Change Challenge in association with the ITDP India Programme. While the Delhi government and other government agencies have planned projects to provide safe infrastructure to pedestrians and cyclists or NMTs on city roads, experts push for quick-fix measures to capture the trend. Pop-up bike lanes, traffic calming measures etc can be used to transform the roads and streets into safe zones for cyclists. World over cities such as Berlin, Milan, London, Rome and Paris have created pop-up bike lanes during Covid pandemic either by painting the lane or just by putting bollards along the length of the roads. Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India, “Dedicated lanes for cyclists along arterial roads should be developed. These pop-up bike lanes can be easily created like it. We, too, have been creating these dedicated pathways for years during monsoon for Kanwariyas. All we have to do is make it a permanent feature on our roads.” But government agencies currently have no plans for such immediate solutions. “As of now, we don’t have any plan to provide such solutions. We are working on redesigning seven arterial roads where adequate infrastructure will be created for pedestrians and cyclists,” said a senior official with the government’s Public Works Department. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently announced that the government will redesign 500 km of 100-foot-wide roads on the lines of those in European cities. The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) had started its ‘Smart Cycle’ sharing project in December 2018 with 500 bikes and 50 stations, and officials said demand has been returning to normal levels in the past two-and-a-half-months. “We were renting around 350 bikes (trips) daily during weekdays before the lockdown was imposed. Now, around 250 bikes are rented a day, which is almost 75% of our demand before the lockdown,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. Similarly, in Vasant Kunj C4, several residents use the electric bikes by Yulu, which has set up around 70 zones around Metro stations and residential neighbourhoods. Aashish Sharmaa, joint secretary of Vasant Villas RWA in Vasant Kunj, said, “These are easy to use. Earlier, we used to take our cars to the local market. But now we can use this. It is an environment-friendly way of commuting.” Currently, there is around 100km of cycling infrastructure in the city, developed by various government agencies. But most of it lies in a state of neglect. The 10-12km stretch between Chhattarpur and Delhi-Gurugram border, for instance, has become mostly unusable due to waste strewn about and unrepaired effects of wear and tear. Vedpal, Aya Nagar councillor and a cycling enthusiast, said apart from the local villagers, there is a large number of people belonging to economically weaker sections who work in the service industry as guards, housekeeping, etc in the commercial establishments situated in the area or neighbouring Gurugram. “But people have to cycle on the main road and risk their lives. If this track is maintained well, it can benefit so many people,” Vedpal said. When contacted, a senior PWD official said, “We will get it checked and get the repair work done wherever it is required.” A Delhi government spokesperson said, “We want to develop the infrastructure for cycling in a planned manner. We have recently awarded work for redesigning 60km of roads where cycling infrastructure will be developed similar to what you have in European cities. Similar infrastructure will be developed on 500kms of road length in the next few years. There are 3-4 stretches where work to create NMT lanes is going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cycling-in-delhi-rides-high-in-covid-era-but-safety-still-a-concern/story-ZyYEyYNu1aBTJnlBplHSHN.html
10-08-2020||Pune||DY Patil Dental college asks fourth-year students to appear in-person for final exams||In an order that came as a surprise to students, the management at the D Y Patil dental college in Pimpri have asked 83 fourth year students to return back to campus and appear for the final year exams later this month. The college has scheduled exams beginning from August 24 and have asked students to be quarantined before appearing for them. The students were asked to arrive in Pune on Sunday, August 9 to and be quarantined for 14 days. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageStudents have also been asked to conduct a Covid test before leaving their respective state. However, the students have opposed this decision and demanded online exams. On the other hand the Shiv Sena’s youth wing – Yuva Sena has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court about the final year exams issue and the verdict is expected to be out today. The students have requested the college authorities to wait until the court’s order. The students have written a letter to the state government which is signed digitally by 63 students out of the 83 final year students. The letter says, “Pune has become an epicentre of the pandemic in India. Going to such a place makes us highly susceptible to the virus. We all have to take precautions and nothing is 100 per cent safe, but the college has not told our parents of alternatives and management strategies they have in case someone gets infected. Can the college handle 100 people in isolation? Interns there have been asked to leave due to the rising number of cases. Why is it different for us? Mess, accommodation, transportation are a few of the many things to be dealt with. Even if we are as careful as possible, our parents aren’t ready to leave us due to understandable reasons.” Students studying in the college come from across the country, one of the protesting student who hails from Delhi and does not wish to be named said, “Since we have got the notification about the final year exam from the college all of us have raised our various concerns before several government authorities and demanded for online exams. We are watching the news daily about the Covid condition in Pune it is very risky to travel to Pune right now. Even my parents are not allowing me to travel and so I have stayed back in Delhi.” Dr D Gopalakrishnan, dean of DY Patil dental college and hospital said, “We are also concerned about students’ safety and for that, a special Covid task force is made in our college as per WHO guidelines. Accordingly, all the exams are being held in our college and students have been asked to do a Covid test before joining back on campus. The decision to conduct exams is for the best interest of the students and for the last two months we are working on safety measures inside the college campus. Students have been given an option; those who do not want to appear for exams now can give it six months later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dy-patil-dental-college-asks-fourth-year-students-to-appear-in-person-for-final-exams/story-ZMVShY29m5vA5kqFqPitqN.html

10-08-2020||Pune||Pune district still awaits new collector, five days after Ram’s transfer order||The state government has not taken a call on the appointment of a new district collector for Pune, which is one of the worst-affected by Covid-19 pandemic, even five days after the transfer order of outgoing district collector Naval Kishore Ram came in. The Centre on August 4 issued transfer orders for Ram to join the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as deputy secretary, leaving his post vacant. While Ram has stopped coming to office after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar felicitated him on Friday, the administration is awaiting a new collector. Ram, a 2008-batch IAS officer, was appointed the district collector in April 2018. According to senior officials in the Maharashtra government, the announcement of the new collector is likely to be made in two days. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the appointment of the new collector will be made this week. “The deputy chief minister is well aware of the situation and he has clearly said that by Monday or Tuesday, the new collector will be appointed in Pune,” said Rao, who has also served as Pune district collector for over three years.Among those being considered for the post are Dr Rajesh Deshmukh, managing director at Haffkine and Yogesh Mhase, chief executive officer of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada). Mhase was recently transferred to Mhada from the Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation Limited where he was the managing director. Other names being considered for the post are Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC); Suhas Diwase, Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) commissioner and G Shreekant, district collector of Latur. For the new district collector in Pune, one of the biggest challenges will be to rein in the rising Covid cases in the rural areas, which has started witnessing a spike in positives, especially after the lockdown was lifted. As of August 9, Pune’s rural areas recorded 8,183 positive cases and 209 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-district-still-awaits-new-collector-five-days-after-ram-s-transfer-order/story-X9QLREQT7gJFoScxnTL0IJ.html
10-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s Sancheti hospital gifts artificial limb to three-legged cow||In one-of-a-kind case, a three-legged cow from Chaufula, a village near Pune was gifted an artificial leg by the city-based Sancheti Hospital. The operation was conducted by a team of doctors at Sancheti hospital on August 2. The weak-looking abandoned cow was rescued by a shelter home for animals in Chaufula. The villagers then approached the prosthetic and orthotics department which makes artificial limbs for humans. The hospital operated on the animal and even offered free of cost treatment. Salil Jain, head of prosthetics and orthotics department at Sancheti Hospital where the operation took place, said, “We took measurements for the leg around two weeks back. My team studied the anatomy of the cow and then prepared the design for the leg. Designing for heavy animals is more difficult. The cow is able to stand and is walking slowly now. But it will take at least a month’s time for her to get adjusted with the artificial leg. Also, we are monitoring her movements and progress with the new leg.”Amar Jagtap, a farmer from a nearby village, who approached the hospital, said, “I often visit the shelter home for animals in Chaufula village. When I saw the cow she was very weak and she was having difficulty in walking too. After seeing her unfortunate situation, I thought of approaching the hospital. Other villagers also supported me. Now, we are examining the cow daily. We are informing about her daily movements to the hospital staff. I want to see her fit and walking with her four legs.”When asked about how difficult it is to perform the procedure on animals, Jain said, “Performing it on the animal is like doing it on a child. The animals cannot talk to you. You have to observe the animal for hours to see whether the animal has accepted the artificial limb or not and what kind of difficulties it is facing while walking. There is a need for more research in the field of prosthetics for animals. With such cases, we would be able to do more research and we can then perform them on more such needy animals in the future.”Parag Sancheti, chairman, Sancheti Institute of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation said, “The prosthetics are quite common on humans, they are very rarely performed on animals. Prosthetics for heavy animals is an uncommon thing and challenging task. Many trials and errors are needed for performing it on the animal. Around two years back, we had done it on a donkey with three legs. When we got success with the donkey, this year we voluntarily did it to help a cow. We wish to help more animals with similar issues.” Meanwhile, many animal rights activists have commended the hospital’s voluntary act. The activists mentioned that more and more research should be done to make prosthetics for animals. Manilal Valliyate, CEO PETA India, an animal rights organisation said, “We commend the hospital to extend the care for animals too. Prosthetic legs are tricky for large, heavy animals. Care must be taken to ensure it can suitably balance weight, however, this cow clearly has many well-wishers and so it appears that care will be extended to ensure her comfort. More such initiatives are needed in the country to ensure care for animals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sancheti-hospital-gifts-artificial-limb-to-three-legged-cow/story-ZyEkXS49WPciBV5EXsdmPK.html

Pune, with a population of 31.3 lakh according to the 2011 census, has reported total 1,516 deaths till Saturday, as per the data.The city’s overall case fatality rate is now 2.3 per cent, while the district’s case fatality rate is 2.28% and the state’s average is 3.4%.Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner, said, “The city’s case fatality rate is rising, but we hope that the number of cases will stabilise by August 25. However, the real worry is the rural parts of Pune where the case fatality rate is rising and the health infrastructure is poor, especially critical health care.”Rao also pointed out that the two jumbo facilities coming up at College of Engineering Pune (COEP) and Annasaheb Magar ground, will each ease the burden on existing health infrastructure.To bring down the number of deaths the PMC has even started an app, iHealWell. The app is dedicated to critical patients and shows real-time updates about the patients’ line of treatment which is later informed to the patients’ relatives by the PMC.The civic body also hopes that this will bring in more transparency to the billing system and the relatives will know the exact line of treatment and medications given to patients, which can be crossed checked during payment.After complaints from hospitals that this is an added pressure, additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal informed, “It is just for critical patients so if one hospital has five ICU beds then they need to fill in the information for only those five patients which need to be updated every eight hours. One entry takes just 30 seconds, I have personally tried it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-s-fatality-rate-up-from-1-67-in-mid-july-to-2-08-on-august-8/story-KTPygZ3pEf6sHdcPyE3j8N.html

According to officials, the sanitation staff at the centre had been providing these items to the admitted patients at higher rates. Sandeep Kadam, PMC’s assistant municipal commissioner and Baner-Balewadi ward officer, said, “It is an unfortunate incident. It was found that liquor bottles and tobacco packets were supplied to admitted patients inside the Nicmar quarantine centre. According to primary inquiry, the cleaning staff hired from a contractor and ambulance drivers were involved in it. Earlier too, such incidents were reported, however, only a warning was given to them. Now, we are going to take strict action against the people involved in this.” Dr Prakash Rokade, medical officer at Aundh Civil Hospital, said, “It is illegal to bring or sell such kind of things at the quarantine centre where all positive patients are staying. When a positive person consumes alcohol or tobacco it is definitely harms their health and if it affects his/her body adversely, then the medical condition of the patient will worsen.”Currently, several educational institutes and other private places like hostels, wedding halls and other residential houses have been taken over by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to serve as quarantine centres. At least 30,000 positive persons have been admitted to these quarantine centres or sent to home isolation, till date. This is the third time such incident reported from the centre, however, this time the security guards alerted the authorities. A security guard found liquor bottles and tobacco packets inside the two-wheeler of a sanitation worker during check on Saturday. Earlier, mineral water bottles, eggs and hot water had been sold at these centres illegally to the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/liquor-bottles-tobacco-packets-found-at-nicmar-quarantine-centre/story-v9WTO6yEQaEyowOzTmRRuK.html
10-08-2020||World||In a first, Indian tricolour to be hoisted at iconic Times Square in New York||A leading diaspora group in the US will hoist India’s National Flag at the Times Square this week, the first time the Indian tricolour will be unfurled at the iconic New York City destination. The Federation of Indian Associations (FIA) of the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said in a statement that it “will be creating history” on August 15, 2020 by “hosting the first ever flag hoisting ceremony at Times Square” to commemorate India’s Independence Day. “It will be the first time ever that India’s tricolour will be unfurled at the iconic venue in all its glory,” the organisation said, adding that Consul General of India in New York Randhir Jaiswal will be the Guest of Honour at the event. The FIA said this year’s Independence Day celebrations will include the flag-hoisting ceremony at Times Square and the annual tradition of illuminating the Empire State Building in hues of the tricolour - orange, white and green. The Empire State lighting ceremony will be held on August 14. “The Times Square flag hoisting ceremony is a testament to the Indian-American community’s growing patriotism and is a fitting tribute to the FIA which is celebrating its golden jubilee year,” the organisation said. Established in 1970, the FIA is among the largest umbrella diaspora organisations. In July, Ankur Vaidya was appointed the FIA Chairman, succeeding prominent Indian-American community leader Ramesh Patel who passed away due to complications from coronavirus. Vaidya, 40, has been long associated with the FIA and was the President of the umbrella diaspora organisation for the year 2014. He is the youngest member of the Board and the youngest to be chosen as its chairman. The Consulate General of India in New York will host a virtual Independence Day celebration on August 15 in which it has invited “members of the Indian community and friends of India” for the commemoration that will be live streamed. The FIA annually organises its flagship event - the India Day Parade to mark India’s Independence Day in August.

We pray for strength to families to overcome their great loss,” Tirumurti said on Monday at a briefing on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon.Tirumurti said India just recently sent Lebanon essential medical items to combat Covid-19. “We are immediately sending more relief and humanitarian material of medicines, foodstuff and other essential items to do whatever we can to alleviate the difficulties on the ground. We are discussing with the Government of Lebanon on how we can contribute further,” he said.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also paid condolences to the families and loved ones of the more than 150 people who were killed, and wished a full recovery to the many thousands of injured in the explosion, which sent shockwaves across the bustling city of Beirut, bursting  out windows and shaking buildings.Tirumurti recalled that he had paid an official visit to the “beautiful city of Beirut” last year, and said it is difficult for him to imagine that this vibrant and bustling city has been affected by the blast. “I admire the resilience of the people and the dedication of the rescue workers to cope with this tragedy,” he said.India has had traditionally close and historical relations with Lebanon, including through Indian peacekeepers in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Tirumurti said, adding that “I would like to express our solidarity with Lebanon at this juncture.” Guterres said almost a week after the blast, many people remain missing. Buildings were damaged for miles around the city of Beirut after 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilisers, stored at the port for six years, reportedly caused the explosion. A plane carrying 20 tonnes of World Health Organization health supplies landed in Beirut on Wednesday to cover 1,000 trauma interventions and 1,000 surgical interventions for people suffering from injuries and burns as a result of the blast. Further, within hours of the blast, the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon released USD 9 million from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to address immediate needs. Last Friday, the Emergency Relief Coordinator released a further USD 6 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund.UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the devastating impact of last week’s tragedy makes it imperative for the international community to stand beside the people of Lebanon who have generously hosted thousands of refugees for years. “We must respond by providing the necessary humanitarian assistance to alleviate the immediate suffering and to support the Lebanese people as they embark on the road to recovery. The needs are enormous and great.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-sending-more-relief-humanitarian-material-to-explosion-hit-lebanon/story-4LyN3kgDhgKsuxbjtdXxAP.html

Multiple countries, including Russia, have already offered their assistance in dealing with the consequences of the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-sends-usd-1-7-million-worth-protective-equipment-to-lebanon/story-U5Z6XWDCb67DyUUgZxaqzH.html

Yet less than 100 people had officially received the inoculation against the epidemic by early August and its widespread use could be dangerous, the Association of Clinical Trials Organizations said in a letter sent to Health Minister Mikhail Murashko on Monday.“Why are all corporations following the rules, but Russian ones aren’t? The rules for conducting clinical trials are written in blood. They can’t be violated,” ACTO Executive Director Svetlana Zavidova said by phone. “This is a Pandora’s Box and we don’t know what will happen to people injected with an unproven vaccine.”The Gamaleya vaccine, which is being developed together with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, began Phase 3 testing last week. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Monday he hopes it will be registered “soon,” while one of his deputies has said production is likely to start next month and the Health Ministry said mass vaccinations could begin by October.World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters last week in Geneva that vaccines should go through all stages of testing before being licensed.A spokesperson for RDIF declined to comment on the letter. The Health Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Scores of Russia’s business and political elite have already been given access to the experimental vaccine as early as April, according to people familiar with the effort. Military volunteers completed Phase 2 trials in July, according to the Defense Ministry. The results haven’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal.Researchers and pharmaceutical companies in other countries including the U.S., the U.K., Japan and China are also racing to develop vaccines. AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. have begun late-stage testing for Covid-19 vaccines, with initial results from some of the human trials expected as early as October.ACTO represents a group of multinational companies that conduct clinical trials in Russia, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Novartis AG.Russia had over 27,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the second quarter, according to Federal Statistics Service data. It has the fourth-most confirmed cases in the world, with nearly 900,000 people diagnosed.“They haven’t published anything,” Zavidova said of the Russian efforts. “This runs counter to the rest of the world. There is a standard to publish data even from unsuccessful studies.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-covid-19-vaccine-is-pandora-s-box-industry-body-warns/story-O8cSVr8VIHD3s478TKvWVP.html

He said they held up the announcement until after the commemorations of the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and parliamentary elections earlier that month.“The administration resorted to secrecy for political and security reasons,” he said, and only provided “engineered statistics” to the public.He also criticized testing efforts and warned of a renewed outbreak next month as universities hold entrance exams and people mark major Shiite holidays.Iran’s Health Ministry has reported a total of nearly 330,000 cases and 18,616 deaths, including 189 fatalities in the last 24 hours.Authorities in Iran have come under heavy criticism since the start of the pandemic because of their reluctance to impose the kind of sweeping restrictions seen elsewhere in the region.

China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, is a breakaway province.Speaking at the regular ministry briefing on Monday, Zhao said the US side should stop official interactions and contact of all kinds as well as the upgrading of substantive relations with the island.Also read: China sends fighter jets as US offers Taiwan ‘strong’ supportAzar met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, a high-profile visit that comes in the backdrop of a severe low in US-China relations. The evident friction in the China’s ties with Washington has likely exacerbated by Azar’s visit, making him the highest-level US official to visit the self-governing island since formal diplomatic relations were severed in 1979 in deference to China.Separately, Zhao announced sanctions on 11 US lawmakers and individuals, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, as countermeasures against earlier US sanctions on Chinese central government and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) officials following the passing of the national security law for Hong Kong. Zhai said China has decided to impose sanctions on individuals who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues“China resolutely opposes and strongly condemns such blatant interference in Hong Kong affairs - China’s internal affairs - as it seriously violated international law and basic principles of international relations,” Zhao added.“Since the return of Hong Kong (from British rule), the “one country, two systems” principle has been recognised around the world as a success and Hong Kong residents enjoy democratic rights and all sorts of freedoms in line with the law. That is a fact that no unbiased person can deny, Zhao said.“But the principle also faces challenges during its implementation, that is to say, national security risks in HKSAR,” Zhao said.Also read: US health chief meets Taiwan’s leader, fueling China tensionsBesides Rubio and Cruz, Beijing sanctioned Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, Pat Toomey and Congressman Chris Smith. The heads of NGOs namely Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for Democracy, Derek Mitchell, president of the National Democratic Institute, Daniel Twining, president of the International Republican Institute, Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, and Michael Abramowitz, president of Freedom House, were also sanctioned.“I want to reiterate that Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs that no external forces can interfere in. China urges the US to have a clear understanding of the situation, correct mistakes, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China’s internal affairs,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-us-lawmakers-over-hong-kong-slams-top-american-official-s-taiwan-visit/story-UNbMCKF7QE3GnOlvU5sxsL.html
10-08-2020||World||China sanctions 11 US politicians, heads of organisations||China has announced unspecified sanctions against 11 US politicians and heads of organizations promoting democratic causes, including Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have already been singled out by Beijing.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Monday said the 11 had “performed badly” on issues concerning Hong Kong, where China has cracked down on opposition voices following its imposition of a national security law in the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city last month.The number of Americans named by the ministry exactly equals the number of Hong Kong and Chinese officials placed on a sanctions list by the US last week over the crackdown.China showed its determination to defy such pressure on Monday by arresting leading independent media tycoon Jimmy Lai and raiding the publisher’s headquarters.Others named by the foreign ministry included Senators Josh Hawley and Tom Cotton and Representative Chris Smith. Heads of organisations including the National Endowment for Democracy and Freedom House were also named.Beijing already placed a travel ban on Rubio, Cruz and Smith last month after Washington announced similar measures against Chinese officials linked to measures taken against Muslims in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-11-us-politicians-heads-of-organisations/story-c980q7TxX5C8wME5ImUmvI.html
10-08-2020||World||Donors pledge 253 million euros in emergency aid for Lebanon after blast||An emergency donor conference on Sunday for blast-stricken Lebanon raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief, the French presidency said. Those commitments would not be conditional on political or institutional reform, President Emmanuel Macron’s office said. There were also pledges made for longer-term support that would depend on changes brought in by the authorities, the Elysee Palace said. World powers promised not to fail the Lebanese people as the capital, Beirut, recovers from the massive explosion that killed 158 people and destroyed swathes of the city last Tuesday. Lebanon was already mired in political and financial crisis before the blast.But foreign countries demanded transparency over how the aid is used, wary of writing blank cheques to a government viewed by its own people as deeply corrupt. Some are concerned about the influence of Iran through the Shi’ite group Hezbollah.The “assistance should be timely, sufficient and consistent with the needs of the Lebanese people ... and directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency,” the final communique stated.Macron, who visited Beirut on Thursday, hosted the conference by video-link and in his opening remarks urged participating nations to put aside their differences and support the Lebanese people.The international response should be coordinated by the United Nations in Lebanon, he added.The offer of assistance included support for an impartial, credible and independent inquiry into the blast. Public anger over the explosion has prompted some Lebanese to call for a revolt to topple their political leaders.“Our role is to be by their side,” Macron said from his summer retreat on the French Riviera.ReformsPresident Donald Trump told the conference the United States was ready to continue providing aid to help the Lebanese, the White House said.“The President called for calm in Lebanon and acknowledged the legitimate calls of peaceful protesters for transparency, reform and accountability,” a White House statement said. Trump later said the United States would send additional planes loaded with medical supplies, food and water and would give substantial aid to Lebanon, though he declined to give a dollar figure.“We haven’t given a number, but it will be substantial. On a humanitarian basis, we have to do it,” Trump told reporters in Morristown, New Jersey.The International Monetary Fund said it was willing to redouble efforts to help Lebanon after the devastating blast, but said all of the country’s institutions needed to show willingness to carry out reforms.In a statement to the conference, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, laid out reforms expected, including steps to restore the solvency of public finances and the soundness of the financial system, and temporary safeguards to avoid continued capital outflows.The explosion gutted entire neighbourhoods, leaving 250,000 people homeless, razing businesses and destroying critical grain supplies.Rebuilding Beirut will likely run into the billions of dollars. Economists forecast the blast could wipe up to 25% off of the country’s GDP. Up to Sunday’s conference there had been an array of offers of immediate humanitarian support such as rescue teams and medical supplies.In a sign of the mistrust between Beirut and donors before the blast, debt default talks between the Lebanese government and International Monetary Fund had stalled in the absence of reforms. The communique said Lebanon’s partners were ready to support the country’s longer-term economic recovery if leaders committed fully to the changes expected by the Lebanese.Many Lebanese say the blast, blamed on a huge store of ammonium nitrate, highlighted the negligence of a corrupt political elite. Protesters stormed government ministries in Beirut on Saturday and demonstrations erupted again on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donors-pledge-253-million-euros-in-emergency-aid-for-lebanon-after-blast/story-WEUFbMK2HMeJKk00MReHsL.html
10-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Extreme poverty rises; a generation sees a future slip away||As a domestic worker, Amsale Hailemariam knew from the inside out the luxury villas that had grown up around her simple shelter of raw metal and plastic sheeting. And in them, she saw how her country, Ethiopia, had transformed.The single mother told herself, “Oh God, a day will come when my life will be changed, too.” The key lay in her daughter, just months from a career in public health, who studied how to battle the illnesses of want and hunger.Then a virus mentioned in none of her textbooks arrived, and dreams faded for families, and entire countries, like theirs. Decades of progress in one of modern history’s greatest achievements, the fight against extreme poverty, are in danger of slipping away because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The world could see its first increase in extreme poverty in 22 years, further sharpening social inequities.“We are living in a state where we are above the dead and below the living,” Amsale said, near tears. “This is not life.” With the virus and its restrictions, up to 100 million more people globally could fall into the bitter existence of living on just USD 1.90 a day, according to the World Bank.  That’s “well below any reasonable conception of a life with dignity,” the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty wrote this year. And it comes on top of the 736 million people already there, half of them in just five countries: Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Congo and Bangladesh. India is struggling with one of the world’s largest virus caseloads and the effects of a lockdown so abrupt and punishing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the poor to forgive him. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, has surpassed India with the most people in extreme poverty — roughly half its citizens. And Congo remains one of the world’s most crisis-ridden countries, with outbreaks of Ebola and measles smoldering.Even China, Indonesia and South Africa are expected to have more than 1 million people each fall into extreme poverty, the World Bank says.“It’s a huge, huge setback for the entire world,” Gayle Smith, president of the ONE Campaign to end extreme poverty, told The Associated Press. Smith, a former administrator for the US Agency for International Development, called the global response to the crisis “stunningly meager.” Most of the millions newly at risk are in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that against countless odds had some of the world’s fastest growing economies in recent years. The World Bank shared with the AP the earliest data out of Ethiopia as it takes a global measure of the pandemic’s direct effects over several months, showing that the pain is already widespread. Similar efforts are under way in more than 100 countries.Back in 1991, when Ethiopia began its transformation, the country was exhausted by war. A new leader, Meles Zenawi, was shaking off years of Marxist dictatorship and terrifying drought whose images of withered children left the world aghast. The former rebel had a vision that became his legacy, one of bringing millions of countrymen out of grinding poverty.Amsale was newly arrived in the capital, Addis Ababa, from what is now neighbouring Eritrea, her baby daughter in her arms. For her the child, Bethlehem Jafar, became a tiny symbol of the city’s rise.Bethlehem benefited from the welfare of the state and the charity of those who saw in her a better future. Her mother scraped by through manual labor, vowing her girl would never do the same.Fellow Ethiopians were moving up in the world, as the government looked to emulate China’s astonishing lifting of more than 800 million people from poverty. Some embraced new manufacturing jobs. Others left subsistence farms for the growing sectors of hospitality, services and aviation that catered to the changing times, hoping to join Africa’s expanding middle class.The number of people in extreme poverty dropped dramatically, from nearly half of Ethiopia’s population in the mid-1990s to 23 per cent two decades later. “Impressive,” the World Bank said.The high-altitude city of Addis Ababa, Africa’s diplomatic capital, became an aviation hub, and a magnet for millions of citizens seeking better lives. Some grasped the first rung of upward mobility in the hustle of the untaxed informal sector, dodging the growing number of cars in the streets that signaled the middle class.Under the country’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, the capital in the past two years has seen a wave of new construction, including malls and luxury apartments. And a source of national pride is a massive dam near completion on the Nile, funded completely by Ethiopia and its citizens in a bid to pull millions more from poverty.Now Ethiopians of all kinds are hurting in the pandemic. The country, along with Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, is expected to see half of sub-Saharan Africa’s new extreme poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-extreme-poverty-rises-a-generation-sees-a-future-slip-away/story-0nQw8Wi0RLAW6GhGVzwoAN.html

The government accepted the advice of a loya jirga, a grand assembly of elders, on Sunday to release 400 “hard-core” Taliban prisoners, paving the way for talks aimed at ending a war that has ground on since US-backed Afghan forces ousted a Taliban government in late 2001. “We are ready to sit for talks within a week from when we see our prisoners released. We are ready,” Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, told Reuters on Monday.A government source told Reuters that President Ashraf Ghani would likely sign the decree to release the prisoners later on Monday.“Everyone is waiting for Ghani to sign on the decree. The original plan is to travel to Doha on Wednesday and the talks will begin on Sunday,” the source said. US Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who reached an agreement with the Taliban in February for the withdrawal of the last US troops, welcomed the progress, having spent months trying to bring the militant movement to the negotiating table with the government. “In the next few days, we expect the completion of prisoner releases, then travel of the Islamic Republic team to Doha, & from there the immediate start of intra-Afghan negotiations,” he said on Twitter.The Taliban had demanded the release of last 400 of 5,000 prisoners to be freed, as a condition for joining peace talk. But the government had been hesitant as these prisoners were involved in some of the worst violence, including a 2017 truck bombing near the German embassy in Kabul that killed more than 150 people - the deadliest attack in the 19-year insurgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-to-sign-release-of-taliban-prisoners-peace-talks-expected-in-days/story-Ww6xX5sV2DUkPgwojGpd2N.html

Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over issues ranging from trade to Hong Kong and China’s handling of Covid-19.Beijing’s move is the latest in a tit-for-tat round of sanctions between China and the United States over allegations of rights abuses and interference. Washington on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as well as the city’s current and former police chiefs, under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.Those sanctions freeze any U.S. assets owned by the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.The U.S. lawmakers targeted by Beijing on Monday have been vocal critics of a new national security law that expands Beijing’s authority in Hong Kong. Last month, China announced sanctions against Cruz, Rubio, Smith and other U.S. officials after Washington penalized senior Chinese officials over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region.Beijing’s latest measure also includes new sanctions against the heads of the U.S.-based campaign groups Freedom House and Human Rights Watch. Both had were been subjected to sanctions in December in relation to Hong Kong.It also imposed sanctions on the heads of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and the International Republican Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-sanction-us-officials-including-senators-rubio-cruz-over-us-action-on-hong-kong/story-gBWWMLqwxsCq7eEV9Z33GK.html

Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing.Azar is visiting to strengthen economic and public-health cooperation with Taiwan and support Taiwan’s international role in fighting the pandemic.“Taiwan’s response to COVID-19 has been among the most successful in the world, and that is a tribute to the open, transparent, democratic nature of Taiwan’s society and culture,” he told Tsai.Taiwan’s early and effective steps to fight the disease have kept its case numbers far lower than those of its neighbours, with 480 infections, including seven deaths. Most cases have been imported.The United States, which has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, has repeatedly clashed with China over the pandemic, accusing Beijing of lacking transparency.Tsai told Azar his visit represented “a huge step forward in anti-pandemic collaborations between our countries”, mentioning areas of cooperation including vaccine and drug research and production.Taiwan has been particularly grateful for US support to permit its attendance at the World Health Organization’s (WHO) decision-making body the World Health Assembly, and to allow it greater access to the organisation.Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to China’s objections, which considers it a Chinese province.“I’d like to reiterate that political considerations should never take precedence over the rights to health.

Another eruption in 2014 killed 16 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-s-sinabung-volcano-erupts-sending-column-of-ash-5-000-m-into-sky/story-2iJ200xs6xKLLdiiIUHyYK.html
10-08-2020||World||Left believes in ‘tearing down the system’, says US attorney general Barr||US Attorney General William Barr mounted a partisan attack on the Democratic Party in an interview that aired Sunday, claiming the left believes in “tearing down the system” and pursues absolute victory as “a substitute for religion.”Barr also told a Fox News TV host he was worried that an increase in mail-in voting could lead to a contested presidential election in November, sounding in on an issue often raised by US President Donald Trump.In an interview with conservative pundit Mark Levin, Barr said Democrats had pulled away from classic liberal values and now were akin to the “Rousseauian Revolutionary Party” aimed at destroying the institutions upon which the country was built.“They’re not interested in compromise, they’re not interested in dialectic exchange of views. They’re interested in total victory,” Barr said of the left. “It’s a secular religion. It’s a substitute for a religion.” The comments come nearly two weeks after a contentious hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in which Barr denied accusations he was doing Trump’s bidding by intervening in high-profile cases and sending federal agents into cities.Barr has come under fire from Democratic lawmakers for sending federal officers to disperse protesters in Portland, Oregon, where some demonstrators have attacked a federal courthouse and others have gathered to speak out against racism and police brutality following the May 25 death of George Floyd.Barr said police have been unfairly maligned and targeted with violent attacks during nationwide protests, and argued greater attention should be paid to a recent surge in violence in some cities that has led to numerous deaths of Black people.He said he believed systemic racism existed, but that the “best example” was in education, with public schools consistently failing inner-city youth. He pointed to school choice - a policy endorsed by Trump - as one solution to the problem. “I believe Black lives matter, but I believe all Black lives matter. I also believe that it’s not just a matter of protecting their safety from physical harm, it’s also providing economic opportunity, which this administration has done,” Barr said.Trump, who trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls, has raised questions about the integrity of the November election and he and his allies have proclaimed without evidence that expanded voting by mail - sought by many due to the coronavirus pandemic - will lead to widespread fraud.When asked about the push to expand mail-in ballots, Barr said he was “very worried about it.” He said he was fine with “individual cases” where people that have difficulty making it to the polls apply for and receive a ballot in the mail. “But the idea that you, without any request from the voter, will mail out your voting list, all these thousands and thousands of ballots, is scary because most of those mailings go to a lot of addresses where the people no longer live,” Barr said. “They could easily create a situation where there’s going to be a contested election.”(This story refiles to fix typo in first paragraph) (reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/left-believes-in-tearing-down-the-system-says-us-attorney-general-barr/story-UFJhWDSuaOwd6Z5Qqwd6QI.html

Prefabricated structures are manufactured off-site in advance, usually in standard sections, so that they can be easily shipped and assembled at the main construction site.A pair of 192-meter-tall (630 feet) towers will come up in Singapore but large portions of the structure are being manufactured over the border in Malaysia and will later be moved to the original construction site.Also read: South Asian origin Canadians worst-hit due to job losses caused by Covid-19Individual modules of residential project Avenue South Residence are being manufactured at Senai, Malaysia, a report published in CNN stated. The modules, a series of six-sided boxes of concrete, will first reach a facility in Singapore for fitting and furnishing before reaching the construction location for the final assembling.This kind of construction method is believed to reduce the amount of construction work carried out at the actual site. In case of a site being amid a residential or a busy city location, such a method can cut down on the inconvenience caused to the locals and those around. Given the pandemic situation, the method also involves having fewer people at the construction site at a given time.

A look at the site plan so sees two majestic towers that are 56 storeys high and there will be 18 Sky Gardens with unique dining & entertaining venues. There will also be 4 function rooms on level 56 which offers unrivalled views of the city centre,” the official website reads.

10-08-2020||World||South Asian origin Canadians worst-hit due to job losses caused by Covid-19||Canadians of South Asian origin, including Indo-Canadians, have been the demographically worst-hit community due to jobs losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. According to the country’s data agency Statistics Canada (StatCan), as against an overall unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent for July, the comparative figure for South Asians was at 17.8 per cent.In fact, according to the labour force survey released by StatCan, minority groups have largely suffered more than the mainstream due to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. While South Asians have been the worst affected, the unemployment rate among those of Arab origin is 17.3 per cent and black Canadians at 16.8 per cent.The agency also pointed out that South Asians and Chinese Canadians has experiences “large” Covid-19-related increases in unemployment. It noted, “South Asian (+9.1 percentage points) and Chinese (+8.4 percentage points) Canadians experienced relatively large increases in their unemployment rates from July 2019 to July 2020.” And among South Asians, women were harder hit than men, with a 20.4 per cent unemployment rate as against 15.4 per cent.Overall, the employment situation appears to be gradually improving in the country. Employment rose by 419,000 or 2.4 per cent in July which, when combined with gains from June of 953,000 and May of 290,000, indicates a degree of economic recovery with restrictions that hampered activity being gradually relaxed. However, the unemployment numbers were still 1.3 million behind the pre-February level. The unemployment rate overall was at 10.9 per cent below the record high of 13.7 per cent in May, but still not close to the pre-COVID-19 situation in February when the rate was at 5.6 per cent.The gains in employment in July came largely due to part-time work, with that accounting for five-sixths of the additions, at 345,000 as compared to just 73,000 full-time positions.“The relatively flat growth in full-time work in recent months is reflected in an increase in the proportion of part-time workers doing so involuntarily.,” StatCan analysed, adding that 29.7 per cent of those working part-time would have preferred full-time work but are unable to secure such openings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-asian-origin-canadians-worst-hit-due-to-job-losses-caused-by-covid-19/story-OAS2aL6bVNdgeXf46KukoM.html
10-08-2020||World||Covid-19 spreading fast because billions don’t have water to wash hands: UN||A severe household water shortage facing two out of five people in the world is undermining efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic.Frequent and thorough hand washing are among the most effective measures in restricting the spread of the virus because the primary routes of transmission are droplets and direct contact, according to the World Health Organization. Yet, some 3 billion people don’t have access to running water and soap at home, and 4 billion suffer from severe water scarcity for at least one month a year, the United Nations group UN-Water said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is a disastrous situation for people living without access to safe water and safely managed sanitation,” UN-Water Chair Gilbert F. Houngbo said in an interview. “The chronic underinvestment has left billions vulnerable and we are now seeing the consequences.”Years of deferred investments in clean water and sanitation are now putting everyone at risk as the virus spreads through developed and developing nations generating a cycle of infection and reinfection.The world needs to spend $6.7 trillion on water infrastructure by 2030, according to the UN, not just for the urgent sanitation needs, but to tackle longer term issues from the pandemic such as providing better irrigation to head off a potential food crisis, Houngbo said.Some companies have stepped in to offer solutions for the most urgent problems. Japan’s Lixil Group Corp., which owns brands such as American Standard and Grohe, worked with Unicef and other partners to create an off-grid hand washing gadget that needs only a small amount of water in a bottle. For $1 million it will make 500,000 units in India to be donated to serve 2.5 million people before it starts retail sales.It’s a rapid, short-term response to help fight the pandemic, but more sustainable investments are needed, such as installing piped water to more homes, said Clarissa Brocklehurst, faculty member of the Water Institute at University of North Carolina and a former water, sanitation and hygiene chief at Unicef.Water inequalitiesThe lack of access to basic water and sanitation is one more example of the lethal effects of inequality being exposed by the pandemic. The impacts of water mismanagement are felt disproportionately by the poor, who are more likely to rely on rain-fed agriculture for food and are most at risk from contaminated water and inadequate sanitation, the World Bank said.Underprivileged people in cities are particularly vulnerable as they often live in densely populated areas where social distancing is hard, especially if they have to share a water source. Transmission in the Americas has been tougher to contain in poor urban areas that have limited access to water, sanitation and public health services, said Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization.As many as 5.7 billion people could be living in areas where water is scarce for at least one month a year by 2050, creating unprecedented competition for water, said UN’s Houngbo.By one estimate, each degree of global warming will expose about 7% of the world’s population to a decrease of renewable water resources of at least 20%. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to 2 degrees, may reduce climate-induced water stress by as much as 50%.“Hand washing for so long has been what I would call infantilized,” Brocklehurst said. “All of a sudden, it’s a matter of life and death and adults are teaching themselves hand-washing songs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spreading-fast-because-billions-don-t-have-water-to-wash-hands-un/story-ovDcXYZXYfnNCbBa4OUiYN.html
10-08-2020||World||Israeli jeweller makes $1.5 million gold coronavirus mask||An Israeli jewellery company is working on what it says will be the world’s most expensive coronavirus mask, a gold, diamond-encrusted face covering with a price tag of $1.5 million.The 18-karat white gold mask will be decorated with 3,600 white and black diamonds and fitted with top-rated N99 filters at the request of the buyer, said designer Isaac Levy.Levy, owner of the Yvel company, said the buyer had two other demands: that it be completed by the end of the year, and that it would be the priciest in the world. That last condition, he said, “was the easiest to fulfill.” He declined to identify the buyer, but said he was a Chinese businessman living in the United States.The glitzed-up face mask may lend some pizzazz to the protective gear now mandatory in public spaces in many countries. But at 270 grams (over half a pound) — nearly 100 times that of a typical surgical mask — it is not likely to be a practical accessory to wear.In an interview at his factory near Jerusalem, Levy showed off several pieces of the mask, covered in diamonds. One gold plate had a hole for the filter.“Money maybe doesn’t buy everything, but if it can buy a very expensive COVID-19 mask and the guy wants to wear it and walk around and get the attention, he should be happy with that,” Levy said.Such an ostentatious mask might also rub some the wrong way at a time when millions of people around the world are out of work or suffering economically. Levy said that while he would not wear it himself, he was thankful for the opportunity.“I am happy that this mask gave us enough work for our employees to be able to provide their jobs in very challenging times like these times right now,” he said.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-jeweller-makes-1-5-million-gold-coronavirus-mask/story-hGU96ZBw0JeFZhpuYE32CL.html
10-08-2020||World||US health chief meets Taiwan’s leader, fueling China tensions||On the most senior visit by an American official in more than four decades, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar hailed Taiwan’s democracy and praised President Tsai Ing-wen’s response to the pandemic in comments likely to stoke tensions with China.“It is a true honor to be here to convey a message of strong support and friendship from President Trump to Taiwan,” Azar said when meeting Tsai in prepared remarks. He called Taiwan’s democracy “an inspiration to the region and the world” and said he wanted to use the visit “to learn about how our shared democratic values have driven success in health.”In comments to reporters, Azar said that Taiwan was “so scarred” by China’s lack of transparency during the SARS outbreak in 2003 that its people didn’t trust information coming from Beijing or the World Health Organization. He also said that the US has fought for Taiwan to be included as an observer in the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body.Tsai called it “highly regrettable” that China has blocked Taiwan from participating in the World Health Assembly, saying her government could help countries fight the disease. “The decision to bar Taiwan from participating in the WHA is a violation of the universal right to health,” she said.Taiwan has been a rare global success story in containing Covid-19, as the US grapples with one of the world’s worst outbreaks. In keeping with Taiwan’s stringent anti-virus procedures, Azar’s delegation is abiding by measures including multiple tests for Covid-19, mandatory daily temperature checks and wearing masks at all times. He’s also scheduled to speak with Taiwan’s health minister on Monday and hold a press briefing, according to a person familiar with the situation.The visit has drawn China’s ire as the US challenges Beijing on a range of fronts, from the early handling of the virus to Chinese-owned technology companies to a new security law for Hong Kong. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin last week said Beijing was “firmly opposed” to the trip, calling Taiwan “the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations.”The trip comes days after President Donald Trump moved to ban Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and TikTok, owned by Bytedance Ltd., sending shock waves through the global tech industry amid increased fears of a push for decoupling the world’s biggest economies. The Trump administration has also led the way in condemning China over its crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, where media tycoon Jimmy Lai was arrested on Monday.Azar’s visit has little to do with the virus and is primarily aimed at sending a message to Beijing as it increases diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan, according to Jonathan Sullivan, director of China programs at the Asia Research Institute and an associate professor at the University of Nottingham.“There is a confidence in Taiwan, which this demonstration of American support will buttress, that it can live with Chinese pressures, limited as they are, especially during a moment when the backlash to ‘Chinese assertiveness’ is growing around the world,” he wrote in an email.Taiwan has rejected China’s criticism of Azar’s visit, saying on Thursday that Beijing was a “global troublemaker.”“What the Chinese government can do is stop making irresponsible remarks on the international stage” and stop interfering with Taiwan’s dealings around the world, ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said at a briefing Thursday. “What the Chinese government can do is ‘return politics to the people, listen to the voices of the people, and understand the needs of the people’ because the 1.4 billion people of China and Hong Kong deserve freedom.”Azar’s trip coincided with a visit by former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori to pay his respects to the late President Lee Teng-hui, who led Taiwan from dictatorship to democracy in the 1990s and reshaped its relationship with China.In a meeting with Tsai on Sunday that could further worsen Japan-China ties, Mori conveyed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s condolences while the Taiwanese president said she hoped the two sides can work together to combat the virus. The group included Abe’s younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, who is also a lawmaker in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/honor-to-convey-message-of-strong-support-friendship-us-health-chief-to-taiwan/story-ITPlNnDH2y41ybUdjOdqpK.html
10-08-2020||World||Ohio governor’s conflicting Covid-19 tests raise backlash||The Ohio governor’s positive, then negative, tests for Covid-19 have provided fuel for skeptics of government pandemic mandates and critics of his often-aggressive policies.“I’m sure the internet is lighting up with ‘Well, you can’t believe any test,’ ” Mike DeWine said in a WCOL radio interview Friday, after a whirlwind of events the day before when the initial positive showing forced the Republican to scrub a planned meeting with President Donald Trump. And on Sunday, he told CNN’s “State of the Union” that “people should not take away from my experience that testing is not reliable or doesn’t work.”Instead of seeing Trump at the Cleveland airport, DeWine returned to this state capital for new testing with his wife, Fran, through Ohio State University’s medical center. They then went to their southwestern Ohio farm in Cedarville, where DeWine said he planned to quarantine for 14 days. But within hours, he had received Columbus test results that were negative. The first test, part of protocol for people meeting with the president, was a rapid-result antigen test, while the Columbus testing was a genetic, laboratory test whose results are considered more reliable.The governor’s office said Saturday another test for each by Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center again returned negative results for DeWine and his wife.The conflicting results come as Americans have grown frustrated about access to testing and by slow results. Ohioans also remain divided over DeWine’s actions to deal with the pandemic, with some saying his early shutdown actions unnecessarily damaged businesses. He was an early advocate of wearing masks to stop the Covid-19 spread even as other Republicans in Ohio remain unconvinced.State Rep. Nino Vitale, a conservative GOP gadfly from Urbana, tweeted a photo of DeWine wearing a mask minutes after the positive test was announced Thursday.“I think the question must be asked. Has he not been wearing his mask, or do masks not stop the spread?” Vitale said in his post, which also stated he wished the governor no ill will.DeWine said he received some “not so nice” texts during the day Thursday about wearing masks. He reasserted Friday that while they might not be 100% effective, they do help prevent spread and have been made a noticeable difference in the state’s most-populated cities.Critics were blasting him on his official Twitter account, too.DeWine, 73, a former US senator and House member who is in his first term as governor, at first appeared to have been only the second US governor to positive for the coronavirus.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he contracted the virus last month. Stitt, a Republican who has been disdainful of mask mandates, said he contracted Covid-19 by hugging friends.Longtime Cincinnati-area conservative activist Mike Wilson, who has been analyzing and writing about coronavirus data since he contracted COVID-19 this summer, saw a storm of strong reactions on his Facebook page including from some who said DeWine’s results show the pandemic is “a scam.”“At this point, this is clearly not a hoax,” said Wilson, who has fully recovered from the virus. He said continued pandemic-deniers are mostly “outliers,” but many other people are frustrated over what they see as DeWine’s overreactions and also about the testing issues. Test results, including false positives, affect individual lives by triggering quarantines that are a rising concern as Ohio schools prepare to reopen.The number of positive cases in Ohio had decreased after the first surge, hitting a low in late May. But numbers again began to rise in mid-June as Ohio began to reopen businesses.DeWine had resisted a statewide mask mandate until July 23. He quickly backed off an earlier try at a mask requirement inside businesses and balked at closing down bars, instead recently mandating a “last call” at 10 p.m. and an 11 p.m. closing time. Nearly 3,700 Ohio deaths have been linked to the coronavirus.Wilson thinks by now, DeWine and other government officials should allow people to make their own decisions on which precautions they need or are willing to take.“We’ve found that people’s individual behavior matters more than those government actions anyway,” Wilson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ohio-governor-s-conflicting-covid-19-tests-raise-backlash/story-7VTWJYJ4kxwMD0zr8TnnLL.html

Much of that has gone toward funding research and manufacturing capacity that will help a vaccine be distributed globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-says-us-covid-19-testing-has-mind-blowing-problems/story-MrsQ0Kj3xqofPwi2FJln7M.html

Those bosses who do intend to review salaries anticipate making 1% increases to basic pay, compared with 2% this time last year. Even so, hiring intentions rose, indicating that businesses are reshaping in response to the crisis.The specter of mass unemployment is looming large over the UK economy as it begins its fragile recovery following months of lockdown. While the government has been paying the wages of 9.6 million jobs at a cost of 33.8 billion pounds ($44 billion) as of Aug. 2, it has started to wind down the program, even as many businesses are still struggling. The Bank of England last week warned unemployment will rise to about 7.5% by the end of the year.“Until now, redundancies have been low -- no doubt due to the Job Retention Scheme -- but we expect to see more redundancies come through this autumn, especially in the private sector once the scheme closes,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser at the CIPD. “This will likely be accompanied by a pay squeeze for workers, which is actually to be welcomed to help preserve jobs.

It has prompted fears among activists and foreign governments that it will be used to silence basic freedoms in the city.Lai’s media group and Apple Daily backed the pro-democracy protests that rocked the city last year, but it’s been years since he was seen as playing a central role in Hong Kong’s democracy movement. Lai had earlier been arrested in February on suspicion of participating in an unlawful assembly in 2019 and intimidating a reporter two years before that, and was granted police bail.The U.S. has led foreign governments in expressing concern over the law, saying Hong Kong could no longer be considered sufficiently autonomous from the mainland. It has begun revoking its so-called special trading privileges, which help underpin its reputation as an international business hub, and sanctioned Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam as well as other officials last week.Lam has defended the national security law and called it the “most important” development in relations between Hong Kong and Beijing since the city’s handover to Chinese rule in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-under-national-security-law-report/story-uCZ7RRNRaMT2tp1wXjbWDO.html

Protesters also broke into the housing and transport ministry offices.Two government ministers resigned amid the political fallout of the blast and months of economic crisis, saying the government had failed to reform.Tuesday’s explosion of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate killed 158 people and injured more than 6,000, compounding months of political and economic collapse and prompting furious calls for the government to quit.Riot police wearing body armour and carrying batons clashed with demonstrators as thousands converged on Parliament Square and nearby Martyrs’ Square, a Reuters correspondent said.“We gave these leaders so many chances to help us and they always failed. We want them all out, especially Hezbollah, because it’s a militia and just intimidates people with its weapons,” Walid Jamal, an unemployed demonstrator, said, referring to the country’s most influential Iran-backed armed grouping that has ministers in the government.The country’s top Christian Maronite cleric, Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, said the cabinet should resign as it cannot “change the way it governs”.“The resignation of an MP or a minister is not enough ... the whole government should resign as it is unable to help the country recover,” he said in his Sunday sermon.Lebanon’s environment minister resigned on Sunday, saying the government had lost a number of opportunities to reform, a statement said.Damianos Kattar’s departure follows the resignation of Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad earlier on Sunday in the wake of the explosion.Anger boiled over into violent scenes in central Beirut on Saturday. Those protests were the biggest since October when thousands of people took to the streets to demand an end to corruption, bad governance and mismanagement.About 10,000 people gathered at Martyrs’ Square, which was transformed into a battle zone in the evening between police and protesters who tried to break down a barrier along a road leading to parliament. Some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks. One policeman was killed and the Red Cross said more than 170 people were injured in clashes.‘Change the government’“The police fired at me. But that won’t stop us from demonstrating until we change the government from top to bottom,” Younis Flayti, 55, a retired army officer, said on Sunday.Nearby, mechanic Sabir Jamali sat beside a noose attached to a wooden frame in Martyrs’ Square, intended as a symbolic warning to Lebanese leaders to resign or face hanging.“Every leader who oppresses us should be hanged,” he said, adding he will protest again.Lawyer Maya Habli surveyed the demolished port.“People should sleep in the streets and demonstrate against the government until it falls,” she said.The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse. The government has said it will hold those responsible to account.An emergency donor conference in France raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief, the French presidency said.For many, the blast was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which has since been rebuilt.“I worked in Kuwait for 15 years in sanitation to save money and build a gift shop in Lebanon and it was destroyed by the explosion,” said Maroun Shehadi.“Nothing will change until our leaders just leave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-police-fire-tear-gas-as-protesters-regroup-and-two-ministers-quit/story-2IybVinkJ4TO4VKO8YiWSM.html

10-08-2020||World||China targeting US election infrastructure with cyberattacks: Report||Chinese government-linked hackers have been targeting US election infrastructure ahead of the 2020 presidential election, White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said on Sunday, indicating a more active level of alleged Chinese interference. O’Brien’s comments appeared to go beyond a statement released on Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence which said China “has been expanding its influence efforts,” and that Russia was already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden. But did not specifically accuse Beijing of hacking attempts against US election-related systems.“They’d like to see the President lose,” O’Brien said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “China - like Russia, like Iran - they’ve engaged in cyberattacks and phishing and that sort of thing with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites and that sort of thing.” China has consistently denied US government claims that it hacks US companies, politicians or government agencies. “The US presidential election is an internal affair, we have no interest in interfering in it,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in April.O’Brien said the United States had seen hackers try to infiltrate websites belonging to Secretary of State offices around the country, which are responsible for administering elections at the local level, and collecting data on Americans. “It is a real concern and it’s not just Russia,” he said. “There will be severe consequences for any country that attempts to interfere in our free and fair elections.” The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ODNI declined to comment or clarify whether O’Brien’s comments contradicted their own. The ODNI previously said that “adversaries” seek to compromise the private communications of American political candidates and penetrate US election systems ahead of November’s election. And that China would prefer President Donald Trump does not win reelection. Multiple reviews by US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump’s 2016 campaign and undercut his rival Hillary Clinton’s chances in that election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targeting-us-election-infrastructure-with-cyberattacks-report/story-GT0YYMpliHe3Ncp1eIpIcK.html
10-08-2020||India||No timeline yet for reopening schools as states hesitate||No timeline has been fixed yet by the ministry of education to reopen schools, as a majority of states are not in favour of such a move due to the continuing spike in Covid-19 cases, according to persons familiar with the matter.While the government is looking at the possibility of starting classes for senior students from September-end or October, no final decision has been taken in this regard, they said.“No timeline has been fixed yet as the decision will completely depend on the pandemic situation. Barring one Union territory, no other state or UT is in favour of reopening schools in near future,” a person familiar with the matter said.“The ministry officials also emphasized before the panel that there would be no zero year. They also apprised the panel of the efforts made to gauge the effectiveness of the online teaching mode. Surveys, etc, are being conducted, including in municipal schools, to find out ways to make teaching more effective,” the person said.Earlier in the day, HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank also said at an event that the decision to open campuses will be taken after discussions with states and other stakeholders. “Possibility of higher secondary classes in late September is being explored but there has been no final decision. Whenever it is decided, the Centre will only issue an advisory in this regard and states will have to take a call depending on the Covid-19 situation in their districts,” the person added.In July, the parliamentary panel for HRD had seen a rejig, with Vinay Sahasrabuddhe becoming the head addition of new members, including BJP MP Jyotiraditiya Scindia.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of the measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day and threw economic activities out of gear. While the government has largely eased restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.Last month, the education ministry had sent out a letter to states and Union territories to furnish a feedback from parents of school-going children, as to when they would be comfortable with reopening of schools — August, September or October 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-timeline-yet-for-reopening-schools-as-states-hesitate/story-qKaB34wbw2Ws2jQHdYPwdI.html
10-08-2020||India||No degrees without exams, UGC tells SC||India’s higher education regulator, the University Grants Commission (UGC), told the Supreme Court on Monday that degrees cannot be conferred on students without final year examinations being held and that it alone is empowered to take a call on whether or not the exams can take place or should be cancelled.State governments cannot cancel examinations, that power lies with the UGC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing on behalf of the UGC, told the top court in response to the stance of the Delhi and Maharashtra governments that they have cancelled final year/ terminal semester examinations because of Covid -19.“How can states cancel exams when UGC is empowered to confer degrees? Students cannot get degrees without exams. Such degrees will not be recognized by UGC. That is the law,” Mehta told a three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan.The bench, which also comprised justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, was hearing a batch of petitions by students and organizations challenging the July 6 guidelines issue by UGC on holding final year examinations by September 30.The petitioners have demanded that the apex court consider scrapping online/offline tests and instead direct the UGC to declare results by July 31 based on the past performance of students or internal assessment. “It’s not just about a couple of students. Any decision regarding exams impacts a large number of students,” said Mahesh Verma, vice chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University-- a state government-run institution in Delhi that has promoted students based on their performance in the last semester and internal tests. “Many of them are living in far-flung areas amid the pandemic and have no access to devices and the internet. They did not get opportunities to attend online classes. How can we take exams of students who could not be taught? ... We just hope the UGC realises the present challenges and ensure that students are not impacted by their decision.”  Delhi and Maharashtra governments invoked powers under the Disaster Management Act of 2005 to scrap the exams. The Disaster Management Act is a law intended to ensure effective management of disasters and it empowers central and state governments to take measures to mitigate disaster situations. Both are among the worst affected by the pandemic.“The powers under it {Disaster Management Act} are sweeping as we saw when the central government and states imposed lockdowns bringing life to a standstill and effectively curtailing various fundamental rights of citizens like right to move freely. If fundamental rights can be curtailed in exercise of that law, then postponing examinations is also reasonable. Hence, in my opinion the power of states under the Disaster Management Act will trump the powers of UGC,” Supreme Court advocate Haris Beeran said.Maharashtra announced its decision on June 19 and Delhi on July 11. The Maharashtra government told the apex court that it took the decision to scrap the final-year exams after the State Disaster Management Authority, constituted under the Disaster Management Act, recommended this against the background of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was submitted by Maharashtra that a majority of university vice chancellors from the state were against holding final-year examinations because of an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the state.Maharashtra has been hit the hardest among Indian states by the viral disease, reporting over 500,000 cases and 17,757 deaths till Sunday night. The Delhi government also adopted a similar stance, pointing out that not all students were able to attend online classes, citing a digital divide that made online teaching inaccessible to less privileged students.“During this extremely tough period, regular physical classes got completely interrupted. The students had no access to study material and the college libraries were closed, although getting access through online mode in such peculiar circumstances, the students did not get the kind of preparation needed to attempt a full-fledged examination,” the affidavit by the Delhi government said. Delhi reported over 145,000 cases and 4,111 deaths till Sunday night. All colleges have been shut since later March on account of Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed to fight it. In all, India imposed a 68-day lockdown between March 24 and May 31. Since then, some activities have been allowed, although educational institutions have not been allowed to reopen. Apart from Maharashtra and Delhi, states including Odisha, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have cancelled university exams including final-year exams. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka had cancelled university exams except for final year/ terminal semester students.“The affidavits by Maharashtra and Delhi are against UGC guidelines. It is the UGC which confers degrees,” Mehta said.“But will the Disaster Management Act override the UGC directive?” the bench queried him, asking Mehta to respond in an affidavit.The matter was adjourned to enable the UGC to file its response and will be heard again on August 14.A government official said the matter was “sub-judice” and added that the regulator’s move was keeping in mind the UGC Act and regulations related to exams and degrees. At an event earlier in the day, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said the decision on exams was taken to ensure that the shadow of Covid did not fall on the degrees of students and their careers were not affected. The minister was asked a question about the opening of schools, to which he replied that a decision would be taken keeping in mind the safety of students and staff.The UGC filed an affidavit before the top court on July 30 defending its July 6 directive that examinations be held by September-end. stating that the academic future of students will be irreparably damaged if the examinations are not held.The final-year/ terminal semester examinations were initially scheduled to be held in July. This was based on April 29 guidelines issued by UGC based on the recommendations of an expert committee headed by Chairperson of Central University of Haryana, RC Kuhad.Keeping in view the evolving Covid-19 situation, UGC, in June, requested the expert committee to revisit the guidelines. Based on the expert committee’s recommendations, fresh guidelines were then issued on July 6, directing that examinations be held by the end of September.The guidelines say that universities could conduct the examinations in the online or offline mode and by ensuring adherence to social distancing norms.A Covid-19 positive student was one of the petitioners raising the demand for the exams to be cancelled. Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena, was also a petitioner before the Court.“Final-year/ terminal semester examinations are important because the learning process of a dynamic interaction where the only way to figure out what the students know is to seek evidence of their knowledge. Academic evaluation of final-year students is, therefore, a very important milestone in any education system,” UGC said.Manoj Khanna, principal of Delhi University’s Ramjas College, agreed. “It would be very difficult to assess students on the basis of internal marks. It cannot be a proper form of assessment and it can be an injustice to students who prepare well for the final exams. Not taking exams won’t be justifiable.” Khanna said.Many students, however, are against the UGC’s insistence on conducting final-year exams. “Many state universities are promoting their final year students on the basis of last semester and internal assessment and still the UGC is adamant about conducting exams,” Amal K Simon, a final year BSc (Physics) student at Ramjas College in New Delhi, said. “The students are going through a lot of issues amid the pandemic. Families of many students are going through major financial crisis.”“It is an incontrovertible fact that as per the Parliamentary Act, UGC is the only agency to lay down rules for the grants of degrees for all kinds of universities: Cental, State, Deemed, Private. It has also the power to derecognise the degree awarded in violation of the UGC guidelines. However, in these unprecedented Covid pandemic times it is desirable that a legal or political fight should not mar the future of millions of final year students or inordinately delay their results. MHRD and UGC should immediately engage in a dialogue with the contending states to reach an amicable and academically sound solution,” said former UGC member Dr Inder Mohan Kapahy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-degrees-without-exams-ugc-tells-sc/story-S8YztuPVaEm89eajZ3kE4H.html
10-08-2020||India||BJP wants more security for party workers in Kashmir Valley||After the killing of five party workers in the last two months by terror groups that has stoked panic among the cadre in the Kashmir Valley, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Jammu and Kashmir unit has sought more secured living spaces for senior functionaries and representatives at the panchayat and district levels. According to a party functionary who spoke on condition of anonymity, the demand for “safe spaces” in Srinagar and other district headquarters was made to BJP president JP Nadda last week. “There is a clear targeted killing of BJP workers; the party is working on measures that will be taken to address the concerns of the workers in the Valley. As for now they have been urged to remain cautious and avoid travelling unless it is urgent,” said a senior BJP leader in Delhi. There is intelligence input that attacks could intensify in the run up to the Independence Day, the functionary said. After the killing of Ajay Bharti, a Congress man and the sarpanch of Lukbawan village in south Kashmir’s Larkipora area in June, five BJP workers were gunned down, these include the killing of Wasim Bari, his brother Umar Bashir and father Bashir Ahmed who were all shot outside their shop in Bandipora in July, Sarpanch, Sajad Ahmad Khanday in Kulgam on Friday and party worker Abdul Hamid Najar in Budgam who succumbed to injuries on Monday. “Six others have been injured in attacks,” said a BJP functionary based in Kashmir. The functionary said while a number of Sarpanches and block development officials have been provided accommodation away from their native districts and villages, there is a need to consider construction of safe houses at district headquarters where their families can be accommodated as well. “When the panchayat member of the BDC visit their homes they become sitting ducks for terrorists. There is no doubt that the number of panchayat representatives runs into thousands, and providing security will be difficult; but some steps have to be taken to assure the workers who have opted to work for the development of the people,” said the functionary quoted above. Killing of political workers in the Valley started soon after the eruption of terrorism in the former state in the last 1990s. Regional satraps, the National Conference and the People’s Democratic Party claim to have lost hundreds of party workers to terror attacks over the past three decades. Hina Bhatt, who contested the 2014 general elections on a BJP ticket and is currently the vice chairperson of the Khadi Village Industries Board said political party workers on the ground are a “soft target” and their killing is used as a message to discourage others from joining the political mainstream. “When the NC and the PDP were in power, their workers and functionaries were targeted; now it is the BJP workers who are being attacked. A lot of people in the Valley are joining the BJP, which is a setback for the terror groups,” she said. The increase in attacks against political workers Bhatt said is also retaliation against the crackdown on terrorists in the Valley. “In the last one year so many terrorists have been killed, so this is the easiest way to demoralise those who support the government and party workers,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wants-more-security-for-party-workers-in-kashmir-valley/story-VmtmFhTozYKSG70Aq2HlwK.html

It gives us an opportunity to showcase our talent to the industry people, which in turn fetches us better work,” said the actor, who was seen as a cop with Nawazuddin Siddiqui in ‘Raat Akeli Hai’, shot in the state capital. Wading into the nepotism and groupism debate the ‘Pataal Lok’ and ‘Rangbaaz’ actor said, “The problem starts at the senior level when one is looking for lead roles. But, the great thing in our industry is that actual control is in the hands of the public. If you are perceived to be aligned to a certain group, people may reduce your screen time before release, or cut your role but the public can still make you king if you have performed well. Now, with OTT, it has become more democratic as the audience decides what to watch.“I am at a stage where people now recognise me by face but do not know me by name. But when people see your work, they search for you. This is proven by the love I get on my social media handles.”Born in Varanasi, he has grown up in Lucknow. “I studied in Ramadhin Singh Inter College, KKC, KKV and Lucknow University. I obtained a NCC C-certificate as I wanted to join the army but could not. During a R-Day camp, I was impressed by a talented cadet, Neeraj, and he suggested that I join theatre. So, I reached Bhartendu Natya Academy (2001) for a workshop and that changed my life.” There he realised the importance of good literature. “I had read Munshi Premchand, Jai Shankar Prasad and other writers to get numbers in exams but here I came to know about their legendary work and art. I was raw but got selected for the comprehensive National School of Drama workshop. On my selection, I was told, ‘Kabhi kabhi hum kore kagaz lete hain jispe kuch likha jaa sake (You have been selected because you can be moulded. A blank sheet of paper is best to write on)’. Thereafter, I joined a three-month Sangeet Natak Academy workshop. I also learnt kathak and we did some dance-dramas. What I learnt in those years are lessons for life…”After doing some TV shows in Lucknow, his first film was ‘Shudra’ but first to release was ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’ where he played a goon Riyaz. “That was a small but noticeable role. Then I played Vicky Kaushal’s friend in ‘Masaan’, followed by ‘Mukkabaaz’, ‘Half Girlfriend’, ‘Sonchiraiya’ and ‘Photograph’. I played Guruji’s (Pankaj Tripathi) father in ‘Sacred Games’ and a journalist in ‘Pataal Lok’.” He also did a short film ‘Suno’ which was shot by Diwakar Bhattacharya, another Lucknowite.Acting helped him realise one of his dreams. “I played cop in ‘RAH’ and now wish to wear the uniform of the Indian Army. I could not do it in real life but wish to do that on screen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/groupism-or-nepotism-public-always-had-the-control-button-says-shreedhar-dubey/story-lcEUQtUoTAKP7fOpSHFEGN.html
10-08-2020||India||Small Bengal village has remained under lockdown since March 22. It is Covid-19 free||Located barely seven kilometres away from Siliguri town in north Bengal, Toribari village, which stands next to the Mahananda Wild Life Sanctuary in Jalpaiguri district, continues to be under complete lockdown since March 22 because that’s the way the villagers want to live. The residents, who live in 94 houses that comprise the small village, do not allow outsiders although the place used to be one of the most popular tourist spots in the region till the Covid-19 pandemic started. The villagers draw satisfaction from the fact that Toribari did not have a single Covid-19 patient yet although the number of cases is rising in north Bengal. No government official could, however, confirm if Toribari is the only Covid-19 free village in Jalpaiguri district. The villagers allow entry of outsiders only during an emergency but not unless thorough sanitization is carried out. Yuden Lepcha, secretary of Toribari village development committee said, “The village is vulnerable as it has a temple, a church and a monastery. It is the most popular picnic spot for people living in and around Siliguri. We have to be careful.” “The villagers decided to continue the lockdown although the government started the Unlock process some time ago. The committee has hired people to keep vigil on the movement of people,” said Sudip Pradhan, vice president of the local joint forest management committee. “There are times when visitors behave rudely after they are stopped by the hired guards. Senior committee members have to rush and restore order. Once normalcy is restored we will welcome all visitors,” Pradhan said. Till August 9, Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts recorded 39 and 14 Covid-19 related deaths respectively. Most of these occurred in the Siliguri sub-division and Siliguri Municipal Corporation area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/small-bengal-village-has-remained-under-lockdown-since-march-22-it-is-covid-19-free/story-Ppc07Uf8WCJSkkosm6rORI.html
10-08-2020||India||N Ram’s petition deleted as it sought stay on Prashant Bhushan’s contempt pleas, says SC||Days after the Supreme Court ordered an inquiry as to how a petition filed by senior journalist N Ram, former Union Minister Arun Shourie and advocate Prashant Bhushan challenging the contempt of court law got listed before a bench other than the one which was hearing contempt petitions against Bhushan, it has now emerged that the petition contained an application for staying all contempt proceedings against the advocate.The application mentioned the two contempt petitions pending against Bhushan before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra. One was a 2009 contempt case initiated against Bhushan for his interview given to Tehelka magazine where he alleged half of past 16 Chief Justices of India (CJI) to be corrupt. The other contempt case was initiated on two tweets by Bhushan. One criticized CJI SA Bobde of riding a bike while keeping Courts closed and another was directed against the judiciary for destroying democracy without a formal Emergency. The tweets were of June 27 and June 29. A statement released by the Supreme Court on Monday said, “In the Writ Petition titled as N. Ram and Others v Union of India, an application for stay has been moved making a request to stay all the proceedings in criminal contempt cases pending against Petitioner no. 3 (Prashant Bhushan).” On receiving this petition, the SC Registry listed the matter before a bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud on Monday, August 10. But the petition was withdrawn after this application surfaced. An inquiry has been ordered to ascertain how the petition got listed before a bench other than Justice Mishra. Pending such inquiry, the statement makes it amply clear why the matter was deleted from the list of Justice Chandrachud. The note released by SC said, “It is a cardinal principle of law that a coordinate bench cannot stay the proceedings of ongoing cases which are pending before other similar bench. This would have created a problem as one Court cannot stay the proceedings of other court having the same jurisdiction.” The petition by Ram, Bhushan and Shourie is yet to be listed. The petition has challenged the validity of Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Courts Acty 1971 which criminalizes publication of any matter that could scandalize or lower the authority of courts. The petition alleged that this provision violates freedom of speech under Article 19 of the Constitution and gags discourse on matters of public importance. The stay application annexed with the petition had prayed to “stay all ongoing proceedings in criminal contempt cases pending against the Petitioner no 3 herein, that are either based on the definition of criminal contempt as defined under Section 2(c)(i) of Contempt of Courts Act or are intrinsically linked to the same during the pendency of the instant writ petition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/n-ram-s-petition-deleted-as-it-sought-stay-on-prashant-bhushan-s-contempt-pleas-says-sc/story-w5TzweXUZAqJLsPVUUGLKM.html

His condition is stated to be serious due to injuries he sustained and loss of blood.The man told hospital administration that he took this extreme step as he was depressed. “He had renal failure. His mother recently donated a kidney to him and then he tested positive for coronavirus. He was in a state of depression as he thought that he was becoming a burden for his family,” said RKS Dhakad, superintendent of Jaya Arogya government multi-specialty hospital. He said the man was admitted at the hospital on Saturday after he was found Covid-19 positive. “The man first slit his wrist at around 3 pm in the bathroom of the hospital and after a few minutes, he jumped off the third floor of the hospital. He fell on a tin shed and sustained serious injuries in his legs and hands. His condition is serious due to loss of blood,” Dhakad said.Gwalior superintendent of police Amit Sanghi said, “We have informed the patient’s family. We are investigating the matter and will record his statement once his condition stabilizes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patient-attempts-to-end-life-twice-in-hospital-in-gwalior/story-op1jKcDgJzyzv301k2g97H.html

I was surprised by a few things that were said. I think we should always maintain restraint and humility. There is no place for personal malice in politics. We had formed the government in Rajasthan after 5 years of hard work,” ANI quoted Pilot as saying late Monday night after a meeting with Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ahmed Patel and KC Venugopal in Delhi.Pilot, who had pitched camp Manesar with 18 MLAs had earlier been accused of hobnobbing with the BJP to bring down his own party’s government. On Monday, he insisted that there were issues that needed to be raised for the party’s interest.“Since past some time some MLAs were in Delhi, there were some issues which we wanted to highlight. I did that. I’d been saying since beginning that all these things were based on principle.

10-08-2020||India||Rajnath Singh outlines initiatives for self-reliance in defence||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday outlined a raft of initiatives to boost the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India movement) and reduce dependence on imported military hardware.Among the initiatives listed for the ‘Atma-Nirbharta Week’ celebrations are upgrading facilities of defence public sector undertakings, modernisation of shipyards, launching locally-made defence items and signing of new memoranda of understanding with the private sector to enhance indigenisation. During a virtual launch of some of the initiatives as part of the Atma-Nirbharta Week celebrations, Singh said the government had made “timely and thoughtful interventions” during the Covid-19 pandemic including issuing a negative list for imports, raising the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the defence sector and creating a separate budget for domestic capital procurement to promote self-reliance. From artillery guns to light military transport aircraft and conventional submarines to long-range land attack cruise missiles, India on Sunday announced that it will ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. “This list of negative items contains not only small items but weapon systems of high and critical technology. More such items will be added to this list shortly which will save crore of rupees in imports,” the minister said. It is an established fact that military balance between adversaries cannot be measured or evaluated on imported systems that reflect the degree to which a country’s security has been outsourced, said former army vice chief Lieutenant General (retd) AS Lamba.“With focus on research and development, new defence technologies and defence manufacturing, the negative import list released on Sunday reflects an aggressive and compelling strategy towards indigenisation,” General Lamba said. The former army vice chief added that India’s leap towards military industrialisation would alter the dynamics of not only the country’s capability and military posturing, but its export programme can bring greater confidence and stability in a new South Asia The Pinaka rocket complex at Ordnance Factory Chanda in Maharashtra is upgrading its facilities to meet the army’s enhanced requirement of rockets, and Bharat Electronics Limited has indigenised the Maareech integration facility for manufacturing, integration and testing of the anti-torpedo defence system designed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the defence ministry said in a statement. It added that the Kolkata-based Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd has enhanced its capacities to meet the production requirement for the ongoing P-17A project to build warships. Also, a steel preparation shop was inaugurated at the Goa Shipyard on Monday for indigenous construction of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) hulls for minesweeping vessels. Imports account for 60-65% of India’s military requirements and the country has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers. India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April. The ongoing border row with China in eastern Ladakh has lent fresh urgency to develop a robust defence industrial base to boost the military’s capabilities with locally-made weapons and systems. The focus on self-reliance in the defence sector comes at a time when India is making emergency military purchases from several countries including the United States, Russia, Israel and France. The border conflict has forced India to speed up the purchase of military hardware including fighter jets, smart air-to-ground weapons, missiles, rockets, multi-mission drones, air defence systems, GPS-guided artillery ammunition, tank ammunition and even assault rifle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-outlines-initiatives-for-self-reliance-in-defence/story-ewfDRcYIJs8CnlKg2x3MJJ.html
10-08-2020||India||‘Only needs to withdraw resignation’: Shashi Tharoor on Rahul Gandhi as Cong chief||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday said if Rahul Gandhi was ready to helm the Congress party he only had to withdraw his resignation and party workers, CWC members and everyone else would be willing to accept him as their leader since he had been the incumbent chief of the party earlier. “If Rahul Gandhi is ready to resume the leadership, he only has to withdraw his resignation. I think party workers, Congress Working Committee and everyone will accept that because he was the incumbent president elected in December 2017,” Tharoor said.“If he says, no I don’t want to come back, then the question that many of the party members are asking – ‘How long can we carry on like this?’ - that is the question. We would ideally like a clear-cut decision as soon as possible,” the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.ALSO READ | ‘Congress needs to find new chief to arrest perception of being rudderless’: Shashi TharoorA day earlier, on Sunday, Tharoor had said that the Congress needed to hasten the process of finding a full-term president to arrest the growing public perception that the party was “adrift and rudderless”. He also said that he certainly thought that Rahul Gandhi had the “mettle, capability and aptitude to once again lead the party”, but if he did not wish to do so then the party must “take action” and elect a new chief soon.The Congress party on the other hand announced on the same day within a few hours that Sonia Gandhi will continue as the interim president till such time that a “proper procedure” is implemented in the “not too distant future” to elect a party chief.ALSO READ | Sonia Gandhi to stay Congress president till election of new party chiefFormer party chief and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had quit as the president after the party’s massive drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls held in 2019 and despite repeated appeals from party colleagues and Congress workers, he had not taken back his resignation. Sonia Gandhi had then stepped in as interim president later that year.Sonia Gandhi’s tenure as interim chief comes to an end on August 10, one year after she assumed the post, but that does not indicate that the seat automatically falls vacant that day, senior Congress leaders have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-needs-to-withdraw-his-resignation-shashi-tharoor-on-rahul-gandhi-as-congress-chief/story-7H04qJjNzHqtuoIEqK8u8M.html

The arrests were made as part of the investigation,” the police commissioner said.Three district level committees involving police, revenue, fire and health officials conducted searches at hotel, hospital and residences of the heads of the two institutions. They seized documents pertaining to the lease agreement. The health department also launched verification of the Covid care centres across the state. Meanwhile, hospital managing director Dr P Ramesh Babu said in a video message that the safety aspects at the Covid care centre were the responsibility of the hotel management as per the MOU between Ramesh Hospital and Swarna Palace.“We provide treatment to the patients and the centre maintenance should be taken care of by the hotel management”, he said. He also revealed that Ramesh Hospital had taken two hotels on lease and had about 200 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-arrested-after-10-killed-in-fire-at-andhra-hotel-used-as-covid-centre/story-LHm1JQEtfyzqa5XuS7wGAK.html
10-08-2020||India||McDonald’s sues former CEO Steve Easterbrook for lying about sexual relationships||McDonald’s Corp. sued ousted leader Steve Easterbrook, seeking to recover tens of millions of dollars in severance pay after discovering evidence he had sexual relationships with multiple employees, tried to cover it up and arranged for one worker to get a lucrative stock award.His termination last fall over an improper relationship shouldn’t have included severance pay because he “concealed evidence and lied about his wrongdoing,” the company said in a filing.Easterbrook had originally admitted to having a consensual relationship with just one co-worker, but information the company received from an anonymous tip in July led the company to further investigate. It concluded he had been involved in sexual relationships with three additional company employees before his exit, according to a company filing Monday.The evidence also shows Easterbrook approved a special discretionary grant of restricted stock units worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to one of the employees after their first sexual encounter -- and just days before their second, the company said.As a result, the fast-food chain filed a complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court to recover any compensation and severance benefits that he received when he left his post. The company has also taken steps to prevent Easterbrook from exercising any stock options or selling any shares.Company MemoChris Kempczinski, who took over as CEO when Easterbrook was pushed out, alerted company employees about the action Monday.“We recently became aware, through an employee report, of new information regarding the conduct of our former CEO, Steve Easterbrook,” he wrote in the internal memo, reviewed by Bloomberg News. “While the board made the right decision to swiftly remove him from the company last November, this new information makes it clear that he lied and destroyed evidence regarding inappropriate personal behavior and should not have retained the contractual compensation he did upon his exit.”Easterbrook got $675,000 in severance and health insurance benefits and stock awards that Bloomberg valued at more than $37 million last November.McDonald’s shares were little changed in premarket trading Monday in New York. McDonald’s rose 3.5% this year through Friday, roughly in line with the S&P 500 Index.Naked photosAccording to the complaint, the evidence against Easterbrook includes dozens of naked or explicit photographs and videos of various women, including some employees, that Easterbrook had sent as attachments to his personal email account from his work account. The time stamps on the photos of employees show they were all taken in late 2018 or early 2019, when he was CEO.“The photographs are undisputable evidence that Easterbrook repeatedly violated the company’s prohibition of any kind of intimate relationship between employees in a direct or indirect reporting relationship,” McDonald’s said in the filing. “They are undisputable evidence that Easterbrook lied during the investigation into his behavior in October 2019.”The company said wasn’t aware of the photographs before July 2020, despite doing an earlier investigation of his behavior in the fall. That’s because Easterbrook appeared to have deleted the emails and photos from his company phone before it was searched by independent counsel in late October 2019, according to the complaint.However, the deletion of the emails from his phone didn’t also delete them from his email account stored on the company’s servers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mcdonald-s-sues-former-ceo-steve-easterbrook-for-lying-about-allegedly-inappropriate-sexual-relationships/story-83ek2FFUmayxJX94kLrALO.html

Till Monday, the total number of positive cases in the state has crossed 80,000 with the 1,256 cases in the last 24 hours. The state has also reported 637 deaths so far.The central team, led by NITI Aayog member Dr Vinod Kumar Paul, held several rounds of discussions with the state government officials, including chief secretary Somesh Kumar.On Monday, the team, which also consists of senior officials from the Union ministry of health, had a detailed discussion with state health minister Eatala Rajender. The team felt that an increase in testing is crucial to control the pandemic.“The state and central governments would work together on an action plan discussed in the meeting to flatten the curve,” Dr Paul said after the meeting.The Central team made a presentation on the ‘Delhi model’ to highlight the steps taken towards effective containment.The chief secretary explained to the Central team that testing had been ramped up in the state in the recent days. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, during the recent cabinet meeting, directed the officials to increase the testing to 40,000 daily and allotted special funds to handle the Covid pandemic in the state,” he said.The team was all praise for the state government for introducing an innovative mobile application – Home Isolation Telemedicine and Management (HITAM), through which the health of the Covid-19 patients under home isolation is being monitored. “The doctors have been extending telemedicine facility to the patients in home quarantine through HITAM application. The health department is being assisted by a team of senior officers for support on key thematic areas of pandemic management,” the chief secretary said.Paul said that details of the HITAM app would be shared with other states along with all good work done by the state in other areas related to Covid management.

10-08-2020||India||In UK, only 53% people likely to go in for a coronavirus vaccine finds recent study||A large number of young people in the United Kingdom, one of the worst hit countries by the Covid-19 pandemic, are likely to steer clear of the coronavirus vaccine, according to a new study. The research has found that 22% of people under the age of 34 have said they may or may not go in for the vaccine as opposed to 11% of those aged between 55 and 75—who have wanted to avoid the jab.The author of the study, carried out by the King’s College London (KCL), has cautioned that “conspiracy theories and mistrust of government, authority and science” could potentially pose a hindrance to conquering the Covid-19 infection.Explaining that the results of the research are “deeply concerning”, the authors have indicated that only about 50% of British people are committed to taking a coronavirus vaccine, as and when it is launched.The new research has found that people who avoid wearing masks, those who distrust scientists, and those who are of the opinion that “too much fuss is being made about the Covid-19 pandemic” are the ones most likely to refuse to take the vaccine.“Vaccines are one of our greatest achievements, and there is a great deal of faith that we’ll eventually develop an effective one for Covid-19 – but more people still need to be convinced of how important it could be for ending this crisis,” Professor Bobby Duffy, director of KCL’s Policy Institute said on the results of the new study.“Misconceptions about vaccines are among our most directly damaging beliefs, and they’re clearly influencing people’s intentions during the coronavirus crisis,” Professor Duffy said.Globally with nearly 200 countries being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, scientists believe that at least 70 per cent of the population per country will need to be vaccinated to provide “herd immunity” that is believed will get nations back to normal.Researchers and scientists working at frantic speed to find a vaccine for the infectious disease have expressed hope that an effective vaccine will be available next year, after clinical trials at Oxford University produced an immune response in volunteers, although it is still unclear how long that will last within the body.Gideon Skinner, research director at pollsters Ipsos Mori, said slightly more number of Britons appeared prepared to accept a Covid-19 vaccine than one for seasonal flu, but said the results were “still disturbing”.A total of 26 vaccine candidates are being developed, according to the World Health Organisation, as a process normally taking up to 15 years has been squeezed into a matter of months.The KCL study found, however, that only 53 per cent of the UK’s population is “certain or very likely” to get a vaccine against the virus. About one in six people (16 per cent) said they would reject it, or are likely to, 11 per cent said they did not know, while the remaining 20 per cent are only fairly likely to go in for a coronavirus vaccine.The findings were published soon after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hit out at anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists, describing them as “nuts”.Among the groups doubtful about getting a vaccine are those who think the government wants people to wear masks to control the public (34%), those doubting scientific experts (33%) and those who do not “follow the rules at all times” (24%).Among the pessimists, only 4% of people said a vaccine will never arrive – but just 44% think it will be available in a year or less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-uk-only-53-people-likely-to-go-in-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-finds-recent-study/story-n1AEyOcZDt38dewnu1SA8J.html

Last week, the Jammu and Kashmir administration extended her detention by another three months under the PSA.Mehbooba backed Faesal saying JKPM’s vision document was well within the realm of constitutional rights.“Unlike other mainstream parties, he had no political baggage & therefore enjoyed considerable popularity & credibility amongst masses. JKPMs vision document was well within realm of constitutional rights given to J&K.”She went on to accuse the Centre of arm twisting of political parties and leaders who refuse to accept scrapping of Article 370.Earlier Monday, the JKPM released a statement saying Faesal had asked the party to “spare him from the organisational responsibilities”. “Dr Shah Faesal had informed state executive members that he is not in a position to continue with political activities and wants to be freed from the responsibilities of the organisation,” the JKPM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-made-shah-faesal-change-his-mind-so-abruptly-asks-mehbooba-mufti/story-2yME5kzToog4CCf0k5pc0O.html
10-08-2020||India||Talk about ‘false corona positive reports’ gets 2 arrested in Odisha||The Odisha police have arrested two persons, including a Covid-recovered man, after an audio clip of the two persons allegedly discussing “false corona positive reports” in state hospitals went viral. A TV channel, TV channel belonging to the wife of senior BJP leader Baijayant Panda, has also been sent a notice for airing the clip. Bhubaneswar commissionerate police arrested one Biswajit Mohanty, a businessman, 47, and his friend Laxmikanta Behera, 46, after their conversation about the latter’s experience in a Covid hospital went viral. A showcause notice was issued to OTV, Odisha’s biggest news channel run by Jagi Mangat Panda.Bhubaneswar police commissionerate, in a statement, said the two were charged with criminal conspiracy as well as Sections 269, 270 and 505(b) of Indian Penal Code as well as Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act and section 52 of Disaster Management Act. Behera had recently recovered from Covid-19.“The audio clip was propagated by OTV news channel. The recording has been prepared, circulated, edited, uploaded and propagated with malafide and mischievous intention as the clip contains misleading and false information about Covid pandemic. The conversation is trying to make others believe that there are false corona positive reports and people are being shifted to hospitals showing them positive as there is a certain target of number of patients to be fetched by hospitals,” the police statement said.However, a careful perusal of the 9.36-minute long audio clip of Mohanty and Behera’s conversation on August 6 shows nothing serious that could trigger panic or anxiety about Covid. The freewheeling conversation between the two friends apart from talking of some “scams” has Behera praising the quality of food being served in the hospital.The wife of Mohanty said it was grossly undemocratic the way police picked up his husband on Sunday evening and released him on Monday morning before arresting him a few hours later. “Did they say anything against the government in the audio clip? My husband was talking to his friend and wanted to know about his experiences in Covid hospital. Is it a crime to discuss the Covid situation? My husband is diabetic and needs to take his medicines on time. However, he was picked up on the pretext of some discussion and kept away from home for more than 12 hours,” she alleged. The police also booked OTV and issued a show-cause notice to the channel for airing the audio clip. Though people have been booked by the Odisha police during the pandemic, many believe the arrest of the two persons in the audio clip was the result of its airing in OTV, run by Panda’s wife. Once a close confidant of chief minister Naveen Patnaik, the former MP is now his principal bete noire after they fell out some five years ago.The BJP leader was persecuted in October 2018 and his choppers seized by the Odisha police for his alleged bid to land over the Chilika Lake, an ‘eco-sensitive, no-flying zone’ in the coastal belt of Orissa. Responding to the arrests, Panda tweeted: “Odisha police have arrested two men who posted their phone chat online. Their “crime”? One of them allegedly tested Covid +ve & spoke of fake “treatment” at massive govt cost. This is just the latest of massive Corona related corruption scams in Odisha. Will FoE activists speak up,” asked Panda.The arrests and the showcause notice to the TV channel has triggered outrage in the state with several prominent voices slamming the government’s move. “Should not TV channels air complaints about the goings-on in Covid hospitals? What kind of democracy are we living in,” said renowned political commentator Rabi Das. Mayurbhanj MP Bishweswar Tudu too criticised the arrests and the showcause notice to the TV channel calling it a vengeful act. Union minister for MSME, Pratap Sarangi, said it was an attempt to suppress the freedom of speech of the media.The arrests come at a time when there have been litany of serious complaints about the government’s management of Covid-19 situation while cases are surging due to high positivity rate. Last month, the Covid-19 test results of a forest official in Ganjam district, was told to his family 24 hours after he died. Similarly, a 42-year-old man in Berhampur town in Covid hotspot district of Ganjam died in his home after an ambulance refused to take him to hospital over suspicions that he was Covid positive. The state on Monday posted 13 deaths, its highest single-day surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talk-about-false-corona-positive-reports-gets-2-arrested-in-odisha/story-PdC2xa0VENCrNtrvIOBAMP.html
10-08-2020||India||Sachin Pilot falls in line after Rahul meet, settles for 3-member panel to hear his side||The Congress on Monday decided to form a high-level committee to look into the grievances of all its rebel leaders in Rajasthan after Sachin Pilot met former party president Rahul Gandhi to end the revolt in the state unit that threatened the survival of the Ashok Gehlot government, people familiar with the development said.“They have had a frank, open and conclusive discussion. Shri Sachin Pilot has committed to working in the interest of the Congress party and the Congress government in Rajasthan,” Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said in a statement hours after Sachin Pilot’s hush-hush meeting with Rahul Gandhi on Monday.Venugopal said Congress president Sonia Gandhi had decided to set up a three-member committee to address the issues raised by “Sachin Pilot and the aggrieved MLA and arrive at an appropriate resolution thereof”.Congress leaders said the panel will have senior leaders as members and will “hear all the sides and also go into the details of the political turmoil” in the state unit before submitting its report to the high command.The pact ends the uncertainty for the Rajasthan government run by Ashok Gehlot that had been teetering on the edge for a month ever since Pilot and his group of 18 lawmakers parked themselves in Delhi and Gurugram in early July. Gehlot, who has claimed the support of 102 MLAs in a 200-member assembly, is due to face a trust vote when the state assembly meets on 14 August.Also Read: Will welcome rebels back if Cong high command forgives them: Ashok GehlotThe support from Sachin Pilot’s camp gives him the cushion that he had lost when Pilot left with his lawmakers loyal to him, reportedly irked over summons received from the police probing a sedition case against people who wanted to bring down the Gehlot government. The rebellion cost Pilot and two of his loyalist members their cabinet berths.Pilot, who was the state’s deputy chief minister and state Congress chief, was also evicted from the two posts. As his camp refused to respond to appeals to head back home from the Congress, Gehlot let it be known that the two of them hadn’t been on talking terms for 18 months and accused Pilot of plotting with the BJP for six months to pull down his government.It is not clear if Pilot’s next role in the party would have anything to do with Rajasthan or Gehlot. Asked if Rajasthan will be out of bounds for Pilot, the functionary said, “We are not aware of any promise given to him by Rahul Gandhi. What transpired between them at the personal level is not known to us.” The functionary quoted above also said that many rebel leaders, including seven-time legislator Bhanwarlal Sharma, had established contact with Congress general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal on Sunday and subsequently met Gehlot on Monday to assure him of his support. He claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not play ball as its house is divided in Rajasthan and there were also apprehensions that some of its legislators were not keen to go with Pilot and other rebel Congress leaders. “With BJP a divided house and the Congress taking a strong stand, the rebel legislators were feeling the heat and that is why they started approaching our central leadership,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-falls-in-line-after-rahul-meet-settles-for-panel-to-hear-his-side/story-wjPCTXXmwjZnwDtSxvxXVO.html

If need be, I will file a defamation case”, he said.Raut is the executive editor of the Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ newspaper, where he has a weekly column.In his column, Raut has claimed that the actor didn’t share good relations with his father K K Singh. “I have received such information. How many times did Rajput visit his father in Patna in the last few years?” he asked.Raut also went on to say Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey was working for a political party and alleged he tried to contest an election on a BJP ticket. “What can you expect from such a police force?” he asked.Rajput’s maternal uncle R C Singh said an attempt is being made to divert the direction of CBI inquiry. He said Rajput had a very good relationship with his father and his father had not remarried, as alleged by Raut.BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand also alleged that the Maharashtra government tried to destroy evidence of Rajput’s death and demanded that the CBI conduct a narco-test on Raut and Aditya Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-s-mla-cousin-tears-into-sanjay-raut-for-comment-on-actor-s-father/story-QjZN89tYZmUNbKyan93ZjP.html
10-08-2020||India||PNB fraud: ED opposes Robin Modi’s petition challenging confiscation of property||Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday opposed the petition filed by Rohin Modi (19), the son of diamantaire Nirav Modi, a prime accused in the Rs.13,500-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case and arrested in London by the Scotland Yard authorities in March 2019, challenging confiscation of properties purportedly belonging to a trust started in his own name. Additional solicitor-general (ASG) Anil Singh, who represented ED, supported the special court order issued on June 8, passed under Section 12 of the Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, 2018, ordering the confiscation of movable and immovable properties worth Rs. 1,396 crore, belonging to Nirav and his firms. Singh said no notice or opportunity of being heard was required to be given to Rohin, as his parents, Nirav and Ami, both the trustees, were represented before the special court and were heard before passing of the order under challenge. Singh added that no relief could be granted to Rohin, as Nirav has defrauded PNB to the tune of Rs. 6,498 crore, laundered most of the money outside the country, and himself fled to the United Kingdom (UK). Rohin moved HC, through advocate Lakshyaved Odhekar, challenging the special court order primarily on the ground that no notice was issued either to Rohin Trust or him individually, before ordering the confiscation of the trust properties, which include a penthouse in Samudra Mahal building at Worli and about 40 costly artworks that belonged to the trust. These properties have been ordered to be confiscated along with other movable and immovable properties purportedly belonging to Nirav and his firms. Rohin’s counsel, advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, pointed out that section 4 of the FEO Act, 2018, mandates that the ED shall submit a list of all the persons, other than the FEO, interested in or who may have an interest in the properties sought to be confiscated. He said ED knew that Rohin Trust owned the paintings and the penthouse, but neither the trust nor the name of Rohin was mentioned in the list of interested persons submitted by ED, and no notice was given to them, despite the mandatory legal norm. Bhandari also pointed out that section 10 of the FEO Act, 2018, provides for an opportunity of hearing to such interested persons, but no such opportunity was given to Rohin before passing the order. He urged HC to grant Rohin an opportunity of hearing to point out to the special court that the penthouse cannot be ordered to be confiscated to the central government, terming it “proceeds of crime”, as the premises were purchased in 2006 --- about five years before PNB even started giving loans to Nirav and his firms. Bhandari pleaded with the court to direct ED to maintain the status quo with respect to the penthouse. Singh responded to the contention about the penthouse by pointing out that the trust was started with a paid-capital of only Rs. 1,000 and it could not have purchased the apartment for Rs. 24 crore. He argued that the property was purchased by Nirav, as Ami and Rohin have a beneficial interest in the Rohin Trust of 90℅ and 10℅, respectively, Bhandari contended that Ami, too, was required to be given notice and an opportunity of being heard. A two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices Sadhana Jadhav and NJ Jamadar, however, adjourned the matter for the next hearing on Thursday (August 13) after finding that the file before it did not contain reasoned order of the special court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pnb-fraud-ed-opposes-robin-modi-s-petition-challenging-confiscation-of-property/story-eug6W7za3drD5nX0hjSU2L.html

On Sunday he succumbed to the disease at the Civil Hospital, Solapur. There is no clarity about any medical history in his case, but he was a little overweight and was given indoor duties,” Inspector Arun Pawar of Pandharpur police station said. Mulani is survived by his wife and two sons.In the second case, 49-year-old head constable Vijaykumar Bansode, who was attached to the Ulhasnagar Central police station, died of Covid-19. “A resident of Ambernath, Bansode was undergoing treatment at the Meera Hospital in Kalyan after he was detected Covid-19 positive recently. He had no medical history,” Senior inspector Ganpat Pingle, attached to the Thane Police Headquarters said.In the third case of death due to coronavirus, 50-year-old police naik Shirish Mutyar of Sagari police station succumbed to the virus on Sunday at the Hinduja Hospital.

10-08-2020||India||Police suspect mass murder and suicide in death of 11 Pakistani refugees in Jodhpur||A woman who was a nurse, possibly gave sedatives and then injected insecticide into 10 members of her family taking her own life, said a senior police official on Monday as a probe continued into the death of 11 people in Jodhpur district’s Lodata town on Sunday.Police had earlier suspected a suicide pact. The 11 people belonged to a Hindu family which had migrated from Pakistan in 2015. Their bodies were found in a small house at a farm in Jodhpur district’s Lodata town on Sunday morning. The victims were identified as Budharam (75), Antara Devi (70), their son, Ravi, 35, daughters Laxmi and Priya and their six grandchildren.Only one member of the family survived. Kewalram who claimed to have gone out in the night to guard his farm, later returned and slept on the verandah of the house. He also claimed that he was not aware of what happened inside the house on Saturday night and that he saw he bodies only on Sunday morning“Preliminary probe suggests that the deceased were first given sedatives in food by one of the victims identified as Priya, who was a nurse. After victims felt unconscious, they were given insecticide injections and the poison mixed directly with blood and they died in sleep,” said Rahul Barhat, Jodhpur superintendent of police (SP). “Priya injected the poison in her body through a cannula (a thin tube inserted in the vein or body to administer medicine) on her leg,” the SP said. He said the injections were given in a very “professional manner” and only Priya, a trained nurse, could have done it.On the basis of the investigation, the police said that there were two possibilities. First, it was a case of mass suicide. Second, Priya committed the murders and then killed herself. The possibilities fit with the evidence that there were no injury or marks on the bodies of any of the victims.Police are still baffled by the motive for the crime. In its investigation, the police have found that there was a dispute between Kewalram and Ravi, two brothers, and their in-laws for a last couple of years, which was also mentioned in the alleged suicide note found from the house. The note also spoke of financial hardship the family was facing.Kewalram and Ravi had married sisters from a Bheel tribal family, whose parents now live in Jodhpur city. Their wives went to their parental house with their children, a few months ago, as the martial dispute became murkier, police said.“Between 2018 and 2020, Kewalram and his in-laws had filed complaints and counter complaints accusing each other of harassment. In the latest complaint lodged at Mandor police station in Jodhpur city in March this year, the in-laws accused the entire family of domestic violence,” said another police officer, who was not willing to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Kewalram told police that his family suspected all of them could be arrested in the domestic violence case. They were also unsure about getting Indian citizenship, if they were arrested and spoke about the possibility of their repatriation to Pakistan, the officer said.The victim’s family had come to India from Sangad district of Sindh province of Pakistan in 2015, a year after the in-laws family came and settled in Jodhpur city. As per the citizenship law, a Pakistani has to be resident of India for seven years before applying for citizenship.On why Priya could kill her family, Barhat said they did not have evidence to suggest that she killed her family. “Priya was a professional nurse and therefore, there was a high probability that she did it. But, again survival of Kewalram is a big question mark in the entire story,” he said.The SP said the medical reports would answer several questions. On Monday, the post-mortem of the 11 bodies was conducted after Covid-19 tests came negative. Later, with help of district administration the funeral was performed. A team of medical experts would examine the post-mortem results, a police officer said. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said thorough investigation will be conducted into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-suspect-mass-murder-and-suicide-in-death-of-11-pakistani-refugees-in-jodhpur/story-MlFKugNgJ1GIYfLd3u0CxI.html
10-08-2020||India||Another attempt to cap Assam gas well blowout fails||Another attempt to cap the blowout of an Oil India Limited (OIL) natural gas well, which has been on fire since June 9 in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district, failed on Monday due to technical glitches. “The blowout preventer (BOP) stack was successfully placed over the wellhead. While BOP stack alignment job was underway to insert the studs, one of the two bull lines connected to the Athey Wagon, which was lifting the BOP stack, came out from the socket due to the impact of excessive heat,” said an OIL statement. “From the safety point of view and stability required for alignment of the BOP stack on the wellhead, experts decided to safely remove the BOP stack from the wellhead. Operations will resume after carrying out necessary rectification jobs,” it added. The BOP is a specialised valve --- a device used to seal control and monitor oil and natural gas wells to prevent blowouts, or the uncontrolled release of gas or oil from a well. They are usually installed in stacks of other valves. An Athey Wagon is a device used to place the BOP stack, which weighs around three tonnes. It consists of a track-mounted boom lift with a hook on one end that is used to place the BOP stack on the wellhead. On July 31, experts were attempting to place the BOP stack on the wellhead when the Athey Wagon “toppled over” leading to the suspension of work on capping the blowout. The gas well had a blowout on May 27, when workover operation, or maintenance work, to locate a new gas reservoir was underway. While efforts to cap the blow out were underway, the well suddenly caught fire on June 9 and two firefighters were killed in the blaze that is yet to be doused. Installation of the BOP is the penultimate task needed to complete the operation. Once the BOP is installed, the process of “killing the well” starts immediately. According to OIL officials, that is done by injecting a “kill fluid”, a sludge-like specially prepared mud, into the well slowly to push the gas from the well back to the reservoir. The process takes around two-three days, as the fluid needs to fill the entire length of the 3.5-kilometre deep well. Initially, OIL had said that the well would be plugged in a month. Later, the deadline was extended to July 7. But floods, technical glitches, and burn injury of three foreign experts while attempting to douse the fire have led to several delays. Since the Baghjan well is located close to Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and the ecologically-sensitive Maguri Motapung Wetland, there were fears of environmental damage to the area due to the blowout and fire. Several studies by different agencies are underway to measure the extent of the damage. In June, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered the formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and subsequent fire and assess the damage caused to human life, wildlife, and the environment because of the industrial disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-attempt-to-cap-assam-gas-well-blowout-fails/story-AXUeM0A5YbV6GK13S5xqNP.html
10-08-2020||India||At meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Sachin Pilot gets an ‘assurance’ on key grievance||Sachin Pilot, the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister, whose revolt spelt uncertainty for the ruling Congress in the state, reached out to the party leadership in Delhi and held a meeting with Rahul Gandhi on Monday, according to people aware of the developments.A leader from the Pilot camp confirmed to HT that a meeting took place for over two hours at Gandhi’s residence at 12, Tughlaq Road. He said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has been in contact with Pilot, too, was present.“The Gandhis did save the day for the (Ashok) Gehlot government,” said the leader quoted above. “They (the Congress leadership) assured Pilot that all issues that he had would be looked into.’’Another leader privy to the details told HT that a committee may be announced to look into the unresolved issues between Gehlot and Pilot, who have had a series of differences since the Congress coming to power in the state in December 2018. Through the day, representatives of both sides held follow-up meetings to hammer out the details of a truce agreement. An announcement is expected soon.The big question is now whether Pilot will go back to Rajasthan or if he will be accommodated in the central Congress leadership. When asked, his side, however, did not rule out Pilot attending the upcoming session of the Rajasthan assembly beginning August 14. “It is on the 14th; so there is time left. We will be making an announcement soon,” leaders in the Pilot camp said.The second leader told HT that Pilot had agreed to give up his aspirations of being Rajasthan chief minister for now. However, there was no confirmation of this from Pilot’s side.Another senior Congress leader aware of the developments sounded hopeful about the possible deal. “...since they met, a positive outcome is expected,” the third leader said.The developments take place exactly a month after Pilot and 18 dissident Rajasthan legislators left Jaipur and rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot.It was Pilot who sought an appointment with former party chief Gandhi, according to leaders privy to the details, who also said the now-dismissed Rajasthan deputy chief minister has been speaking to senior leaders Ahmed Patel and KC Venugopal in what is being seen as an apparent softening of his stance.This was the first time that Gandhi met Pilot since the latter left Jaipur after the state police issued him a show-cause notice in a case involving a plot to bring down the government.Pilot has till now insisted on the removal of Gehlot as chief minister as a pre-condition for any sort of rapprochement, while the Congress asked him and his legislators supporting him to give up the “hospitality” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before starting a conversation on resolving the current impasse.Pilot’s team, which has been camping in various places from Faridabad to Manesar after spending several days at the ITC Grand Bharat hotel, meanwhile, pointed out that the Congress Legislature Party meeting had completely ruled out a return of the rebels. Pilot’s rebellion stems from his complaints against the operational style of Gehlot, according to the Pilot camp.While the Gehlot camp has been claiming the support of 102 legislators (including allies) in the 200-member House, Pilot’s side has not been able to increase its numbers beyond 19, although this number was previously claimed to be at least 30 by the rebel leader and his aides. The Pilot camp is believed to have the support of three independents as well. Monday’s developments come against the backdrop of the Congress suggesting, at least at the state level, that ties with Pilot are set to be severed. On Sunday, the general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande, ruled out a return of Pilot and his supporters. “In politics, sometimes to save democracy, dil par pathar rakhna padta hai (difficult calls need to be taken),” he told the media.In the run-up to the assembly session on August 14 that is likely to feature a floor test, the opposition BJP has also shifted 20 of its 72 legislators to Gujarat to prevent any poaching attempts by the Congress.While Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia denied any internal rifts, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje met party president JP Nadda and defence minister Rajnath Singh last week to discuss the political developments in her state.The BJP will hold a meeting of its legislators and those belonging to its alliance partner, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) of Hanuman Beniwal on Tuesday, the day Rajasthan high court will hear a petition challenging the merger of six MLAs of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with the Congress.These BSP legislators have since moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer of their case from the Rajasthan high court to the country’s top court.(With inputs from Aurangzeb Naqshbandi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-meets-rahul-gandhi-priyanka-gandhi-rajasthan-truce-soon/story-lePZkjGnlRDTq1NE1TrEVO.html
10-08-2020||India||Andhra’s new industrial policy to focus on manufacturing sector, generate jobs for locals||More than a year after coming to power in Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress party government on Monday finally announced its new industrial policy focussing on the manufacturing sector with a regional balance and generation of employment for locals through skill development. Unveiling the new policy at the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, state industries and infrastructure minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said the core theme of the policy was to provide support to industries across the business value chain – from approvals to setting up industries, supporting their operations and scaling up their business. The new industrial policy proposes to reimburse state GST to Medium, Large and Mega industrial units generating huge employment for a period of five years, provide special incentives for women entrepreneurs hailing from SC/ST/OBC communities and reserve 16.2 per cent and 6 per cent of industrial plots for SC and ST entrepreneurs respectively. The minister said the state government was contemplating establishment of a new initiative called “YSR AP One” by integrating different agencies like industrial development corporation, infrastructure corporation, economic development board and micro, small and medium enterprises corporation etc to extend as many as 10 services for entrepreneurs and industrialists under one roof. “This new organisation would help entrepreneurs by providing handholding during pre-establishment and setting up of the industrial unit, extending post setup support, ensuring forward and backward linkages and accessing market and new technologies,” the minister said. The “YSR AP One” will have 10 different wings such as entrepreneurship facilitation cell, market research cell, marketing and branding cell, sales support cell, scheme support cell, business enablement cell, investor reach-out cell, incentive management cell etc., that would help entrepreneurs in various ways, he said. The minister further said the state government had identified industrial zoning as a key focus area to ensure planned industrial development and provide a risk-free, investment-friendly environment for setting up and operating industries in the state with minimal impact on the environment. “Mega industries will be allowed in industrial parks and independent locations as per the environment management plan. Similarly, the government would develop industrial parks for MSMEs with all the facilities including ready-built factory shells. The government has also proposed to make changes in the land allotment for industries. In place of the existing lease and buy model, the government has introduced a composite lease and buy model, in which land is allotted to the industries on lease for a period of 33 years with an option of buying the land after 10 years of successful business operations. Stating that the manufacturing sector as an employment provider continues to be top priority for the state government, Gautam Reddy said the government would undertake structural reforms to accelerate industrialisation in the state. “We believe that providing the right facilities at the right cost and offering transparent approvals is critical to the success of the industrial sector,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-s-new-industrial-policy-to-focus-on-manufacturing-sector-generate-jobs-for-locals/story-rBtwUbbfIdO7hze1RbNAyK.html
10-08-2020||India||Villagers oppose setting up of IIT Goa campus on forested stretch, warn those supporting the project||Panaji: Villagers opposing the setting up of permanent campus of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) on a forested stretch of land at Melaulim village in Goa have warned that those supporting the project would enter the hamlet at their own peril. On Sunday, around 500 villagers from Melaulim and surrounding hamlets put up the warning signboard underlining it would not be an empty threat against the setting up of the IIT campus. “This is a direct stern warning to all those entering our village with the intention to hurt our sentiments, livelihood, faith, and rich biodiversity,” alleged Shashikant Sanvordekar, the convenor of the Melaulim Gram Panchakroshi Samiti. The signage unequivocally warns “no entry” for the IIT campus in Melaulim village and that “any person visiting this area will be responsible for h/his own security”. “We’d like to draw the government’s attention to the fact that our existence is dependent on the land, which is our precious possession,” said Shubham Shivolkar, another villager. Located in the state’s eastern corner in the foothills of the Western Ghats and over 50 kilometres (km) from the state capital Panaji, the proposed permanent campus site for the IIT is a thickly-forested area and interspersed with cashew trees. Villagers claimed that the cashew trees have sustained them for generations. They are demanding that the proposed IIT campus is shifted to a different location, where the ecological impact will be less severe. Though Goa was allocated an IIT in 2014, it has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College. Earlier, though the state government had identified two sites --- in Canacona and Sanguem sub-districts – to set up a permanent IIT campus, both were scrapped due to public protests and after the opposition had alleged a land scam. Rumblings of protest and murmurs of discontent were started by residents of Melaulim village and from adjoining hamlets in early February, when the state government made it known that it would hand over the land for the IIT’s permanent campus in May. Trouble started when the police bundled off in a vehicle a section of villagers, who had called a press conference to protest against the move. The video of the alleged police high-handedness went viral on social media and sparked public outrage. Though Melaulim village falls in an eco-sensitive zone, it hasn’t been formally declared as one because the state government notification to that effect is still pending. The plot on which the IIT permanent campus is slated to come up is a revenue land and belongs to the state government. However, Melaulim villagers have contended that the crisis has deepened because they don’t have the required documentation to prove that they have rights over the land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-oppose-setting-up-of-iit-goa-campus-on-forested-stretch-warn-those-supporting-the-project/story-AhDN5eVcQc1gf9GliiGJ0M.html
10-08-2020||India||Kashmir politician Shah Faesal is still IAS officer, erases Twitter timeline||Shah Faesal, the 2010 IAS topper from Kashmir who resigned from the civil services to launch his political party last year, stepped down from the J&K People’s Movement’s leadership role. Faesal, who has been under detention since August last year, changed his Twitter bio that identified him as the JKPM chief on Sunday evening, triggering speculation that he could exit politics.Faesal had announced his resignation from the civil services in January 2019 and launched his party, Jammu and Kashmir People’s Movement, two months later. When parliament scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in early August last year, he was one of the sharpest critics of the move . He was detained under the Public Safety Act soon after when he was on his way to Harvard to pursue a course, released in June this year and placed under house arrest a day later.But his resignation from government service was never accepted, reportedly because the Centre had initiated disciplinary proceedings against him over his tweets on rape in July 2018.The central government’s website on IAS officers continues to show him as a serving IAS officer. It does not, however, indicate if he was placed under suspension under a rule that automatically deems All India Service officers held in detention for more than 48 hours to have been suspended.The JKPM, the party that the 37-year-old founded, on Monday confirmed that the change in Twitter bio reflected his changed status in the party.In a statement released on Monday, the JKPM said Faesal, who trained as a doctor before joining the civil services, had asked the party to “spare him from the organisational responsibilities”. “Dr Shah Faesal had informed state executive members that he is not in a position to continue with political activities and wants to be freed from the responsibilities of the organisation,” the JKPM said.The party has accepted his request “so that he can better continue with his life and contribute whichever way he chooses”.Shah’s success in the civil services examination had inspired many young Kashmiris to sit for the fiercely-competitive examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. This year, a record 16 candidates cleared the examination from Jammu and Kashmir, many of them from remote parts of the Kashmir valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-ias-topper-shah-faesal-won-t-lead-kashmir-party-he-founded-sparks-buzz-about-exit-from-politics/story-KeuQgnFqo4pU9QIqewHAjN.html
10-08-2020||India||Rain and topography triggering flash floods, landslides in Uttarakhand hills, say experts||Spells of heavy rain for short periods, bigger catchment areas of streams and topographical conditions are leading to cloudbursts, flash floods and landslides in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand, say experts.Over 40 people have died in rain-related disasters in Uttarakhand in the current monsoon. Piyoosh Rautela, executive director of Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre in Uttarakhand said, “In the hills, the catchment area of even small streams is very large, these streams can be seasonal also, but during monsoons with heavy rainfall the water spills. This heavy rainfall leads to flash floods or rain-induced disasters.” He also said that due to the topographical conditions, likelihood of cloudbursts or flash floods happening in the hills is more compared to plains. “The physiography or geomorphic conditions of the mountains is such that the wind gets a sudden upward thrust which leads to cloud formation. But due to the topography of mountains or valleys, in particular, the winds rise to form clouds and then rainfall occurs in a small area or the clouds get trapped in a valley amid mountains as the monsoonal winds are not able to cross the topographic barriers (mountains). Due to this the rainfall recorded in those areas is high leading to disasters,” said Rautela. According to the state disaster control room, three cloudburst incidents have been reported so far this year since June 15 in Pithoragarh district. Officials from the control room said that 33 people have died due to cloudbursts and flash floods due to heavy rain and 11 have died due to landslides across the state. Around 18 people have been injured due to landslides, flash floods and cloudbursts, while four are missing. Officials from the Meteorological Centre in Dehradun said that an incident of rainfall is termed as a cloudburst only when a particular area receives 100 mm of rainfall within an hour. Bikram Singh, director of Regional Meteorological Centre said, “Landslides take place with continuous rainfall, it could be due to heavy or moderate rainfall, but cloudbursts leading to flash floods happen when a particular area receives minimum 100 mm of rainfall within an hour. This year, as per rainfall records, 100 mm rainfall has not been witnessed at any particular location. In 2017, around 9 4mm rainfall was recorded in Dehradun, which was considered as a cloudburst.” He added that in the hills, even 50 mm to 60 mm hourly rainfall can cause harm as water levels in streams rise leading to flash floods. According to the MeT department, Uttarakhand has received 558.6mm of rainfall from June to August 5 compared to 655.1 mm for these months. Bageshwar district has received the maximum rainfall with a 148% departure from normal rainfall limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-and-topography-triggering-flash-floods-landslides-in-uttarakhand-hills-say-experts/story-iuWn6XrQOkTWusynjkLYDP.html

Observing a day-long fast at his residence in Alwar, Rajasthan; Singh, the waterman of India, urged the public to observe a similar non-violent protest to extend their support to the seer’s agitation. “Support is pouring in from across the country. On Monday, people from all walks of life observed the fast. I urge the government to address this important issue on a priority basis and meet the demands raised by the revered Matri Sadan saint,” said Singh. Earlier in January, Singh had organised a two-day Ganga Environment Conservation convention at Matri Sadan under the aegis of Tarun Bharat Sangh. “We regard the Ganges as a deity and mother. We need to preserve the river’s sanctity, purity, unhindered flow, and ecology. The rise in pollutants, haphazard construction of hydropower projects, operation of stone crushers, largescale quarrying and indifferent attitude of the government doesn’t augur well for the Ganges,” Singh had said. Swami Shivanand Saraswati, the founder of Matri Sadan ashram in Haridwar, is on an indefinite fast since August 3. The seer has demanded the scrapping of all hydropower projects on the Ganges, Yamuna and its sub-tributaries, prohibition on quarrying on the rivers’ bed, enactment of the Ganga Act, and the inclusion of environmental activists in its drafting panel, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganga-activist-on-fast-unto-death-in-haridwar-gets-support-from-magsaysay-awardee/story-Yvm84y1ksXWegITPjDjpgP.html
10-08-2020||India||NIA team in Dubai to question accused in Kerala gold smuggling case||Investigating the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leg of Kerala gold smuggling scandal, a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) reached Dubai on Sunday night to interrogate key accused - Faisal Fareed - and collect evidence gathered by the authorities there, people familiar with the development said. Apart from Fareed, who used to send gold in the diplomatic baggage from Dubai, the two-member NIA team will question a couple of other suspects as well who have been taken into custody by the Dubai police, the officials said. A senior official cited above, who didn’t wish to be named, said that Fareed’s firm was contracted in the UAE to clear and send the diplomatic baggage to India. It is also suspected that Fareed is the one who had set up a network of hawala dealers and couriers who helped in disposing of/selling the gold. He originally hails from Kerala but resides in the UAE. The anti-terror probe agency had last month also approached the Interpol seeking a “blue notice” against Fareed. It was found that Fareed had forged the documents - seal and emblem - of the UAE embassy to ensure diplomatic protection for the baggage and the gold coming here was to be used for terror activities. During its stay in Dubai, the NIA team will also seek details of shell companies, which were used for transferring the money, as well as hawala operators linked to gold smuggling. The UAE authorities are learnt to have conducted substantial investigation already on India’s request and are likely to hand over its findings to the NIA team. The federal anti-terror probe agency is probing “terror angle” in the large scale smuggling of gold in Kerala.Apart from Faisal Fareed and Swapna Suresh, NIA has identified K T Ramees as the mastermind of the whole racket. Ramees is currently in judicial custody. Last week, it had arrested Muhammad Ali, a Popular Front of India (PFI) member. The outfit, however, denied Ali being associated with it. In all, NIA has arrested 10 accused in the case so far, including Swapna Suresh, who helped in air consignment of UAE consulate at Thiruvananthapuram in which 30 kg gold was recovered last month. The agency had informed a court last week that prime accused Swapna Suresh had a strong connection with Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office. A larger terror conspiracy is being probed by multiple agencies – NIA, ED and Customs. The NIA had said earlier that “the accused persons had conspired to damage the monetary stability of India by destabilising the economy by smuggling large quantity of gold from abroad and it is suspected that they had used these proceeds of smuggling for financing terrorism through various means”. It has further claimed that “using diplomatic baggage of UAE as a cover to transact illegal business may have serious repercussions in the diplomatic relations with the government of UAE and it is prejudicial to the monetary and economic security of India as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-team-in-dubai-to-interrogate-accused-in-kerala-gold-smuggling-case/story-jbyzOQeJjk01r27U8XGPQO.html

Rawat who visited Gairsain in Chamoli district on Sunday along with his supporters taunted chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat for going slow on the new capital.They raised slogans in Garhwali dialect saying ‘Trivendra Singh Bhaiji Kakh Cha Tumhri Grishmakalin Sarkar’ (Brother Trivendra Singh where is your summertime government here). Harish Rawat who visited the Assembly building in Gairsain and other residential establishments, attacked the BJP government saying, “After about three and a half years of this government, not a single new brick has been laid for any construction here. All existing construction was done during my government.” Gairsain was declared the state summer capital by CM Trivendra Singh Rawat during the budget session on March 4 amid intense politicking between BJP and the opposition Congress.Rawat said, “No new project has been approved by this government. Work is being done in all those projects which were approved during our government. Their announcement of the state summer capital just seems to be on the paper with nothing to see on the ground for any development pertaining to it ….One can see all sorts of signboards here but not a single one stating that this is the state summer capital.” The former chief minister accused the government of dragging its feet over actually shifting to the new summer capital.“Three months have passed since the summer started but not a single minister or secretary from the secretariat has moved here which can signify that the government is unwilling to shift here as per its promise. This is an insult of Gairsain as well as Uttarakhand,” said Rawat. “We have already said we will make it the permanent capital of Uttarakhand if our party comes to power in next Assembly elections.” The BJP termed Rawat’s visit as a mere ‘political gimmick to grab media attention.’ BJP state vice president Devendra Bhasin said, “Rawat has been a master of misleading people and doing irrelevant politics. This Gairsain visit is a part of that only. He just wants to be in the media with such acts.” Bhasin also said that “Rawat should answer that if he is so worried about Gairsain then why didn’t he declare it the summer capital or capital during his tenure? He is just pretending to show affection for Gairsain now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-brick-laid-at-new-capital-gairsain-uttarakhand-ex-cm-harish-rawat-slams-bjp/story-aqEeWPQiLxXXkZOaWn82NI.html

The meeting, which was attended by the chief ministers of Kerala, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and the Karnataka home minister, also reviewed the preparedness to deal with the south-west monsoon. The chief ministers complimented the efforts of central agencies including NDRF teams for their timely deployment and rescue efforts, said news agency ANI quoting the Prime Minister’s Office. The Prime Minister emphasised on better coordination between all central and state agencies to have a permanent system for forecasting of floods and extensive use of innovative technologies for improving forecast and warning system, according to the PMO.Continuing heavy rainfall over the last few days have affected lakhs of people, resulting in loss of life and disruption of normal life. In Kerala, a landslide occurred in Idukki district following heavy rainfall last week in which 49 people have died so far. The National Disaster Response Force is battling rain, slush, mush and rocky terrain in rescue operations at the site.India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued orange alert in for Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Idukki, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasargod districts today.. In neighbouring Karnataka, several parts of Malnad, coastal and interior Karnataka and Kodagu district have been affected by torrential rains causing flood-like situation and landslides. The state has so far incurred a loss to the tune of Rs 3,500-4,00 crore as a result of rains and floods, revenue minister R Ashoka said on Monday. During the meeting with the prime minister, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai sought Rs 4,000 crore financial help from the Centre to tackle the situation. He also sought immediate release of the next instalment of SDRF fund of Rs 395 crore. In Bihar, around 74 lakh people in 16 districts have been affected by the flood situation while the deaths caused due to rain-related incidents stand at 23, according to PTI.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar raised the issue of Nepal’s non-cooperation in flood management at Monday’s meeting with PM Modi and sought Centre’s intervention in the matter, the agency added.

10-08-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh’s bail plea rejected by NIA court||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Kochi on Monday rejected the bail application of the main accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, and ordered that provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act will remain in place.Her counsel had opposed the UAPA saying no terror angle was involved and the case only dealt with economic offences but Assistant Solicitor General P Vijaykumar appearing for the NIA contended that major proceeds from smuggling were diverted to fund anti-national activities. After a week-long hearing, quite unusual in bail petitions, the court had posted it for a decision on Monday. This is the first time UAPA has been imposed in the country in a smuggling case. “Earlier smuggling came under the Customs Act but after the amendment in UAPA, money laundering and serious economic offences that affect the country’s stability also come under it. True, this is first time UAPA has been applied in a smuggling case,” Supreme Court lawyer M R Abhilash said. After hearing the versions of both sides in detail, the court ruled that considering the case diary and other details submitted by the probe agency her bail application will not stand. The NIA had produced the letter of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan which he wrote to the PM two days after the case surfaced on July 5 seeking a high-level central agency probe into the case. During the hearing, NIA also said the accused was influential and she had a good rapport with the CM’s office, bureaucracy and the state police. The NIA said a portion of the proceeds from the gold smuggling was diverted to fund anti-national activities. It also said that after a preliminary investigation it found that one of the suspects, KT Ramees, who is in NIA custody, was in touch with some fundamentalist organizations. He also undertook many foreign trips including Tanzania in Africa and he was suspected to be a part of the international smuggling and drug racket, it said. But her lawyer insisted that the terror angle was brought in without any reason. At one point, the court also agreed she had no direct links with terror activities. Her counsel also said she was a victim of intense political rivalry between the CPI (M)-led state government and the BJP-led Union government but the NIA citied the CM’s letter saying both governments wanted a thorough inquiry into the case and politics was dragged into the case intentionally. After her bail plea was dismissed, her counsel said he will move a higher court. Meanwhile, people familiar with the probe said an NIA team had reached the United Arab Emirates and it will question Faisal Fareed, the third accused in the case, reportedly under the custody of the Dubai police. Earlier, Interpol had issued a red corner notice against him after the NIA’s request. It will also interrogate three others whose names cropped up during the questioning of KT Ramees. There are also reports that the MEA sought permission of the UAE government to “interview and take a statement,” of the consular attaché who left the country after the seizure of 30 kg gold which had arrived as part of a diplomatic consignment. UAE is a friendly country where at least 25 lakh Indians are working, so the MEA is very cautious in its approach, a senior official said. After the case came to light, the UAE embassy had issued a statement “that some former employees had misused Swapna Suresh had earlier worked with the consular office in Thiruvananthapuram. During investigation the NIA also found that both of them had allegedly forged the consular seal, stamp and other documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-swapna-suresh-s-bail-plea-rejected-by-nia-court/story-fVi6b9ZBCmQSS5j3ANPdfO.html

10-08-2020||India||Weather dismissed as factor in deadly Air India crash||Weather conditions were within safe ranges and pilots were briefed about them by controllers just before the Air India Express jet they were flying crashed at a southern Indian airport Friday, killing at least 18 people and injuring more than 100, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.The Boeing Co. 737 appeared to touch down near the middle of the 9,000-foot-long (2,743-meter-long) runway at Kozhikode, the person said, before skidding off the end and careening down a slope, breaking into three parts. The captain was experienced, with 11,000 flying hours, while the co-pilot had 2,000 hours. Neither one made a distress call, and both died in the crash. Visibility, precipitation and tailwinds were within acceptable guidelines for landing, the person said, asking not to be identified because the investigation is ongoing.A playback on the FlightRadar24 website shows a first attempt to land the plane was aborted before another effort was made from the opposite direction. The flight-tracking site shows visibility at the airport was 1,500-to-2,000 meters, and winds were blowing at 12-13 knots, which is a moderate breeze on the Beaufort scale. Indian officials say 800 meters is sufficient visibility for landing.Kozhikode’s table-top runway, so named because it sits on higher ground, was shortened by 150 meters to create a bigger safety area before the downward slopes, but it still is long enough under international regulations, the person said. He didn’t say when it was shortened. Most table-top runways in the U.S. and elsewhere have areas called arresting beds that stop planes from going off the edge.Flight 1344, operated by the low-cost unit of state-run Air India Ltd., was carrying 190 passengers and crew from Dubai to Kozhikode, the Keralan city formerly known as Calicut, in southwest India. Many were on the repatriation flight after losing their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic. There was no distress call from the cockpit to the air traffic control tower prior to the 7:41 p.m. crash.The flight-data recorder and cockpit-voice recorder, known as the black boxes, were recovered from the crash site for examination. Teams from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing will join India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in the investigation, and an initial report could come in a few months, the person said.A representative of India’s civil aviation ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A representative for Boeing in India didn’t have an immediate comment.Investigators are looking at both human error and mechanical failure as potential causes of the crash, the person said.The last major commercial aviation disaster in India was in 2010, when a plane -- also a Boeing operated by Air India Express and flying from Dubai -- overshot another table-top runway in Mangalore and burst into flames, killing 158 people. Investigators are looking into why there was no fire in Friday’s crash and are checking whether the aircraft’s engines were shut down, the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weather-dismissed-as-factor-in-deadly-air-india-crash/story-0X6PLuv05EZI17kWYRbwyJ.html

The museum has been set up by the Herbal Research Development Institute (HRDI), an autonomous body, said officials. Chandrashekhar Sanwal, director, HRDI, said that there was a need for such a museum, following an uptick in the demand for herbal products across the world. “Herbal renaissance is occurring is a global concept, as herbal products are considered safer than synthetic modern drugs. Looking at the importance of medicinal and aromatic plant-based natural products, HRDI has developed a national-level Herbal Museum at Mandal in Gopeshwar area of Chamoli district,” said Sanwal. The museum has 36 medicinal plants such as Kutki, Kuth, Chippi, Gandrayan, Tejpatta, large cardamom, among others. The museum aims to promote medicinal and aromatic plants, which are important for developing pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, herbal disinfectants, repellents and culinary herbs-based natural products. Sanwal said that research and development activities have also been undertaken to develop various categories of traditional, medicinal and aromatic plant-based natural products at the museum. HRDI is a nodal agency of Uttarakhand State Medicinal Plant Board, which was established at Gopeshwar in 1989 for conservation, development and sustainable utilisation of the valuable medicinal and aromatic plant resources of the region. Uttarakhand, which is spread over 53,000 square kilometres (sq km), including over 46,000 sq km is hilly terrain, has over 7,000 species of plants of which more than 1,100 are of medicinal value. The institute’s primary objective is to co-ordinate medicinal and aromatic plants activities carried out by various government agencies, farmers, research institutes, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and other stakeholders. The institute focuses on the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants, survey and conservation of medicinal and aromatic plants, research on agro-technique, bio-diversity, biotechnology and genetic improvement of medicinal plants and many such activities.

The decision came after the Gujarat High Court in its order last month asked the government to collect a minimum fine of Rs 1,000 from those found without mask in public places.In the wake of the rising number of coronavirus cases in the state, the high court had observed that “masks are logically the best defense individuals have against Covid-19”.“Following the high court directive, the penalty for not wearing mask in public will be Rs 1,000 from August 11 onwards,” Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said here.To stop human-to-human transmission of the virus, Rupani urged people not to come out of their homes to celebrate festivals, including Janmashtami which falls on Tuesday.The Gujarat government had recently increased the fine for not wearing mask to Rs 500 from Rs 200.During a hearing in HC last month on a sou motu (taken by court on its own) PIL about various aspects related to coronavirus, the state government informed the court that the hike of Rs 300 led to a significant decrease in the number of people who violated the rule.However, the high court said some people still do not adhere to the rule, and asked the government to increase the fine for not wearing mask in public places to a minimum of Rs 1,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fine-for-not-wearing-mask-raised-to-rs-1-000-in-gujarat/story-clBKyaJKivTG49xLf9koXL.html

How can they protest against the draft? It is not a final notification. It was kept for public consultation for 150 days because of Covid-19. Otherwise it is only 60 days as per rules,” PTI quoted him as saying after an event to celebrate World Elephant Day.Javadekar said the environment ministry has received thousands of suggestions which it will consider before coming out with the final draft.“We have received thousands of suggestions which we welcome. We will consider those suggestions. Then take a call and come out with the final draft. So people jumping just on the draft is not fair practice. Those who want to now protest, took many of the big decisions without consultations during their regime. It is unnecessary and premature. I have mentioned it in my letter to (Congress leader and former Union minister) Jairam Ramesh,” he said.“It (Gandhi’s comment on EIA and demanding protests) is unnecessary and premature,” Javadekar said.On Sunday, Gandhi had tweeted, “This EIA 2020 draft is a disaster. It seeks to silence the voice of communities who will be directly impacted by the environmental degradation it unleashes. I urge every Indian to rise up and protest against it.” The Congress leader has also called for its withdrawal, saying it will lead to further environmental destruction and looting.“EIA 2020 draft must be withdrawn to stop the loot of the nation and environmental destruction,” Gandhi said.Congress MP Jairam Ramesh who heads the Parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment, forests and climate change, technology has been one of the strongest critics of the draft EIA.On Monday, ahead of Javadekar’s comments, he said the draft EIA loosens pollution standards for thermal power plants, dilutes coastal regulation zone and opens up the western ghats in a substantial manner in an eco-sensitive area among other thingsHe accused the government of adopting double standards on environmental issues.“Globally, you want to assume the role of being an environmental leader but domestically, what you are doing is diluting all the laws that we have,” Ramesh said.“In our desire for faster economic recovery from this current crisis, land laws and environmental laws will become the biggest casualties,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-jumping-just-on-draft-eia-not-fair-says-prakash-javadekar/story-WSdMmcuAtqtLem9WWE3dHK.html

10-08-2020||India||Rhea Chakraborty approaches SC with plea alleging unfair media trial in Sushant Singh Rajput’s death||Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty moved the Supreme Court on Monday with a fresh plea, alleging media trial and attempts to pronounce her guilty for the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Chakraborty has filed a fresh affidavit in the top court, maintaining that Bihar government does not have the jurisdiction to probe and try the matter. The actor has also submitted that the transfer of the case to the CBI by Bihar police is without jurisdiction.Rhea is seeking a transfer of the case from Bihar to Maharashtra. In her plea, she alleged that the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput is being sensationalised by the media since it occurred at a time when Bihar elections are due. “This has led to the suicide being blown out of proportion. Actors Ashutosh Bhakre and Sameer Sharma were also reported to have died by suicide in last 30 days and yet no whisper about the same in power corridors. In case of death of Sushant Singh Rajput, Chief Minister of Bihar is reported to be responsible for the registration of FIR in Patna,” the affidavit said.The plea further alleged that media channels are examining and cross-examining all the witnesses in the case and that Chakraborty has been convicted by media even before a foul-play in the case is established.“Extreme trauma and infringement of privacy of the rights of the petitioner is caused due to constant sensationalisation of this case. Media had convicted accused in 2G and Talwar case in a similar fashion where each and every accused was later on found innocent by the Courts,” the affidavit stated. The Supreme Court is slated to take up the matter tomorrow.Rhea Chakraborty faced investigation agency Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday in money laundering case linked to Rajput’s death.

10-08-2020||India||SC to hear on Tuesday pleas on merger of six Rajasthan BSP MLAs with Congress||The Supreme Court Monday said it would hear tomorrow the petitions filed on the issue relating to merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress in Rajasthan last year.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by a BJP MLA who has challenged the Rajasthan High Court order which had refused to stay the functioning as Congress legislators of six BSP MLAs who after election to the assembly merged with the ruling party in the state. A bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said that appeal filed by BJP MP Madan Dilawar would be heard along with a separate plea filed by the six MLAs. In their plea, these six MLAs have requested the apex court to transfer to itself Dilawar’s plea pending in the high court seeking their disqualification for allegedly violating the party whip.Dilawar has challenged in the apex court the August 6 order of a division bench of high court which had disposed of his plea against the order of a single judge, who had refused to stay the functioning of these six MLAs as Congress legislators.During the hearing conducted on Monday through video-conferencing, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Dilawar, told the apex court that in September last year the Assembly Speaker had passed an order accepting the merger.He said that BSP has said that they have not merged. While saying that the issue is pending before a single judge of the high court, he also referred to the plea filed by the six MLAs in the apex court. The bench said it would hear both the matters tomorrow. The single judge of high court had earlier not granted any interim relief and refused to put a stay on the participation of six MLAs in the proceedings of the House as Congress legislators.Sandeep Yadav, Wajib Ali, Deepchand Kheria, Lakhan Meena, Jogendra Awana and Rajendra Gudha contested and won the 2018 assembly election on a BSP ticket but they defected to Congress in September 2019.They had submitted an application for the merger on September 16 last year and the Speaker allowed their induction into the Congress two days later. The merger was a boost to the Ashok Gehlot-led government as the tally of the Congress increased to 107 in the house of 200.In their plea filed in the apex court, these six MLAs have contended that similar petitions, raising questions on disqualification under the 10th Schedule of the Constitution, are pending before the Supreme Court and, therefore, the plea filed against them in the high court should be transferred to the top court.They said the high court cannot exercise the power of judicial review in “purely political questions” but can examine questions if they emanate from a constitutional duty or obligation.They have said in their plea that it would be in the interest of justice that the matter is transferred to the top court and heard together with similar petitions filed there.Two petitions have been filed in the high court, one by Dilawar and the other by BSP National Secretary Satish Mishra.Dilawar has challenged the merger of the BSP MLAs into Congress, questioning Assembly Speaker CP Joshi’s order dismissing his complaint without allowing him to have his say.Mishra has challenged the defection of the MLAs, but these legislators have not sought transfer of his plea to the Supreme Court.On July 30, the high court had sought the response of the Assembly Speaker and its secretary on the pleas challenging the induction of the six MLAs into the Congress.Amid a political crisis triggered by a rebellion by Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs, the Speaker had moved the top court for a stay on the high court’s order which had asked him to defer disqualification proceedings against the sacked deputy chief minister and the 18 others.On July 31, the Rajasthan Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi also moved the top court challenging the high court order asking the Speaker to defer disqualification proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-on-tuesday-pleas-on-merger-of-six-rajasthan-bsp-mlas-with-congress/story-OKnWmvGvPyUo6vzwnV67pN.html

Whenever a body was extricated they used to rush to the spot and smell the area and return to the rocky shade waiting for the next. Tears rolled from many eyes seeing their desperate moves. No doubt a dog is man’s best friend,” MJ Babu, a senior journalist from Munnar, said.Some people tried to take these dogs, a black and a grey-haired, to their homes but they stood their ground. Babu said residents have no idea how they survived nature’s fury and some of them even said that many domestic animals were restless the night before the tragedy. Meanwhile, Maya, a police sniffer dog on her first major assignment, has won many hearts in Rajamalai by helping spot at least six bodies from under the slush. Police said Maya and Dona were pressed into service on Sunday. Maya is trained in locating dead bodies and Dona, a labrador, is an expert in sniffing living people from under the earth, they said. While Dona’s role was limited as the scope of survivors was thin, Maya was on a roll.“She is yet to complete one year in service. Belonging to Belgian Malinois breed, she had completed nine months’ training and six more months training remains. A good performer, she has surprised us all,” P Prabhat, her handler, said. He said the two sniffers belong to the fresh batch of 35 canines inducted into the dog squad of the Kerala police headquartered in Thrissur.Loknath Behera, Kerala’s director general of police who had a brief stint with the National Investigation Agency (NIA), said there are 150 trained dogs in the canine squad and they can sniff out drugs, explosives, cadavers, alcohol and have helped solve murders, robberies, gold smuggling and other illegal activities.“We have a retirement home for police dogs. And we decorate them with proper rank based on their service and performance. Maya has done wonders on her first assignment itself and she will be rewarded properly,” the state police chief said, adding she helped spotting many bodies and she will remain there for some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pets-unending-wait-for-their-masters-moves-many-at-kerala-landslide-site/story-eO7PtrIx8bNYvdQ2cwmgWJ.html
10-08-2020||India||More than 500 people, 100 elephants die every year due to conflict with each other: Officials||More than 500 people and 100 elephants die every year due to conflict with each other, officials of the environment ministry said on Monday.Releasing the figures at an event ahead of World Elephant Day on August 12, the officials said interactions between humans and elephants have led to the death of both. As per the last census conducted in 2017, India is home to 30,000 elephants. Addressing the event, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said elephant conservation is vital as it balances the ecosystem. Elephants have to be kept in forests for which fodder and water augmentation programme has been initiated, the minister said, adding that by next year results will start showing. Speaking about the significance of elephants, Union Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo condemned the May 27 incident in Kerala wherein a pregnant elephant died after consuming a firecracker-filled pineapple. “We must protect our elephants. The Kerala incident was inhuman and such criminal acts will be dealt with. The ministry and states have zero tolerance approach to such activities and I am sure exemplary punishment will be given to the culprit,” Supriyo said. Giving out the figures of deaths due to human-elephant conflict, Additional Director General of Forests (Wildlife) Soumitra Dasgupta said hundreds of elephants migrate and come in contact with human beings. “More than 500 human and 100 elephant deaths take place each year due to the conflict. In last five years, the ministry has unleashed a series of activities for the conservation of elephants. More elephant corridors have been identified, budget has been increased by 30 per cent and several committees have also been formed,” said Dasgupta. During the event, Javadekar also released a booklet on best practices of human-elephant conflict management and launched the national portal of project elephant which will have all the data and details of elephant movements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-500-people-100-elephants-die-every-year-due-to-conflict-with-each-other-officials/story-83lyktQprBi0DgMYcyT7xH.html

The body of Raihan Mahaldar was found inside a mango orchard on Sunday evening, not far from his home. Raihan was last seen at around 11 am, when he was playing with some other children outside his home, according to his family members. The police have detained two men for questioning on Monday morning amid tension in the area over the infant’s murder. Suraj said, “I had left home for some work on Sunday morning. When I returned at around 12:30 pm I could not find Raihan even though we searched from him everywhere.” Around 2:10 pm, Suraj received a phone call from an unknown person, who used abusive language and demanded Rs 2 lakh for releasing Raihan. Initially, the caller told Suraj that he would find his son alive near an agriculture field. Within a few minutes, he called again and said the child would be released near the local Moregram bridge. The family members informed the Shamsergunj police station but the child’s body was found before the culprits could be traced. It is suspected that Raihan was killed before the ransom call was made. Suraj had won Rs 26 lakh in a lottery as prize money a year ago, but two more men allegedly took the lion’s share. Later, some village elders brokered a deal and Suraj got more money from the other two claimants. The police are probing the dispute over the lottery prize money and are trying to connect to dots with Raihan’s murder. Amit Bhakat, officer-in-charge of Shamserganj police station, said, “We have received a written complaint and a murder case has been registered. A probe has started.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infant-killed-for-ransom-in-bengal-police-probing-dispute-over-lottery-prize-money/story-KM8U51UtowlLjZpVitOIsK.html
10-08-2020||India||India gets ready for UNSC role, boosts diplomatic strength at New York||India has decided to upgrade its diplomatic presence at the United Nations in preparation for taking over as a non-permanent member of the Security Council in January 2021 with an additional deputy permanent representative (DPR) and a counsellor appointed to handle the UNSC matters. External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar will personally review India’s stint at the UNSC every month.According to South Block, R Ravindran, a 1999 batch Indian Foreign Service officer posted as Joint Secretary (Central and West Africa), will join at a rank equivalent of DPR at the Indian Permanent Mission to UN at New York. Pratik Mathur, a 2007 IFS officer and Deputy Secretary (PMO), will join as Counsellor (UNSC).While the mission already is headed by TS Tirumurti and has Nagaraj Naidu as DPR, the two officers will join the group before the 75th UN General Assembly opens on September 15,2020. Preparatory work for the new non-permanent members begins months before the formal joining of UNSC.Ravindran had served in the UNPR under Hardeep Singh Puri, now Minister of Civil Aviation, Urban Development and Commerce, who headed the mission when India was a non permanent member in 2011-2012.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spelled out Indian approach at the UNSC, describing it as the ‘5S’ or Samman (Respect), Samvad (Dialogue), Sahyog (Cooperation) , Shanti (global peace) and Samriddhi (global prosperity) with an overall objective of “New Orientation of a Reformed Multilateral System.”While India got 184 out of 192 valid votes cast for the UNSC seat, the vote numbers surprised New Delhi as India’s adversaries particularly Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia and backed by Islamabad’s all weather friend China had run a shrill campaign targeting India over the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir.“Our understanding is that India got these many votes as its forces stood up to China at Galwan in East Ladakh in June. Although only 129 votes are required, India got additional votes for having the capacity to fight for its territory,” said a senior government official.It was a reference to the violent brawl that took place in Galwan on June 15 in which heavily outnumbered Indian soldiers fought back against Chinese troops. India lost 20 men in the skirmish and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties. But diplomats underline that as New Delhi prepares to play a constructive role at UNSC, it hasn’t forgotten that it is still waiting to become a permanent member 75 years after the world body was founded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gets-ready-for-unsc-role-boosts-diplomatic-strength-at-new-york/story-SSms8I2Ka8931jvUmYL9BP.html

10-08-2020||India||Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee’s J-PAL proposes pilot project on universal basic income in Odisha districts||A pilot project based on the concept of inclusive growth dividend (IGD) or universal basic income (UBI), guaranteeing income to poor people is likely to kick off soon in two of the mineral-rich but poor districts of Odisha. Under the project, a monthly transfer of Rs 100 will be made to the bank accounts of each and every person in the targeted areas.Odisha government officials said the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) South Asia, co-founded by Nobel Laureates Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, has proposed a pilot project in Keonjhar, Sundargarh and Mayurbhanj districts of Odisha. Last year, J-PAL South Asia had signed an agreement with the state government to maximise the impact of state’s poverty alleviation programmes across a wide range of sectors.Under the pilot project, J-PAL has proposed UBI for poor people in around 400 gram panchayats in these districts by ensuring functional bank accounts of each of the adults and crediting Rs 100 to their accounts every month for two years with a budget of Rs 300 crore. For minor children in each of these panchayats who can’t have bank accounts, the money will be transferred to their mother’s account. As per J-PAL’s assessment, the monthly unconditional income supplement of Rs 100 was assessed after pegging it at 1% of GDP/capita (Odisha’s GSDP/capita estimated to be Rs. 1,16,614 as of 2019-20). However, government sources said the pilot project can be implemented in only Keonjhar and Sundargarh districts as it can be financed from the District Mineral Fund available there.Development Commissioner Suresh Mohapatra, who had a preliminary discussion with J-PAL officials last week, said, “Once we get the project report, the DMF trust boards of the two districts would consider it and if found viable then it would be approved. We have suggested to them to include villages within 10 km area of the mining blocks in these districts.” A Below Poverty Line census conducted by Odisha’s Panchayati Raj department found about 65 per cent of the population in Sundargarh district to be BPL while in Keonjhar 69 per cent of its population is BPL.J-PAL’s proposal to Odisha government said that IGD may be especially appropriate in the current situation when the aftermath of the economic shutdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 is creating enormous stress on every part of the economy. “A small regular and predictable income transfer cannot only provide universal social protection, but also be a foundational investment in the broader economic recovery by boosting demand. The Rs 100 a month may be a trivial amount, it would give a large a boost to consumptions to poor households in rural Odisha. The IGD would boost monthly consumption by nearly 20% for the poorest 10% of rural households and would increase monthly consumption for the bottom half of the rural population by l4%,” it said.While most income transfer schemes are targeted at households, the J-PAL said individual transfers -- where children’s allowances are deposited into the mother’s account -- could be a game changer for female empowerment and intra-household targeting. It can also help in boosting female labour-force participation in Odisha, which at 2l.6 %, is lower than the national average.The J-PAL in its proposal said the inclusive growth dividend has the potential of delivering on several development goals including progressive poverty reduction without exclusion errors or targeting costs, it can also improve livelihoods through several channels including making it easier for poor households to save and access credit for productive investments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobel-laureate-abhijit-banerjee-s-j-pal-proposes-pilot-project-on-universal-basic-income-in-odisha-districts/story-cvaCh65AKGXwZe0du67IhJ.html

The Bhupesh Baghel-led government on Monday claimed that Chhattisgarh is the first state in the country to provide such an entitlement. “It’s a matter of pride and satisfaction that Jagdalpur Municipal Corporation (JMC) is the first in the country, which has provided land entitlement under Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, to urban tribal residents,” CM Baghel stated via a social media post. The government cited that 11 families, who are living under the jurisdiction of JMC, were given the rights on Sunday. “For providing rights of urban forestlands, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and the guidelines of the Central government issued in 2015 were followed by the state government. On a pilot basis, 11 tribal families were given pattas for urban forestland for household purposes. There are about 4,500 tribals and other traditional forest-dwellers, who have applied for the rights over urban forestlands ... The process of recognising their forest rights have been initiated. Soon, other eligible families will be handed over similar land rights,” stated a press release issued by the state government. On Sunday, the pattas were handed over to the beneficiaries by the Bastar’s Member of Parliament (MP) Deepak Baij. “The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, recognises rights on forest land of tribals and other traditional forest-dwellers in both rural and urban areas. The process of recognising individual forest rights on the forestlands of the urban area in Chhattisgarh is a welcome step. However, there is a need to implement the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, more effectively and in a coordinated manner throughout the state,” said Alok Shukla, a tribal rights activist and the convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan (CBO), a pressure group. An official from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) told HT that the entitlement would be given to tribals across the state. “The state government is working on the implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. Our aim is to benefit each and every tribal family amid the hard times triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic,” said the official. Chhattisgarh public relations (PR) department’s record showed that 4,84,975 individual and community forest rights certificates have been distributed to tribals to date spread over 50.16 lakh acres of forestland. The state govermment also claimed that Chhattisgarh tops the list in handing out forest rights certificates, followed by Madhya Pradesh (2,56,99), Maharashtra (1,72,116), Odisha (4,43,000), and Gujarat (93,704). “So far, in individual claims, recognition was given to over 9.18 lakh acres of land and 4,41,429 forest rights certificates were distributed. Another 40.97 lakh acres of land in community claims were settled and 43,546 forest rights certificates were distributed,” said a PR official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-provide-urban-forest-land-under-fra-to-tribals-for-household-purposes/story-acQ0BjkxLz4hHspXWzpatK.html
10-08-2020||India||Multiple complaints filed against Assam BJP MLA for controversial remark on noted writer||Guwahati: Various organisations and individuals from all walks of life have filed multiple complaints against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker from Assam Shiladitya Deb for allegedly describing reputed Assamese literateur, the late Syed Abdul Malik, an “intellectual jihadi”. Recently while commenting on a communal clash in Sonipur district, the BJP legislator from Hojai, who is known for his provocative comments on various issues, had accused the late Malik, a former president of Asom Sahitya Sabha, the state’s highest literary body, of instigating “intellectual jihad”. “I condemn Deb’s remarks on Malik and urge him to publicly apologise for his statement,” said Muminul Aowal, a BJP leader and chairman of the Assam Minority Development Board (AMDB). Opposition Congress has also targeted Deb for his remarks and accused him of trying to spread communal hatred in Assam by making such irresponsible and provocative comments. The party’s minority wing filed a complaint against Deb at Guwahati on Sunday. “The comments by Deb are politically motivated and expose his low mentality and lack of knowledge. I urge Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who holds the home portfolio, to take stringent action against Deb,” said Debabrata Saikia, Congress legislator and leader of opposition in the Assam Assembly. Three complaints have been filed against Deb by the Sadou Asom Goriya Moriya Deshi Jatiya Parishad at Morigaon, Barpeta and Dhubri districts. Two other organisations, Sodou Asom Goriya Yuba Chatra Parishad and Asom Sangrami Yuba Manch, have also filed two complaints against Deb in Guwahati. Kuladhar Saikia, former director-general of police (DGP), Assam, and president of Asom Sahitya Sabha (ASS), also condemned Deb’s remarks. “If my comment on Malik has hurt anyone I express my regret for that. It was never my intention to hurt anyone and request all to end this matter. I want to make it clear that the comment was my personal view and has nothing to do with my party or the government,” Deb had explained on Saturday via a social media post. In July, the BJP member of the Assam legislative assembly (MLA) had hit the headlines after he had threatened to resign from the party for being overlooked. Later, he was mollified by party leaders and revised his stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/multiple-complaints-filed-against-assam-bjp-mla-for-controversial-remark-on-noted-writer/story-oRrefwnkAAe9fguJnP5VCN.html

10-08-2020||India||At least 500 persons are killed in human-elephant conflict every year: Environment min data||The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on Monday said at least 500 people and 100 elephants are killed in the country due to human-elephant conflict every year. While releasing a document on best practices of conflict management and a portal on addressing the human-elephant conflict cases, the MoEFCC officials said there are 30,000 pachyderms in the wild and another 2,700 are in captivity. Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general of forests (wildlife), on Monday, said that financial contribution to states for payment of compensation and other conflict mitigation strategies had been increased by 30% this financial year, as compared to the previous year. “New elephant reserves have been declared and elephant corridors have also been identified in the past five years to address the problem. Elephants have also been included in appendix 1 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals to ensure better conservation.” Sanjay Kumar, the director-general of forests, said the population and distribution of elephants in the country have been on the rise. They have been migrating from Jharkhand to Chhattisgarh to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. “New interactions are leading to more conflict. They are migrating to newer areas. We are trying to identify research methodologies to understand how the population can remain stable in new areas,” he said. The portal and the document was released by Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar. “We do not kill animals. Animals are revered in India. We have to devise good conflict management practices. We have also started a fodder and water augmentation programme in elephants’ habitat and corridor,” Javadekar said. On Sunday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, 2020, is “not only disgraceful, but it is also dangerous”.“Not only does it have the potential to reverse many of the hard-fought gains that have been won over the years in the battle to protect our environment, but it could also potentially unleash widespread environmental destruction and mayhem across India,” Gandhi wrote in a lengthy post on a social media platform calling youth to protest against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-500-persons-are-killed-in-human-elephant-conflict-every-year-environment-min-data/story-MbLQNN5Snm22W6gC32Of0I.html

Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, the pilot in command of the Boeing 737 aircraft, and co-pilot Akhilesh Kumar also lost their lives as more than 100 were injured in the country’s worst commercial aircraft accident in a decade.“56 injured passengers have been discharged from various hospitals after obtaining complete fitness,” Air India Express said in a statement.“The Emergency Response Team of Air India and Air India Express and the Angels of Air India are continuously positioned at various hospitals to render all the required support to the injured passengers as well as to their family members,” it added.The airline also said it’s chief executive officer and the regional head of the southern region continue to remain in Kozhikode to “render continuous support to the family members”.The crashed aircraft was coming from Dubai to Kozhikode under the government’s Vande Bharat Mission to bring back Indians stranded abroad amidst the coronavirus pandemic. It was carrying 174 adult passengers, 10 children, four cabin crew and two pilots.Air India Express has said it will provide an interim compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the family members of the deceased passengers over 12 years of age and above Rs 5 lakh to those of passengers below the age of 12. It will also give Rs 2 lakh each to critically injured passengers and Rs 50,000 to other injured passengers.Directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) chief Arun Kumar has said the tabletop runway at Kozhikode airport was long enough for the aircraft but a late touchdown may have caused the plane to overshoot the runway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kozhikode-ai-express-crash-56-passengers-sent-home-says-airline/story-P1Un8yPbp4kOI3zE329m7O.html
10-08-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: Swapna Suresh’s bail rejected, anti-terror law to apply||Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the Kerala diplomatic gold smuggling case, was denied bail on Monday by the NIA special court in Kochi. The court further added that provisions of the anti-terrror law, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), will apply in her case. Suresh’s counsel opposed the application of UAPA against her client arguing that the case pertains to an “economic offence and is not terror related”. The National Investigation agency, probing the case, opposed it, saying major proceeds from smuggling were used to fund anti-national activities in south India.Earlier the premier agency told the court that it suspected the proceeds from the gold smuggling case might be used for terror funding.The agency invoked Section 16 and 17 of the UAPA, which prescribes punishment for raising funds for terrorist activities.After preliminary investigation, the NIA said, it found one of the accused K T Ramees, who is in custody now, was in touch with some fundamentalist organizations. He also undertook many foreign trips, including to Africa and he was suspected to be a part of an international smuggling and drug racket, the NIA added.When Suresh’s two bank lockers were opened by the probe team last month it reportedly found Rs one crore in cash and two kg of gold. These lockers were in the joint name of Suresh and a chartered accountant. The latter reportedly told the team that he was allegedly asked by Sivasankar to help Suresh to open lockers three years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-swapna-suresh-s-bail-rejected-anti-terror-law-to-apply/story-rtvglt7lNEBNi5MFoLk9tK.html

A search has been launched to trace and nab the culprit.The girl was kidnapped from outside her home by a masked motorcycle-borne man. After being informed about the incident by the children who were playing with her, the girl’s family looked for her and failing to find her, they lodged a case of kidnapping against unknown persons with Garh police station.While a search by police teams failed to locate her, some villagers later spotted an unconscious girl on Mela road and informed the cops. The girl was rushed to the community health centre and later referred to the medical college hospital in Meerut, given her serious condition.Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Hapur, Sarvesh Kumar Mishra said initial investigation indicated that the girl was raped.

The second leader earlier said that Pilot had sought an appointment with former party chief Rahul Gandhi and that Pilot has been speaking to senior leaders Ahmed Patel and KC Venugopal, in what is being seen as an apparent softening of his stance.Neither Pilot, nor Rahul Gandhi’s office commented on the meeting. This is the first time that Gandhi met Pilot since the latter left Jaipur after the Special Operations Group under Gehlot’s ministry, issued him a show-cause notice in a case involving a plot to bring down the government. Also read: ‘Betrayers shouldn’t be allowed to come back’, say Rajasthan Cong MLAs at CLP meetPilot has till now insisted on the removal of Gehlot as chief minister as a pre-condition for any sort of rapprochement, while the Congress had asked him and his legislators supporting him to give up the “hospitality” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) before starting a conversation on resolving the current impasse. A member of Pilot’s team, which has been camping in various places from Faridabad to Manesar after spending several days at the ITC Grand Bharat hotel, pointed out that the Congress Legislature Party meeting had completely ruled out a return of the rebels. Pilot’s rebellion stems from his complaints against the operational style of Gehlot, this person added.The second Congress leader cited above said that while that may be the case, with the state government looking reasonably secure, some of the legislators supporting Pilot are becoming restless and want him to reach some sort of understanding with the party’s central leadership. Also read: Six days before Rajasthan showdown, Vasundhara Raje meets Rajnath SinghWhile the Gehlot camp has been claiming the support of 102 legislators in the 200-member House, Pilot’s has not been able to increase its numbers from 19, although this number was previously claimed to be at least 30 by the former deputy chief minister and his aides. Monday’s developments come against the backdrop of the Congress suggesting, at least at the state level, that ties with Pilot are set to be severed. The general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan, Avinash Pande, on Sunday ruled out a return of Pilot and his supporters. “In politics, sometimes to save democracy, dil par pathar rakhna padta hai (difficult calls need to be taken),” he told the media.In the run up to the assembly session on August 14 that is likely to feature a floor test, the opposition BJP also shifted 20 of its 72 legislators to Gujarat to prevent any poaching attempts by the Congress. While Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia denied any internal rifts, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje met party president JP Nadda and defence minister Rajnath Singh last week to discuss the political developments in her state. The BJP will hold a meeting of its legislators and those belonging to its alliance partner, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) of Hanuman Beniwal on Tuesday, the day Rajasthan high court will hear a petition challenging the merger of six MLAs of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with the Congress. These BSP legislators have since moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer of their case from Rajasthan high court to the country’s top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-reaches-out-to-congress-leadership-puts-in-an-appointment-request/story-W26kyhRBHltnv2u2a1YGwM.html

Forest officials said it was a male adult leopard, aged around five years. The animal had strayed close to Kanakia Atrium-2 near JB Nagar in Andheri-MIDC (Andheri-East) on Sunday early morning and was spotted by security staff of the apartment complex, who immediately informed the police and forest department. Forest officials said the animal was hiding in a 20-acre area, adjacent to the residential society, which housed Vazir Glass Warehouse, an abandoned factory warehouse, and placed three trap cages there on Sunday. “On early Monday morning, the leopard was trapped in one of the cages,” said Santosh Kank, range forest officer (Mumbai). “The animal was transported to the van parked near the society and released back into the wild.” A forest official said the animal was released back into Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). “However, as per protocol, we cannot name the exact location, where the animal was released,” said the forest officer. The factory warehouse has been lying abandoned for over two decades and there are several areas that are covered with dense vegetation, where the leopard could have hidden. “The animal avoided any movement during the day. But, it might have moved towards the trap cages late at night on Sunday or Monday early morning, where a chicken was kept as bait and got trapped,” he said. Teams from SGNP, Mumbai, and Thane forest range, and animal rescue groups had gathered at the spot after the incident was reported on Sunday. Two cages were set up during the day, and another by the afternoon. Besides, camera traps (about 10-12) were placed across the abandoned warehouse to track the animal’s movement. Two forest guards and a few police personnel were deployed at the residential complex in a bid to restrict the movement of the public. In April 2019, a leopard was rescued after a three-hour operation following its entry into a residential area in Marol, Andheri (East). At least six leopards have been rescued from residential areas in the densely-populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) since 2017. SGNP and its surrounding areas, including Aarey Colony, are home to an estimated 47 leopards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-trapped-from-an-abandoned-factory-in-andheri-released-back-into-the-wild/story-KgEJURQgpmnM5UkrwCM74N.html

Now that India is following the new policy and practiceof trade and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the importance of our islands including Andaman and Nicobar has increased,” PM Modi said.“Under the Act East policy, Andaman and Nicobar’s role in India’s strong relations with east Asian countries and other countries associated with the sea is very important and it is going to increase,” he said.The Act East policy, a key foreign policy approach, is India’s effort aimed at bolstering extensive strategic and economic ties with southeast Asian countries that would possibly act a counterweight to the influence of China in the region.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also home to India’s only tri-services command, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), which has become strategically important amid the Chinese aggression in the region.“This optical fibre cable project, connecting Andaman and Nicobar with rest of the country, is a symbol of our commitment towards the ease of living. Be it online classes, tourism, banking, shopping or telemedicine, thousands of families in Andaman and Nicobar will now get its access,” he said.“The completion of the work of laying 2,300 km long cable undersea before the scheduled time is praiseworthy. Deep-sea surveys, maintaining cable quality and laying cable using special ships is not easy,” PM Modi said.PM Modi had said earlier in the day that the inauguration of the submarine optical fibre cable in Andaman and Nicobar Islands will ensure high-speedbroadband connectivity, fast and reliable mobile and landline telecom services and delivery of e-governance platforms to the islands, crucial for India’s security.“Today, 10th August is a special day for my sisters & brothers of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. At 10:30 this morning, the submarine Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) connecting Chennai and Port Blair will be inaugurated,” PM Modi had tweeted.The cable will enhance broadband and telecom facilities on the islands, according to a release by the Prime Minister’s Office. The foundation stone for the project was laid by PM Modi on December 30, 2018, at Port Blair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andaman-and-nicobar-s-development-crucial-for-india-s-act-east-policy-pm-modi/story-KQpRQt0xRil7bqiuuU16hL.html

He said he is not happy with the efforts made in the past to put it to the intended use in time. “I am amazed by the socio, economic, legal administrative issues and hurdles that come in the way,” the vice president said, adding that he was aware of the acute shortage of housing for the secretariat employees. “The housing demand of secretariat employees is being met by only 38 percent, indicating a shortage of around 68 percent,” he said. This comes a day after Naidu marked the 78th anniversary of the Quit India movement on Sunday and called for an intensified campaign for Knit India to enable a strong and emotionally integrated nation. The vice president urged people to pledge to drive out poverty, illiteracy, inequality, gender discrimination, corruption and all kinds of social evil.“Lack of sense of belonging to each other and unity of purpose and action had led to long subjugation and exploitation of India. Learning from this, all Indians need to be bound by the shared sense of Indianness while pursuing their respective cultural value and ethos. This is all about nourishing the spirit of nationalism. A perception of divided India would make us an easy target for others for fishing in troubled waters.

A statement was given by Bhushan as well as Tarun Tejpal, the former editor of Tehelka magazine.The bench said that there is a thin line between free speech and contempt. The judges said they seek to balance the right to free speech on one hand and the need to protect the dignity of the judiciary as an institution.Bhushan said that his allegation on corruption did not refer to financial corruption but lack of propriety and if his statement hurt judges or their families he regrets his statement.Tejpal had offered an apology.The top court had issued contempt notice to Bhushan and Tejpal in November 2009 for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to Tehelka.On July 22, the same bench had issued suo motu notice to Bhushan for his remarks and two alleged derogatory tweets against the judiciary, observing his statements prima facie “brought the administration of justice in disrepute”.In his reply to the court’s notice, Bhushan said the expression of opinion, “however outspoken, disagreeable or unpalatable to some”, cannot constitute contempt of court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-prashant-bhushan-s-regret-over-corruption-remark-proceeds-with-contempt-case/story-4LX3OkCnMhAfrKcO5WrJmO.html

10-08-2020||India||India faces lost generation as Covid-19 pushes children to work||The coronavirus pandemic is forcing India’s children out of school and into farms and factories to work, worsening a child-labour problem that was already one of the most dire in the world.Sixteen-year-old Maheshwari Munkalapally and her 15-year-old sister stopped attending lessons when virtually the entire economy was brought to a halt during the world’s biggest lockdown. Munkalapally’s mother and older sister lost their jobs as housemaids in Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Telangana. The younger girls, who had been living with their grandmother in a nearby village, were forced to become farmhands along with their mother, in order to survive.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Working under the sun was difficult as we were never used to it,” Munkalapally said. “But we have to work at least to buy rice and other groceries.”It’s difficult to quantify the number of children affected since the pandemic erupted, but civil society groups are rescuing more of them from forced labour and warn that many others are being compelled to work in cities because of the migrant labour shortage there.Even before the outbreak, India was struggling to keep children in school. A 2018 study by DHL International GmBH estimated that more than 56 million children were out of school in India -- more than double the combined number across Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The cost to India’s economy, in terms of lost productivity, was projected at $6.79 billion, or 0.3% of gross domestic product.Also read: Telangana Police rescue 5-year-old girl made to work as domestic help, abusedOf those children not in school, 10.1 million are working, either as a ‘main worker’ or as a ‘marginal worker,’ according to the International Labour Organization.Global TrendGlobal child labour had been gradually declining in the past two decades, but the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to reverse that trend, according to the ILO. As many as 60 million people are expected to fall into poverty this year alone, and that inevitably drives families to send children out to work. A joint report by the ILO and United Nations Children’s Fund estimates that a 1 percentage point rise in poverty leads to at least a 0.7 percentage point increase in child labour.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Indonesia, the world’s fourth most-populous nation, is another country that will see large numbers of children from vulnerable families drop out of school and into the workforce. The ILO estimates about 11 million are at risk of being exploited as child labourers under current conditions, especially in the less-developed eastern parts of the country, like Sulawesi islands, Nusa Tenggara and Papua.Economic LossIn India, home to more young people than any other country in the world, this lost generation of children will have substantial effects on Asia’s third-largest economy: lower productivity and earning potential, unrealized tax revenue, increased poverty levels and pressure for more government handouts.“Even prior to the pandemic, numbers of children out of school in India and in child labour were high,” said Ramya Subrahmanian, the chief of research on child rights and protection at Unicef-Innocenti in Florence, Italy. “An even bigger issue will be for those children who are due to enter school during this time. If these children face delays in entering school, there may be an increase in the numbers of never-enrolled children, which could in turn push up child labour numbers.”The Indian constitution provides free and compulsory education for all children in the age group of six to 14 years as a fundamental right. While Munkalapally and her sister are no longer covered by it because of their age, they are protected by the local law on child labour, which prohibits employment of adolescents between the age of 14 and 18 from working in any hazardous or dangerous occupations. The same law bars children under the age of 14 in any form of occupation except as a child artist, or in a family business.Forced labour“At a household level, it’s hard to differentiate whether children are involved or not,” says Dheeraj, a program manager at Praxis: Institute for Participatory Practices, who uses only one name. The jobs may still be hazardous and against the law -- small-scale businesses such as matchbox-making can be run from home -- but the difficulty in identifying such labour leaves children open to exploitation.Bonded labour, where people are forced to work for creditors to pay off their loans, is another avenue where families send their children to work.A total of 591 children were rescued from forced work and bonded labour from different parts of India during the lockdown by Bachpan Bachao Andolan, a civil society group on children’s rights, founded by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi.“Once the lockdown is lifted and normal manufacturing activity resumes, factory owners will look to cover their financial losses by employing cheap labour,” the group said in a statement.NGOs point to the fact that the real spike in child labour is yet to come. When economic activity begins accelerating, there is a risk of returning migrants taking children along with them to the cities.“When hotels reopen, construction work starts, the railways get back on track, when everything opens up, this community that has returned will be the main source that take our children to the cities,” said Abhishek Kumar, program coordinator at SOS Children’s Villages.Children may be seen as a stop-gap measure to fill jobs left vacant by migrant labourers who fled cities for their rural homes during the lockdown.“The burden has shifted to the poor households within urban areas,” said Rahul Sapkal, an assistant professor at the Centre for Labour Studies in the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai.While children aren’t exactly engaging in heavy labour usually carried out by adults, if parents take their children along for support in their jobs, even if it’s to avoid leaving them at home, a precedent is set, and such activity is normalized, he said.Mukalapally mother, Venkatamma, is unhappy that her children are now forced to work, but cannot think of any alternative. The money they make is still not enough.“Vegetables, rice, spices, soap, we still cannot afford these despite the four of us working,” she says. “It would be better if we could go back. In Hyderabad, even if the work is difficult, the pay is better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-faces-lost-generation-as-covid-19-pushes-children-to-work/story-hIbEkV1pEhQAmkWwR9S8rO.html

It’s a really great auction story – and one that we all dream of,” he said.The glasses, which have already attracted an online bid for 6,000 pounds, are said to have been in the family of the unnamed elderly gentleman vendor in England, who was told by his father that they were a gift to his uncle when he was working for British Petroleum in South Africa between 1910 and 1930.“The vendor’s uncle definitely worked for British Petroleum in South Africa, and I believe Gandhi didn’t wear glasses until the late 1910s early 1920s,” says Stowe in reference to the provenance of the glasses, which are likely to be one of Gandhi’s earliest pairs during his time in South Africa.“The story that appears with the lot is exactly what the vendor told us, and exactly what was told to him by his father some 50 years ago,” explains Stowe.The lot, titled “Pair of Mahatma Gandhi’s Personal Spectacles”, forms part of the auctioneers’ Military, History and Classic Cars online sale and will go under the hammer on August 21. It has already attracted much interest, including from India.“A pair of early 20th century c1920 gold plated circular rimmed spectacles by repute owned and worn by Mahatma Gandhi,” notes the auction lot details.“The spectacles of usual form, with sprung gold plated arms and prescription lenses. Jointed by a gold plated nose bar, the spectacles formed an important and somewhat iconic part of Gandhi’s overall appearance. It was known that he would often give away his old or unwanted pairs to those in need or those who had helped him. A rare and important pair of spectacles,” it notes.“The uncle working for British Petroleum at the time and was stationed in South Africa, and it can be presumed that these were gifted by way of thanks from Gandhi for some good deed. A note from the vendor is included,” the auction lot adds.Gandhi became synonymous with the iconic round-rimmed Windsor-style glasses, common during the period when he was studying law in England in the late 1800s and 1900s. While initially used infrequently, the glasses became a regular feature during the national movement and Gandhi’s civil disobedience protests in India.He is known to have handed over his personal items as gifts to admirers and a number of similar items have emerged on the auction circuit over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spectacles-believed-to-be-worn-by-mahatma-gandhi-emerge-at-uk-auction/story-n5cLXWIiJjfeTGh6DKigZI.html

Before this, the highest detections in a single day was 348 recorded on August 5.The state administration has now announced the setting up of a new dedicated Covid-19 hospital in the state and has promised better treatment protocols as the numbers have taken a turn for the worse. “We will be setting up a new Covid-19 hospital at Sub-District Hospital, Ponda to cater to rising cases in the state,” Vishwajit Rane, Goa’s health minister, said. Prior to this the state had only one dedicated hospital for Covid-19 with a capacity of 220 beds. The hospital soon filled up prompting the state government to set up care centres for asymptomatic patients. After they too filled up, the government allowed asymptomatic patients to home quarantine. The new Covid-19 hospital, which will function out of the sub-district hospital in Ponda town in south Goa, has the capacity to cater to nearly 440 patients. Goa has witnessed 8,712 Covid-19 cases of which 5,995 have recovered and 75 have succumbed while 2,642 are undergoing treatment either at care centres or at the state’s dedicated hospital. “Our government is committed to provide the best healthcare facilities to the people in this challenging period. I urge everyone to come together and support the authorities to fight against this pandemic and avoid politicising issues related to healthcare,” chief minster Pramod Sawant said. The government has rolled out rapid antigen test to help cope with the demand for tests despite their knack for false negatives but with a rider that they will only be used on asymptomatic patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-registers-506-new-covid-19-patients-in-a-day-the-highest-so-far/story-iA6nsDUJ50BYDKcn4Tr0AO.html

It’s not only in Ladakh in India but also against its other neighbours as well. It’s time that the world unites against this Chinese aggression,” said Adapa Prasad from Overseas Friends of BJP USA. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died.“China’s Communist party has infringed on the religious rights of the Uyghur community and violated human rights of people of Hong Kong,” Puneet Ahluwalia, who is an Indian-American Republican and founder of the Proud American Political Action Committee, said. Ahluwalia, who is exploring to run for the post of Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, said US President Donald Trump’s hard measures against China was in the right direction. “China has to play international rules,” he said.“We have seen what they have done in Africa. We have seen that they are doing in Iran...Most importantly, they recently backstabbed India,” Ahluwalia said, alleging that China is spying on Americans through various social media applications and by stealing data and information.Sunil Singh, an eminent Indian-American from the Greater Washington DC area, praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for banning Chinese applications in India. Noting that people of India have stopped buying China made goods, he said there was also a need for the Americans to make a similar move.This was the second major anti-China protest by Indian-Americans here in Washington DC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-americans-protest-china-s-aggression-against-india-human-rights-violations-of-uyghurs/story-lcGhWvJgl0MFaa6AlvPgTI.html

10-08-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh needs more HDU, ICU beds as Covid-19 cases increase||Madhya Pradesh needs more High-dependency unit (HDU) and Intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ones with oxygen as Covid-19 cases have increased in the state alarmingly during the unlock period in the past seven weeks. Active cases of coronavirus too have shot up in this period, as per a health department’s report. As per the health department’s bulletin released on Saturday night, the state Covid-19 tally rose to 38,157 with an addition of 859 patients identified in the past 24 hours while the number of active cases stood at 8,827. When the lockdown was lifted in the state on June 16, albeit restrictions continuing on Sundays and several districts going on with extended lockdown besides night curfew continuing across the state, the tally of Covid-19 patients in the state was 10,935 while the fatalities stood at 465 had died. The active cases in the state stood at 2,567.Statistically, while the period from March 20, when the first Covid-19 patient was reported in the state to June 15, saw a Covid-19 patient almost every 12 minutes, during the unlock period since June 16 has seen a new Covid-19 patient almost every 5 minutes on an average in the state. In the past fortnight, the situation further worsened with coronavirus affecting more people as a result of which every 1.70 minutes a new Covid-19 patient was reported.Also read: India’s trajectory a worry as world nears 20 million Covid-19 casesSimilarly, while the lockdown period reported the death of a Covid-19 patient every 4.54 hours, the duration of a Covid-19 patient being reported dead during the unlock period so far has been reduced to every 2.53 hours. During the past fortnight, every 1.83 hours there was death of a Covid-19 patient in some part or the other of the state. As per a report of the health department, as many as 13 districts of the state, including major Covid-19 spots like Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Gwalior, need as many as 5,474 HDU beds by the end of August, whereas the availability of such beds is 907 as of now. There are 2,307 beds planned to be added by August 31. Thus, there will still be a gap of 2,260 HDU beds as on August 31.Similarly, Gwalior, Bhopal and Indore need 2,626 additional isolation beds with oxygen and 864 ICU beds. In all, the state’s requirement as on August 31 would be 21,904 isolation beds without oxygen, 7,301 isolation beds with oxygen, 5,474 HDU beds and 1825 ICU beds. The calculation is based on the presumption that 60 percent of the active cases don’t need beds with oxygen, 20 percent of the patients need isolation beds with oxygen, 15 percent need HDU beds and remaining 5 percent need ICU beds, as per the report.However, the state has 20,340 isolation beds without oxygen and it may have a gap of 1,564 such beds as on August 31. They may also be a gap of 2,260 HDU beds and 254 ICU beds as on August 31 even after the planned activities of the department to create more such beds. However, there may be 1,917 isolation beds with oxygen in excess to the demand by the end of the month.Public health experts Amulya Nidhi said, “Almost five months after the Covid-19 outbreak in the state, the health infrastructure is not well equipped to tackle the situation. At the same time, there are reports about patients being made to overstay in certain private hospitals despite their recovery from the disease. The government must make public a comprehensive report on when a patient was hospitalised, when was he cured and when was he discharged and from what facility- government or private. Also, there should be a transparency in data as to who all died and in which hospital.”Rachna Dhingra, founder member of a Bhopal group for information and action, an organisation working for Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims, said, “Shortage of beds is being felt even now. Some patients were turned away from some hospitals but the state government itself is compounding the situation by sending to hospitals even those people who test positive in rapid antigen test (RAT) whereas they should be sent to the hospitals only after they test positive in real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests.”Additional chief secretary (ACS), health department, Mohd Suleman said, “We started working in a right direction long back in ramping up our fever clinics, testing and hospital facilities besides a door to door survey campaign. Still we are ramping up our capacity to treat patients who get infected and continue to treat everyone free if they want it. The result of our efforts can be gauged from the fact that in terms of active cases Madhya Pradesh stands at the 15th spot from the top in the country. Also, the fatality rate which stood at 10.3 percent as on April 3 has come down to 2.9 percent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-needs-more-hdu-icu-beds-as-covid-19-cases-increase/story-PLZgwlluYAjqJGh3czr6hL.html

10-08-2020||India||Congress launches ‘Rozgar Do’ drive||The Congress on Sunday launched a ‘Rozgar Do (give employment)’ campaign with its former chief Rahul Gandhi alleging that 140 million people have lost jobs due to the Centre’s policies in the past six years. He alleged that the Modi government’s decision of demonetisation, its “faulty” implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) and the Covid lockdown have “destroyed” the economy. “When Modi became the prime minister, he promised the youth of the country that he will give jobs to 2 crore youth every year. He sold a dream, but the reality is that 14 crore people have become unemployed due to his policies,” Gandhi said in a video message while launching campaign on the Youth Congress foundation day. “Why did this happen, because of the Modi government’s wrong policies. Demonetisation, faulty implementation of GST and then lockdown, these three steps have destroyed the economic structure of the country and the truth now is that India cannot give employment to its youth.” BJP’s Gopal Agarwal said, “If he has some data, let him share..., we will answer them. Otherwise these are his opinions and have been answered several times. One source of his figure of 14 crore increase in unemployment is not sure. Second, linking of unemployment to Modiji policy is absurd. Thirdly, jobs include self employment figures, figures of mudra loans etc vouch for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-launches-rozgar-do-drive/story-ohZfIVZ4JRqze1iTrRgeuO.html

The apex court will take up the actor’s plea seeking transfer of case to Maharashtra from Bihar. On Monday, a three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra will pronounce its order in a 2009 contempt case against advocate Prashant Bhushan. The case was initiated against Bhushan for a remark he made in 2009 on past chief justices of India (CJIs). Bhushan had refused to apologise for his statement but offered an explanation to the court regarding his controversial remark. Another important case listed for hearing is a plea by Rajasthan BJP MLA Madan Dilawar seeking disqualification of six MLAs who were elected to the state assembly on the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket in 2018 and but merged with the Congress in 2019. Dilawar’s plea was rejected by assembly speaker CP Joshi on July 22. He had then challenged the speaker’s decision before the Rajasthan high court. The HC issued notice to the speaker but declined to stay his decision. Dilawar then approached the SC challenging the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-probe-to-rajasthan-crisis-sc-to-take-up-key-cases/story-KseN3A8NH2jWy9UePMV20J.html
10-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It was a weekend that saw a succession of grim milestones as the coronavirus disease continues to ravage countries around the world — with the US, Brazil and India being the most affected.The global case number will most likely cross the 20-million mark on Monday. On Saturday, the US crossed the 5-million case mark, Brazil crossed the 3-million case mark, and also 100,000 deaths, and, closer home, Maharashtra, the Indian state worst affected by the pandemic, crossed 500,000 cases. All are worrying numbers. The US, with a little over 5 million cases as of Sunday morning has added 47% of its caseload since July 1. July and August have been bad months for all three countries. India, with around 2.15 million cases as of Sunday morning, added 73% of its caseload in the same time. And Brazil, with a little over 3 million cases, added 53% of its caseload in the 39-day period. The numbers have been compared using data from worldometers.info.Also read| No parties, no trips: US colleges set Covid-19 rules for fallIt is a mathematical certainty that deaths will rise, if only with a lag, as cases increase (they have continued to in India and Brazil; the US saw a dip in mid-June, with 7-day average of daily new cases falling to the low 20,000s, but has since witnessed a sharp rise; the current 7-day average according to the New York Times databases is around 54,000; all 7-day averages are from the database). The US has seen this, with 7-day average of daily deaths climbing to around 1,000 now, after falling to the 500s in June. India’s 7-day average of daily deaths has risen to around 860. Brazil’s has been around the 1,000 mark since late May. The overall case fatality rate (number of deaths as a proportion of number of cases) for the US was 3.2%, India, 2%, and Brazil, 3.33%. Even as the number of cases has increased, this proportion has declined for all three countries — the corresponding numbers on June 30 for the US was 4.8%, Brazil, 4.2%, and India, 3%. Clearly, as this columnist has previously mentioned, we appear to be getting better at saving lives — which is understandable. Doctors around the world are discovering which intervention and medicine works best at each stage of the disease, information that is being shared almost in real-time. Some of the therapies (including plasma therapy) are experimental and there is a bit of a hit-and-miss involved, but, in general, health systems around the world are seeing fewer deaths.This is starkly evident when only the cases and deaths registered since July 1 are considered. The US saw a case fatality rate of 1.43% in this period, India, 1.66%, and Brazil, 2.55%. To be sure, while this is how case fatality rates are calculated, there is some internal inconsistency in this calculation, one that has been previously pointed out by some experts — deaths lag corresponding cases by two to three weeks. Still, these numbers do highlight the trend that’s clearly visible in the US and India especially (Brazil’s numbers are a little too volatile for it to be included in this): more cases through July and August, but fewer deaths.Also read: Bill Gates says US coronavirus testing has ‘mind-blowing’ problemsOver the last two weeks, interestingly, the US has been on a decreasing curve of daily new cases, evident in its declining 7-day average, which has fallen by around 13,000 cases in this period. India, over these two weeks, has been on an increasing curve of new cases, with new hot spots showing clusters of cases emerging in the hinterland and the peninsula. According to the NYT database, India’s 7-day average on August 8 was around 3,500 higher than the corresponding number for the US. That is a worrying trend, even if allowances were to be made for India’s much higher population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ytyEpv8CAK5C7hVHT1IFHJ.html
10-08-2020||India||Kerala govt shouldn’t differentiate between plane crash, landslide victims: V Muraleedharan||The Kerala government should not differentiate between the victims of the Karipur plane crash and the Rajmala landslide, said Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan during his visit to the landslide site on Sunday.“It is not right for the government to take a separate stand in each place. It is not right for the Chief Minister to be selective,” Muraleedharan told reporters.He added that the pathetic condition in which plantation workers live in Rajmala should become eye-opener to the state government.“Very tragic incident. I convey my condolences to loved ones of those who lost their lives. Kerala is considered a developed state but the pathetic condition in which plantation workers live should be an eye-opener to the government. I’m sure urgent efforts will be made by the state government,” he said.Earlier on Friday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased in the Rajamala landslide tragedy. However, the Kerala government, on Saturday, announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of each passenger who died in the Air India Express flight that veered off the runway while attempting to land at the Karipur International Airport on August 7.But Chief Minister said the prime importance is rescue operations and arranging treatment for people who survived the landslide. Revenue Minister E Chandrasekharan and Power Minister M M Mani are also camping at the site and leading the rescue operations in Idukki.Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also criticised the Vijayan government for being ‘divisive’ while dealing with the two tragedies. Taking to his Twitter and Facebook handles, Chennithala wrote, “The families of those who died in the tragedy should also be given financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each. The amount declared in Karipur should be paid here as well. The government should not have been criticised for being so divisive. The locals are dissatisfied that the Chief Minister did not visit the site of the tragedy.”He added on this Facebook post that he doesn’t want to cause controversy at this point and is just sharing the sentiments of the local residents.The Chief Minister had been unable to visit the Rajamala landslide site, while he paid a visit to Kozhikode Medical College where the passengers of Air India flight AXB1344 are being treated and took stock of the situation on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-shouldn-t-differentiate-between-plane-crash-landslide-victims-v-muraleedharan/story-KjVPpcYgdTkWAfPHj8c8bL.html
10-08-2020||India||India’s trajectory a worry as world nears 20 million Covid-19 cases||India’s trajectory of daily cases of Covid-19 is now ahead of that of the United States’, making it the country with the highest number of daily infections, as total cases globally appear set to breach the 20 million-mark on Sunday night with the US, India and Brazil leading the surge in infections.As the pandemic accelerates in some of the world’s most populous regions, 19,922,762 total cases of the coronavirus disease had been recorded across the world till late Sunday night with 731,747 fatalities — reflecting a global case fatality rate of 3.7%. Of these, 2,212,737 cases and 44,462 deaths have been reported in India (CFR of 2.01%), which is the third worst-hit nation in the world after the US and Brazil.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn the seven-day period between August 1 and August 8, India reported 399,263 new Covid-19 cases against 384,089 cases in the US — the highest and second highest most daily cases globally. This is the first time the average weekly trajectory in India eclipsed United States’s, which has been hit the hardest by the pandemic by a significant margin. The average daily new cases over the past week indicates India may be beginning to close the gap.To be sure, the US on Sunday reached the extraordinary milestone of five million cases, more than twice those in India. Even Brazil, which breached the three million-mark on Sunday, has nearly 800,000 more cases than India, so the latter may not be overtaking the two worst-hit countries any time soon.Also read: US tops 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases, to Europe’s alarmBrazil had the third highest number of daily cases on average in the above mentioned time period – 304,493. In the seven days before that, India reported 366,196 new infections while the US reported 447,026 and Brazil 312,442, according to HT’s dashboard and Worldometer.This is the first time in a month-and-a-half that any country’s cases have grown faster than the US’s. The last time this happed was on June 25, when Brazil was reporting a steady spike in cases and the second surge of cases in the US was only kicking off.Among the three worst-hit nations, only India’s trajectory is currently rising — the other two have been reporting a near-steady decline in new infections over the past few weeks. Together, US, Brazil and India were responsible for more than 1.1 million (61%) of the 1.8 million new cases reported across the world.In all, infections have been reported in at least 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019. After a rapid initial outbreak, China managed to control the outbreak by the end of February (the nation has since dropped to the 30th place globally, with 84,619 cases). However, by then, the virus spread to several other countries, particularly in Europe. Italy became one of the earliest hot spots of the outbreak in Europe along with Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany.The World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020.The US, meanwhile, has been the worst-hit nation in the world since it overtook China on March 26. As of Sunday night, it has more than 5,166,319 cases and 165,269 deaths.In terms of continents, nearly a third (31%) of cases have come from North America, followed by Asia’s 25% of cases and South America’s 24% of cases. Europe accounts for over 15% of all confirmed cases in the world.As countries across the world started lifting months of lockdowns induced by Covid-19, many that had largely controlled a first wave, started seeing a second wave of cases. Key among them was the United States, but cases have also been rising in Europe the past few weeks with nations such as Spain, Italy reporting new batches of cases since the last week of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-trajectory-a-worry-as-the-world-nears-20mn-cases/story-b3YZpk3c6n2YzESWOGyG5J.html
10-08-2020||India||India to stop import of 101 key military items||India announced on Sunday that it will ban the import of 101 types of weapons and ammunition over the next five years — from artillery guns to light military transport aircraft and conventional submarines to long-range land attack cruise missiles — in a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector. The detailed list of equipment published by the defence ministry has spelled out that the import embargo will kick in between December 2020 and December 2025 for different categories of military hardware. The government has also created a separate budget for the purchase of locally produced military hardware. “Our aim is to apprise the Indian defence industry about the anticipated requirements of the armed forces so that they are better prepared to realise the goal of indigenisation,” said defence minister Rajnath Singh, who made the announcement on Twitter. Later in the day, the defence minister said at an online event that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will present a new outline for a self-reliant India in his address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15. Also read| Centre’s move to ban import of 101 items will give major boost to defence sector: Amit ShahHe also referred to his announcement on defence import ban and said the Modi government was taking “big and tough” decisions for a self-reliant India. The coronavirus pandemic has shown that a country may not be able to effectively protect its sovereignty if it is not self-reliant, he said, adding: “Our government will not allow any harm to India’s self respect and sovereignty at any cost.”The move to ban the import of the 101 items is expected to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (Self-reliant India Movement). In May, the government announced that it would notify a list of weapons and equipment that cannot be imported. The military hardware on the negative import list includes assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition. The ministry will take necessary steps to ensure that the timelines for the production of the equipment on the negative import list are met, Singh said. The list includes wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs), with an embargo date of December 2021. The army is expected to order 200 AFVs at a cost of more than ~5,000 crore, he said.  The list of weapons banned for import will be reviewed every year. “More such equipment for import embargo would be identified progressively by the Department of Military Affairs in (DMA) in consultation with all stakeholders. A due note of this will also be made in the Defence Acquisition Procedure to ensure that no item in the negative list is processed for import in the future,” the minister said. This implies India will have to compulsorily develop technology for defence systems and platforms figuring on the negative import list, experts said. One of the key responsibilities assigned by the government to the DMA, headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, is to promote the use of indigenous military equipment in the armed forces. The list has been put together by the ministry after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including the military and the industry, and factoring in the future capabilities of the defence sector to locally manufacture equipment and ammunition. “Almost 260 schemes of such items were contracted by the tri-services at an approximate cost of ~3.5 lakh crore between April 2015 and August 2020. It is estimated that contracts worth almost ~4 lakh crore will be placed upon the domestic industry within the next six to seven years,” Singh said. He said the ministry has split the capital budget for 2020-21 between domestic and foreign capital procurement routes. “A separate budget head has been created with an outlay of ~52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement in the current financial year,” he said. From raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government had announced a raft of measures to boost self reliance in the defence sector in May 2020. It’s a good start to a very long journey ahead, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “While the Indian private industry, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises, would be expected to perform as per a time schedule and a quality yardstick, the government will still have to handhold the small players through financial and policy support,” Bahadur added. Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers. Defence Research and Development Organisation chief G Satheesh Reddy told Hindustan Times that the country had the capability to develop and manufacture the military equipment on the negative import list within the prescribed embargo timelines. PLR Systems chairman Ashok Wadhawan said, “The items on the list can and will have to be produced domestically. If there are any capability gaps, they will have to be filled as there is no other option.” PLR Systems is an Indian joint venture with Israel Weapon Industries (IWI) and it is competing for contracts to supply assault rifles, light machine guns, carbines and sniper rifles to the military. India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April. Confederation of India Industry director general Chandrajit Banerjee said the announcement of the negative import list marked the launch of a “new glide path” for Atmanirbhar Bharat. “The announcement of ~52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement coupled with the list of 101 items for import embargo gives a tremendous boost to Atmanirbhar Bharat and indigenous defence manufacturing,” he added.Former Union minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram said the defence minister promised a “bang” on a Sunday morning and ended with a “whimper”. He was referring to a Twitter alert by Singh on an “important announcement” an hour before the defence minister gave out details of the move to achieve self-reliance.

The dead include a five-year-old girl and two boys, aged 11 and 10. Police found traces of rat poison and a suicide note in the house, causing them to suspect that the 11 had killed themselves. But murder cannot be ruled out, the police said.“All angles are being investigated,” said Jodhpur (rural) superintendent of police Rahul Barhat. Barhat said that the lone survivor who slept on the veranda outside the hut, informed the police about the deaths around 10 am on Sunday. “The survivor told us that when he went into the house on Sunday morning, other members of the family didn’t wake up. He said he called some people and it was found that the 11 people were dead. Kewalram went to the police station to inform about the incident,” the SP said. The Jodhpur SP and district collector Indrajeet Singh visited the scene. Senior police officials, a dog squad and a forensic science laboratory (FSL) team also reached the house.The dead belonged to the Bheel community. All of them lived in the single-room house. “All the deceased are Pakistani immigrants and were living in Jodhpur since 2015 on long-term visa. Migrants of any other country can only apply for citizenship after completing seven years in India. The family had taken a farm on lease from a local and used to do farming on that for their survival. They had many relatives in Jodhpur also,” said Barhat. The Jodhpur rural SP said that during examination of the spot, traces of rat poison were found. No injury marks or bruises were found on the bodies, the SP said. “Prima facie it appears that the deceased consumed poisons as traces of rat poison were found from the floor of the house. There is a possibility that someone may had mixed the poison in the dinner of the deceased last night. A suicide note has been also recovered from the spot which indicates abetment. However, the note could have been placed on the spot to distract the police investigation. No injury marks or bruises have been found on the bodies of the deceased,” the police officer said.The suicide note mentioned financial hardships the family was facing and problems two of the family members were facing from their in-laws. The SP said the suicide note could have been planted at the crime scene to divert police investigation.The postmortem examination on the victims would be done by a team of doctors at a Jodhpur medical college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-of-immigrant-family-from-pakistan-found-dead-cops-suspect-suicide-pact/story-PrH0us2GSHOn3SL7v0gWQM.html
10-08-2020||India||Draft EIA disgraceful and dangerous, says Rahul Gandhi||The union environment ministry has received well over 100,000 comments and suggestions from people on the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification of 2020 that some green activists say could severely undermine environmental regulation in India.“The number of comments is way over a lakh. We are still compiling the submissions. We have been overwhelmed with the number of comments,” said a senior environment ministry official who declined to be identified. The feedback was based on the count as of Friday. The deadline for submission of feedback is Tuesday.Environmental activists have been critical of the draft EIA notification, which was published by the environment ministry in March, because of a number of contentious clauses that they say could weaken environmental regulation.“The government itself will turn its policy interventions into horror stories on the ground if projects are not put through rigourous, EIA procedures in an impartial manner,” said Manju Menon, legal researcher at Centre for Policy ResearchThe notification became a potential issue for a political debate on Sunday when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the notification was “not only disgraceful, it is dangerous.” #IndiaNotForSale was also trending on Twitter which had people drawing attention to concerns over the draft notification and demanding it be withdrawn. Not only does it have the potential to reverse many of the hard-fought-for gains that have been won over the years in the battle to protect India’s environment, it could potentially unleash “widespread environmental destruction and mayhem across India,” Gandhi wrote in a lengthy post on a social media platform.He highlighted contentious clauses and said if a project is labelled strategic, highly polluting industries could be exempted from the environment impact assessment process and that an EIA can be conducted post facto, after a project has already violated the EIA notification by starting construction without getting an environmental clearance.“This EIA 2020 draft is a disaster. It seeks to silence the voice of communities who will be directly impacted by the environmental degradation it unleashes. I urge every Indian to rise up and protest against it. Our youth, who have always been at the forefront of every battle to protect our environment, must take up this cause and make it their own. A fight to protect our environment cuts across political and ideological beliefs,” Gandhi wrote, adding: “If nothing else, the recent Covid19 pandemic has shown us how fragile human life is. For millions of Indians already living on the edge, the environment isn’t an abstract term, but a life and livelihood issue. If EIA 2020 is notified by the government, the long-term consequences of the widespread environmental degradation will be catastrophic for us and future generations of Indians.”Congress leader and former environment minister and chairman of the parliamentary committee on science, technology, environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, wrote to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar more than once last month, raising these concerns. Javadekar also responded in writing, suggesting that the concerns were “unfounded” and based on “misrepresentation.” There was much controversy around the draft also because Delhi Police issued a notice to a youth climate group, Fridays For Future, under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, invoking section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on July 8 and said that their website depicts contents “which are dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of India.”The notice was issued following a complaint by Javadekar against multiple emails sent to him on the subject of EIA 2020.Delhi Police later clarified that the July 8 notice issued under UAPA was a “clerical error” which was withdrawn and that a fresh notice had been sent to the group.Environment ministry officials in the EIA division said it will take a long time for the ministry to look into every comment before taking a call on notifying the draft. “The time for comments expires on August 11. But it will take us quite some time to go through the comments and discuss,” said Geeta Menon, joint secretary, environment ministry. HT sought a response from Javadekar through the Press Information Bureau, but didn’t receive a reply until late Sunday. Environment secretary RP Gupta also did not respond to HT’s calls for a response on SundayOn a petition to extend the deadline for public comments on the draft notification, the Delhi high court had extended the time for submission of feedback until August 11 from the June 30 date originally set by the ministry. The court also asked the Centre to publish the notification in all vernacular languages on websites.“We have been informed that the environment ministry has moved the Supreme Court against Delhi high court’s order of translating the draft in all languages. We are a respondent in SC too,” said Vikrant Tongad, the advocate who had filed the petition to extend the deadline in the Delhi high court.Major concerns with draft EIA 2020:• Post-facto clearances: Detailed protocol for appraisal of projects that have started operating without approval. Projects that have violated norms can be regularised based on appraisal and asked to furnish a bank guarantee.• The draft exempts many projects seeking an expansion or modernisation with a capacity increase of up to 50% and even establishment of new projects from requiring a public consultation• Extended time for reporting of compliance with environment clearance conditions• Reduces public consultation period from 30 days to 20 days||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draft-eia-disgraceful-and-dangerous-says-rahul/story-zBtUTlzYxOPIiG3n6QofjN.html
10-08-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi to stay Congress president till election of new party chief||The Congress on Sunday sought to set at rest speculation over an extension of the tenure of Sonia Gandhi as the party’s interim chief beyond Monday, August 10, saying she will continue to occupy the post until the process of electing a new president is completed. A Congress functionary said an extension was a technical requirement under the party’s constitution given that a regular president is yet to be elected. The party also has to inform the Election Commission of its decision. The party has maintained that the process of electing a new president could not be initiated because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the nationwide lockdown enforced on March 25 to contain its spread. “Soon after her appointment, there were assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana in October-November last year followed by polls in Jharkhand and Delhi. Then the Covid-19 struck,” added the party functionary quoted above. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) named Sonia Gandhi as the party’s interim chief on August 10 last year after Rahul Gandhi refused to take back the resignation he tendered in May after the party’s rout in the Lok Sabha elections in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was re-elected for a second straight term . The CWC has powers to appoint a provisional president pending the election of a regular president by the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party’s central unit comprising around 2,000 members from across the country. “Neither nature nor politics nor political parties permit or tolerate a vacuum. Just like nature abhors a vacuum, political parties cannot function in a vacuum. It is true that the tenure is expiring tomorrow (Monday). There is a laid down procedure in the constitution for elections,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, addressing a virtual news conference. “In the meanwhile, if anybody is suggesting that the Congress will become headless on the stroke of midnight of August 10, is it possible? Is that a fair interpretation of any constitution that August 10 midnight happens and the seat suddenly becomes vacant? Nobody can suggest that. No point giving simple views as they have to be in accord with common sense,” he added. Singhvi said the process of electing a new party chief will be completed soon and till then Sonia Gandhi will remain at the helm. “Sonia Gandhi ji is the president and she will continue till such time a proper procedure is implemented and it will be implemented in the not too distant future. It is as simple as that,” he said. A veteran Congress leader said on the condition of anonymity that general secretary in-charge of the organisation KC Venugopal will have to inform the election commission that the organisational polls could not be held due to certain reasons and till the time the process is completed Sonia Gandhi will continue to discharge her responsibilities as the party’s interim president.The CWC can ratify this decision anytime, he added. “There is a process that goes to the CWC and the AICC and this will start anytime and you will get the results soon. We are bound by our party constitution,” added Singhvi. In the run-up to the August 10 deadline, some sections of the Congress had started demanding that Rahul Gandhi return to the post. He was elected the Congress president in December 2017 for five years till 2022. Congress leaders say that while Rahul Gandhi is not keen to accept that responsibility in the immediate future, Sonia Gandhi is also unwilling to continue in the post for long. In the CWC meeting on August 10 last year, Sonia Gandhi agreed to lead the party once again after repeated pleas by her colleagues and only on the condition that she would stay on interim chief only till an election to choose a full-time president is held. “It’s unfair to her to expect her to carry this burden indefinitely,” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor told PTI. He said the Congress must expedite the process of finding a full-term president, through a participatory and democratic procedure, to arrest the growing public perception that the party is “adrift and rudderless” if Rahul Gandhi does not wish to become president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-to-stay-congress-president-till-election-of-new-party-chief/story-3rhczxwrVge2obP9diRjgL.html
10-08-2020||India||India rejects Nepal’s stand on Buddha row||India on Sunday dismissed a controversy over the birthplace of Gautam Buddha and said a comment by external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the shared Buddhist heritage of the two neighbours was misunderstood in the Himalayan country. The clarification came a day after Jaishankar referred to the teachings of Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi at an event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries. The remark triggered controversy in Nepal with political parties saying that Buddha, the philosopher and religious teacher who founded Buddhism, was born in Nepal and not India.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Jaishankar’s remark referred to common Buddhist heritage of India and Nepal. “There is no doubt that Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, which is in Nepal,” he said.The Indian side said at the time of the Buddha, who lived in the 5th and 4th century BC, there was no separate nation state called Nepal, and that the Siddhartha Gautama became Buddha after attaining enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, which is in modern day Bihar. Earlier in the day, Nepal’s foreign ministry said that historical and archaeological evidence showed Buddha was born in Nepalese territory. “It is a well-established and undeniable fact proven by historical and archaeological evidences that Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, Nepal. Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha and the fountain of Buddhism, is one of the UNESCO world heritage sites,” a statement by the ministry’s spokesperson read.  There were also protests by political parties such as the main opposition Nepali Congress and individuals such as former foreign secretary Madhu Raman Acharya and former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, a top leader of the ruling Nepal Communist Party. The controversy came against the backdrop of a border row that erupted earlier this year when India opened a new road leading to Lipulekh on the border with Tibet. Nepal responded by publishing a new political map that included Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, which are controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory. Last month, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli sparked a controversy with his remarks that the “real” Ayodhya is in Nepal and that Lord Ram was Nepalese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-nepal-s-stand-on-buddha-row/story-bPsLu3HG6wgkXx6ftvIkYO.html
10-08-2020||India||10 killed in fire at Andhra Pradesh Covid-19 facility||A fire broke out at a hotel being used as a Covid-19 treatment facility in Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada city early on Sunday, killing 10 patients, officials said.About 31 patients of the coronavirus disease were in the facility, most of them deep in sleep, along with six medical personnel and six hospital staff in the facility at the time the fire broke out. The 10 victims suffocated to death. The hotel – Swarna Palace – was being used as a care centre for Covid-19 patients by the privately run Ramesh Hospitals. According state health minister Alla Kali Krishna Prasad, the fire broke out at around 4.45 am on the ground floor of the hotel and spread to the first and second floors. Preliminary investigations by the police revealed that the fire was the result of a short-circuit in the electric wiring. Also read| Andhra Pradesh: FIR registered in Vijayawada fire incidentFlames engulfed the building and thick plumes of smoke billowed from the entire building. Some the medical personnel and hotel staff managed to escape by running out and four of them jumped off the first and second floors to save their lives. A security guard, Krishna Reddy, suffered injuries by falling to the ground. Many of the patients were fast asleep when the fire broke out. Some young patients tried to run out of the rooms but did not know how to escape because of the fire and smoke that engulfed the building. . “I did not know in which direction I was moving. I managed to open the window panes and come out shouting for help. I picked up courage and informed the police,” a young patient, Pavan Sai, said in a video message. Vijayawada city police commissioner B Srinivasulu said the police control room had received a call at around 5.15 am about the fire breaking out in the hotel. The minister, however, said the fire station, which is situated less than a kilometre away from the hotel, received the first call at 5.09 and within five minutes, the fire tenders arrived at the scene. “The fire was brought under control within a couple of hours,” the minister said. After putting out the fire, the firemen and personnel of the National Disaster Response Force brought out the bodies of 10 patients. The bodies were shifted to the Vijayawada government hospital for post-mortem. The dead were identified as: Kosaraju Suvarnalath (42) of Nidabrolu village of Ponnur block in Guntur district; Dokku Siva Brahmaiah (59) of Machilipatnam in Krishna district; Potluri Purnachandra Rao of Kodali in Krishna district; Sunkara Babu Rao (80), Indira Nagar, Vijayawada; Majji Gopi (54) of Machilipatnam; G Venkata Jaya Lakshmi (52) of Kandukuru in Prakasam district; Venkata Narasimha Pavan Kumar (40) of Kandukuru in Prakasam; Sabbili Ratna Abraham (48), Rajakumari (40), both from Jaggayyapet; and Maddali Raghu (40) of Moghulraja Puram, Vijayawada. In all, the firemen rescued 18 Covid-19 patients, mostly by bringing them out through the windows, using ladders. All the rescued Covid-19 patients were taken to Ramesh Hospitals, where they were declared out of danger. Three others were moved to a different hotel. Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas, district collector Imtiaz Ali and director general of police Gautam Sawang supervised the rescue operation. Following a formal complaint from Vijayawada Central tehsildar (block revenue official), the police registered criminal cases against the managements of Ramesh Hospitals and Swarna Palace Hotel under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 308 read with 34 (acts amounting to culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. The tehsildar said Ramesh Hospital had a memorandum of understanding with Swarna Palace Hotel to operate a Covid-19 facility on a paid basis. “It appears that the management of the hotel and Ramesh Hospitals had known that there are electrical defects in the lodge (hotel), and as rectification of defects involved a huge amount, they avoided repairing it. Knowing the fact that if the defects were not rectified, there is a possibility of an accident, they opened the Covid-19 care centre,” the official said. The health minister said a committee had been formed to prepare a detailed report on the fire within 48 hours. “Preliminary report says the hospital and the hotel managements are at fault. We asked for a detailed report so that stringent action can be initiated against those responsible”, the minister said. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Sunday announced ex gratia of Rs 50 lakh to the kin of the deceased. He ordered an in-depth probe into the incident Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and spoke to the chief minister over the phone about the fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-killed-in-fire-at-ap-covid-facility/story-xiAnaQQEYwpoaQaSR8CbGK.html
10-08-2020||India||A year after Article 370, Kashmir valley voter turnout a big number to watch||On August 5, 2019, the Narendra Modi government effectively annulled Article 370 of the Constitution that conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and divided the state into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh. A year on, there is little convergence of views on the move. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continues to assert that the decision was in the interest of Kashmir and the nation at large. Mainstream political actors in Kashmir continue to oppose it. In an opinion piece published in the Indian Express, National Conference leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah wrote that unless the central government restores statehood to J&K, he will not participate in elections.In making this threat, Abdullah is raising a metric which has often been seen as the most important measure of democratic legitimacy-- voter turnout in elections. This collapsed in the immediate aftermath of the militancy, took time to recover once elections were restored , but then resumed its downward trajectory after the BJP’s alliance with the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) ended in a fiasco. Because the erstwhile state of J&K also had parts of Jammu and Ladakh, which unlike the Kashmir valley do not have a Muslim-majority population, a geographical segregation is more useful to understand the valley’s political sentiment rather than headline voter turnout numbers for the entire erstwhile state. The legislative assembly of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir had 87 members, 46 from the Kashmir valley, 37 from the Jammu region and four from Ladakh. The assembly’s total strength was 76 before a delimitation exercise in 1995 (42 from Kashmir, 32 from Jammu and two from Ladakh).In the 1987 assembly elections, held just before the militancy began, 73% of registered voters participated, the highest ever in any assembly or Lok Sabha election in Jammu and Kashmir. The voter turnout in 42 assembly constituencies of the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley was 77% compared to 69% in 32 constituencies of the Hindu-majority Jammu region. This was the last assembly or Lok Sabha election in which the valley saw a higher voter turnout than Jammu.Alleged rigging of the 1987 assembly election is known to have ignited large-scale militancy in the Kashmir valley. Its impact on electoral politics was clear two years later when, in the Lok Sabha elections of 1989, only 25% of the electorate turned out to vote in the whole state. About 48% voted in the Jammu region, a 20 percentage point drop from the 1987 elections. In the Kashmir valley, just 3.4% voted, a 73 percentage point drop. In the Ladakh region, on the contrary, there was a 12 percentage point increase in voter turnout between these two rounds of elections.Also read: From Kashmir to Ayodhya, the BJP’s total domination of politicsWhen Lok Sabha and assembly elections were held in the state after a gap of seven years in 1996, there was a significant improvement in the number of people turning out to vote, especially in the Kashmir valley. Nearly 43% people voted in the valley in both these elections, compared to just 3% in the 1989 polls. However, it took more than a decade before a majority of voters participated in polls in the Kashmir valley. It was only in the 2008 assembly election in which the Kashmir valley recorded a 52% voter turnout, while 72% voted in Jammu and 69% in Ladakh. To be sure, people’s participation in the polls did not significantly drop in Ladakh during the militancy, except in the 2002 assembly polls.The highest voter turnout in Kashmir valley after militancy erupted was in the 2014 assembly elections. This was the same election which ended with a hung assembly and paved the way for a coalition government of the BJP and PDP, the last elected government in the state before it was turned into a Union territory. It was during the BJP-PDP government’s time that the valley erupted into prolonged turmoil after the killing of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.The turnout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the Kashmir valley dropped to 19%, the lowest in two decades and 12 percentage points less than in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. To be sure, signs of growing disenchantment with the democratic process were visible earlier. Three years before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti won the by-election to the Anantnag assembly constituency. At 34%, the constituency recorded its lowest voter turnout in three elections. Also, only 7% voters participated in the by-election to the Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency in April 2017, its lowest ever voter turnout.Also read: Astute political skills may be key for new J&K L-G Manoj SinhaAmong the numbers worth watching out for in the Kashmir valley, as far as the success or failure of nullification of Article 370 is concerned, will be the voter turnout whenever there is an election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-after-art-370-valley-voter-turnout-a-big-number-to-watch/story-wYGfegaFjEWyqWlER8VL4O.html
10-08-2020||India||No new coronavirus test done on Amit Shah, says MHA after Manoj Tiwari’s post creates confusion||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Sunday denied a claim by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament Manoj Tiwari that the Union home minister, Amit Shah, who has tested positive for the coronavirus disease last week, had tested negative this morning. Hours after Tiwari tweeted that the home minister’s latest report had stated he had tested negative, an MHA official issued a clarification saying that no fresh test has been done on Shah and so, “unconfirmed” reports should be avoided. “Nothing other than the official health bulletin released either by the treating hospital, MHA or his own Twitter feed should be referred to,” a government official said, requesting anonymity. Manoj Tiwari, who is a former BJP president in Delhi, also deleted his tweet later. The Union minister had tested positive for Covid-19 last Sunday and was admitted to the Medanta Hospital in Gurugram. Shah had himself announced the news on Twitter. “After showing initial symptoms, I underwent a test for coronavirus and the report came out positive. My health is fine but I am being admitted to the hospital on the advice of doctors,” Shah had posted last Sunday. Officials familiar with Shah’s schedule said that he is working from hospital and is clearing the files. Shah has also been regularly tweeting the government’s achievements. On Sunday, he praised the government’s decision to put 101 items on embargo to boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India movement) in defence production. “Modi govt’s decision of import embargo on 101 items and a separate budget for domestic capital procurement of nearly Rs 52,000 crore for the current financial year will surely provide a major boost to the indigenous defence sector. I thank PM @NarendraModi & RM @RajnathSingh for this historic decision,” the home minister tweeted. Officials cited above said the minister is recovering at present and another test will be conducted in a couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/45-annual-funds-for-jobs-ration-spent-in-4-months/story-3DZAkqyCVUl6Bp2EzJctlI.html
10-08-2020||India||Health ministry’s tele-medicine platform provided 100k online consultations: Data||In about nine months since it was inaugurated, the Union health ministry’s tele-medicine service platform has provided at least 100,000 online consultations, shows data released by the ministry on Sunday, leading to patient to doctor consultations within the confines of a patient’s home, as well as doctor to doctor consultations.The service has particularly proved to be beneficial for patients during the past six months as visits to hospitals have been limited because of the high risk of contracting coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection.On average, about 5,000 tele consultations are being provided per day.The health minister Harsh Vardhan held a review meeting with States and Union territories on progress made by the platform that is called eSanjeevani and eSanjeevaniOPD.In a short span of time since November 2019, tele-consultation by eSanjeevani andeSanjeevaniOPD have been implemented by 23 States that cover 75% of the population, and other States are in the process of rolling it out.“Under the guidance of… Prime Minister (Narendra Modi), we have started implementing the vision of Digital India through broadband and mobile phones at the Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. With the cooperation of States and UTs, and a pool of selfless and talented medical practitioners and specialists, we have been able to provide healthcare services through tele-medicine platform such as eSanjeevani. This has substantially augmented our health infrastructure during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Harsh Vardhan.The facility will be particularly beneficial for people in villages where access to a healthcare facility is not that widespread.“This eSanjeevani platform has enabled two types of telemedicine services viz. doctor-to-doctor(eSanjeevani) and patient-to-doctor (eSanjeevani OPD) tele-consultations. The former is being implemented under the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWCs) programme,” said Ashwini Kumar Choubey, minister of state for health and family welfare.The health ministry plans to implement tele-consultation in all the 1.5 lakh HWCs (as spokes) in a ‘hub and spoke’ model, by December 2022.States have identified and set up dedicated ‘hubs’ in medical colleges and district hospitals to provide tele-consultation services to ‘spokes’ that will be functional at sub-health centres and primary health centres. About 12,000 users comprising community health officers and doctors have been trained to make use of this national e-platform to date.Currently, telemedicine is being provided through more than 3,000 HWCs in 10 States.The telemedicine platform is hosting about 40 online out patient departments (OPDs), and at least half of these are speciality OPDs that include gynaecology, psychiatry, dermatology, ear nose and throat (ENT), ophthalmology, antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS/HIV patients, non-communicable disease etc. Around 3,000 doctors have been trained and on-boarded at eSanjeevaniOPD and every day around 250 doctors and specialists across the country provide eHealth services.“Owing to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the Health Ministry launched the second tele- consultation service enabling patient-to-doctor telemedicine through ‘eSanjeevaniOPD’. Offered at no cost, this e-health service is rapidly gaining popularity as citizens in around 20 States are now consulting doctors without having to go to the hospital physically…This service is available as an Android mobile application as well. This has made it convenient for the people to avail of the health services without having to travel. It also ensures that the patient gets to see the doctor in around five minutes after logging in,” said health ministry in its statement.Experts say demand for telemedicine is growing because of the convenience it provides.“At Medanta also we provide tele-consultation to peripheral hospitals and it works well. In countries like US also e-ICUs is a growing concept. Plus, something is always better than nothing,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telemedicine-online-consultations-at-100k/story-LB5x70ydJEVvUldSVtaf6K.html
10-08-2020||India||PM Modi announces ₹1L crore support for agriculture sector||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a Rs 1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund to boost investment in the farm sector, especially in cold storages, warehousing and markets for farmers.The scheme was first announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman as part of a Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus and relief package in the wake of the coronavirus disease pandemic.Modi also transferred the sixth instalment of the cash payment for farmers under the PM-KISAN scheme, making the announcement via video conferencing. Under the sixth instalment, Rs 17,000 crore has been deposited into the bank accounts of 85 million farmers.According to the guidelines for the agriculture infrastructure fund, all loans up to Rs 2 crore will be disbursed with a 3% interest subsidy. The loans will be disbursed in the next four years with a sanction of Rs 10,000 crore in 2020-21 and Rs 30,000 crore in the next three years.“The agriculture infrastructure fund will provide better warehousing and cold storage facilities for farmers and is a step towards doubling of farm income,” Modi said. The fund will also create new jobs as investments will flow into food processing and post-harvest facilities in rural India.The fund was launched with Rs 1,128 crore of new loans given to over 2,200 cooperative societies.Under the infrastructure fund, banks and financial institutions will provide up to Rs1 lakh crore in loans to cooperative societies, farmer producer companies, self-help groups, entrepreneurs, startups, and infrastructure providers.Through videoconferencing, Modi interacted with farmers from Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. He urged farmers to stop the indiscriminate use of chemical fertilisers like urea to improve soil health.“The Prime Minister had an engaging discussion with the representatives of these societies to understand their current operations and how they plan to utilise the loan. The societies informed the Prime Minister about their plans to build godowns, set up grading and sorting units which will help member-farmers secure a higher price for their produce,” an official statement said.Releasing the latest instalment of PM-Kusan, Modi said: “No middlemen or commission, it went straight to farmers. I am satisfied because the objective of the scheme is being fulfilled.”The PM-KISAN scheme, launched on December 1, 2018, has already provided a direct cash benefit of over Rs. 75,000 crore to more than 99 million farmer families.Under the scheme, income support of Rs 6,000 per year is provided to farmer families across the country in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 every four months. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund is a medium- to long-term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets through interest subsidy and credit guarantee.“Indian agriculture has always depended more on subsidies than investments. The new fund will help correct that. It is important that the fund is managed in a way that farmers are able to achieve scale and connect with markets efficiently,” said Ananth Kumar of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-announces-1l-cr-support-for-agriculture-sector/story-5EZUI9o03Z3BZM31mesllN.html
10-08-2020||India||Bihar’s creaky health care system struggles to curb surging Covid infections||Sarvar Ali, 48, a resident of Patna City, takes private tuitions for a living. He is hard pressed to pay Rs 50,000 per day, living as he is on an artificial life support system at a private nursing home , after having contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on July 30. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Patna refused Ali admission, saying the rapid antigen detection (RAD) test report was not valid, says his nephew Amber Ali. According to Amber Ali, his uncle had to wait in a private ambulance, with oxygen support, for four hours outside AIIMS before the authorities finally refused him admission. “By the time we got him to a private clinic on the 99 feet Bypass Road at Kankerbagh, his condition had deteriorated and he was put on ventilator support,” he added. After doctors prescribed his uncle plasma therapy, Amber said he made around 350 calls to find just two convalescent plasma donors. He went with them from one blood bank to another and from one medical college to another on August 5, but none was willing to oblige. The reason: Most blood banks, including those in government medical colleges, did not have a plasmapheresis machine, required for convalescent plasma donations. The private clinic where Ali is admitted has neither the machine nor the government permission to carry out the procedure. “My uncle is not eating or talking, his condition remains critical,” said Amber, criticising the state government for not capping the cost of treatment in private facilities. Shaukat Ali, 52, another Covid-19 patient, was admitted in the government’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) on July 24. He died a day later. “No doctor attended to my uncle. The nurse came just once and asked me to learn how to administer the drip, saying she would not come again, as she feared contracting the virus,” recollected Aamir Hasmi, 26, a businessman. “Though there are ventilators, there is no functional team to run and manage them. As a result,the ventilators there are underutilised. Doctors do not visit patients, they get medical updates on phone,” he added. Septuagenarian Dr RB Jha, a retired professor and head of the department of surgery at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JLNMCH), Bhagalpur, died of Covid-19 on August 5. Dr Sanjay Kumar Singh, former vice-president of Indian Medical Association, Bihar, alleged Jha died of medical neglect. Also read| Covid-19 in India: Daily tests up to 700k, 1 million target in sight“Dr Jha was in the ICU, with no one to treat him. Most 60-plus doctors are scared to go near Covid-19 patients. The paramedical staff is equally reluctant. If he were to be left at the mercy of God, a temple would have been better than the ICU,” says Dr Singh. With nearly 80,000 infections and a chronically underfunded health care system, Bihar is struggling to arrest the spread of Covid-19, which has been made worse by the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers over two months. The state, which has largest share of rural population among states in India, has only 0.11 beds and 0.39 doctors available per thousand people, according to the National Health Profile, 2019. In comparison, the figures were 0.46 and 1.54 respectively for Maharashtra, the worst-hit state.  The state has conducted 7,917 tests per million people, the lowest of any state in the country, according to HT’s internal Covid-19 dashboard, compared to the national average of 18,086.Bihar also has the third-worst doubling rate, a measure of how many days for infections to double from a given point in time, in the country. The state’s doubling rate stands at 14.7 days, behind only Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand — both at 13.2 days. In contrast, India’s doubling rate stands at 23.6 days. To be sure, testing in the state has increased in recent days. Bihar was testing just 2,352 samples a day on June 1. The figure rose to 8,500 by the end of June. For the week ending August 1, the state conducted 19,000 daily tests at an average. Last week, this number stood at 52,000 tests a day at an average.The increased testing has led to a fall in positivity rate, which is the ratio of positive results to the total number of tests conduced. On July 28, this number stood at 17.1% and came down to 6% on August 8. The government, however, said the situation is slowly improving after a change of guard at the helm of the health department, with Pratyaya Amrit having taking over as principal secretary, health, on July 27. This is the second change the state government has effected since May 20, when Sanjay Kumar was shifted and then Uday Singh Kumawat.Amrit did not respond to calls and text messages. On August 1, Bihar launched a mobile application, Sanjivan, to enrol for home isolation, check availability of beds and requisition ambulance, besides dedicated helpline numbers for tele-consultation.  It also set up control rooms, headed by probationary Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service officers at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. It has also set up dedicated personnel to source medicines for patients, instead of asking their attendants to get them. Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said new cases have to be seen in the perspective of testing, indicating that spike in cases was due to higher testing. Less than 10% of the total 71,520 tests Friday were done through the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) test, considered to be the gold standard for Covid-19, and the rest were rapid antigen tests, which search for substances that trigger an immune response in the patient and can give results in less than an hour. “We have taken testing through rapid antigen kits to the primary health centre level in districts. We are also testing non-Covid patients coming to hospitals with other ailments. We are also testing people at flood relief camps, besides testing those in containment zones,” said a state government official, on condition of anonymity. “The governments at the Centre and state are doing a reasonably good job. It is the people who are behaving irresponsibly by not adhering to norms of social distancing, wearing nasal masks and practising hand-washing habit,” said Dr Ajay Kumar, former national president of the Indian Medical Association and ex-council member of the World Medical Association, which has its headquarters at Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-s-creaky-health-care-system-struggles-to-curb-surging-infections/story-EKe5PTLsrGYD12YLWgp6zK.html
10-08-2020||India||45% annual funds for jobs, ration spent in 4 months||Close to 45% of Central funds meant for ensuring rural employment and subsidised rations, the two schemes that have helped deal with the economic distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, have been spent in just the first four months of the 2020-21 financial year, according to government data. While the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) enabled 90 million households find work between April and July, subsidised rations under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) were provided to an average 720 million people every month during April-July, the data showsThe 68-day lockdown enforced on March 25, shutting all manufacturing and services units barring those deemed essential, triggered an exodus of migrant workers, mainly daily wage-earners, from the cities to their homes in the villages of states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Demand for work and food under two of the world’s biggest social welfare programmes dropped in July after peaking in June, indicating that many of those who had left for their villages may be migrating back to the cities in search of work as lockdown restrictions are gradually eased. Also read| Covid-19 in India: Daily tests up to 700k, 1 million target in sightUnder MGNREGS, 24.2 million households were provided work in July, compared to 38.9 million in June (the highest ever monthly figure under the scheme month) and 33.1 million in May. At least one member of rural household is guaranteed 100 days of work a year under the programme.“The employment in July was less because migrant workers returned to cities and labourers got engaged in sowing work that started in July after a good spell of rains,” said Nikhil Dey, a former member of MGNREGS’s Central Advisory Council and an activist working in rural areas of Rajasthan. This year, the employment provided under the scheme is almost 50% more than in 2019 and 2018, he said. The number of people provided 100 days of employment during the period is almost three times the number in 2019. Himanshu, an associate professor in the department of labour studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University, who uses only his first name, said MGNREGS has provided a social security net to the rural poor, and this is amply clear from the data.Similarly, the disbursement of subsidised rations peaked in June with 94% of the 800 million identified beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act receiving foodgrains. In July, the disbursement came down to 91%, which was about seven percentage points less than the number in June and July of 2019. In terms of foodgrains disbursed, 2.8 million tonnes of rice and 21 million tonnes of wheat was given to the needy in June, which went down to 2.44 million tonnes of rice and 1.99 million tonnes of wheat in July. Still, the quantity was about 20% more compared to June and July 2019, the data showed. The employment generated under MGNREGS and rations disbursed under NFSA in July was still higher than the pre-lockdown period. Officials expect the offtake to remain high under these two schemes and other rural development programmes until the end of this year. Four months of Covid-19 have weighed heavily on the exchequer. According to central government data, between April and July, around 45% of the Rs 1.01 lakh crore allocated for MNREGS and 44% of Rs. 1.15 lakh crore for NFSA this financial year had already been spent . MGNREGS funds are given to states to pay wages to workers and buying raw material for asset creation. The NFSA money is given to the Food Corporation of India for supplying foodgrains from its stocks to different states for their Public Distribution System. “We are left with very less money under MGNREGS for the current financial year,” said a rural development ministry official while briefing the Parliamentary standing committee on labour on Friday. At this pace, the official said, the NREGA funds would be exhausted by early December. He, however, added that as NREGA is a demand-driven scheme, the Central government has to pay the states and the finance ministry has held out an assurance that there would be no shortage of funds. sThe RD ministry official said the government has been taking steps to transfer 100% wages to the bank accounts of the rural jobs guarantee scheme and emphasised the need for a on social audit of the public works built with the funds. “We have been able to plug leakages by weeding out fake jobs cards and it meant more people getting work for same amount of government expenditure,” he said. He said that the Centre had sought a report on high MGNREGS expenditure from states such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which traditionally spend relatively less under the programme. The two states, along with Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, have generated the most work under the programme this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/45-annual-funds-for-jobs-ration-spent-in-4-months/story-1Od9ZPkmswGiRner7QuaeM.html

Efforts are underway to make use of some of the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) machines installed in other government labs that are being used for performing other molecular tests. RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of Covid-19 testing. “Several measures are being taken to ensure testing capacity meets the target in the coming weeks. The measures include upgrading existing labs by way of increasing testing machines, manpower and also work shifts to be able to run more samples in a day,” said an ICMR official, requesting anonymity.Also read: India’s trajectory a worry as the world nears 20 million Covid-19 casesAbout 200-odd machines are installed in other labs that can also be used to carry out Covid-19 testing, the official said.” Also, labs of medical colleges that have the basic infrastructure to conduct molecular tests can also be mentored and upgraded to equip them to perform Covid-19 tests. All this is being done to ensure we reach the target of one million as planned,” the official added. India has performed about 25 million tests since January 22 when Covid-19 testing started with one lab at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune, Maharashtra.ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said last week that the research body had adopted an intelligent and caliberated approach as far as Covid-19 testing was concerned. “When you look at the overall testing numbers, India is comfortably placed. Most states are performing adequate number of tests, however, there are certain states that are lagging behind where we need to increase testing capacity, and the labs there are being established and testing kits deployed accordingly,” he said. Also read: 35% patients in Covid hospitals from outside Delhi, says Satyendar JainAs on Sunday, August 9, India has 1,402 labs -- 940 government and 462 private labs -- approved to perform Covid-19 testing across the country. “Such high level of testing will also lead to high number of daily positive cases, however, States have been advised to firmly focus on comprehensive tracking, prompt isolation and effective treatment, following the Centre-led strategy of test, track and treat,” the health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Experts agree that to control the outbreak, aggressive testing is crucial.“The more you test, the higher will be the number of infected that you will be able to identify. To curtail an infectious disease from spreading, one must be able to identify, through testing, as many infected individuals as possible in time so that they are isolated and put on treatment. It will also ensure they don’t roam around freely within the community and transmit the infection,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The health ministry has held several meetings in the past week to engage with the worst-affected states.The Covid-19 recovery rate continues to improve steadily, with 53,879 Covid-19 patients having recovered and been discharged in the past 24 hours, according to the health ministry data. With this, the total number of recoveries touched 14,80,884 on Sunday, which is at least twice the number of active cases (6,28,747).The recovery rate of patients under medical supervision either in home isolation or in a hospital has touched 68.78%.“The number of Covid-19 patients who need hospitalization is low, and most of those who are hospitalized are recovering faster. The percentage of severely ill cases is even lower, which is why the rate of recovery is seeing constant improvement,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, consultant at tje department of medicine in New Delhi’s Moolchand Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-tests-up-to-700k-1-million-target-in-sight/story-ZQNld4oWxtxTMX1zy2cueP.html
10-08-2020||India||‘All we know is touchdown was late’: DGCA chief on Kerala plane crash||Directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) chief Arun Kumar said the tabletop runway at Calicut Airport, where an Air India Express plane crashed killing 18 people including both pilots on Friday, was long enough for the aircraft, but a late touchdown may have caused the plane to overshoot the runway. Edited excerpts from an interview:What do we know about what happened with the Air India Express flight that crash-landed?We don’t know much, the actual investigation is on. They {investigators} have got the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder so they have to open them and they have to study the transcripts and also the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) transcripts which they have obtained. All we know at this point of time is that the touchdown was late. That is the ATC information, more than 3,000 feet. Actually, if it was 3,000 feet, 4,000 {feet} or 2,000 {feet) -- that will come out once everything is decoded. It was a 9,000 feet runway, which is a fairly long runway as I have been saying all along. It’s not a small runway, for example like Patna which is just 6,000 feet. It is a Code D runway and this is a Code C aircraft and the grading is like B, C, D where D is bigger to C. So under the circumstances, it is fit enough or more than fit enough for a Code C aircraft.Also read| Kozhikode air tragedy: CISF personnel who rescued survivors told to go into quarantineSo you are saying length of the runway was big enough?This runway was fit enough for bigger aircraft, so a smaller type of aircraft cannot complain of the length of the runway. So if you touch down late on any runway, suppose it’s a 12,000 feet runway, and you touchdown at 8,000 feet, then you can have problems.Can you explain how that happens? We can only say that it was a late touchdown and obviously the aircraft has skidded and gone beyond the runway and the safety area. That is also a big rectangle- -240 by 90 square metres -- in all. The aircraft should have stopped there but it has gone beyond that. Fortunately for us, it has not gone far beyond, just 10 feet ahead. With the impact, it has broken into three parts. It could have gone even further, it could have been worse. All these facts, the real truth will come out once the investigation is done by AAIB (Air Accidents Investigating Branch) as under the international civil aviation organisation structure, it has to be an independent body carrying out the investigation. They can find fault with the DGCA too or with airport operator. Who is heading that?Mr Aurobindo Handa, an air force officer who is currently based out of India. He’s a joint secretary rank officer who is heading that bureau.You say that it isn’t a small runway but some experts have pointed out the problem with Calicut was that as a tabletop, there were problems?You don’t do away with tabletop runways. There are tabletop runways across the world. I reiterate and repeat, it is not an Indian innovation. Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu is also a tabletop, they haven’t closed it down. Similiarly, in the US or Europe, all over the world, there are tabletop runways. So what do you do with them? You design flight procedures to navigate your aircraft on these runways. These are very well prescribed and defined procedures. So this isn’t an issue and again 9,000 feet is a fairly long runway.Also read| ‘Spirit of solidarity’: Hardeep Puri lauds locals who rescued Kozhikode crash victimsSome experts have come forward and said that they have pointed out issues in 2010 and 2011; they pointed out problems with the airport to the DGCA. I know you weren’t in DGCA then but you must have read up on them.Yes, I have. The simple point is that at that time when the investigation and the inquiry committee report came, the runway and safety area was not adequate. One of their recommendations was to make these areas appropriate. For that, the dimensions were 240X90 metres. The airport authority, after due deliberations, carved out this safety area. That was one, and secondly, the pavement classification of the runway for it take a heavy aircraft, the strength of the runway to take the load, was also complied with according to the recommendation. All the recommendations that were there have been complied with and after that the airport has been functioning for the last 14 years. In 2006, it was only a 6,000 feet runway, now it is 9,000 feet after acquisition of land and then it was declared an international airport.So all the recommendations that were given by the experts were incorporated?Most of them. Only some weren’t for various reasons. For example, one recommendation was to have an arrester, which means a soft ground on which the aircraft could stop. That was a solution given when you don’t have a runway safety area but since that was made, there was no need for an arrester and that’s why it was dropped.Do we know anything new from the voice recorder or from the black box?No, I am not the right person. The investigator will be going through them. They will study each aspect and come out with the findings.What could be the possible reason for a late touchdown?No idea. Let’s wait for the evidence to tell us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-we-know-is-that-the-touchdown-was-late-director-general-of-civil-aviation-arun-kumar/story-DVNngwno2PLjWCLWO46k1M.html
10-08-2020||India||Death rate among doctors due to Covid far more in Bihar, says IMA official||Death percentage of doctors succumbing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Bihar is nine times more than country’s national average, claims a senior functionary of Indian Medical Association (IMA).“Doctors account for 0.5 per cent of the total deaths in India due to Covid-19. However, in Bihar, the percentage of doctors’ death is 4.75 per cent, which is nine times more than the national average,” said senior vice-president of IMA-Bihar Dr Ajay Kumar.States like Tamil Nadu (0.1%), Maharashtra (0.15%), Gujarat (0.9%), Karnataka (0.6%), Andhra Pradesh (0.7%) and Delhi (0.3%), which reported far more Covid-19 cases, had less percentage of doctors dying to the virus as compared to Bihar, he said. “In Bihar, 19 doctors have died of the 400 fatalities attributed to the virus as on Saturday. In India, against 41,600 Covid-19 deaths, 200 are doctors,” Dr Kumar said. The high percentage of doctors’ death in Bihar has set tongues wagging against the government. At the same time, doctors have also cited exising co-morbidities and reduced precautions among doctors against the virus outbreak in the state. “Most elderly doctors having co-morbidities continued to do private practice. They also took precautions against Covid-19 lightly and had to pay the price with their lives,” said Dr Ranjeet Kumar, general secretary of the Bihar Health Services Association. Among doctors, private medical practitioners account for nearly 64 per cent — seven out of 19 —deaths due to the contagion in Bihar. Dr Kumar questioned the government’s policy of not quarantining doctors who were treating Covid-19 patients. “In other states, doctors doing duty in Covid-19 wards are quarantined for 15 days after 15 days of continuous work. This arrangement is not followed in Bihar, as a result of which our doctors remain exposed to Covid-19 patients far longer than in other states. In fact, in Bihar, doctors are working continuously at a stretch since mid-March, without even an off day,” said Dr Kumar. “I had given our health minister a list of 220 doctors who were infected by SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, around 10 days back, requesting him to allow them to be quarantined, but nothing has happened so far,” he said. Another official also raised concerns over the quality of protection kits available in the state. “Protective gears available here are questionable. Fifty percent doctors in public sector are 60-plus and have co-morbidity, yet they have been drafted for Covid-19 duty despite our requests not to engage them. However, given the shortage of doctors, with 60 per cent posts vacant as compared to their sanctioned strength, the government allowed elderly doctors no relief,” said IMA-Bihar secretary Dr Sunil Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-rate-among-doctors-due-to-covid-far-more-in-bihar-says-ima-official/story-I6hRm0eoJAVXMWSgcyu8zN.html

10-08-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Discharge mechanism in focus after false Covid-19 negatives||Scientists have called for urgently revisiting the discharge protocol for Covid-19 patients after recent international studies showed people can test positive for the virus even after two consecutive negative results. The research comes at a time when South Korean authorities reported 91 patients who were previously cleared of the coronavirus had tested positive again, with experts saying the scare of reinfection was yet unproven, and that a more plausible reason was the unreliability of two RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) tests to conclusively prove a patient cured. “RT-PCR testing is most useful when it is positive,” said Dr Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, US. “It is less useful in ruling out Covid-19. A negative test often does not mean the person does not have the disease, and test results need to be considered in the context of patient characteristics and exposure.” The first study, by Chinese medical experts in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, found that 14.5% of 172 patients discharged from the Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital between Jan 23 and Feb 21 tested positive again. Their hospital discharge protocol was four-pronged: Normal body temperature for more than three consecutive days, significant reduction of respiratory symptoms, improvement in chest CT, and two consecutively negative results of RT-PCR testing separated by a 24-hour interval. This is the common global standard, including in India, for patient discharge. But within an average of roughly 5-9 days from their discharge, 25 patients returned positive tests. “According to our study, it is probably that two negative RT-PCR tests 24 hours apart may not be sufficient for viral clearance evaluation. Repeated viral RT-PCR testing separated by prolonged duration like 48 hours is essential…we suggested that some immunological parameters such as D-dimer and absolute lymphocyte count, and even antibody test should be combined with RT-PCR negative test,” the study added. A second study, by doctors at the Tongji hospital in Wuhan, found that 15 out of 70 patients between Jan 21 and Feb 12 with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection tested positive after two consecutive negative results. But the doctors cautioned that this was likely not a case of recurrence, but one of false negative test and prolonged viral clearance period, which can throw the RT-PCR test off. “Traces of virus detected by RT-PCR were not necessarily correlated with the ability of transmission. However, longer observation period should be considered for certain group of COVID-19 patients,” the doctors concluded. But why is the RT-PCR test, which relies on identifying the virus’s genetic material, unreliable when it comes to discharge? A third study, by Chinese doctors in the Journal of Medical Virology, offers some clues.In this study, of 610 hospitalised patients from Wuhan between February 2 and 17, the scientists reported a “potentially high false negative rate” of the RT-PCR tests. The doctors conducted six tests on the patients, and found that in a number of cases, tests of a particular patient, turned from negative to positive and again negative – indicating the high fluctuating nature of the tests. Eighteen patients tested positive after two consecutive negative tests. Only after five rounds of tests did all patients consistently test negative.“To reduce the number of new cases, strict adherence to discharge criteria is needed. In addition, it is recommended that patients should be isolated for several days after discharge to reduce the risk of transmission,” the study concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discharge-mechanism-in-focus-after-false-negatives/story-ksFnjYViWOhZ4C0O6gOBOJ.html
10-08-2020||Today's||India must take steps to prevent a chemical catastrophe||The ammonium nitrate explosion tragedy in Beirut was avoidable. It also has lessons for India.Chemicals are complex creatures. Ammonium nitrate, for example, is used for fertilisers, although it is being phased out in some countries. But, as we saw, it is almost bomb-like in its propensity to explode. In India, chemicals are handled both formally and informally, even the most toxic of them. For example, people come in contact with mercury and pesticides. So, although we don’t know of an ammonium nitrate crisis in the public domain, let’s try to avoid one.At the risk of stating what many people know already, here are a few foundational steps. First, ministries concerned, with a lead from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, should identify the most explosive chemicals still in use. Second, a handling protocol should be prepared based on the field observations of current practices. Some of these can restrict how much to store, how to store, and how long to store. We know that over time, chemicals lying in godowns can be forgotten till they kill. Third, the protocol has to be disseminated innovatively, both at the grassroot level and the local administration. Capacity building is essential — how should people measure, handle and monitor? What should a trader in a chemical bazaar know, for example? And of course, registry systems should be strengthened, and made easier to use. These are just the basics. We need to roll them, and many more, out before we are struck by a chemical catastrophe.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-must-take-steps-to-prevent-a-chemical-catastrophe/story-WYxD6Q6AISddvsW3fAEf9N.html
10-08-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: A warning bell for Bihar||Bihar is India’s third-largest state in terms of population. It also has the largest share of rural population in any state in the country. It has a large migrant workforce that after a long struggle made its way back home during the lockdown. Its socioeconomic indicators remain weak. And its health infrastructure is limited, with only 0.11 beds and 0.39 doctors available per 1,000 people.When the pandemic spreads to Bihar, it is time to worry. Over the past month, anecdotal evidence and a series of reports have suggested that those with symptoms are unable to get tested; those who have tested positive have struggled to find hospital beds; those who have developed severe symptoms are unable to access medical care, get ventilator support on time, and receive plasma donations; citizens have been lax in following social distancing protocols; health care personnel themselves are wary of providing care for the fear of being infected themselves; and that the contact tracing process is severely limited. A report in this newspaper on Monday showed that data corroborates these reports. While it has improved somewhat in recent days, Bihar has the lowest testing rate anywhere in the country — 7,917 tests per million people, when the national average is 18,086. Like other states, it is banking disproportionately on rapid antigen tests, rather than RT-PCR tests, which is a far more accurate barometer of judging infections. It has the third-worst doubling rate at 14.7 days, when the national average is 23.6 days.While the government has made recent bureaucratic changes and accorded higher priority to Covid-19 management, the reports and data ring a warning bell. Bihar must follow the only successful model available to tackle the pandemic. Increase testing; rigorously trace the infected and their contacts; isolate those infected and treat them; ramp up health infrastructure; and enforce social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-a-warning-bell-for-bihar/story-7FB7aqnKtgHWSbUEHr6ZOJ.html
10-08-2020||Editorials||Boosting agricultural infra||On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), a medium- to long-term infrastructure loan financing facility for enhancing post-harvest infrastructure in India. The scheme is aimed at providing ₹1 lakh crore worth of loans for such projects until 2029. The creation of a comprehensive post-harvest infrastructure in India can be a game-changer in agriculture. Last year, Rameswar Teli, minister of state for food processing industries, told the Lok Sabha that 16% of fruits and vegetables and up to 10% of cereals, oil seeds and pulses are wasted in the country due to inadequate post-harvest infrastructure.Most of the storage infrastructure in the country is not owned by farmers. This also means that they are forced to sell their entire output at one go immediately after the harvest is over, and when prices are low. Because AIF is trying to rope in farmers’ producers organisations (FPOs) to build such infrastructure, it will hopefully also address this asymmetry and allow farmers to dispose their produce in a phased manner to avail better returns. This will go a long way in increasing the bargaining power of Indian farmers.Laudable as the scheme is, its benefits will only accrue in the medium- to long-term. The government must not lose sight of the immediate economic challenge of boosting growth and incomes. Even before the Covid-19 crisis, the economy was caught in one of its worst deceleration phases. The pandemic’s disruption has made matters worse. If the situation does not revive, it is unlikely that FPOs and other intended beneficiaries of AIF loans will be enthusiastic about committing to such investments. There is a growing consensus that the economy needs a big fiscal push to boost economic sentiment — RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) released last week shows that consumer confidence has plummeted to an all-time low — and growth. The optics of Sunday’s announcement — AIF was approved by the Cabinet a month ago, and the actual loan disbursal on Sunday was just ₹1,000 crore — is yet another signal that the actual fiscal boost to the economy does not match the scale of this government’s big-ticket announcements. This needs to change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/boosting-agricultural-infra/story-G03HL6mt117KSvkOf1sJwO.html
10-08-2020||Editorials||The Rajapaksas cement power in Sri Lanka | HT Editorial||After winning the presidential elections last November, and now winning a two-thirds majority in parliamentary elections, the Rajapaksa brothers in Sri Lanka have cemented their control over the island’s polity. Gotabaya Rajapaksa has firmly consolidated his power as president; the parliamentary win now brings back the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister.Both the presidential and now the parliamentary win are not surprising. Citizens were tired of the infighting and inefficiencies of the older dispensation. There remains a deep Sinhalese majoritarian impulse, which the Rajapaksas leverage by virtue of being the leaders who defeated the Tamil Tigers and promising what, in effect, is an exclusivist Sinhalese State. And their party, the Sri Lanka People’s Party, remains the best organised formation even as the other parties are struggling with leadership, ideological, and organisational issues.But while the win itself is not surprising, the consequences are worrisome — for both Sri Lanka and India. Armed with its legislative might, there is a possibility that the Rajapaksas will once again seek to centralise authority, trample institutional checks, and chip away at democratic liberties. Given their discriminatory ethnic outlook, the prospects for reconciliation, justice, and powers to the minorities remain grim. And while they may be somewhat more careful and make the right noises in front of an Indian audience on China, expect the engagement and partnership with Beijing to only grow. India should engage with the regime more vigorously, and diplomatically underline its concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-rajapaksas-cement-power-in-sri-lanka/story-i5FOTzXXnMuXaIoipAku7H.html
