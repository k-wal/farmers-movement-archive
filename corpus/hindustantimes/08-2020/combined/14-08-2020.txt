14-08-2020||News||Envisioning a self-reliant and science-driven India||It was 1918, three years after he returned to India from South Africa. Mahatma Gandhi thought he had a mild case of dysentery while in Ahmedabad. Tempted by an offer of kheer made by Kasturba, he went on to be severely affected. “This was sufficient invitation to the angel of death,” he later wrote in Experiments with Truth. What Gandhi had was a gastric version of the infamous Spanish flu, a pandemic that devastated the world towards the end of the World War I, a gripping story told in Laura Spinney’s The Pale Rider. The state of the world seemed immutable only a year ago. The global braid of politics, economics, dominance and relationships were all knotted together in a way that seemed impossible to redo.In December 2019, all this changed. A spillover occurred. A virus, normally resident in bats infected a human, in Wuhan, China. Often, the story would have ended there. The human would recover and all would be well. This time, the virus had the ability to infect another human from its first human host and then others. If the 1918 flu pandemic spread like ripples in a pond, the SARS-Coronavirus-2 has spread Covid-19 like a stone-hopping across the pond of earth. Not only has the disease wreaked havoc on the health and livelihood of the most vulnerable, the consequential damage to the world’s economy and morale has been immense. Lives and families are in disarray. The stress and the effect on mental health are not to be underestimated. On Independence day, as we look back from January 30, when the first case was reported in India, to the present, we need to grasp three strings — acknowledge citizens with pride, grasp the way out of this pandemic, and take a new path — to create a new braid that will hold India and the world together in a more just way. To anyone unfamiliar with India, it would seem extraordinary how all of India observed lockdowns from the first one onwards. Next, our doctors, nurses and hospitals worked relentlessly. Our administrators from the smallest towns to the big metros have also not rested. Our scientists and engineers, our industry, our farmers, all came together to make extraordinary products for our people and the medical system, defying broken global supply chains. From within government at every level, and at every level in the bureaucracy, there was and is an unflinching commitment to deal with each aspect of this pandemic. These are extraordinary times where decisions, based on complex and multifarious inputs, have to be taken each day, accepted by all each day, and then implemented. All of this under the relentless, eagle-eyed, and critical watch of the media, of intellectuals, and of disease-analysts; all necessary and natural feedback in a democracy. Now, as we go two-thirds of the way through this nightmare year, it is more necessary than ever to wake up, take charge and wrest our lives and livelihood back, and not be numbed into inaction, waiting for a miracle to lead us out. In truth, that miracle is here and it is all of us. We have learnt much about the virus and we need to learn a lot more. But, some conclusions from science are very persuasive. Following them, we can crush the virus and get our lives back. Mask up properly when in company. Observe hygiene. Keep a distance from others, and as much as feasible, stay in ventilated spaces. These are simple to say but often hard to do. Yet, we must keep at it. These acts effectively decrease the spread of the virus. External help is also at hand. Through the efforts of scientists, we are getting better and faster diagnostics tests. In the near future, we will have access to inexpensive and frequent tests, allowing us to carry on with our activities more efficiently than we could in the early stages of the pandemic. Drugs that mitigate the severity of the disease are available and more will come steadily. Drugs that prevent the disease are more difficult, but large efforts are underway. Increasingly, successful vaccines appear more and more promising. They will come and be rolled out, we expect. Studies are ongoing but it seems likely that those who have recovered will be immune to re-infection at least for a while. So, the time, if ever there was one, for shock and despondency is long over. We need to focus on innovative ways to recover and brighten the lives of every Indian.While behaviour, drugs and vaccines will give us an exit from the disease, we need to also pull ourselves up into a new route to recovery and prosperity. The fury of the pandemic has brought together our people and their expectations, our industry and its aspirations, our scientists and their purpose, and our governments (at the Centre and the states) at the helm. Analysts, over many years, have lamented the “silo” mentality in each of our structures and how, if only, we worked with a shared purpose, much can be done. We have worked together during the pandemic, because, now we must work together as that is the only future we have. Here, science and technology has a critical role and must take courage and place itself at the centre. For the first time in many, many years, people have demanded research, not just the fruits of research. There is an appreciation of and expectation from scientists of every kind. We, therefore have a responsibly of immense proportions. Speaking in 1941 on language and science, Albert Einstein said that if the goals of a society are clearly articulated, scientists will find the means to reach them. If there is “perfection of means and confusion of goals”— and much of our science has been trapped in this cage — will not move ahead. The pandemic has shaken us to what our goals should be — we must focus on the environment, biodiversity and sustainable development through Aatmavishwaas and Aatmanirbharata. Ill with flu in the 1918 pandemic, the Mahatma did not flinch and instilled both. On this Independence day, we must take that path again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/envisioning-a-self-reliant-and-science-driven-india/story-UTsF4ZC5ll1LnKA8sJRnSN.html
14-08-2020||Dehradun||Notices to 3 ex-Uttarakhand CMs over non-compliance of pending dues order||Three former Uttarakhand chief ministers - Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Vijay Bahuguna and Bhuvan Chand Khanduri - were sent show cause notices by the state high court over non-compliance of an earlier court order regarding the non-payment of their dues.The former CMs have been directed to submit their replies within three weeks.On June 9, the high court had declared several provisions of ‘Uttarakhand Former Chief Minister Facility (Residential and other facilities) Act 2019’ as ultra vires (beyond one’s legal power or authority), paving way for the recovery of dues.On May 3, the HC had directed ex-CMs to pay the market rent amounting to Rs 2.8 crore for the buildings occupied by them as ex-chief ministers within six months. It had also directed that all amount due and payable towards amenities such as electricity, water, petrol, oil and lubricants etc be recalculated within four months and same be intimated to ex-CMs who shall within six months pay the said amount to the state government.The HC had delivered the order after hearing the PIL filed by Dehradun-based NGO - Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK) - challenging free residence, car, security and other perks to the former chief ministers in 2010.Kartikey Hari Gupta, counsel of the petitioner, said as the former CMs didn’t comply with the HC directions, the petitioner RLEK filed a contempt petition against them on Thursday.“The contempt petition was heard on Friday by the court of Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma. After hearing the matter, the court issued show-cause notices to three former CMs to file replies within three weeks as to why the order has not been complied with,” he said. The case has been listed for hearing after four weeks. In January this year, RLEK had filed a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of the Act passed by the state government in the winter session of state legislative assembly in December last year.Gupta said the court in its June 9 landmark judgment had ruled that Section 4 A and Section 4 C of the Act are in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. He said the HC pointed out that “any attempt by the state legislature to enact a law only to overrule a judicial decision violates the doctrine of the separation of powers which is entrenched in the Constitution of India” The state government on January 15 had issued a gazette notification regarding implementation of the Uttarakhand Former Chief Minister Facility (Residential and other facilities) Act 2019, which was passed by the state legislative assembly in December and assented to by the governor on January 13. According to the notification, the appropriate rent of the government residences allotted to the ex-CMs would be recovered from the allottee from the date of allotment. However, the notification added, the facilities provided to the ex-CMs by the state government like vehicle along with driver, maintenance of vehicles, personal assistant/officer on special duty/public relation officer, fourth class employee, watchman, gardened, telephone, attendant, security guard, as determined by the government, would be free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/notices-to-3-ex-uttarakhand-cms-over-non-compliance-of-pending-dues-order/story-T7HXNOg1osm4BFDjBI7QuJ.html
14-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 recoveries cross 400,000 in Maharashtra, tests top three million||Maharashtra recorded 12,608 Covid-19 cases, third highest single-day spike, as its tally rose to 572,734 on Friday, with the number of active cases at 151,555. The state’s toll went up to 19,427 with an addition of 364 fatalities. However, according to the state health department, of the 364 deaths, 277 were from the past 48 hours, 46 from the past week and 41 from the period before that.Maharashtra also went past 3,000,000 tests, after 68,995 tests conducted on Friday took the tally up to 3,045,085.The state, meanwhile, crossed the 400,000 recoveries milestone, after 10,484 patients recovered from Covid-19 on Friday. The number of recoveries in Maharashtra stood at 401,442, with August 9 recording the highest single-day recoveries at 13,348.In the past fortnight (since August 1), the number of recoveries have been 145,284, marginally lower than new infections — 150,616. The state crossed 400,000-mark of recoveries in nine days after it went past 300,000 recoveries on August 5. It took the state 11 days to go from 200,000 to 300,000 on July 25; 23 days from 100,000 to 200,000; and 116 days for the first lakh patients to recover. The state’s recovery rate has improved and stand at 70.09% from 67.26% on August 8 and 55.67% on July 14. The national rate is 71.17%.However, the number of fresh infections being recorded in the state every day for the past week has remained high. In the past seven days, the state reported more than 12,000 cases on four days, with 12,822 infections on August 8 being the highest so far since the first case was reported on March 9. “Numbers [cases] are definitely high, but the rise in daily cases is in proportion with the number of tests. Due to more tests, we are getting more cases,” said a senior official from the public health department. “More importantly, active cases are around 27% of the total cases detected so far. Of them, 96% patients are asymptomatic, which means they are completely stable. Another one per cent patients need oxygen support and only 3% patients are in critical condition.”Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health expert, said the rise in cases is certainly because of more number of tests, but the spread in cases should not extend geographically. “It is a fact that increased number of tests will increase the output, but the spread in cases should not extend geographically in new areas and localities, which is currently happening,” said Dr Pattiwar, adding that 95% patients will recover. “The problem is of 3%-5% patients who are critical and the government is falling short of highly skilled doctors and kind of health infrastructure needed to deal with such a situation,” he said.Mumbai, meanwhile, maintained its average daily case count, as it recorded 979 infections on Friday. The city’s tally stands at 128,535, of which 19,337 are active cases. Mumbai had reported its highest single-day spike of 2,077 cases on June 27.The city’s toll, however, crossed the7,000-mark after 47 fatalities were reported on Friday, taking the death count to 7,038.There was a projection that cases will rise in August, which is proving right for Maharashtra. State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, had said cases will rise till mid-August after which the state will hit a plateau. “In my view, the peak has arrived and the cases will continue to rise by another 15 days. We are expecting plateau or flattening of the curve somewhere around August 15. Once we hit the plateau, cases will start declining,” Tope had said.Pune City, meanwhile, continue to contribute maximum infections in the state’s daily caseload as it recorded 1,192 cases on Friday. Its tally stands at 76,645. Pimpri-Chinchwad, a satellite city of the Pune Metropolitan Region, recorded 906 cases, third highest rise in the state.The high fatalities is also a cause for concern for Maharashtra, as the state has recorded 4,433 deaths in the past 14 days as against 6,988 deaths in July, 5,638 in June, 2,286 deaths in May, 449 in April and 10 deaths in March. Maharashtra has highest number of Covid-19 deaths across in the country.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stands at 3.39% (on Friday), second highest in the country after Gujarat, where the CFR was 3.62% with 2,731 deaths (75,408 cases) till Thursday, according to the statistics shared by the state medical education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-recoveries-cross-400-000-in-maharashtra-tests-top-three-million/story-4V60KJMHGaDufF9Wxbf9lI.html

14-08-2020||City||Forest minister kicks off 1200 acre eco-restoration project around Faridabad’s Badkal lake||The forest department’s Badkal eco-restoration project, in which over 2,25,000 native species of vegetation is proposed to be planted in Faridabad’s Aravalli forests, kicked off on Friday in a 1200-acre catchment area around Badkal lake. The plantation drive inaugurated by Haryana forest minister Kanwar Pal will last for two monsoon seasons, with around 1,25,000 native saplings to be planted this year itself, department officials said. Forest department officials said that the Badkal eco-restoration project is part of two such major efforts being planned in south Haryana. The other project is scheduled to kick-off over the weekend in Gurugram’s Kasan village, under the afforestation component of the Centre’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan . “This is basically an exercise in compensatory afforestation to make up for green cover that has been diverted for non-forestry purposes in other parts of the state. The Badkal catchment area is an extremely important groundwater recharge zone, and so we have picked this place to carry out our most ambitious plantation drive in recent year,” said Raj Kumar, district forest officer, Faridabad.The Badkal catchment area is currently notified under special sections four and five of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, which gives the land legal ‘forest’ status, with attendant protection under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. In recent years, rampant mining activity has degraded the local ecology, severely impacting groundwater levels and leaving the nearby Badkal lake bed bone dry for most of the year. “This plantation drive will cover 31 villages in Faridabad, where local communities have been engaged in protecting the regions biodiversity. In this arid climate, the forest department will work with them to nurture these saplings and water supply will be provided. Going ahead, we will be restoring mining pits in the area and creating ponds and johads, so that the forest can be irrigated self-sufficiently,” said Pal. In addition to Badkal in Faridabad and Kasan in Gurugram, there are least two other eco-restoration projects in the pipeline in the region — in Sakatpur near Gairatpur Bas in Kukrola village and around Damdama lake. “These are still in a planing stage, or have been held up due to minor issues. Plantation work in these regions has begun, but they are ambitious projects that require time,” said Jai Kumar, district forest officer, Gurugram. --||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-minister-kicks-off-1200-acre-eco-restoration-project-around-faridabad-s-badkal-lake/story-WgU3tje169US5LHiCv4GcL.html
14-08-2020||Gurugram||DTCP to inspect condominiums regularly, resolve construction, upkeep issues||Abhishek Behl To resolve the issues being faced by residents of group housing societies across the city, officials of town and country planning department (DTCP) have decided to visit individual condominiums and take up issues relating to poor quality of construction material, structural defects, inadequate infrastructure, and poor maintenance. A decision in this regard was taken after several residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), particularly those in the developing sectors, raised these issues with the department, said DTCP officials. The department has also decided to take action against structural engineers of those projects, in which issues of leakage of water, seepage and other defects have been reported. “We have already issued a notice to developers in this regard but now the action would also be initiated against the structural engineers, who have certified the construction quality,” said RS Bhath, district town planner. The residents of condominiums, meanwhile, said that DTCP officials should visit the project sites and see for themselves the plight of residents. Ripudaman Singh, a resident of Raheja Atharva project in Sector 109, said that quality of construction was poor, there was seepage in the basement and in flats and the sewage treatment plant remained non-functional for a long time. “The plaster of the building often falls, which can prove to be fatal. The balconies are in poor shape, while the quality of the fittings is also below average,” he said. Residents also complained that, despite repeated requests to the authorities, they have not been able to get relief. In another newly developed colony in Sector 37 D, the RWA alleged that the club, gym and other common facilities have not been created. “The construction of more that 50% flats has been delayed. The maintenance charges are high but facilities are lacking. Lifts breakdown frequently and electricity tripping is a routine matter,” said Atanu Bhattacharya, a resident. At Sare Homes, a group housing society in Sector 92, the residents said that infrastructure to pump out rainwater from basement is not adequate. “The electricity infrastructure is also not complete as the developer has not set a 33KVA substation for power distribution. There are several such issues and we want the DTCP to resolve them. Ashok Tops, secretary, Atharva RWA said that it was for the first time in January 2020 that an independent RWA has come into existence. “The earlier RWA was nominated by developer. What we want is resolution of problems faced by us such as poor condition of facade, cracks and seepage,” he said. Similar problems abound in majority of the condominiums in the city but DTCP officials said that these problems can easily be resolved if all stakeholders work together. Ravi Sihag, senior town planner (STP), Gurugram said that they have issued notice to Raheja Developers to resolve the issues pertaining to seepage, cracks on building, dumping of waste and non-functional sewerage treatment plant. “We have directed them to take corrective action and warned them of penalty, “ said Sihag. Bhath, who conducted the inspection, said that they will recommend registration of FIRs if developers, maintenance agencies and even RWAs violate rules and don’t take corrective action to mitigate problems being faced by residents “We will be inspecting condominiums regularly. Next week, the team will conduct an inspection of Mapsko Casabela,” he said. When asked about the matter, a spokesperson of Raheja Developers said that occupation certificates were received almost six years ago and maintenance has been handed over to RWAs. “It is up to the RWA to keep basement pumps in working condition specially during the rainy season so that no water can collect. We are helping them to repair the pumps and leakage points”, he said. A spokesperson of Sare Homes, on the other hand, said that the project was facing litigation for last one-and-a-half years. “A mitigation plan has been submitted to Haryana-Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) and we have requested the authority to release funds so that a power substation and related infrastructure can be made. However, due to Covid-19, things have been moving very slow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-to-inspect-condominiums-regularly-resolve-construction-upkeep-issues/story-GMQS6N7NGpjSmZjowZ3xzO.html
14-08-2020||Gurugram||Buses in Gurugram to allow full capacity from today||The Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited on Friday decided to allow full occupancy in all its 68 Gurugaman buses that are currently plying in the city. Buses so far had been restricted to carrying not more than 18 passengers at a time, with alternate seating arrangements to ensure social distancing. However, all vehicles will now be allowed to carry a maximum of 36 passengers. The revised policy was to be implemented a week ago, from August 8. However, it was rolled back at the last minute after senior officials in the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the district administration raised concerns over whether it was too early to relax social distancing norms . At the time, VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, had said, “Physical distancing on all GMCBL buses will continue to be enforced.” However, taking a cue from the state-run Haryana Roadways, which has been running buses at full occupancy across the state for the past week, GMCBL officials on Friday said that restrictions on occupancy will be lifted in Gurugram as well. “We were initially apprehensive about allowing people to sit next to each other, but Haryana Roadways buses have been operating at 100 percent seating without any problems, across the state. Moreover, the number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram is extremely low. So, we have assessed the risk and found it suitable to allow more occupancy,” said Vanita Akhaury, spokesperson, GMCBL. A statement issued to the press on Friday evening, GMCBL CEO Anju Chaudhury said that the decision to lift seating restrictions “will end the pain point of travellers who had to wait at bus stops because the buses were allowing only 18 passengers following the Covid-19 safety rules. Passengers used to complain of getting late for office work and other jobs... This decision has been taken to provide commute relief to passengers travelling in Gurugram.” Vishnu Kumar, 29, who frequently travels from Gurugram to Sohna using Gurugaman’s route number 218, said, “The decision is a relief, because I will be able to save a lot of time. I usually take the bus from Subash Chowk, but I have to wait for one or two buses to pass before I can get a seat which sometimes takes up to 30 mins.” Asked whether he is worried about relaxing social distancing norms in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, Kumar said, “Yes, but the chances of ending up in hospital are very little. If I was older I would perhaps be more worried.” A doctor with the district health department, seeking anonymity, said, “This decision goes against conventional wisdom, but the spread of the virus has slowed down, so the risk is less now. If cases start rising again, we will advise that social distancing norms be put back in place. Meanwhile, all commuters should wear masks and sanitise themselves before entering the bus. These are part of the standard operating procedure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/buses-in-gurugram-to-allow-full-capacity-from-today/story-DtURQJvQ9xxWErjnbJOJKJ.html
14-08-2020||Gurugram||Fine for not wearing masks in public increased to Rs 2500||People not wearing masks in public areas are now liable to be fined up to Rs 2500 , as per the new revised Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) rules that were released on Friday. The fine amount till now was Rs 500.As per MCG officials, during a two-day drive, on Monday and Tuesday, they had found more than 3,000 people violating the compulsory wearing of masks rule. As per MCG officials, till August 1, more than 18,000 people had been fined for mask violations by officials by the civic body, which has realised a fine amount of Rs 90 lakh. Besides the MCG, till July 25, Gurugram police had also fined 13,000 people for mask violations and recovered Rs 64 lakh in penalties. Officials said that through the drive they realised that violations were rampant and a higher fine amount was needed as a deterrent. During the drive, which was carried out on the directions of Haryana government, MCG did not fine a single violator. Instead they just apprised the violators of the rules and the importance of wearing a mask in limiting the spread of Covid-19 and letting them go. Bijendra Sharma, senior sanitary inspector, MCG said that depending on the laxity of the violator, he or she will be fined a minimum of Rs 1,000 and a maximum of Rs 2,500.“Our main objective right from the start has been to implement and introduce various measures that can help in limiting the spread of Covid-19. We realised that Rs 500 was too small a penalty amount for some, and wasn’t necessarily causing a deterrence in people . Hence, we have hiked the penalty amount significantly, with the hope that people realise the importance in wearing of masks during these crucial times,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.In May, MCG had started fining people Rs 500 per violation for not wearing masks in public places. Since mid-July, MCG officials also started handing over five cotton masks to every violator at the time of issuing a fine. Officials said the practice will continue along with the revised penalty rates.At MCG’s sector 42 central store, where all Covid-related items are stored, the civic body has a stock of over 153,000 masks, including 30,000 cloth masks, as of August 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fine-for-not-wearing-masks-in-public-increased-to-rs-2500/story-qWYq7VdKzlhKd5h3gWfXNL.html
14-08-2020||Gurugram||Government schools to have separate entry and exit points for students||In a move aimed at ramping up the school infrastructure to facilitate social distancing measures, the district secondary education department on Thursday directed all its education officers to share details about the government middle and senior secondary schools that do not have separate entry and exit gates on their premises. In a letter shared on Thursday, the department said that adequate arrangements were needed for schools to be reopened in line with directions from the ministry of human resource development (MHRD, recently renamed ministry of education). In order to avoid overcrowding in schools and enforce social distancing, the department was undertaking the construction of separate entry and exit gates in schools that do not already have the facilities, said the department. Schools across the country have been shut since March, when the country went into a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. Elementary education department director and special secretary, school education, Pardeep Kumar said that while the timeline and modalities of reopening would be decided by the MHRD, the state was undertaking preparatory steps. “We are working on ramping up the infrastructure so that every school has more than two gates. We plan to have separate entry and exit gates so that crowding can be avoided whenever schools reopen. There shouldn’t be any congestion,” said Kumar. He added that the department wanted to be prepared with adequate infrastructure before directions are issued by the Centre regarding the reopening of schools. All districts in the state have been asked to share the necessary details by Monday. Ritu Chowdhary, district project coordinator, said that the department was preparing ahead keeping in view the changing circumstances even as guidelines were awaited. “Schools need to have some facilities to ensure that students stay safe during the pandemic. Physical distancing has become extremely crucial and creating infrastructure to meet the new demands will take time. We are planning beforehand,” said Chowdhary. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said,“We have been asked to share details about the existing facilities so that adequate preparations can be done before schools reopen. All these efforts are aimed at complying with physical distancing norms,” said Sharma.

14-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Readers’ Take: We would rather be safe than visit Sukhna Lake on weekends||“Sometimes, the most productive thing that you can do is to step outside and do nothing... relax and enjoy nature.” This is a magnificent quote by Melanie Charlene, an author whose appreciation for the simple beautiful things are authentically expressed through her words. However, by closing the Sukhna during weekends is just a step to save us from the pandemic. Our responsibility at this time is to agree with the government and take all precautionary measures as it’s only for our good. Anybody badly missing greenery should start planting trees and saplings in any space near their homes and enjoy nature’s bounty.Ankita TiwaryIt’s time for implementing smart ideas at the Sukhna lake. Temperature checks should be conducted and social distancing and other SOPs should be put in place. Rapid testing for the virus can also be done outside the lake. Number of visitors can be regulated by issuing digital tokens to visitors. Lists of precautionary measures against Covid-19 can be displayed at the lake and sanitisers also made available.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhSukhna Lake should not be only closed for weekends, but it should be closed permanently along with other tourist places, till the pandemic situation normalises, as leisure and pleasure can only be enjoyed when we are healthy and wealthy and free from any fear of contracting the infection. Though there is no evidence of anyone getting infected while visiting, but even a single case if positive can have serious repercussions on the visitors and infect a large number of people. Thus the old saying: “Prevention is better than cure,” has to be followed by the UT administration.SK Khosla, ChandigarhThe administration is concerned about people’s safety and that is why it has taken the decision to close the lake on weekends. If people need fresh air they can do yoga in their balconies and terraces or go to the parks around the city which do not attract as many people as the lake does. It is now our responsibility to keep ourselves and our families fit by not going out of our homes. Ishita NaraClosing the lake area for 48 hours on the weekends is a good way to have no human footprint in the area for some time and prevent the infection from multiplying, but it isn’t the best approach. People are fed up of being confined at home during the lockdown and want to do anything to exercise. Therefore, the Chandigarh administration should limit lake timings, monitor the number of people in the premises by keeping a count and expect the public to cooperate in return. Temperature checks aren’t sufficient to tackle the problem. A proper head count should be taken, minimum number of people should be allowed and issuing of tokens should start. Maintaining the code of normalcy along with protective measures is a challenge for the administration for sure, but that’s the new normal, isn’t it? Madhav Bansal, ChandigarhThe decision to keep the lake area closed is unlikely to serve any useful purpose since shopping malls, multiplexes, city parks, gardens and other public hotspots are open to the public. In this hour of global distress, the Sukhna offers some breathing space for those who are currently confined at home. The decision would amount to depriving people of their right to enjoy some time in Sukhna’s scenic surroundings. The administration should roll back its decision.Ramesh K Dhiman, Chandigarh Of course it cannot be denied that people need some space for exercise, but at the same time it has to be understood that allowing crowds to gather at the lake would mean increased risk levels. I myself have seen people walking and sitting by the lake without masks and it is for the welfare of the whole tricity that the administration has taken this step. I totally second this decision and will optimistically wait for everything to get back to normal and then enjoy my weekends at my favourite Sukhna lake.Amit SharmaBanning walking in the Sukhna region is in violation of the Fit India movement launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The area around Sukhna should be beautified with more facilities added to make it more attractive. Water reservoirs should be built to make boating and rowing possible throughout the year. Walkers should be allowed here during the day or night without any restrictions. A morning walk as per doctors is like medicine because the body gets extra oxygen which boosts immunity. Corona can be controlled if morning walk is encouraged and not restricted.Col SK Aggarwal (retd), PanchkulaThese are difficult times;we may have to adjust with the virus for a long period of time. However, the joy of watching the calm waters of the lake and enjoying the happiness of the people out boating must not be denied by the administration. It can take measures to regulate the crowds by issuing tokens, ensuring strict checks for masks and gloves and making sanitisers available at the spot.Usha Verma, ChandigarhNot allowing crowds at the Lake is not a bad step and will definitely stop the transmission of Covid-19. The administration can also charge a nominal entry fee at the Sukjna and another public places. This money can be used for emergency services and to sanitise those areas .Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Closing down the Sukhna Lake area to public on weekends due to the corona scare is akin to shutting down factories and vehicular traffic to reduce accidents. Nonetheless, people get what they deserve and self-regulation is the best regulation. But when people violate safety rules and don’t wear masks or observe hygiene or sanitisation, forced curbs and compliance are inevitable though this reflects poorly on regulators. Unlockdowns aim at public ease, activity and liberty but the corona-threat persists unabated. The public does not have to be totally deprived of fresh air or the scenic environs of Sukhna, but preventions and precautions should be strictly enforced. While playing light music, intermittent reminders on public address system should be aired to make visitors alert to the dangers of the virus.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaThe lake area should remain open on all seven days of the week with some riders and conditions. Tokens for visits should be generated online with slot booking. A nominal fee covering the cost of mask and sanitiser may be taken while booking the slot, which can be provided to visitors at entry points of the lake. This will prevent overcrowding which will further contribute to stemming the daily rise in coronavirus cases. Security marshals should be deputed in the area to watch and advise the visitors on safety measures.Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhIn my opinion, we all are part of the administration as good citizens but many people are not following the rules to stop the spread of coronavirus. We are not maintaining social distance or even bothering to wear our masks properly. Observing safety will help us recover quickly from the Covid situation.Gunwant Singh For a healthier mindAmid the pandemic when the masses have spent such a long time period locked at home because of which their mental health could have been affected, the administration should keep Sukhna Lake open to rejuvenate their minds. The entry and exit points of the lake should have kiosks where people should be checked for Covid symptoms. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliNo one is safeLet’s get this straight: When a doctor covered entirely from head to toe in PPE can contract the virus, no one is safe. A vaccine/herd immunity is the only solution going forward and closing the iconic lake is not the solution. Outdoor spaces are great for relaxation and peace of mind in these trying times and so the administration must reconsider and re-evaluate its decision. Avik Seth, Zirakpur No one without masks, sanitisers should be allowedSome rules should be in place if people are to be allowed at Sukhna lake1. People wearing masks, having sanitizers, free of cough, cold and with normal temperature should be allowed to enter.2. Boating should not be allowed for some more time.3. Identity proof at gates is a must so immediate action can be taken if any person shows symptoms of infection.4. Temperatures should be checked at entry levelPrabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurWhy bother now?Maximum relaxation in/during the lockdown has been allowed. Markets have/ had been reopened under the influence of powerful leaders when the coronavirus was peaking. Many people are refusing to follow safety measure like wearing masks, gloves or sanitizing hands. So closing Sukhna on weekends does not make sense. The administration should take strict and strong action/ steps against those who do not follow the guidelines. T. Everyone is equal before law. People must wear face-masks, gloves and maintain social distance. The administration should arrange for a proper health checkup when the citizens go for walks at the Sukhna. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliNot a good move for senior citizensOne visits Sukhna Lake to get fresh air while walking and enjoying the views of the Shivaliks, which is good for one’s physical and mental health, especially senior citizens. Denying them this facility on weekends will force them to stay at home, which could lead to all sorts of health problems. However, visitors should be advised to strictly wear masks, maintain social distancing and sanitise their hands before entering the lake areaCol TBS Bedi(Retd), MohaliPlants and animals need a weekend off tooWill the heavens fall if Sukhna is closed on weekends? Only very few people living close by in nearby VIP sectors visit Sukhna Lake, can’t they cope with the weekend closure? When people go to Sukhna for walk they take their pets with them, can’t they go to parks instead? We have seen people care two hoots for Covid precautions such as masks and social distancing . Besides, excessive activities in and around Sukhna Lake has affected its flora and fauna and aquatic life. These silent creatures also require a break from humans to sustain life. Corona or no corona, Sukhna Lake should also have weekends off – like human beings do. Capt Amar Jeet Kumar (retd).Govt needs to step up confidence building measuresA weekend lockdown serves no purpose. It has to be clearly understood that unless we isolate an infected person for a continuous period of 14 days they will continue to infect others. That is the nature of the Covid-19 virus. The fight against it cannot be won based on perceptions. Hard decisions need to be taken. Lockdowns, anyhow, serve only a limited purpose. The government needs to step-up confidence building measures and ensure that the public does not live under a shadow of fear. Keeping the lake open while observing safety measures is a way out.

14-08-2020||City||Expert group has made unrealistic suggestions, claim power engineers||Patiala Engineers in the power sector across the state have termed the recommendations of group of experts led by economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia as disastrous and unrealistic for the power sector. PSEB Engineers Association (PSEBEA) general secretary Ajay Pal Singh said, “It is surprising that experts from the power sector were not included in the expert group. The group has reiterated the same old recommendations regarding closure/privatisation without understanding the issues affecting the power sector.”He added, “It seems that the group is unaware of basic facts. Non-payment of subsidy bills by the state government is impacting the finances of the PSPCL, but the expert group has avoided any comment on ensuring timely payment of subsidy bills by the state government to the PSPCL. The expert group has also avoided any comment on the very serious issue of expensive power being procured from Punjab based private power plant.”The expert group has also ignored the loss of revenue to the power corporations resulting from avoidable breakdowns due to acute shortage of staff, which leads to poor maintenance of equipment and poor service to consumers, a source claimed.The association also demanded that such a prestigious group assigned with such an important task of devising an economic strategy for Punjab must include experts from the power sector, otherwise such recommendations can be disastrous for the power sector and economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/expert-group-has-made-unrealistic-suggestions-claim-power-engineers/story-yacoLQo1JHLd9s3QQAOyzN.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Returning migrants to be tested for Covid in centres at Delhi’s borders||The Delhi government has set up a rapid antigen test centre at the interstate bus terminal (ISBT) in Anand Vihar in light of migrant workers returning to the capital with the slow revival of the economy and gradual lifting of curbs that were imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The move comes at a time when the daily reported cases have come down in the national capital, while they have gone up in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- the two states from where the maximum number of migrants are trickling into Delhi. Delhi recorded 1,192 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday, against 3,947 – the highest single day spike in the capital – on June 23. Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, recorded 4,512 fresh covid cases on Friday against 605 recorded on June 23. Bihar recorded 3,906 fresh Covid cases on Friday against 206 on June 23.   The rapid antigen test centre was set up on Thursday, said a senior official of the Delhi government. He said till Friday evening, around 450 people were tested at the centre and only six were fund to be Covid-19 positive.Although the interstate road transport is yet to be allowed, many are reaching Delhi by walking across the border lines that Delhi shares with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. “In the next two weeks, the government will set up several such test centres at crucial locations in the city’s border areas. Revenue district officials have been entrusted with identifying such locations,” the official said.Millions of migrant workers had left Delhi in the days following the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of Covid-19. The state government had also set up thousands of centres to provide food and shelter to migrant workers who lost their livelihoods until arrangements were made to send them back to their villages on trains and buses. Thousands of them also set off on arduous journeys back home, covering hundreds of miles, by foot.“Since mid-July, we have seen a large number of workers returning to the city. While it is easier to keep a tab on those arriving by trains, it is difficult to track those coming by foot,” said another senior government official, on condition of anonymity.Currently, interstate road transport is prohibited under the lockdown norms drafted by the central government. But, road transport within states is allowed.The second official said most of the migrants take buses from their respective districts and arrive at Kaushambi – a township in Ghaziabad, on the Uttar Pradesh side of the border. From there, they walk to Anand Vihar, covering a distance of about 4km by foot. From Anand Vihar, which is in Delhi, they take local buses and go to other areas within the national capital, the official quoted above said.He further said most individuals who have so far been tested at the Anand Vihar centre are factory workers, construction workers, and self-employed people such as plumbers, electricians, painters, and carpenters, among others. Several of them have also crossed from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh in a similar fashion, before reaching Delhi eventually, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/returning-migrants-to-be-tested-for-covid-in-centres-at-delhi-s-borders/story-UBhb2Qc5RTQIQY3h3THwvM.html
14-08-2020||City||Capt says no withdrawal of free power, as Montek panel faces flak||Chandigarh As the recommendations of the group of experts led by economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia evoked sharp reactions from political parties, including the Congress, and farm leaders, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said there is no question of withdrawing free power to farmers in the state. Amarinder said free power to tubewells will continue as long as he is leading the government. His government will not consider any recommendation on withdrawal of free power by any expert, he added. The 21-member expert panel, set up by the state government in April to formulate Punjab’s post-covid revival strategy, has proposed wide-ranging changes across sectors for revival of the state’s covid-hit economy, on free power, paddy procurement and increased role of private sector in agriculture.Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said he had not seen the interim report, but disagrees with the recommendations based on whatever he has come to know. “This is the problem when people give suggestions on agriculture sitting in air-conditioned rooms. Agriculture is the only sector which has performed across the country even during the covid period with all the restrictions. In Punjab, we had a bumper crop,” he said, without mincing words. Questioning the lack of representation of the farming community, he said it would have been more appropriate if the committee giving proposals on farm sector also included representatives from farm organisations or people with farming background. “We are already opposing the centre’s ordinances and will not accept anything that hurts the interests of farmers,” he said. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party’s government introduced the free power facility, warned the CM of a mass movement if any step was taken to withdraw it. He also rejected the panel’s advice to “slow down the procurement of paddy” in the state. Leader of opposition from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Harpal Singh Cheema said the views and recommendations of the Montek panel on free power and private sector are on the same lines as the World Bank. “The farming sector is reeling under stress, but the Congress government has no agriculture policy. If implemented, these suggestions will ruin it further,” he said, terming the report as “anti-farmer”. PANEL MADE WRONG ASSUMPTIONS: FARMERSThe concerns of farm leaders, who have also rejected the recommendations, are more basic. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), while panning the panel’s criticism of the free power policy, said their suggestions are based on wrong assumptions as 86% farmers in Punjab have land holding of less than five acre and get only one direct subsidy in free power.“The farmers are “soft targets” who are blamed for everything from the state’s financial crisis to pollution and depleting water level,” he said, dismissing the suggestion to follow ‘Haryana model’ of cash incentive to reduce area under paddy. He branded the model as “just a declaration with practically zero result”. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, another BKU faction, said the report is a copy of the centre’s script for promoting private sector in agriculture. “They are silent on paying remunerative rates for our produce. If they want to wean us away from paddy, they need to first ensure assured marketing and price of alternative crops,” he said. The naysayers have also questioned the feasibility of the suggestion to reduce paddy procurement from “extremely water stressed areas”. Of 138 blocks in the state, 109 are in over-exploited category, seven are critical or semi-critical and only 22 are safe as per last year’s official data. The expert committee has, in its first report, strongly disapproved of the free power policy for its financial and environmental consequences and suggested reduction of paddy procurement from water-stressed areas, incentives for shifting out of paddy and saving water, and opening up agricultural marketing beyond APMCs. REPORT NOT ANTI-FARMER: MONTEKHowever, Montek clarified during a videoconference with the CM that the report was not “anti-farmer” and had suggested diversification as the only hope for Punjab agriculture.“Diversification implies a reduction in area under rice and modernisation of marketing, which in turn implies a much larger role for the private sector,” he said. The Montek panel is not the first to voice its concerns over free power and continuous groundwater depletion. The draft farmers’ policy prepared by the Punjab State Farmers and Farm Workers Commission (PSFFWC) more than a year-and-a-half ago had proposed cutting down on agriculture power subsidy to farmers owning more than four hectare of land, direct benefit transfer and cap on paddy crop. The fund-starved government first sat on its own state commission’s report for months and then set up a cabinet sub-committee in July 2019, but there has been little forward movement. The reasons for this lack of urgency are not hard to fathom. Farmers constitute a powerful bloc in the state and successive governments have been wary of taking steps that may have a political cost. The expert panel, which said its ideas are “skeletal” and will be spelt out in detail after these are accepted “in principle”, will submit its report in December this year and the state polls (due in March 2022) will be just a little more than a year away by that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-says-no-withdrawal-of-free-power-as-montek-panel-faces-flak/story-I5UDxMrZ0SpLdttg16uzaJ.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Slain Batla House inspector among 215 selected for President’s gallantry medals||Delhi Police inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who died in the 2008 Batla House encounter, was awarded the gallantry medal posthumously for his role in a 2007 operation against members of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), officials privy to the development said on condition of anonymity. Sharma had worked with the Delhi Police’s special cell and was among the few decorated officers tasked with anti-terror work.The Union home ministry on Friday released the list of police personnel who have been awarded medals on the occasion of Independence Day. While 215 personnel have been given the medal for gallantry, 80 were awarded the President’s medal for distinguished service and 631 for meritorious service.Sharma, then 44, had suffered three gunshot wounds when he went to capture five suspected terrorists hiding in south Delhi’s Batla House on September 19, 2008. He later succumbed to injuries at the hospital.He had joined Delhi Police as a sub-inspector in 1989 and received an out-of-turn promotion that made him an inspector in 1995. Usually, it takes a sub-inspector around 13 to 15 years to be promoted to the rank of inspector. The citation for Sharma, which mentions the act of bravery of the award winner, has not been released as yet. But officials privy to the development said Sharma was given the gallantry award for his bravery in a 2007 encounter against JeM members. In the shoot-out in Janipur in Jammu on August 11, 2007, Sharma and his team had shot dead Asif alias Qari, a Pakistani citizen, who was then the divisional commander of JeM (Jammu region). Qari’s accomplice Zafar Iqbal was arrested after the shoot-out. The two were involved in the attack on the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. Qari, police said, was later convicted of the crime in 2019. Other members of Sharma’s team -- inspectors Kailash Bisht and Dharender Kumar, sub-inspector Devender Singh, and assistant sub-inspectors Nissar Ahmed Shaik and Pravesh Rathi -- have also been awarded the gallantry medals.Sharma was also awarded the Ashok Chakra in 2009. This was Sharma’s seventh gallantry medal.Sanjeev Yadav, deputy police commissioner, special cell, who was Sharma’s senior in 2008,said, “ At the special cell, we are happy that the government has recognised the team’s work.”Other special cell officers DCP Manishi Chandra, inspectors Ravinder Joshi and Vinod Badola, along with sub-inspector Banay Singh have also received the gallantry medal for the shoot-out that led to the death of Delhi gangster Surender Malik alias Neetu Dabodhia. Until his death, Dabodhia was one of the most wanted men in the national capital. This year, the gallantry awards’ list is topped by the police personnel from Jammu and Kashmir -- they won 81 medals, followed by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) with 51 medals.The home ministry officials familiar with the selection process said a majority of gallantry medals went to these two forces due to their counter-insurgency operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/slain-batla-house-inspector-among-215-selected-for-president-s-gallantry-medals/story-w3XUO8dmnePUv8XzEr6OdO.html

Staging a dharna along with his party workers against an illegal distillery at Bahomajra, he said from Rs 5,000 crore during the SAD-BJP tenure, the excise revenue went down to Rs 3,500 crore during the Congress rule. “Why there is no money to run the social welfare schemes? Ration under the atta-daal scheme is not being provided and social welfare outlays were not being released,” the SAD chief said. Speaking on the occasion, senior Akali leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal demanded investigation into the role of Congress MLA Gurkirat Kotli in the illegal distillery case. “The Khanna police were deliberately going slow in the probe into the case,” he added. Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said while action was taken against a station house officer (SHO and deputy superintendent of police (DSP) in Tarn Taran in the wake of the hooch tragedy, SSP Dhruv Dahiya was rewarded as he was posted in the same capacity in Amritsar (rural). Charanjit Singh Atwal, Hira Singh Gabadia, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, Santa Singh Umedpuri and Gurpreet Singh Raju Khanna also spoke on the occasion. Social distancing norms were violated by the SAD workers at the Khanna rally. CONDOLES SLAIN YAD LEADER’S FAMILY Later, Sukhbir along with Majithia and other party leader visited Seh village in Samrala to express condolences to the family of Ravinder Sigh Sonu, a Youth Akali Dal (YAD) leader who was shot dead on Tuesday.

14-08-2020||Delhi||Our reshuffle of grievance panel not infringement of rights: High Court to Delhi University||The Delhi High Court on Friday came down heavily on Delhi University (DU) for filing a plea challenging the reconstitution of the Grievance Redressal Committee by the single judge of the same court. The court said the reconstitution does not infringe on DU’s rights or reflects badly on the university.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad, however, allowed one member, Professor SC Rai, of the university’s choice to the newly constituted committee after DU filed an appeal, saying the reconstitution casts aspersions on the eminence of the varsity.On August 7, Justice Pratibha M Singh, while allowing DU to conduct the Open-Book Examination, had reconstituted the Grievance Redressal Committee to “ensure fairness and transparency”.The reconstituted five-member committee comprises Justice Pratibha Rani (Retd. Judge, Delhi High Court) as chairperson, Professor K S Rao, department of Botany as deputy chairperson, and Professor Kavita Sharma, department of commerce, B B Gupta, senior advocate and Kamal Gupta, advocate, as members.The court had said the committee will deal with all grievances related to the downloading of question papers, uploading of answer sheets, technical glitches, etc., faced by students during the online examinations.On Friday, senior advocate Sachin Datta, appearing for DU, told the court that there is an implicit assumption that the old committee of DU would not be transparent. He said DU is a university of eminence where the President of India is a visitor and the Chief justice of Delhi High Court is the pro-vice chancellor.Datta said it is the question of the integrity of the varsity and it should be allowed to function. He said people who are not even associated with DU are a part of the committee.“Let my old committee to operate otherwise it would prevent the university to discharge its duties,” he said.To this, the court replied, “Don’t take it amiss. There is no ego battle. The new members would be adding value to the committee”. “Why are you worried if a retired judge is helping you? Why are you fighting shy to have this grievance cell which it also has your members?“Why are you feeling threatened? Did you let the committee work even for a day? It took you seven days to approach the court….Things have not gone properly for many students and we are forced to say this. Is it correct that during the examinations one of the email ids on which students were to mail answer scripts was not working?The DU counsel said there was a problem but it was rectified immediately. He said all queries to the committee were not complaints.“We have much to say about your examinations. Your preparedness has been questioned thrice and it is only after that you have been able to manage to take the exams…You have not been able to satisfy in the preparedness,” the court said.After the arguments, the court proposed that it would allow one member of DU’s choice, who was a part of the erstwhile committee, to be part of the present one. The counsel took Professor Ajay Arora’s name.The court rejected this proposal and said asked him to choose someone who is not a part of tier one of the Grievance Cell. The university then chose Prof SC Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/our-reshuffle-of-grievance-panel-not-infringement-of-rights-high-court-to-delhi-university/story-kRV1D2CQKvtHy868DcmCLN.html

Residents can either get in touch with the Dean’s office and come and take it themselves. If they can’t do that, they can authorise a family member, relative, guardian, or friend to do the same. They can authorise the dean himself to remove the belongings because we need to prepare the rooms for the next academic year.”Students can approach the Dean’s office with their queries and issues, Varghese added.On July 25, the college had issued a notice stating that students who were unable to clear their belongings by August 7 could retain their rooms “with a modest room rent of ₹100 per day starting from August 7.” The college’s Students’ Union Society has written multiple times to college authorities explaining that many students would find it difficult to return to the campus as the Covid-19 crisis has created a lot of travel restrictions.“States have varied Covid-19 guidelines across the country. For instance, if I come to Delhi, I would be quarantined for a week. If I go back, I would be quarantined for 28 days, of which two weeks would be paid institutional quarantine. States like West Bengal have random two-day lockdowns which will affect the travel schedule arbitrarily. Such students can’t come and collect their belongings,” said a final-year undergraduate student, requesting anonymity.Many students also said that authorising others to clear their belongings would not be a feasible option. “Not all students have local guardians in Delhi. Even if they do, the guardian or friends might not be willing to put themselves in danger and go to college to retrieve our belongings. This is also because Delhi has seen a high number of Covid cases,” added the student.A first-year undergraduate student from a southern state said that the notice would pose more difficulty for students who do not live in neighbouring states of Delhi. “My parents were not keen on me coming to Delhi to clear my room. Apart from the health crisis, there are financial concerns. Travelling via train would take too much time and plane tickets are very expensive,” said the student who could not clear her room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/30-of-st-stephen-s-students-yet-to-clear-their-hostel-rooms-have-to-pay-room-rent/story-QJmrKSI6fqdSpaBwcOMWXK.html

Later, however, the hotel owner refused to provide the facility citing losses among other reasons.”One of the employees of the health department, requesting anonymity, said requests for availing isolation facilities were pouring in, but there were no rooms available. A few hotels were providing quarantine facilities to suspected and asymptomatic patients at their own level and were also fixing rent on their own, the official said, adding that many residents were also opting for home isolation.Executive member of the hotel and restaurant association, Amarjit Singh, said, “Only big hotels can provide isolation facilities for positive asymptomatic patients as they can dedicate a whole space/floor for them. However, the impact of the presence of such patients on other visitors is also stopping hotel owners. At a time when hotels are receiving tepid responses due to Covid-19 restrictions and fear, no one would want to push away customers. There is a shortage of labour as well.”Additional chief administrator (ACA), Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority, Bhupinder Singh, said, “The administration is making regular efforts to rope in hoteliers for providing isolation facilities. But no hotelier has given consent till now.”Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma had on July 21 formed a committee and deputed three nodal officers including ACA, GLADA, Bhupinder Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Sachin Gupta, and SMO Hatinder Kaur for coordinating with willing hoteliers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/owners-unwilling-to-turn-hotels-in-covid-isolation-facilities-in-ludhiana/story-RGDwudgqnXp6lEK4E6HVhK.html
14-08-2020||City||Residents complain of mosquito menace, inadequate fogging exercise||Noida Amid the ongoing monsoon season that is favourable for mosquito breeding, residents from several areas of the city have complained of mosquito menace which can cause diseases like malaria and dengue. The residents have asked for a large-scale remedial drive to check the menace. Pointing out a number of spots with stagnant water either in open fields or the drains, the residents of sectors 27, 46, 50, 76, 77, among others, said that the mosquito breeding is evident and the fogging being done by the apartment associations is simply not enough. The residents alleged that despite a number of complaints, the Noida authority did not conduct fogging or cleaned up the vacated plots. “The mosquito breeding has increased. We have been complaining about it to the Noida authority since the last week. We have tweeted the pictures of choked drains with larvae and also dialled up the helpline numbers, but still waiting for a response. Drains are choked due to which water gets stagnant. Besides, a large vacant plot is also to be cleaned. As a result, mosquitoes have started causing problems to everyone,” said Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77. Gupta said that while the apartment owners association has its own fogging machines and holds regular fogging, the high-density breeding outside the high-rise makes their efforts futile. The issue of the stagnant drains was not limited to certain pockets only, as residents fear health hazard due to lack of remedial steps to control the breeding. “We had written a letter to the authority a few days ago, complaining about the stagnant water in the drains as well as in the unlevelled open fields and vacant plots. But we have not got any response from the authority,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NOFAA) According to the residents, the fogging or anti-larvae spray is not adequate in several sectors. “There is fogging going on, but that is not enough as mosquito breeding is at its peak. For an area as big as Arun Vihar, if the fogging or anti-larvae is sprayed only twice a month, then it is clearly not up to the mark. We all are forced to face the mosquito menace,” said Colonel (retd) Shashi Vaid, chairman of Arun Vihar RWA, which include sectors 27,28 and 37. It is an open secret that the malaria mosquito Anopheles breeds from July through October, and the one that causes dengue comes after August. According to official figures, the Gautam Budh Nagar district saw over 400 cases of malaria last year. When asked, officials of the Noida authority said that they are working to intensify the anti-larvae drives and fogging across the city. “We have already prepared the rosters to cover areas as much as possible for anti-larvae spray in stagnant water and fogging in the open areas. The rosters are also being shared with the RWAs. We are working on intensifying the same by increasing the number of anti-mosquito drives in each area,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty (health), Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-complain-of-mosquito-menace-inadequate-fogging-exercise/story-E34fac45rNxcLm3NH0RJGI.html

The police have also charge-sheeted three of the 10 suspects who were named in another case related to the harassment of Joshi’s niece. “We have filed a charge sheet in connection with the murder case against 10 suspects, all of whom were nabbed. We have also initiated action against them under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act. A charge sheet is also filed against three suspects in connection with the case of harassment of his niece.

With the NHM’s nod, the Ghaziabad health department will now hire anaesthetists and physicians for its two L2 hospitals said officials.The officials of the Ghaziabad health department said they need at least six anaesthetists (doctors who are responsible for providing anaesthesia to patients and give intensive care and help in pain management) and two physicians for their L2 hospital at ESIC, Sahibabad and another six anaesthetists for the L2 facility at Sanjay Nagar for now.In a letter issued on Thursday to all district magistrates and chief medical officers, state director, NHM (Uttar Pradesh), Aparna U said that medical specialists can be hired on a temporary basis till December 31, 2020, either through selections made via walk-in interviews or through bidding in case the interview fails to draw applicants.“Committee comprising district magistrate, chief medical officer and chief medical superintendent will be formed to select the candidates. The district committee will initially select candidates through walk-in (interview) method and will appoint the selected candidates. In case, the specialists are not available through walk-in interviews, a bidding process should be taken up and the applicants should be selected on the basis of lowest bid made (those who ask for lowest monthly remuneration,” the letter stated. The bidding process will be held with the help of an online bidding model developed by an agency selected by the Central government.With the letter the Ghaziabad health department hopes to appoint at least 14 specialists for now. “We have given one high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)—an advanced oxygen-supplying equipment—and four bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) systems—a non-invasive ventilation mechanism—to ESIC Hospital, while six BiPAP systems are given to the Sanjay Nagar L2 hospital. These equipments are helpful in tackling respiratory issues and breathing difficulties in patients. We need more anaesthetists for the operation of such equipment and the ventilator in our hospitals apart from two physicians needed at ESIC Hospital,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.“Now that the hiring of specialists is allowed, we will be able to appoint specialists in order to give better care to Covid-19 patients. We have also provided three HFNCs to our L3 hospital. This is proving helpful in dealing with patients who face respiratory issues,” he added.The Ghaziabad district has reported 6,309 cases of the coronavirus disease so far.According to the latest records of the health department, the district, at present, has 576 beds available in the two L2 hospitals at ESIC Sahibabad—an L1 hospital (for asymptomatic cases) earlier now converted to an L2 hospital and the Sanjay Nagar hospital, besides beds in the only L3 hospital at Santosh Medical College. The L2 hospitals have 13 ICU beds, while the L3 has 20 ICU beds. The three hospitals also have three, 12 and 21 ventilators, respectively. Together, the three hospitals have 387 beds which are equipped with oxygen supplies.“The L3 hospital enough specialist doctors available for now, while more specialists are available with the 10 private hospitals which have been roped in to provide paid Covid treatment to positive patients. The new order will enable us to rope in more workforce required to deal with Covid-19,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/districts-allowed-to-hire-specialist-doctors-temporarily-to-deal-with-rising-covid-cases/story-cTExEjbYsJkPJGkjFiFYMP.html

This is 7% of the state’s total covid-19 cases of just over 29,000 to date, meaning that every 14th patient has been a frontline warrior against the disease, data with the state health department shows. A further break-up shows that of these 2,000, over 600 are health care staffers, including doctors, nurses and accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers, who were assigned duties in hospitals and containment zones and were in direct contact of patients. Around 1,200 members from the state police and BSF personnel (combined) have also tested positive. Over a 100 district administration employees tested positive. The rest of infected were sanitation workers and people who had to be on covid duty for one reason or another.“We had been testing only symptomatic doctors and cops, but now we are regularly testing frontline warriors. One Punjab government minister and four MLAs were also infected. The frontline warriors are getting infected because they come in direct contact of a large number of people. In Punjab, almost 75% of covid-19 patients are asymptomatic,” said state covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.“The state provides PPE kits and we are paying special attention to their safety. Infected warriors must be diagnosed early to stop further spread of infection,” he added. After a spike of cases at BSF camps in Punjab, 2,500 BSF personnel in Khasa camp, Amritsar, and 1,018 in Hoshiarpur camp, have been isolated in containment zones.“Recently, four doctors of GMCH , Amritsar, were tested positive for the virus, even as they always wore the safety gear. This is a major concern. OPDs at government hospitals see a large crowd daily, without maintaining social distancing. Safety of frontline warriors has to be paramount,” said Dr Jaspinder Pratap Singh, president, Resident Doctors’ Association of Punjab (RDAP).Deputy commissioner of police (law and order Amritsar), Jagmohan Singh, who was infected with covid-19, and has recovered, said, “Police personnel are given PPE kits, but only cops in at stations can wear them. Those on field duty cannot wear PPEs all the time. Symptomatic people should isolate themselves and consult doctors at the right time to avoid spreading the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/frontline-warriors-form-7-of-punjab-s-covid-19-patients/story-c57RF8JdazArhkn7b7T9AK.html

The officials of the Ghaziabad police said that they have registered an FIR against three persons under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). Police identified the victim as Kedarnath Gaur who retired as executive engineer from the electricity department and was residing with his family in the third floor flat of tower ‘A’ of the highrise. According to initial investigations, the incident took place when Gaur was stepping out for some work and had pressed the button of the lift. The lift came to the third floor and the door opened. “As soon as the door opened, the victim stepped in but the lift cab was not there. As a result he fell into the shaft and fell to minus one floor, sustaining injuries, to which he succumbed. The family launched a search and after a lot of efforts they could trace him. He was rushed to a hospital but declared dead. On the basis of a complaint given by the family, we have registered an FIR under IPC section 304 against three officials of the developers’ firm. Further investigations is underway,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The highrise is located behind the Raj Nagar Extension in Morta (adjacent to Delhi Meerut Road) and falls under jurisdiction of the Muradnagar police station. “There have been lot of complaints in the highrise about the lifts, but the developer has not taken any steps to address them. On August 13 my father met with an incident which resulted in his death. The incident took place due to improper maintenance of the lift. He pressed the button of the lift and the door opened. But the lift cab was not there. As a result my father fell from the third floor and died,” victim’s son Rajesh Gaur said in his police complaint. Vishwanath Agrawal, the managing director of the builder’s firm, did not respond to repeated calls and queries sent to him for his response over the issue. He is named in the FIR along with two other officials. However, the developer firm in a statement late on Friday night said, “We express deep sorrow and share concerns with the family. Our company has given maintenance contract to a renowned elevators’ company which is also the manufacturer. We have all the related documents of yearly maintenance contract with the company. We have shared information of the incident with the maintenance company and sought explanation as how this incident took place. We will be able to give our full response once we receive explanation from the maintenance company.”“The incident is very unfortunate and should not have happened. The developers must make sure that the quality of equipment installed is top class and maintenance is done through the original equipment manufacturer. In this case, a detailed investigation should take place and responsibility should be fixed,” said Gaurav Gupta, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India , Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/senior-citizen-falls-into-lift-shaft-dies-three-from-developers-firm-booked/story-IFQrlzC00i2LKwHUzjARVK.html

14-08-2020||City||Deadly August: 59% of Ludhiana Covid fatalities in just two weeks||The district is witnessing a steady rise in Covid-19 fatalities with the number of those dead due to the virus multiplying over twofold in just two weeks of August.From 88 deaths between March 29 and July 31, the Covid toll has risen to 214 with 126 (59%) fatalities in August alone.Worse, over half of total fatalities at 109 were reported in just 12 days between August 3 and 14. During this period, at least 10 deaths were reported per day for four consecutive days and nine deaths on five days – an average of nine deaths every day. August 13 witnessed the highest fatalities so far with 13 people succumbing to the virus. Besides 126 deaths, the Covid-19 cases have spiralled from 3,246 on July 31 to 6,176 on August 14 – a nearly twofold rise again.Among these, 1,807 cases are still active. POST LOCKDOWN AFTERMATHNotably, the mortality rate spiked majorly after the curfew restrictions were lifted on June 8. A whopping 95% deaths of all Covid deaths occurred post lockdown. Before June 8, 11 people had died since March 29 (70 days).March had recorded one death, followed by three in April and five in May. As the borders reopened and curfew restrictions were eased in June, allowing public to venture out and businesses to reopen, the Covid positive cases shot up and fatalities rose to 12 in a month. The situation worsened in July that saw 67 deaths. The fatalities touched the century mark on August 2 and took just 11 more days for the toll to cross the 200 mark on August 13. Dr Bishav Mohan, a member of the Covid-19 task force set up by the state government, stressed that patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) should reach the hospital at an early stage for timely treatment. “There is a strong misconception that treatment for Covid-19 is not available in hospitals, which is false. Knowledge exchange is taking place at a global scale. With the right kind of treatment, doctors across the world have been able to bring down the mortality rate from 18% to 3% or less. I urge patients to reach the hospital at an early stage,” Dr Mohan said. Dr Hitinder Kaur Sohal, senior medical officer (SMO)-cum-nodal officer for Covid-19 at Ludhiana civil hospital, said a large number of patients feared social stigma due to Covid-19 and therefore reached the hospital only when their condition worsened. “Besides timely treatment, residents also need to observe precautions by avoiding crowded areas, social gatherings and wearing mask and maintaining social distancing in public,” Dr Sohal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/deadly-august-59-of-ludhiana-covid-fatalities-in-just-two-weeks/story-UVrJlqRkoDoMj6HEsa4WfO.html
14-08-2020||City||Punjab Agricultural University prepares resource to uplift farmers of India||In view of the unprecedented Covid situation, the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has prepared a resilience resource for the farmers of the country called ‘I the farmer of India’.Prepared by professor Sarabjeet Singh, head of the Department of Agricultural Journalism, Languages and Culture, and Vasundhra, counsellor, Department of Human Development & Family Studies, the resource highlights the five T’s of mental health—talking, teaching, training, tools and taking care.The resource aims to build respect for farmers in the society and asserts that farming is the most noble, the most useful, the most mindful and the most healthful profession. “When lockdown was announced, no one rushed to buy gold, land, car, or expensive phones, but everyone rushed for fruits, vegetables, milk and bread,” said Dr Sarabjeet.“The pandemic led to many direct and indirect impacts on farmers. The farmers, especially the vegetable growers, suffered losses. The farmers also saw their children sitting idle at home while the schools and colleges were shut. Such issues were enough to drive farmers into depression. So keeping in view all these issues, we designed the programme that will be launched by all the agriculture universities to support farmers in distress,” he added.Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon, vice-chancellor of PAU, while sending the resource in soft format to all the agricultural universities and institutes of the country, remarked that he hoped for translation of the resource into local languages of the country to boost the morale of the farming community.The university is running a programme ‘Talking is Healing’ wherein farmers can avail counselling by reaching the PAU helpline number 8360684948.PAU CELEBRATES NATIONAL HANDLOOM WEEKThe Department of Apparel and Textile Science, College of Community Science, PAU, celebrated the National Handloom Week from August 7-14. An exhibition put up by the faculty members showcased the traditional handloom textiles including sarees, durries, carpets and other household products. Students were made aware of the importance of handlooms through online lectures and a TV talk was delivered on National Handloom Day by Dr Surabhi Mahajan, assistant professor of the department.PAU TO IMPART TRAINING TO RURAL YOUTHS IN PROCESSING TECHNIQUESThe experts of PAU will apprise the rural youths of the importance of agro-industrial complexes in Punjab, machinery for grading of fruit and vegetables, machinery for processing of rice, and machinery for making poultry and dairy feed during a three-month online training programme on ‘Integrated Crop Production’ which is underway at the PAU Skill Development Centre.Dr TS Riar, associate director, skill development, said the trainees will be imparted knowledge on machinery for processing of chillies and turmeric, sugar and jaggery, wheat, oilseeds and potato. In addition, experts will explain post-harvest management of fruit and vegetables, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-agriculture-university-prepares-resource-to-uplift-farmers-of-india/story-XTa9eOc6a8rKhLA52g8qcP.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Policeman who survived Delhi building collapse spotted cracks, alerted senior||The illegally constructed third floor of a building in north Delhi’s Azad Market that collapsed on Wednesday, killing 49-year-old assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Zakir Hussain, had cracks in the roof and crumbled soon after the officer climbed onto it, said constable Debu Singh, who survived the mishap and is recuperating at home. Constable Singh said that he had asked ASI Hussain to come down immediately after he spotted the cracks in the roof while climbing the stairs to take pictures and videos of the illegal construction work that was going on in the nearly 100-year-old building. “I was barely two-three metres behind ASI Hussain on the staircase when I saw the cracks. I screamed and asked him to come down, but the floor collapsed. Before falling on the second floor along with the debris, I saw Hussain sir try to get a grip on the wall and fall outside the building,” said constable Singh, adding that four-five persons were working on the other end of the floor’s terrace when it caved in.Constable Singh, however, said that he was unaware of what happened to the people working on the terrace. On the day of the mishap, a police officer who visited the site said on condition of anonymity that according to locals, one more injured person had come out of the building.“But neither was that person identified nor was anyone admitted to the nearby government or private hospitals,” said the officer, adding that despite his injuries, the constable rushed outside the building and with locals’ help rushed ASI Hussain to Aruna Asaf Ali hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.According to Singh, someone informed ASI Hussain about the illegal construction in the building on Tuesday evening. Around 8.30pm, Hussain asked Singh to accompany him to the building the next morning. As part of the Independence Day security audit drive, the duo also planned to verify the antecedents of the building’s tenants.“We first conducted the verification process for five-six labourers working in a toy factory who live on the first floor. A few minutes later, Hussain sir asked me to accompany him to the third-floor terrace where illegal construction was going on. As he reached the terrace, the floor collapsed, and he fell off the building. There were construction materials in large quantity on the terrace which probably led to the collapse,” he said.Meanwhile, the police said they have identified the owner of the portion of the building that collapsed and the contractor who was constructing the floor. “We are verifying the documents submitted by the original owner. Our probe is on,” the deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said.An officer associated with the probe said, “We will send separate notices to the owner and the contractor asking them to join the probe and explain why and with whose permission they were carrying out the construction.”The North Delhi Municipal Corporation is also probing how and why the illegal construction was taking place. “The inquiry is still in progress,” an official of North MCD said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/policeman-who-survived-delhi-building-collapse-spotted-cracks-alerted-senior/story-iau9awIIJ1uX26f4JFXDgJ.html

The special cell had named 10 people, including students, social activists and a local ward councillor, as the main accused persons in the case.Some of them are Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar, Gufisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Asif Iqbal Tanha, Shafa ur Rehman and Tahir Hussain who have been arrested under the Unlawful Activity Prevention Act (UAPA) and are currently lodged in jail. The police, in the FIR, had also named former JNU student Umar Khalid. However, he has not been arrested till now and Khalid has denied all charges.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said the investigation is still going on regarding the conspiracy which is “deep-rooted, large scale, and multilayered” and all the different aspects pertaining to different accused persons, including their links, are being investigated.The police had approached the court seeking time till September 17, saying they would require more time to file the charge sheet. Earlier, on June 17, the court had granted them two months to file the charge sheet.While in general cases, the charge sheet is filed within 90 days, in cases related to UAPA, the final report can be filed within 180 days of the arrest of the accused, subject to the permission of the court.According to the special cell submissions in the court, Khalid along with the accused had hatched a conspiracy to orchestrate riots just before the visit of the US President Donald Trump on February 24-25. Besides the case by the special cell, the crime branch and the local police have already filed nearly 100 charge sheets in connection with the February riots that left 53 dead and scores injured.On Thursday, while granting time, the court said compelling reasons with respect to each of the 10 accused has been borne out from the application and records. The judge said a number of witnesses have been examined and even statement of witnesses, including protected ones, have been recorded which points to a conspiracy.“The role of different organisations, involving different accused persons and groups, is being investigated. The role of other persons, having links to accused persons, who may be involved in the conspiracy has also come out during the investigation. The huge electronic data and evidence is being examined. The money trail/suspicious funding for riots is also being investigated,” the judge said.“The new facts that have emerged during the investigation have to be confronted. The different dimension of conspiracy including different organizations, Whatsapp groups and different accused persons and their inter-linkages along with the electronic records among other things are being investigated,” the judge said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-special-cell-gets-time-till-sept-17-to-file-conspiracy-charge-sheet/story-iMJiuNcbnvA61ThObKzDXK.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Mask violations in Ludhiana: Standing punishment brings little change||Stricter punishment for not wearing a face mask in public seems to have had little effect on violators, even as Covid-19 cases and fatalities continue to soar in Ludhiana.Following verbal orders by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, police on August 9 had started punishing the violators by making them stand in a corner for up to an hour, besides the usual Rs 500 fine. Going a step ahead, police are also distributing free reusable masks among the violators.Yet, in the past five days, police have issued 4,269 challans, collecting Rs 21.34 lakh in fine – an average of 853 challans a day. The number of violators, before the punishment was increased, was also nearly 900 a day. According to the police, not only the youth, but people of middle age and senior citizens were also not wearing masks, and had weird excuses for the violation.Inspector Jarnail Singh, SHO, Division Number 8 police station, said several people argued that they lived at a short distance and hence did not need to wear a mask. A 34-year-old man, who was stopped near Rakhbagh, said he had come out for fresh air, so there was no point wearing a mask.Another 27-year-old man at Mall Road argued that he stepped out only to buy medicines, but failed to produce any prescription. Both were fined and made to stand for up to an hour.Police commissioner Rakesh Kumar Agrawal said they had issued over 50,000 challans for mask violations since the pandemic started and had collected nearly Rs 2.5 crore in fine from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mask-violations-in-ludhiana-standing-punishment-brings-little-change/story-SmS6ItHVjDYG7jVNttg5rO.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||North Delhi mayor visits collapsed landfill, orders flattening of mounds||A day after a portion of the Bhalswa landfill in north Delhi collapsed after rains overnight and injuring three waste-pickers, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash and senior officials inspected the site on Friday and directed the mounds be flattened at the earliest.Prakash directed the corporation’s engineering department to check for vulnerable portions of the landfill that could crumble in the event of heavy rain. “Being prepared in advance is the only way we can avert any possible damage,” he said. “I have also asked officials to clean up the area abutting the slums so that residents are safe and live in hygienic conditions,” he said.On Thursday the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led opposition had blamed the political wing of the BJP-led corporation for the accident in which three people were injured and two-three livestock was trapped in the debris. A small portion of 15 metres in length at the back of the landfill had collapsed in the wee hours. Prakash also said that he has instructed the officials to erect a boundary wall near the slum clusters so that residents from the clusters engaged in rag-picking work are not able to climb up the landfill without permission. “At present the entire area is open and waste-pickers keep venturing onto the landfill throughout the day, which could put their lives in danger. We will erect a wall and will have it manned so that a record can be kept and will also help in maintaining a vigil,” the mayor said. In September 2017, a large portion of the Ghazipur landfill in East Delhi had collapsed that swept motorists on the road in a nearby canal and claimed two lives while leaving many injured. The Bhalswa landfill site is an open dumping ground near GT-Karnal road. Created in 1984, it is spread over 70 acres. Till October 2019, the landfill had attained a height of 65 metres, eight metres less than that of Qutub MinarThe civic body had last month claimed to have reduced the height of the landfill by 12 metres by processing legacy waste with the help of 15 trommel machines that are in operation at the site. According to officials, nearly 5.8 lakh tonnes of legacy waste had been segregated and processed till July 2020.The landfill that had reached its saturation point in 2006 still receives about 2000-2500 metric tonnes of mixed waste every day. More than 80 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste (old solid waste material) is dumped here giving it the shape of a waste mountain. Prakash said that the 15 trommel machines segregate and process 4,500 metric tonnes legacy waste on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-delhi-mayor-visits-collapsed-landfill-orders-flattening-of-mounds/story-gDvnwQ2OflPpzJbCHgNI4N.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||OBE glitches: DU students receive two question papers for one exam||There were glitches during online the open-book examination (OBE) conducted by Delhi University on Friday as students complained of receiving the wrong question paper. The university began its first OBE exam on August 10 for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students as a one-time measure due to the Covid-19 crisis amid resistance from teachers and students.“At around 11am, we got an email from DU which had the question paper…it was sent as “sample question paper for mock test”. We were confused and decided to wait till 11.30am to check whether there was any difference in the question paper uploaded only on the OBE portal. By 11.30am, we found the same question paper on the OBE site and started writing,” said Sneha Shaji, an undergraduate student from Kerala, who wrote her Political Science exam on Friday. Apart from the university’s exam portal, students can also access the question paper sent to them over e-mail.“I didn’t know when the second question paper was uploaded by the administration and saw it only after completing my exam and sending the answer sheets via email,” she said, adding that only students who checked WhatsApp groups between the exam got access to the correct question paper.Seema Swami, an undergraduate student at the varsity’s School of Open Learning, said she also received the wrong question paper on Friday morning. “I was supposed to appear for my History exam at 7.30am. But when I opened my e-mail, I saw the Political Science paper instead. I wrote the exam and sent it. It was only when my friend told me of the glitch that I realised that they wrote their History paper, unlike me,” she said.Rajesh Jha, who teaches Political Science at Rajdhani College, said, “This is mental torture for students and it is akin to playing with their career. They spent half their time answering a set of questions and then were told that they would have to answer another set of questions. What about the time that was lost? These papers must be cancelled.”Officials from the varsity’s Computer Centre refused to comment saying the exam branch would be able to shed more light on the matter. Despite repeated calls and messages Dean (Exams) Vinay Gupta did not respond to the queries till Friday evening. DU Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said, “Students can send their queries to the grievance cell and their case can be considered later if they faced an issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/obe-glitches-du-students-receive-two-question-papers-for-one-exam/story-mON2dqlg09IsdLGh4AnsvI.html

The South corporation is the nodal agency for the implementation of the RFID project in the national capital. The RFID system was introduced to decongest city borders, smoothen traffic movement and thus bring down air pollution. Once RFID tag is pasted on commercial vehicles, the environment compensation charge (ECC) and toll tax are automatically deducted at the 13 toll plazasAccording to officials, the decision was taken in a review meeting of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority and senior officials of the SDMC. “In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the penalty, of charging double the amount from commercial vehicles not having RFID tags or not having adequate balance in the tag, will be waived till October 15. Besides, all vehicles taking monthly passes will have to make online payments for the same or at the RFID system installed at the 13 city toll plazas,” a statement from the SDMC said. During the meeting, officials also said that at present, the RFID system is installed at 13 toll plazas while the installation of the system at the remaining 111 toll points will be completed by January 31, 2021. “Till such time, all toll plazas will have to get hand-held devices by November 2020, for enforcement during the winter,” the SDMC statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-won-t-penalise-vehicles-for-not-having-rfid-tags-till-october-15/story-ILT8kIQzFCcRuvfMDTkl7H.html
14-08-2020||City||Man, accomplice held for duping employer of ₹2.5L||New Delhi: A 31-year-old man was arrested along with his brother-in-law on Thursday for allegedly cooking up a robbery story to embezzle ₹2.5 lakh from his employer, the police said on Friday.The arrested man, Mumtaz Alam, worked as an accountant in a footwear store, and had invested ₹3.5 lakh he had borrowed to start a business. However, that venture allegedly racked up losses and eventually shut, throwing Alam into debt. He thereafter got work in the footwear showroom in northwest Delhi’s Keshavpuram. To repay the money lender, Alam hatched a fake robbery plot with his brother-in-law, Mohammad Wasim Akram, 36, senior police officers associated with the case said.As per their plan, Alam on Thursday around 4pm, called the police control room and said two bike-borne robbers intercepted his bike near Zakhira flyover and robbed him, at gunpoint, of a bag containing ₹2.5 lakh he had collected from Chandni Chowk area on his employer’s instructions. Since the call was about a daylight armed robbery, senior officers reached the spot, apart from the local Moti Nagar police personnel, said deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit. Multiple teams were formed to nab the suspects. Teams scanned footage from CCTV cameras on the routes Alam had taken while returning from Chandni Chowk. Police said that footage from one camera showed Alam riding his bike on the service lane but not carrying a bag, as he had claimed. Another piece of footage confirmed that he had used a different route, Purohit said.“We confronted Alam with the video footage, and he responded with multiple contradictory statements, which made us more suspicious. When Alam was interrogated, he broke down and confessed to cooking up the robbery story and told us about the loan he had to repay,” he added.Alam told the police that while returning from Chandni Chowk, he gave the bag of cash to his brother-in-law and travelled a spot near the Zakhira flyover, from where he made the call about the fake robbery. He led the police to his brother-in-law, from whose possession the police recovered the ₹2.5 lakh. A case of criminal conspiracy and breach of trust was registered and the two were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-accomplice-held-for-duping-employer-of-2-5l/story-2CZLk9MxRATR3OQXCJcRgL.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Delay in regularisation of colonies in Ludhiana: RTI activist seeks vigilance inquiry against GLADA officials||: RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal has submitted a complaint with Punjab chief secretary and director of vigilance bureau seeking inquiry against Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) officials for not following the state government’s procedures for regularisation of colonies that came into effect in October 2018, and not recovering pending composition fees from colonies who have applied under the policy. Sabharwal alleged that applications for 559 colonies have been submitted under the policy across Punjab, but GLADA authorities have failed to recover the pending composition fee from colonies falling under its jurisdiction even after one and a half years. He added that colonies were given four-month time to submit application after the policy was floated in October 2018. It is mandatory to issue a demand notice to the applicant for submission of fee within three months after an application is submitted by authorities. But, in many cases, GLADA officials concerned have not even issued the demand notice till now and the dues have also not been recovered, the RTI activist said. As per an estimate, composition fee has not been recovered from around 50% colonies.Refuting the allegations, GLADA estate officer Sonam Chaudhary said, “No delay is being made deliberately. The process to approve colonies is lengthy as a multiple departments are involved in the process. Recovery is also being done from colonies keeping in mind the rules and process of clearing an application for regularisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delay-in-regularisation-of-colonies-in-ludhiana-rti-activist-seeks-vigilance-inquiry-against-glada-officials/story-wXf8IqN6mlmm50pf90qKxL.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt waives parking charges on impounded vehicles||The Delhi government Friday waived the parking custody charges imposed on vehicles impounded by the transport department and the police, which could not be bailed out by owners over the past few months on account of the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 spread.Vehicles that get impounded for any violation are taken into custody and parked at impounding pits located in Burari, Dwarka and Sarai Kale Khan.

The Gambusia fish will be released in other water bodies by next week.”Dr Dilbagh said, “These biocontrol measures are a lot easier to introduce in villages. Mohali health department started breeding Gambusia fish, which is said to be effective in checking mosquito breeding. The species, which predominantly feeds on the larvae is also called ‘mosquito fish’ and is being used as a biological control measure.” He said that nearly 86 water bodies in villages and towns have been earmarked as ‘hotspots’ wherein these fish will be released in open wells and water bodies. “An adult Gambusia fish can consume nearly 150 larvae a day,” he added. The problem of mosquitoes breeding in clear water, especially Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which carry the dengue virus can be controlled through them. While the fish are bred at the office, they are fed rice husks and groundnut oil cakes said health inspector Gurtej Singh. He said that an adult mosquitofish can eat up to 150 mosquito larvae in an 8-hour period. This makes them an excellent biological tool for mosquito control because the fish consume the larvae before they have a chance to develop into adult mosquitoes. He further appealed to the public to approach the fish seed farm for collecting mosquito fish for releasing at stagnant water points to check and control mosquito breeding. The department gets Gambusia fish from Gharuan, where people have fish farms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gambusia-fish-to-help-mohali-health-department-combat-mosquitoes-this-year/story-qENfCdqpGVzVejt3cL0QXI.html

A local resident, Gaurav Sharma, had complained at the Cantonment police station after Jarnail shared objectionable comments against Hindu gods on his Facebook account. He was booked on Friday. After his post surfaced, the AAP suspended Jarnail, its prominent Sikh face and former MLA of Rajouri Garden segment in Delhi, on Thursday. He deleted the post after social media backlash. Later, he claimed that the image was mistakenly published by his son during an online class.“My little son had taken my phone for his online class. He posted an image which I have deleted. I respect all the names of God Ram, Gobind, Keshav, Sadashiv and follow the principles of Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib,” a rough translation of his clarification that was issued in Gurmukhi reads. “The AAP is a secular party and has no place for anyone who disrespects any religion. The Sikh community is also very sad, because such kind of action is also against the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev,” a release from the AAP stated. Station house officer Inderjit Singh Dhaliwal said an FIR has been registered against Jarnail under Sections 295-A (deliberate acts to outrage religious feelings) of the IPC and 67 of IT Act, 2000. NO APOLOGY ACCEPTABLE: MANNIn Bathinda, AAP MP Bhagwant Mann said on Friday that the party was in no mood to consider apology tendered by its senior leader Jarnail Singh over derogatory comment on Hindu gods. At a press conference, Mann said the former Delhi MLA acted in a very irresponsible manner and his conduct is beyond any negotiation.“AAP is firm that if any person is seen involved in mocking any faith or practices in any manner will not be accepted. His suspension from the primary membership is justified. His voluntary deletion of the defamatory post from his Facebook page will not make the party leadership rethink over his suspension,” said Mann.While stating that the state unit is being restructured and the rebel leaders will be roped in again, the Sangrur said the party may announce a CM face in the next assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-ex-mla-booked-for-hurting-religious-sentiments/story-U3sn23OMtn7SrBehBpWloJ.html

Sheikh Gowhar Ali, joint secretary general and spokesman of KCCI, in a statement said that despite full cooperation extended by the general public and the business community, the administration appears to be running in circles.The KCCI blamed the officials of taking refuge by placing barbed wires around localities instead doing the hard ground work. “Here, the administration cannot be bothered to stop tweeting and identify individual houses. They simply barbwire off entire neighborhoods, if not the entire districts. Saves a lot of hard work.”The spokesman alleged that DDMA funds have been spent on purchase of barriers despite Kashmir having the highest inventory of barriers including barbed wires available. ‘’The prices of critical medical equipment, including oxygen concentrators ,has skyrocketed without any system of checks and balances in place.’’“Handpicked star restaurants, frequented to by the high and mighty, have been allowed to operate.

Reasi district commissioner, Indu Kanwal Chib, said, “Most probably the pilgrimage will resume from Sunday but a final decision is yet to be taken by the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board.” A shrine board member said,“The government’s order with a detailed standard operating procedure for re-opening religious places and shrines is out. The Covid-19 cases at the bhawan (sanctum sanctorum) have admitted to hospitals and the yatra will begin from August 16.” However, the Katra hotel association met Reasi district commissioner Indu Kanwal Chib on Thursday and urged the administration to make a couple of concessions. PROTOCOL For pilgrims from outside J&K, Covid-19 antigen testing will be mandatory. Permission to proceed beyond Katra will be accorded only when the Covid-19 results of the pilgrims comes negative.  Pilgrims from red districts will be compulsorily tested and allowed to proceed if the results are negative. Registration of pilgrims will be only done online Periodic Covid-19 antigen testing of exposed frontline staff of SMVDSB and other service providers in the area will be carried to keep a tab on the spread of the infection in Katra and its surrounding area. ‘DO AWAY WITH 500-PILGRIM CEILING’ Katra hotel association president Rakesh Wazir said, “Every individual in Katra, India and across the world welcomes the much-awaited resumption but we have requested the administration to remove the ceiling of 500 pilgrims from outside J&K and 4,500 from within J&K that is valid till September 30 because the footfall of local pilgrims during lean and peak season varies between 500 to 1500. Therefore, the rider of 500 pilgrims from outside J&K should be done away with.” “Further, the latest Covid negative test reports from native states of pilgrims from outside J&K should be considered valid for 72 hours,” he said. The J&K government on Tuesday had issued guidelines and instructions for opening of all religious places from August 16. The order clearly says that any deviation from the order will attract penal action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. “Due to the relatively large number of pilgrims visiting the shrine, additional guidelines shall be applied to this shrine and will be enforced by the shrine board’s chief executive officer and Reasi district magistrate,” the order reads. Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) facilities at multiple locations at the start of yatra route could be set up to randomly test and identify any potential carrier of infection. The shrine board and the district administration have already launched a massive cleaning and sanitisation drive at the sanctum sanctorum, twin tracks and Katra town. Sanitisation and hygiene of all toilet blocks, bathing ghats, guest houses, battery cars, helicopters, cable car shall be ensured. The shrine, which is one of the holiest places for Hindus, is located in Reasi district and is the second richest temple in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vaishno-devi-shrine-likely-to-re-open-on-august-16/story-KcLO5gDqEJtfiTevChYtzL.html

A person who wants a parcel to be delivered can drop it at our depots with proper safety precautions and it will reach its destination via our buses,” said Jagtap.“People need such services to send their couriers and parcels within the city, and as we have a vast network across both the cities it will be beneficial for residents,” he said.“We have already converted some of our buses into this courier service bus for trials, in which the seats are removed and at the backside, the shutter is installed. And we are also looking at the legal technicalities before starting this cargo service.

Even the employees are not aware of Covid-19 positive patients who are isolated at homes. I was collecting garbage from one housing society every day and later come to know that three to four Covid positive patients are home isolated in that society.”An officer from the health department said around three to four thousand kilo biomedical waste is collected daily mainly of Covid patients which is later disposed off scientifically.Molak said, “Health department has appointed a contractor for collecting the biomedical waste. They are regularly collecting garbage from patients.”A resident from Sahakarnagar said, “I have two Covid positive patients who were isolated at home. I have put a bag in their room. PMC van comes every alternate day to collect the biomedical waste.”A Covid-19 positive patient who has opted for home isolation said, “Earlier we were not aware of the waste segregation process, but later through Swacch employee we come to know that there is a separate arrangement for collecting waste from Covid patients. We got the number of one of the elected member and he helped to arrange for collection facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/door-to-door-biomedical-waste-collection-a-challenge-for-pune-civic-body/story-mcOcNkGLHCApoG8Iy3eTYJ.html

The ₹3,200-crore tunnel will shorten the 474-km distance between Manali and Leh by 46km, which means the eight-hour journey will be cut by two-and-a-half hours. The tunnel is also called Atal Tunnel, as the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced the project on June 3, 2000. The work was entrusted to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). After this announcement, there was a lull with the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi laying the foundation stone of the project on June 28, 2010. The project has faced geological challenges which have pushed the deadline, since digging started in 2011.The project was to be completed in February 2015, but water ingress from Seri Nullah, ban on rock mining and delay in allotment of land needed for quarrying, and loose rock strata in the middle caused the slow progress.More than 700 men are working in shifts to complete the tunnel. When the pandemic-enforced lockdown was imposed, proactive measures were taken to recommence work in active coordination with the state government. “When the lockdown was imposed, labourers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh working on the tunnel migrated, causing a major labour problem. Later, we arranged labour from different parts of the state,” said chief engineer Rohtang Tunnel project KP Purushothaman. He added, “Almost all major civil and engineering works have been completed and the remaining will be completed before September 20.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh was to inspect the work at the tunnel last month, but due to the stand-off between India and Chinese troops, this trip was cancelled. Rajnath is likely to visit Rohtang tunnel in August-end.“The government will invite PM Narendra Modi to inaugurate the tunnel, which is a boon for people living in the inhospitable terrain in Lahual and Spiti,” said technical education and tribal affairs minister Dr Ram Lal Markanda. Speed limits in the tunnel will be 80km per hour. The tunnel will accelerate troop mobility to strategic frontiers in Jammu and Kashmir, besides providing a road link to Lahaul and Spiti in the winters. The tunnel has the capacity to ply 3,000 vehicles per day under any weather condition. The cost of the project has escalated from ₹1,700 crore in 2010 to almost its double to ₹3,200 crore by September-end 202||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohtang-tunnel-to-open-by-september-end/story-wXtB7EdECwm2xIEmtnmYdI.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Miscreants put up flag with Khalistan written on it on terrace of Moga district administrative complex||Moga: Despite the security alert on the eve of Independence Day, two miscreants managed to reach the terrace of the four-storeyed district administrative complex in Moga on Friday morning and put up a saffron flag with Khalistan written on it, while their accomplice filmed the incident from a distance. While fleeing, the two men took away the Tricolour on the ground floor and allegedly tore it. On getting information about the incident, police personnel put up a new Tricolour and removed the saffron flag from the roof of the building. Moga senior superintendent of police Harmanbir Singh Gill said that two youngsters brought along the saffron flag at 8.15am. “It was a normal flag with the Khanda symbol but they had written Khalistan on it with paint.” Inspector general of police Kaustubh Sharma said, “We have CCTV footage of the accused and will arrest them soon.” SIKHS FOR JUSTICE RELEASES VIDEO OF INCIDENT The incident took place days after the banned US-based pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) announced a reward of $1,25,000 (Rs 93 lakh) for anyone who puts up the ‘Khalistan flag’ at Red Fort on Independence Day. SFJ leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu released a video of the Moga incident that shows the two men tearing the Tricolour and escaping with it. At the end of the video, Pannu announced a reward of $2,500 (Rs 1.8 lakh) for anyone raising the ‘Khalistan flag’ at panchayat ghars on Independence Day “It seems all this was done for money. While fleeing, they took away the National Flag with them. We are trying to recover it,” SSP Gill said. Deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans said, “This is an act of cowardice. They chose a time when the employees were arriving for duty so no one suspected them. We will take steps to ensure such lapses don’t occur again.” An eyewitness was taken into custody as police suspect his involvement in the incident. A case was registered under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act at the city police station in Moga. BITTU BLAMES SFJ, JATHEDARCalling for the arrest of the two miscreants, Ludhiana Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu tweeted, “The poison being spread by Pannu and Jathedar Sahib has shown its effect in Moga. Now is the time to differentiate between those who love this country and those who want to destroy it.” Bittu is the grandson of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, who was assassinated by Sikh extremists at the Punjab secretariat on August 31, 1995. Bittu has been at loggerheads with Akal Takht acting jathedar Harpreet Singh for allegedly supporting SFJ ‘s demand for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.AAP STEERS CLEAR, MANN CALLS IT ‘NON-ISSUE’ Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann termed the Moga incident a non-issue. “The AAP struggles for issues such as unemployment, inflation and poverty as they affect the common man. Owing to the deteriorating situation in Punjab, scores of youngsters are migrating to foreign lands. Such incidents are actually not issues,” he told reporters in Bathinda. In the run-up to the 2017 Punjab elections, AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was seen cosying up to Sikh radicals. In January 2017, Kejriwal had even stayed at the house of former militant Gurinder Singh’s house in Moga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/miscreants-put-up-flag-with-khalistan-written-on-it-on-terrace-of-moga-district-administrative-complex/story-5QEHItG8lALz10bDMeTwfM.html

14-08-2020||Delhi||Freedom from taboo: Artists help remove stigmas around prisons||When the terms prison and punishment are spoken, dreadful images of crime come to mind. But anyone who has interacted with inmates only has tales of hopes to tell. Life behind bars teaches inmates many lessons, leaving most of them with a will to turn around their lives for the better. This Independence Day, a group of artists is helping these inmates get freedom from the taboos surrounding them.Yogesh Saini, who founded Delhi Street Art (DSA) to make the city’s public spaces more breathable, has teamed up with various incarceration facilities to help engage inmates. He and his team of artists have been cleaning up spaces, adding relevant murals to the city’s walls. Recently, they undertook painting murals of the lesser-seen facets of Mahatma Gandhi’s life at an incarceration facility on the outskirts of Delhi. “We started in December last year and finished the first phase by January. We have painted over 40 murals, and a few final touches remain,” says Saini. Masks are mandatory and social distancing protocols are followed. “We are being extra careful and restricting our movement,” he adds. The team has spent about five years working in different jails, and Saini believes that art reinforces positivity. “These are indelible memories for the people of the city, and it is a positive change for the inmates as well. They are in our contact even when they are out on parole, or upon completion of their sentence,” shares Saini.Sudhakar Singh, previously an employee with the Central Government, was sentenced to seven years in Tihar jail. He is a self-taught artist from Delhi and found his footing with the group, but life after sentence has not been kind to him, as he found himself out of work. “Ek baar aap jail chale jaao toh uske baad kuch nahi bachta. Main ek professional driver bhi hoon, lekin ab corona ke chalte koi kaam nahi hai,” he says. His son is a graduate and the sole earning member of the family. “Jab main gaya tha tab voh school mein tha. Usne graduation kari aur ab job karta hai,” he says.Read: Stuck in Pune due to Covid, Hong Kong-based doc’s murals spread positivityPhrases like “art has the power to reform lives” are not just tall proclamations. For life behind bars, art often emerges as a ray of hope. Vinod Lahori was fortunate he found a mentor in a fellow inmate who helped him hone his skills. “I used to sketch on applications and letters, but guruji motivated me to take it up seriously,” says Vinod who is currently out on parole due to his good behaviour and the covid crisis. Talking about his love for art, he says, “Dil ko bahut sukoon milta hai yeh kaam kar ke. Jail mein reh kar maine independent hona seekh liya hai. Vahaan aap insaan ko parakhna samajh jaate hain.”Artists who have worked with inmates realise and acknowledge the sea of difference in life in prison and the outside world. “Everyone deserves a second chance at life, and whatever they did in the past, they have paid for it. Unhe pachtava hai,” says Deepak Saini, a graduate of College of Art. Sharing his experience of working with the inmates, he says, “A lot of them came to know us, and before corona, we would often have lunch together. Art is a way to integrate them back into the society.”Read: Spreading corona awareness, one wall at a timeSelf-taught artist Virendar has worked at several incarceration facilities and says that often a person succumbs to their circumstances. “Koi kaise criminal banaa yeh aap nahi keh sakte, zaroori yeh hai ki sabko ek izzatdaar zindagi jeene ka adhikaar hai. Baahar aa ke unhe kaam nahi milta, log unhe alag nazar se dekhte hain.

Police stumbled upon the body, hidden in the boot trunk of a taxi among sacks of vegetables, during a routine checking. Cops have arrested the parents and a relative of the victim’s daughter-in-law and the driver of the taxi in which the body was found. Preliminary investigation revealed that the accused had planned to dispose of the body in east Kolkata as the area has large wetlands, canals and creeks and remains desolate. “The victim, Suja Mani Gayen, used to harass and torture her daughter-in-law Sujata Gayen. The relationship between Suja Mani’s family and Sujata’s parents had gone sour long back,” said a police officer. Sujata’s parents invited Suja Mani over for dinner under the pretext of discussing their disputes. They hit the victim with a rod and strangulated her. “During a routine checking, a police patrol unit intercepted the taxi. There were sacks of green vegetables in the boot trunk. The head of a woman with blood stains on it was jutting out. The four were immediately arrested,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/60-year-old-killed-by-daughter-in-law-s-family-4-held-while-trying-to-dispose-of-body-in-a-taxi/story-kdLD24p6CtmDPy5wfzUmHI.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||300 buses plying under PRTC’s kilometre scheme yet to resume operations||Patiala: The Pepsu Road Transport Corporation’s kilometre (km) scheme has gone off track as at least 300 buses it is running under it are yet to resume operations during the Covid-19 unlock phases. Under the scheme, the responsibility of operating the buses is of the private transporters and the corporation has to give only the running cost. Of the 300 buses under the scheme, 15 are integral coaches (Volvo), 47 are HVAC, while 233 are ordinary buses that run through contracts with private transporters. These buses have not been plying since March 18 when restrictions were placed on public transport. CORPORATION FEARS LOSSES, SCHEME BECOMING UNVIABLE The corporation has a total fleet of 1,045 buses. Though the PRTC resumed transport services on May 20, it is still running less than 50% of its total fleet due to lesser occupancy in the wake of the pandemic. The private transporters associated with the corporation fear huge losses in this scenario. “It is not financially viable for the PRTC to run buses under the km-scheme at this stage. The buses plying under the scheme could only resume services once the situation normalises. At present, only PRTC-owned buses are put into service. Even they are facing occupancy issues as the people are reluctant to travel in public transport,” PRTC managing director Jaskiran Singh said. Under the scheme, the running cost of a bus is estimated to be around ₹6.68 per km, while in self-financed buses, the expenses are pegged at ₹7.80 per km. Even insurance and security expenses are borne by the transporters. The employees unions see the scheme as a tactic to promote privatisation in the state’s transport sector. FOCUS ON GENERATING REVENUE Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener of trade unions linked with PRTC, said the decision of not running the buses under the scheme at this stage will help PRTC to meet its expenditure somehow. “In the present scenario, the corporation should concentrate on generating revenues by running its pre-owned buses,” he said. Pradeep Gautam of the Km-Scheme Bus Operators’ Union said non-operation of buses has not only hurt them financially but also the workers have been rendered jobless. “A majority of us purchased these buses by taking loans from banks. We are finding it hard to repay our loan installments. Moreover, the PRTC has not paid ₹5 crore for plying these buses from February 15 to March 18,” Gautam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/300-buses-plying-under-prtc-s-km-scheme-yet-to-resume-operations/story-lmMn8AFMa9CB2iFRXkAMBK.html

14-08-2020||City||PMC to shut down 8 Covid-19 care Centres due to low occupancy||Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to temporarily shut eight Covid Care Centres as there is less occupancy at these centres.These centres include FC College, Agriculture College, Bunter School, Aundh ITI, Polytechnic college, Ambedkar Hostel, Dyaneshwar Hostel and a hostel at Sinhgad College.Rajendra Muthe, PMC estate department head and deputy commissioner, said, “These eight Covid Care Centres will be closed temporarily due to low occupancy. Patients at these centres will be shifted to nearby Covid Care Centres.”“PMC has a total 21 Covid care centres in the city with a capacity of 15,430 beds,” he said.“These centres will be in the possession of PMC only. We will be sanitising it and keeping it ready in case of an emergency,” he said.Muthe said, “More number of Covid-19 patients is under home quarantine in Pune city compared to hospitals.”As of August 11 out of the 15,043 active cases, almost 7,754 are in home isolation and 7,289 are in hospital isolation.Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner said, “There is enough bed capacity at the Covid Care Centres for asymptomatic patients. But at the same time, we are promoting home isolation as it would help the administration to concentrate mainly on critical patients rather than asymptomatic patients.”The administration claims that as these centres will be shut temporarily, it will reduce the burden on manpower.A patient who tested positive for the virus said, “I did my Covid test at a PMC swab centre. They asked me to stay at the PMC-run quarantine facility until the report was out. The experience at the quarantine facility was not satisfactory.”Another patient from Baner centre said, “Toilets at this centre are unclean. Also, it is tough to spend days here as there is only my mobile for entertainment. So I preferred home isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-to-shut-down-8-covid-care-centres-due-to-low-occupancy/story-280DwFBl9TUFue1IqaMqkN.html

Not one condemning riots or attack on his own party’s Dalit MLA or asking Govt for tough actions. Same beating around the bush asking irrelevant questions to BJP. Fear of votes & Policy of appeasement. #CongressAgainstDalits,” Santhosh tweeted.Recently, Congress MLA Srinivas Murthy’s residence in Bengaluru was vandalised, allegedly over an inciting social media post by his nephew.Murthy’s house was attacked by people for an alleged controversial post on Facebook by his nephew Naveen.On August 12, Murthy demanded police security after his house was set on fire.The MLA said the miscreants were not from his party but were outsiders.

14-08-2020||Chandigarh||High court asks CBI to probe collection of ‘royalty’ from mining trucks in Rupnagar||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary probe into the collection of ‘royalty’ from trucks carrying mining material in Rupnagar district. The court was acting on the report submitted by chief judicial magistrate-cum-secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Rupnagar, Harsimranjit Singh. On February 19, the high court asked him to prepare the report as during the hearing of a petition on illegal mining, the government had told the court that there are no illegal check points/barriers near the mining sites in Rupnagar. Since the counsel for the petitioner had controverted the statement, the high court had sought a report from the DLSA secretary. “From the stand of the state and the report, the factual position of the existence and operation of the illegal and unauthorised nakas varies. We have no reason to doubt the report that is supported by photos and videoclips through a pen drive,” the bench of justice Jaswant Singh observed. It said that in view of this, the court was inclined to initiate action against the officials concerned who have failed to discharge their obligations under the Provisions of the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 and failed to preserve the supremacy and rule of law. The CJM had listed out seven locations where he found illegal nakas on three dates on visits to verify facts again. The officer submitted photos and videos of the nakas and collection being made. “(Those contacted) unanimously confirmed that no truck carrying sand and gravel is being allowed to cross these points without paying royalty. In fact royalty is being charged/collected by crusher owners from the trucks/tippers of sand and gravel at the start of their journey and slip (parchi) in this regard is being issued to truck/tipper drivers, which is being cross-checked at the illegal checkpoints to ensure that no vehicle passes through without paying royalty,” the CJM’s report says. The court too observed that the report established the existence and operation of the illegal and unauthorised checkpoints, operated by private persons without any authority of law, at various locations. There’s an instance where such an illegal checkpoint is even near a police post. The CBI has been asked to probe the case in view of the stand of the state and its authorities and looking at the dimension of the lawlessness involved, the bench added. The CBI has been told to take further steps after a preliminary report based on the outcome of the probe within two weeks. A status report has been sought by September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-asks-cbi-to-probe-collection-of-royalty-from-mining-trucks-in-rupnagar/story-tkhhTUDB9htOfqPZwCoMIN.html

Landlords have no option but to renegotiate in the backdrop of an emerging trend of desperate tenants surrendering office space in neighbourhoods such as Udyog Vihar, Sohna Road, even Golf Course Road, a premium addressThe impact of the pandemic has been so drastic that Gurugram was pushed to second place for the first time in seven years in office leasing activity in the first half of this year, according to a report by the property consultant Knight Frank. According to the report, more office space was leased in Noida in January-June as supply was available at much lower rentals in the satellite city.According to the report, 0.92 million sq ft office space was leased in Gurugram in the first six months of 2020 compared with 1.08 million sq ft in Noida. Noida outperformed Gurugram in terms of overall transactions and became the highest contributor to gross leasing in the National Capital Region market, posting a year-on-year increase of 86%. It came against the backdrop of a 45% decline in gross leasing by area in the NCR in the first six months of 2020. “Demand for office spaces has been growing in Noida mainly due to relatively high rentals in Gurugram’s established office space locations such as DLF Cyber City, Golf Course Road, MG Road and Udyog Vihar,” Knight Frank said, adding that better roads, improved metro rail connectivity and competitive rentals helped Noida pip Gurugram.Over the years, Gurugram has emerged as a powerful magnet for both domestic and multinational companies as available commercial space in New Delhi shrank and rentals soared. Today, it is the India corporate base of companies ranging from insurers Aviva and Max Life to consultant McKinsey and beverage maker PepsiCo, and home to the factories of automakers Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotorCorp, and airlines IndiGo and SpiceJet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-hit-gurugram-falls-behind-on-office-rentals/story-9oDT7wPtc9PYcxVwZ7hOuM.html

A decision was taken to refer him for Medanta hospital and an advanced life support system-equipped ambulance was called. Mathura city magistrate Manoj Kumar Singh and a circle officer... accompanied him to Gurugram.”Shri Krishna Janambhoomi Seva Sansthan (Mathura) secretary Kapil Sharma said Das had not been keeping well over the last five years, but he appeared fine when he attended the Janmashtami celebrations on Wednesday. “We came to know about his ill health on Thursday morning.”Das shared the dais with Modi, Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Ram temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/head-of-ram-temple-trust-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-toD3Qbo9N85FihwlHhP7BO.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Rain likely in Delhi over next few days, light showers in NCR: Met||Delhi will continue to get light to moderate showers over the next two to three days owing to moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea and the monsoon trough (a line of low pressure) passing near the national capital.Delhi’s Safdarjung station recorded the highest rain for August in 24 hours since 2013 on Wednesday evening and Thursday night. Between 5.30pm on Wednesday and 2.30pm on Thursday, the station recorded 83.8mm of rain, the highest since 95.2mm on August 21, 2013.Delhi’s rain deficiency (since June 1) fell from 35% on Wednesday to 10% on Thursday, considered to be in the “normal” category for monsoon. The Palam station recorded 99.9mm, while Lodhi Road recorded 84mm and Ridge recorded 98 mm. Most of the rain was recorded in two intense spells between 11.30pm on Wednesday and 2.30am on Thursday and another between 2.30am and 5.30am, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi.“We can expect more rain. NCR (National Capital Region) may record moderate category rains while Delhi will continue to record light to moderate rains. The monsoon trough is passing along Ferozepur, Narnaul, Gwalior, Satna, Ambikapur and Chaibasa towards the low pressure area over Bay of Bengal. There is also a cyclonic circulation over south Haryana. So rains will continue for two to three days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“Palam recorded a very heavy spell by 5am on Thursday and then parts of central Delhi recorded a spell after some time. South Delhi got the highest share because moisture incursion is from the south now, from the Arabian Sea. We may not see such intense spells from Friday in Delhi-NCR, but 5 to 7cm rain can be expected. The heavy spells are dependent on convection and monsoon winds,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rain-likely-in-delhi-over-next-few-days-light-showers-in-ncr-met/story-ByhqaXP5G6x2gzj5gUx1pJ.html

The victims are identified as Hitesh Barod and Parbhat Barod. The bus driver, Nilesh Tanaji Bangre, has been booked by the Manor police and he has also sustained minor injuries. According to the police, the bus had jumped the lane owing to which the collision took place. As the van was operating on compressed natural gas (CNG), the two vehicles caught fire after the collision and the two occupants inside the van were charred to death.“The bus was coming from Borivli and going towards Boisar. It had three passengers, as well as the driver and the conductor. The passengers of the bus were in essential services and were returning to Boisar from work. As the bus was approaching Varai Dhekale, its driver lost control of the vehicle and crossed the barricade and jumped on the lane towards Mumbai where it collided with the van. The passengers on the bus jumped outside using the emergency exit,” said assistant inspector Pratap Darade of Manor police station. “Prima facie, it appears that Bangre was overspeeding, owing to which he lost control of the bus. We are probing if he was driving in an inebriated state. He has been booked under sections 304 (a) (neglience), 279 (causing hurt due to rash act), 337 (rash driving endangering human life) and 427 (mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and we will arrest him soon,” said Darade.

14-08-2020||City||26-year-old Navi Mumbai resident offered job overseas, duped of ₹5.79 lakh||Days after a 26-year-old woman from Airoli returned to India after completing her Master’s degree in Australia, she was cheated of Rs5.79 lakh in a phishing attack. The Rabale police have registered a case of cheating following her complaint. The police said that the incident took place between February and March. The complainant, Nilakshi More, returned to the country on February 11 after completing her biotechnology course. Soon after, she updated her details on a job search portal, including her qualification and contact details. On February 22, she received a job offer from an email ID which was made to look like the official correspondence of a Canada-based chemical company. The fraudsters made her fill a form and a few days later, communicated through the same e-mail id to inform her that she had been selected for the job. Later, a woman who identified herself as Lynn Desautels called More on her number and asked her for more details. She then connected the complainant to another woman who posed as an agent in New Delhi. The woman identified herself as Nora Jayden and told More that she would have to pay Rs35,800 as work visa charges. She also made the complainant pay Rs88,650 for the work permit, said the police. Later, More paid an additional Rs2.89 lakh towards travel expenses including flight tickets. Once she transferred the large amount, the accused her asked for more money to create a new bank account for her and made her transfer Rs1.65 lakh. “However, the accused kept calling her and asked her for more money on various pretexts. Then the complainant found something amiss and after verifying some details, found that the email id on which she was sent the job interest was fake,” said an officer from Rabale police station. More recently approached the police, following which a case was registered against the two women, Desautels and Jayden on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/26-year-old-navi-mumbai-resident-offered-job-overseas-duped-of-5-79-lakh/story-OEWlcBht9Ler7kshqqTXgI.html

14-08-2020||City||Whale shark case: 2 accused arrested in Mumbai sent to forest custody||Two persons detained on Wednesday for allegedly attempting to buy and transport the remains of a whale shark, which was brought to Sassoon Dock in Colaba, were arrested and presented before a court on Thursday.The chief metropolitan magistrate court at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus sent the accused – Jan Bahadur Yadav, 50, and Sham Rajaram Dhar, 35, – to forest custody till August 18. “We have begun interrogating the two accused to identify the others involved in the incident. The fisheries department is also assisting us to identify the boat through which the species was captured at the sea,” said Suresh Warak, range forest officer (mangrove cell).On Wednesday, the carcass of around 20-foot-long dead female whale shark was caught by a fishing boat which was brought to Sassoon Dock. As authorities made their way to the spot, the shark was cut into pieces in an attempt to sell it to a distributor. Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, and listed as ‘endangered’ species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The forest and fisheries department managed to nab Yadav, the distributor who had come to Sassoon Dock to purchase the shark. Dhar is a tempo driver. Both were arrested on Thursday morning for violating the WPA.Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner (fisheries), said, “We have traced a boat that may have been involved in catching the shark. A notice has been issued to those inside it, directing them to report to us at the earliest. Based on proper evidence, details will be shared with the mangrove cell for further action. Meanwhile, we are deploying more personnel at landing centres such as Sassoon Dock to keep an eye on unsustainable fishing practices, which are affecting endangered marine species. An information board will be installed and awareness sessions will be undertaken to inform fishermen about the seriousness of such offences.”On Thursday, the shark’s post mortem was carried out by senior veterinarian Dr Shailesh Pethe from Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The report stated that the marine species had died due to suffocation. “Since the carcass was made into multiple pieces, no singular organ was available for patho-anatomical description. However, considering the gills were showing some amount of hemorrhages (bleeding), the death possibly could be due to hypoxia (condition where oxygen does not reach cells and tissues of the body),” said Dr Pethe. Additionally, tissue samples were collected for further DNA analysis and associated studies, as per the request of the mangrove cell, said Dr Pethe. The carcass and slaughtered pieces were buried at the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre in Airoli.“The post mortem proves that the shark was fished out at the sea. Similar to cases involving tigers or leopards, DNA samples help confirm that the species involved was Schedule I under WPA before the court. Proactive efforts being taken will ensure that such cases are not repeated,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-held-for-sale-and-transport-of-whale-shark-carcass-in-mumbai-sent-to-forest-custody/story-4jjfBElfgGcAIk4ISJzwFO.html
14-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra waives toll for vehicles plying to Konkan for Ganesh Chaturthi||The Maharashtra government on Thursday announced a toll waiver for private vehicles plying towards Konkan for Ganesh Chaturthi. Eknath Shinde, the cabinet minister for public works department (public undertakings and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation) announced that the waiver will be implemented two days prior to the 10-day festival – which falls on August 22 – and two days after it. Shinde held a meeting via video-conferencing with Shambhuraj Desai, the minister of state for home, and other officials to finalise the toll waiver. To avail the waiver, motorists will have to go to their local police station and register their details, including their name, address, vehicle owner’s name, vehicle registration number and the date of journey, in a bid to avail the toll waiver, that will be granted by the issuance of a sticker. After the meeting, Shinde in a series of tweets said that like every year, the state government has decided to waive the toll this year too. “In the light of the coronavirus outbreak, those travelling to Konkan will need to have a [negative] corona test and an e-pass to travel,” one of his tweets read. Each year, thousands of people – hailing from Konkan – visit their villages and towns in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Konkan region for the festival. They either take the Mumbai-Goa highway (National Highway-66) or travel via the Mumbai-Pune expressway or Kolhapur-Bengaluru highway (to travel from Pune to Kolhapur), where tolls are collected. The total toll amount from Mumbai to Konkan costs around ₹500-₹600, depending on the type of vehicle. The government has also deployed more Maharashtra State Transport Road Corporation (MSRDC) buses to ferry people to the Konkan region during the festival. Those who wish to travel by the state transport buses will not need an e-pass, but have to undergo a Covid-19 test 48 hours prior to the journey. According to the state government guidelines, only those who are tested negative will be allowed to travel. Meanwhile, a miscommunication between the state and railways resulted in the delay in operations of special outstation trains for Ganesh Chaturthi. While transport minister Anil Parab said they gave permission for trains to operate, the railways said the state asked to keep the operations on hold. “Confusion is being created by the railways by blaming us [state government]. We have asked for 200 trains and directed the railway authorities to depart the trains once they get the bookings. It is not true that we have asked them to keep the proposal on hold. Nothing was given in writing and no oral orders are obeyed in government communication. They should immediately start the trains running,” said Parab. According to officials from the chief minister’s office, the proposal to run special trains has been put on hold and may be given a go-ahead only a week ahead of Ganesh Charturthi (August 22).“Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have no capacity or health infrastructure to take extra load. The district administrations have requested to not give permissions to people coming from Mumbai, Pune and other cities. The railways may be given permission to ply trains early next week,” the official said.However, the minister confirmed that Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg district administrations have been asking the state to not allow people from outside the districts to flock in during the festival. “Even if we decide to run the trains, there is no response from the people. We have kept 3,000 ST (state transport) buses ready to ply more than 60,000 passengers but have received booking only for 12,000 passengers so far,” he said.Meanwhile, the Central Railway in a press release stated that they are ready to operate trains but waiting for approval from the state. “Railways is ready to run the specials subject to all the norms including social distancing, etc. Senior officials of the state government of Maharashtra informed on telephone on Saturday, August 8, at night to keep on hold the schedule of the running of special trains, as the matter is under reconsideration of the Maharashtra government and said that they would advise the outcome. Since then, the railway administration, both at the board level and the zonal level, are in continuous touch with Maharashtra government officials and have been waiting to go ahead,” the press release read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-waives-toll-for-vehicles-plying-to-konkan-for-ganesh-chaturthi/story-qCmvlO79eniVYNF1uC5ezL.html
14-08-2020||Bangalore||SDPI role under scanner: Minister||The role of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Tuesday’s violence in Bengaluru that left three people dead was under scanner, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Thursday. A mob went on a rampage in the city on August 11 over a social media post with alleged derogatory references to Islam. The mob, armed with machetes, swords and sticks, vandalised the residence of a Congress legislator — the post was made from the Facebook account of his nephew — attacked two police stations, damaged vehicles, and smashed an ATM machine into pieces in a violent five-hour spree that also left 100 people, including 60 police personnel, wounded. Three people were killed after police opened fire to bring the situation under control. “As per the information gathered so far and video footage [available], most importantly the role of SDPI is coming to light. We are collecting more information regarding it, we are investigating deeply in this regard”, Bommai said. State deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan said the government was also considering banning SDPI, four of whose members are among the over 140 arrested in connection with the violence. Seventeen people have been booked for the clashes. “Already, several SDPI office bearers have been arrested. Muzammil Pasha, the SDPI district secretary is the main [accused]. Firoz, Afraz Pasha and Shaik Adil, all of them are from SDPI, have also been arrested. Their role is completely being investigated,” Bommai added.SDPI, however, has denied any connection to the violence and instead accused the police of failing to bring the situation under control. Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy’s nephew Naveen was among those arrested in the case. Naveen , who is in his 20s, said his account that was used to make the controversial post was hacked into. The post was made on August 10 and it went viral a day later, police officials said on condition of anonymityAuthorities have also extended Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which prohibits the gathering of four or more people at a place, in areas under DJ Halli and KG Halli police station, till August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/sdpi-role-under-scanner-minister/story-VC0GEXbOgubRMcFrjDXfOL.html

14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Montek report to Punjab govt: Punjab’s free power policy highly regressive, benefits only big farmers||Former deputy chairman of planning commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia has termed Punjab’s policy of free power to agriculture sector as “highly regressive” as it benefits only big farmers. In a report submitted to the Punjab government, Ahluwalia has also asked it to gradually reduce procurement of paddy from the extremely water-stressed areas, a suggestion which is expected to receive a sharp reaction from farmer community. The free power largesse --- incurring an annual burden of Rs 6,500 crore on the cash-strapped government --- has remained a sensitive political issue in Punjab, with no regime really being able to do away with the populist measure ever since it was announced in 1996. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had sought suggestions from the expert group, led by Ahluwalia, on ‘medium and long term post-COVID economic strategy for Punjab’. The report lists out three damaging consequences of free power policy. “It has led to an unsustainable burden on the budget and limits the state government’s ability to incur other expenditures essential for development. The total power subsidy in 2021 amounts to almost 1.9% of GSDP,” says the report. There are at least 14.5 lakh agriculture tubewells that draw benefit of this scheme. The Amarinder government had proposed to generate bills for tubewell use and offered direct cash benefit to farmers. However, the plan was junked after stiff political opposition. “Secondly, the policy has very damaging environmental consequences because it promotes water intensive paddy cultivation, leading to an excessive use of groundwater,” it added. “And lastly, only big farmers were really benefitting from the scheme,” the report said. Darshan Pal of Kranti Kari Kisan Union termed the report as anti-farmer and anti-Punjab. “The present government is looking for excuses to end free power to agriculture sector but we will not let it happen,” said Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema. FOLLOW HARYANA MODEL The expert group said Punjab needs to reduce the area under paddy by about 25 lakh acre (out of total 76 lakh acre under paddy) over the next 6-7 years. Suggesting Punjab to adopt Haryana model, it said the latter is currently giving an incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre in overexploited blocks to diversify. “Punjab should consider something along these lines. This would reduce the use of electricity, resulting in big saving on the subsidy front,” says the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/montek-report-to-punjab-govt-punjab-s-free-power-policy-highly-regressive-benefits-only-big-farmers/story-CaCniZxZWjngZ98HEhoDtN.html

14-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC withdraws order removing HoD at Mumbai’s Seth GS Medical College||After receiving a rap from the Bombay high court (HC), the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday withdrew its order to remove Dr Deepa Kane from the post of professor and head of the cardiac anaesthesia department (HoD) of Seth GS Medical College, attached to KEM Hospital.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, who represented the civic body, on Wednesday informed the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar that the order will be withdrawn and a fresh decision will be taken by the additional municipal commissioner after hearing Dr Kane and Dr Sanjeeta Umbarkar, on whose complaint the former was removed from the post.Dean of KEM Hospital, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, had issued the order on July 27, removing Dr Kane from the post. She was appointed on the post on December 3, 2019. The action was taken based on a complaint lodged by Dr Umbarkar, an associate professor in the department, alleging that Dr Kane lacked the necessary educational qualifications and experience in cardiac anaesthesia.However, when Dr Kane moved HC, BMC claimed that she was removed from the post of HoD because the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) had withdrawn approval for her appointment.MUHS counsel, advocate Rajshekhar Govilkar, on the other hand, pointed out that the approval was withdrawn based on two communications received from BMC, in January and February 2020, informing the university about purported deficiencies in Dr Kane’s qualifications and experience. Govilkar added that it was not an independent decision of the university, and was completely based on the communications.HC was irked to note that Dr Umbarkar had filed three complaints and representations with the dean of KEM Hospital, additional municipal commissioner and MUHS. Several communications had been exchanged between them, but at no point was Dr Kane informed about the complaints against her.On the contrary, her lawyer advocate Rohaan Cama pointed out that even after repeatedly approaching the authorities for specifics about her dismissal, she was not provided any information. “This is complete malafide... This is not the way to deal with doctors and professors,” the bench had said earlier, after it was pointed out that all the steps and action was taken behind Kane’s back, in complete breach of the principles of natural justice.The judges were also annoyed to note that Dr Deshmukh, the then HoD, was the one who had signed Kane’s experience certificate, yet he has questioned the same document.The court has allowed the civic body to take a fresh decision on the issue after granting the opportunity of hearing to both sides. However, it has clarified that till then, Dr Kane will be back on the post held by her. HC also ordered that the fresh decision of the additional municipal commissioner will not be implemented for two weeks if it is adverse to the HoD, cardiac anaesthesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-withdraws-order-removing-hod-at-mumbai-s-seth-gs-medical-college/story-JEm3na7VMN3exV8nMmIhrI.html

14-08-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi govt ministers made money from transfers of officials, alleges BJP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state chief Chandrakant Patil on Thursday alleged that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s ministers had received kickbacks in transfers of officials. Patil has called for a criminal investigation department (CID) inquiry into the matter. “MVA ministers have opened up a market of sorts for plump postings to favoured officials. There is a huge turnover in these transfers and it also comes at a cost to genuine officials, who may not have political affiliations. All this needs to be investigated by the CID,’’ said Patil. Patil, a former state minister, also added that the general administration department (GAD) led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had lifted the moratorium on transfers laid down by the finance department, headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on May 4. The moratorium was laid down owing to the Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown to maintain continuity in the implementation of measures to tackle the pandemic. The finance department had in May issued a government order stating that no officer should be transferred this year to ensure continuity in the implementation of Covid-19 measures across departments. It was stated that GAD would come out with a specific order on transfers. Patil said that GAD issued a government order on July 7, allowing 15% of the transfers of the total posts to be carried out by July 31, which was later extended to August 10. He also said that the transfers had caused inconvenience and hardship to officials amid the pandemic. The state BJP chief, however, did not offer any concrete details or evidence about such kickbacks. He also did not level a charge against any specific minister. The ruling parties have refuted the allegation. Water resources minister Jayant Patil said that such “loose allegations” are not be taken seriously”. In a jibe to state BJP chief, Patil said, “If we set up an inquiry, we will start [the probe] with all transfers carried out by the BJP government in the past five years.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-govt-ministers-made-money-from-transfers-of-officials-alleges-bjp/story-QjvMzsYuBUfcX4wEjQM81I.html
14-08-2020||City||Shiv Sena’s fight against injustice to continue: Maharashtra CM||Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the party’s fight against injustice will continue, similar to how Maratha warrior king Shivaji fought against the Mughals. Thackeray, in his speech on the diamond jubilee celebration of Bal Thackeray’s weekly magazine ‘Marmik’, said that Shivaji Maharaj stood up against the mighty Mughals and taught the ‘Marathi manoos’ to not cower against injustice. The statement comes at a time when the state government is engaged in a legal battle with the Centre over the takeover of the investigation into the Sushant Singh Rajput case by CBI. Thackeray, during the 2014 state elections, had likened Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers to Bijapur general Afzal Khan. “The identity of Marathi manoos is such that they would not do injustice to others, and if injustice is meted out to them, they will not leave the person. We must fight against injustice. Shivaji Maharaj taught us that. The Mughals were so powerful, despite that, a 16-17-year-old boy stood up against them and won Torna fort. If at that time, someone would have thought how to fight against the powerful Mughals, forget winning, then swarajya [self-rule] would not have been established. Therefore, without thinking about winning or losing, injustice will be rooted out of this soil,” Thackeray said. Sena leader Sanjay Raut, earlier in the day, said the state government was fighting in the Supreme Court to protect its rights within the federal structure. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Raut said the case had been “technically” handed over to CBI.“The Mumbai Police is investigating the case and if there is anything else to probe, the CBI can do it… Bring Mossad and KGB too. There is nothing to hide. We are not opposing the CBI. When the Mumbai Police is already on the job, what will the CBI do?” Raut also defended Sena leader and Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is being linked to the actor’s case. “Aaditya Thackeray has nothing to do with the case. Nobody has taken his name, rather media has been taking his name. Everyone knows where today’s journalism is heading.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-s-fight-against-injustice-to-continue-maharashtra-cm/story-0ZxzP8KzDARVXae7y4j6hL.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||UT tells PGIMER, GMCH-32 to reserve 100 beds each for Covid patients from city||With a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, and a realistic prospect of shortage of beds for critical Covid-19 patients in the city, the UT administration, on Thursday, directed the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, to reserve 100 beds each for critical patients from the city.The UT health secretary, in a letter to the director, PGIMER, has requested “immediate earmarking of 100 beds with critical care facility and keep it in reserve for Chandigarh patients.” If necessary, beds outside the Nehru Hospital Extension (NHE) block should be used, it was further stated.The letter notes, “There has been a spread of infection in Chandigarh in recent times which may lead to shortage of beds for critical patients of Chandigarh.”Earlier in the day, Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore, in the war room review meeting, decided that additional facilities for 200 beds-- 100 in PGIMER and 100 in GMCH-32-- should be created exclusively for Chandigarh’s Covid-19 patients.UT PLANS DISRUPTEDAs per the contingency plan prepared by the Chandigarh administration, 300 beds were to be set aside for critical patients. Of these, 200 beds were for critical patients at the dedicated Covid hospital at NHE, PGIMER. The scope for expansion of an additional 100 beds was also kept at the facility.Further, a similar facility of 100 beds was to be created by GMCH-32 at the Sector 48 hospital by converting the existing hospital into a dedicated Covid hospital.But it was observed that many beds in the Covid hospital at NHE, PGIMER, were occupied by patients from adjoining states.Of the 300 beds available in the city currently, only 91 are occupied by patients from city while the rest are from neighbouring states. Of the 149 patients at the Covid Care Centre at PGI, only 57 belong to Chandigarh, 54 are from Punjab, 16 from Haryana, 11 from Himachal Pradesh and the remaining from other states. In GMCH-48, out the total 44 critical patients admitted, 34 are from Chandigarh.FOR MODERATE SYMPTOM PATIENTSThe bed capacity for patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic patients has also been expanded.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “As many as 600 beds are available in Hostel No 8, 9 and 10 of Panjab University for taking care of mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 patients.” He also stated that facilities in James Hotel have been requisitioned, where the Covid positive patients, who can afford to pay the charges can stay and avail the facilities. Eden Hospital has also been made available for Covid treatment in Chandigarh.For patients availing facilities at James Hotel, Sector 17, the charges will be Rs 3,500 a day for single occupancy, including three times meal, and Rs 4,000 for double occupancy.HELP DESK FOR ACTIVE PATIENTSThe UT Administration has also set-up a helpdesk for Covid-19 active patients who are in home isolation. The prime-objective of the helpdesk is to have regular interaction with patients and provide the medical assistance in case of emergency. The patients will be contacted on a daily basis. On Thursday, the doctors interacted with the patients through a video call and responded to their queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-tells-pgimer-gmch-32-to-reserve-100-beds-each-for-covid-patients-from-city/story-wluz3zTPM5vQlhAW2r5NEI.html
14-08-2020||City||Is all well in the Pawar family?||Eight months after an open revolt by Ajit Pawar (now the deputy chief minister), the Pawar family is again facing the same question, is all well? This time, because of Ajit Pawar’s son Parth. A day after Pawar called his grand-nephew (Parth) “immature” and said he doesn’t give a damn about what the latter says, three meetings were held, including one on Thursday evening. Parth had demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case a few days ago, following which Pawar on Wednesday said, “We give no importance to what my grand-nephew (Parth Pawar) says. He is immature.” Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai apartment on June 14. It is yet unclear how Ajit is reacting to the public rebuke for his son as he chose not to talk to the media. But there were rumours that Parth was upset and may take a decision, which was refuted by senior NCP leaders. Parth reached Silver Oak, Pawar’s residence at south Mumbai, on Thursday evening to meet the NCP chief and his daughter Supriya Sule. The meeting went on for more than two hours. Parth avoided speaking with the media after coming out. NCP insiders said Sule had called Parth home. “We are expecting all issues would have been resolved. His decision to meet the NCP chief indicates a positive development,” said an NCP leader. Before that, Sule met Ajit at his Mantralaya office on Thursday afternoon. The meeting between the cousins lasted an hour. State NCP chief Jayant Patil, considered as close aide of Pawar, said neither Parth nor Ajit is upset and Sule went to meet the latter to discuss development works of her parliamentary constituency. “Who said Parth is upset? Being a grandfather, he (NCP chief) has all the authority to say or suggest something. Do we get upset when a father figure in the family says something,” Patil asked reporters. “I don’t see any intention.” Before that, a meeting was also held at Pawar’s residence on Thursday evening where Sule, Ajit and state NCP chief Jayant Patil were present. Patil denied any discussion on Parth at the meet too. “It was a scheduled meeting. We had discussions on several issues. The party allows everyone to express their views. He (Parth) may have said something that I’m not aware of. There was no discussion on Parth’s statements, also no clarification will be sought from him,” he said. NCP insiders said Pawar is certainly unhappy, but by ridiculing his grand-nephew publicly, he has also given a clear message to all leaders that any deviation from the party line will not be tolerated. This is the first time the veteran leader has slammed a family member publicly. “Pawar saheb made the statement as the party president. He should have raised the issue on the party forum before going public,” said an NCP insider. Senior NCP leader and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal too said that no one in the family was upset and Pawar only said that Parth was new. “The family is united, everything is fine and we are also members of the same family. No one is upset, not even Ajit dada (Ajit Pawar),” Bhujbal said. Political experts feel Pawar wants to end Parth’s habit of speaking out of turn on policy matters. “It doesn’t appear that Parth’s statements had anything to do with Ajit,” said Prakash Bal. The Pawar family has seen an open revolt by Ajit and a few other NCP lawmakers only last November. They had got together with the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and had hurriedly cobbled together a government. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had taken the oath as the chief minister, while Ajit too was sworn in as the deputy chief minister, but returned to the party as most NCP legislators, who were loyal to the party chief, refused to side with the rebel faction and the government barely lasted for 80 hours. A month later, Ajit Pawar was sworn in again on the same position in the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government. Parth had contested last year’s Lok Sabha election from Maval constituency in western Maharashtra against the wishes of the NCP chief. He was not in favour of Parth contesting the general polls, but surrendered to the pressure from the family and declared his withdrawal from the electoral fray, saying only two members from the family should contest polls at a time. Pawar was preparing to contest from Madha parliamentary constituency at that time. However, Parth lost the parliamentary election to sitting Shiv Sena MP Shrirang Barne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/is-all-well-in-the-pawar-family/story-y62jGgYvTcKz4gSMx4PZJI.html

14-08-2020||Mumbai||2 sales manager of pharma firm held for selling Covid drug for ₹30K in Mumbai||The crime branch on Wednesday night arrested two regional sales managers of a pharmaceutical company for allegedly selling remdesivir injections – used in the Covid-19 treatment – for ₹30,000 each. According to officers from crime branch unit 7, Chandraprakash Gupta, 31, and Swatantra Shukla, 32, are the masterminds of the illegal remdesivir sale racket. The duo used to take the injections from hospitals or medicine distributors by claiming that it was required for the relatives of senior officials of the pharmaceutical company where they worked. They then used to sell the injections for exorbitant amounts, said crime branch officers. “Gupta and Shukla were in touch with around 200 hospitals, distributors and medical stores in Mumbai and Thane. The accused used to sell a single vial of remdesivir injection to customers for ₹30,000, which is almost six times more than the actual price of the anti-viral drug,” said Akbar Pathan, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch). “They conspired to make easy money by procuring and selling the drugs for a higher price and dupe needy customers. They are the masterminds behind the illegal remdesivir sale racket and we are questioning them to find out how many injections have they sold in the black market so far,” Pathan added.A local court on Thursday remanded them to police custody till Sunday.Last month, the crime branch busted the racket and arrested seven people in connection with the case and seized 13 injections from them. The accused were identified as Rahul Bharat Gala, Vikas Angad Dubey, Bhavesh Ashok Shah, Ashish Gangadin Kanojia, Ritesh Rohidas Thonbare, Gurvindersingh Jasvindersingh Rathod and Sudhir Babu Pujari. Based on a tip-off, unit 7 officers, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials, sent a dummy customer to meet Shah. After bargaining the price of the drug, he agreed to sell a vial of the injection for ₹30,000. Shah then asked the customer to collect the injection from Gala and Dubey and gave their address to the customer. The police then conducted raids and arrested Gala and Dubey from their homes in Mulund and Diva, respectively, and recovered seven injections from them. The duo worked at a medical store in Mulund. The police then probed Shah, Gala and Dubey, and arrested the remaining accused and recovered six injections from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-sales-manager-of-pharma-firm-held-for-selling-covid-drug-for-30k-in-mumbai/story-O4I7rYmLVtPABdHUzrZiEJ.html

14-08-2020||Mumbai||IMD issues orange alert: Mumbai likely to get heavy rain till Monday||The city is likely to witness active monsoon conditions throughout the rest of the month, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) extended rainfall forecast, released on Thursday. The weather bureau also issued an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar, for Sunday and Monday. A yellow alert (heavy rain across isolated areas) has been issued for Friday and Saturday. The city can expect gusty winds reaching 45-55 kmph occasionally on Friday and Saturday, said IMD. “The extended rainfall forecast indicates a positive anomaly for Maharashtra over the next two weeks till the end of August, with rainfall activity expected to continue, especially along the Konkan coast, which is expected to be active with moderate to heavy showers,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. The formation of a low pressure weather system over northwest Bay of Bengal, off north Odisha and West Bengal, is likely to persist and become more organised over the next two to three days paving the way for fairly widespread rainfall for the Konkan coast, ghat areas and central Maharashtra, said a bulletin issued by IMD. Meanwhile on Thursday, the suburbs and south Mumbai only recorded light showers despite the yellow alert issued earlier by IMD. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs, recorded 5.6mm rain between 8.30am and 5.30pm Thursday while Colaba, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 2.2mm rain during the same period. For the second consecutive day, more rain was recorded in the northwestern suburbs, eastern suburbs and parts of Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

Along the Konkan coast, maximum rain was recorded on Thursday, between 8.30am and 5.30pm, at Mahabaleshwar (77.8mm). IMD classifies 15.6-64.4mm as moderate rain while 64.5-115.5mm rain is heavy. Over the past 24 hours (8.30 am Wednesday to 8.30 am Thursday), Mumbai suburbs recorded 42mm of rain while 17.8mm was recorded in south Mumbai. Maximum rain was recorded in Mulund (78.6mm) and Borivli (77.4mm) while isolated areas in Palghar (Jawahar, Vikramgad, Talasari) recorded 110-120mm rain. Matheran recorded 161.4mm while Mahabaleshwar recorded 135.5mm rain during this period. IMD also released a cumulative dataset of maximum rain recorded across weather stations in Konkan for the season so far. With 4,290mm rain, Gaganbawda in Kolhapur has witnessed maximum rainfall followed by Malvan (4,004mm) and Sawantwadi (3,508mm) in Sindhudurg district.

Chandigarh now stands at the third position among all the states and Union Territories in the country, coming only after Andaman and Nicobar Islands (8%) and Puducherry (5.6 %).The average growth rate essentially means the speed at which infections increase. A calculation of average growth rate helps predict the expected number of infections in the coming days.As per data, Chandigarh has added 700 cases to its tally in just two weeks of August. This is exponentially higher than the 605 cases recorded in the month of July.TESTING RATE HAS INCREASEDMeanwhile, the testing rate in UT has also increased with the introduction of the antigen testing method. In July, an average of 199 tests were conducted in a day. This went up to 431 tests a day in August. UT health secretary Arun Gupta said, “Testing is being gradually increased. The RT-PCR method is being used on an average of 300 persons while the remaining tests are being conducted through antigen testing. Antigen testing is being conducted only for asymptomatic contacts of positive persons. More kits are being procured by the health department.” Prof Rajesh Kumar, former head of the department of the Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said, “The outbreak in the unlocking period is on expected lines but there are strategies to bring things under control. In our case, we need to bring down the positivity rate (percentage of positive cases found among the total population tested), which is around 9% in UT. So, there is a need to test more people and isolate them.”He added: “The simple thing is to trace as many contacts as possible of the positive persons. This exercise is as important as having beds in hospitals to treat patients. If a person tests positive, extensive contact tracing is the key to stop the outbreak. The number of contacts of a person will increase by over three times now as compared to the lockdown period. So, more resources are needed for tracking. Authorities need to zero down on every individual contact and categorise them into high and low-risk contacts and test them within five to seven days. These measures will bring the infection spread under control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-5-3-chandigarh-s-infection-growth-rate-is-twice-the-national-average/story-ozxovV1a61WWixMG50jZXJ.html
14-08-2020||Mumbai||In 21 days, lake levels at 60%; water cut in Mumbai may be reviewed||Good rainfall in catchment areas over the past 21 days has led to a sharp rise in the water levels of the seven lakes that supply drinking water to the city. From around 4 lakh million litres (30% of full capacity) on July 24, the water level on Thursday was at 8 lakh million litres (60%). However, there is still a shortfall of 6 lakh million litres of water for the lakes to reach full capacity. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is monitoring the situation on a daily basis and any decision to roll back or relax water cuts could be reviewed next month, depending on the rainfall over the next 20 days. BMC imposed 20% water cuts in the city on August 5. While there were no water cuts in 2019, owing to good rainfall in catchment areas, BMC had imposed a 10% water cut in 2018, a 20% cut in 2016 and a 25% cut in 2014. An official from BMC’s hydraulics department said, “If there is sufficient rainfall and the lakes are full, we can review the situation of water cuts. Normally, the situation is reviewed in the first week of October, but this year due to shortfall, the situation is being constantly monitored.” Generally, 15% of monsoon rainfall is expected in June, 35% in July and August, followed by 15% in September. The city has seen more rainfall than its monthly average in June and July.According to BMC’s data, the seven lakes at present have 8.70 lakh million litres of water, which is 60.17% of their full capacity of 14.47 lakh million litres. On Sunday, the water levels were at 7.31 lakh million litres (50.53%). The overall lake level in 2019, in the corresponding period, was 92.38 % and it was 88.26% in 2018. Bhatsa dam, which caters to 55% of the city’s total water requirement, is at 60.75 % of its total capacity, compared to 89.78 % at this time in 2019. Out of the total seven lakes, Tulsi and Vehar, located within Mumbai’s limits, have overflowed. The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems, the Vaitarna system supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The civic body supplies 3,750 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. Further, BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal has plans to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar, if required. However, BMC officials said a final decision on this may be taken next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-21-days-lake-levels-at-60-water-cut-in-mumbai-may-be-reviewed/story-66cosvNUWFedgj4cVxGSvI.html

The bridge will connect the Sector 80/81 dividing road with several villages. The Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had allotted the project to Panchkula-based Mann Builders with a December 2017 deadline. Contractor Abhishek Kumar said the work was delayed due to three illegal houses on the construction site, which GMADA had failed to demolish. “Earlier, shifting of cables was stalling the project’s progress, but those have been removed now,” he said. “The three illegal houses will be razed within a week. Thereafter, the contractor will expedite the work,” said Davinder Singh, chief engineer, GMADA.Sources said the project was now expected to be completed by October 2021.Mauli Baidwan’s sarpanch Bal Krishan Goyal said commuters were at the receiving end due to delay in completion of the bridge. “This is negligence on the part of GMADA officials, who first failed to shift the cables on time and are now delaying compensation to three house owners,” he added. The National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI) authorities have also written to GMADA authorities several times to complete the project since they have to take the longest alternative route to reach the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-years-after-deadline-mohali-s-n-choe-bridge-hanging-in-balance/story-MVQ0vkINNEEtTFwRuEVdoI.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh private schools seek permission to strike off names of fee defaulters||Following the dispute between private unaided schools and the administration over the charging of fees to students during the lockdown, the Independent Schools Association (ISA) have prepared a composite proposal for the Chandigarh administration asking that they be allowed to strike the names of students not clearing their dues by the 15th of each month.The letter (copy with HT) sent to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore and signed by ISA president HS Mamik, mentioned that since the lockdown had gotten over on June 8 and unlock 3.0 was currently in effect, on compassionate grounds, the schools should be allowed to charge fees for the 2020-21 session at the same rate as were in 2019-20 session.The letter further mentioned that the schools wanted to set the 15th of every month as the date of clearance of pending dues by parents, and that any delay beyond that would result in the student’s name being struck off from the rolls.However, the schools have also written in the letter that they will show a sympathetic attitude towards parents who are still unable to pay the fees, wholly or partly due to the lockdown. They have suggested in the letter that such parents could submit an application with documentary proof as specified by the school and the Punjab and Haryana high court for their request to be considered.‘ADMN SHOULD WITHDRAW ORDERS’The ISA has asked that the Chandigarh administration withdraw its orders regarding fee collection citing them invalid under the Disaster Management Act. The association has also asked that no coercive action be taken against any school for the 2020-21 session in the matter of fee collection.On the other hand, the Chandigarh education department on Thursday issued a notice to a retired educationist and a retired accountant to process all complaints received against private schools. Officials on the basis of anonymity confirmed that between 100-150 complaints regarding charging of fee under the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act which is in effect in the UT had been received. Director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said that he was aware of the letter sent by ISA, but declined to comment on it.The ISA had moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the order issued by UT which directed private schools to reschedule the last date of depositing fee and funds for the 2020-21 session and fix the last date by giving at least a month’s time to the parents after the reopening of the schools.Private schools were also asked to upload the income expenditure account and balance sheets, but most schools haven’t followed through with that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/allow-us-to-strike-off-names-of-students-who-don-t-pay-fees-by-15th-of-every-month-independent-school-association-to-chandigarh-administration/story-64NLvIwgYy3UxsdxBHb44O.html

The Union government has sanctioned ₹12 crore for restoring the kitchen wing of British Era building. Human resource minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Thursday virtually laid the foundation for stone for the restoration of the historic building .The ministry has also approved ₹65 crore for the renovation and restoration of the building that over the years has borne the brunt of the vagaries of weather and time.The building, which is now the Rashtrapati Niwas (President’s residence), and also houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, is famous for hosting the historic failed ‘Simla Conference’, a meeting between the Viceroy of India Lord Wavell and prominent political leaders of Indian Muslim league and Indian National Congress. Institute director Makarand Paranjape said, “Except for small repairs no major restoration work has been undertaken in the building. The cobbled stones in the building have become delaminated due to weathering . The British-era refrigerators and an ice-cream machine will be repaired and put for display of the visitors.” The wing is in a bad shape due to long disuse. “The five-storey kitchen wing is unsafe as water drips from the roof and walls have deteriorated due to dampness. The tiles have also broken. There is trolley installed in the kitchen to ferry food to the top story,” he said. Built in the Jacobethan style, the construction of building began in 1878 and on July 23, 1888, Lord Dufferin became the first viceroy to occupy the majestic building, which thereon remained the nerve centre of the British administration. As many as 13 viceroys stayed in building between 1888 and 1946.

A committee, formed curtail the university’s spending, stated this during a meeting on Thursday. The committee, led by dean university instructions (DUI) RK Singla, also suggested that the university will be able to save ₹21 to 29 crore through cost-cutting measures, which were approved during the meeting.Due to the present circumstances, the university is not expecting examination fee of both semesters of the academic session 2020-21. According to the estimates, prepared by the finance and development office of the university, tabled in the meeting, the loss due to examination fee for one semester is estimated at ₹70-75 crore.The projected flow of revenue may also get affected as the varsity is expecting an adverse impact on fresh admissions. As the university has decided that classes for the first semester of session 2020-21 will be conducted online, it is not expecting to get hostel fee for at least six months, which comes to around ₹5 to 6 crore. The loss in rotation of the test is expected to be ₹3 to 4 crore while the loss due to drop in admissions will be around ₹7 to 8 crore.NO SALARY CUTSThe proposal for a partial salary cut was also discussed during the meeting of the panel but it was not approved by the committee. A member of the panel, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have suggested that the university may cut down the expenditure and take loan on internal assets which will be returned when possible.”WAY OUT FOR PU During the meeting of the panel, cost-saving measures were also discussed to make up for the losses due to the present circumstances. According to the estimates made by the university, ₹17 to 22 crore can be saved if the university conducts the examination of one semester.Cost cutting on electricity and other miscellaneous charges was estimated at ₹2 to 3 crore and ₹1 to 2 crore respectively. Besides this, ₹1 to 2 crore can be saved from administrative expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-expecting-upto-93-cr-shortfall-in-revenue-panel-says-no-to-salary-cut/story-6Etaar163rne772488abnN.html
14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Empanelment record : High court again puts Centre on notice on Khemka’s fresh plea||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday put the Centre on notice on a fresh plea of senior Haryana cadre IAS officer Ashok Khemka, who has demanded records pertaining to empanelment or exclusion of officers at the Centre be summoned. The fresh plea has been filed days after the HC had put the Centre on notice for August 24, in a plea wherein Khemka had challenged the central administrative tribunal (CAT) order dismissing his petition seeking direction to the Centre to consider his empanelment. As per Khemka, he was empanelled as joint secretary in December 2010 and applied for central deputation in 2011, 2012 and 2014, but was not appointed. Non-empanelment at this stage would lead to a cascading effect and he will not be able to serve at the Centre permanently, he had argued. In the fresh plea, the Haryana IAS officer says that on June 8, he had sought information under RTI to give names of all IAS officers who had been given relaxation against empanelment guidelines for evaluating their suitability for inclusion in the panel of secretary/additional secretary, but the information was denied. Then again on July 9, the information was sought to give names of all IAS officers who after April 2016 were excluded from consideration for evaluating their suitability for inclusion in the panel of secretary/additional secretary because of non-fulfilment of guidelines, but it too was refused. Hence, no information was produced to substantiate that despite him being empanelled at the post of joint secretary in 2010 and being placed in the offer list in 2011 and 2012, why his appointment never fructified. “The arbitrariness of the Union in meeting out sweeping relaxations to others unaffected by any hardship, whilst not applying mind on the petitioner’s repeated pleas demonstrates severe hardship, reeks foul. Therefore, it is essential for the determination of the present petition to summon the records,” the fresh application filed by him says. The officer also wants a complete list of the posts for which he was shortlisted in 2011 and 2012 for the appointment as joint secretary and recommendation/decision by the civil services board and the appointment committee of the cabinet. He also wants the Centre to supply the record to the court as to what were recommendations/decisions of the civil services board and the cabinet committee for his appointment as joint secretary in 2014. The notice on the fresh plea has been issued for August 24 too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/empanelment-record-high-court-again-puts-centre-on-notice-on-khemka-s-fresh-plea/story-hejq3QjJb7pL9kSOLNdk2I.html

One of them is the driver of the pilot vehicle in the CM’s motorcade, while the other is a gunman, officials said. They were part of the security squad during the chief minister’s travel from Kangra to Jwalamukhi on August 7 and then moved to Una. Thakur’s Una tour was cancelled so both of them joined back duty in Shimla. The chief minister was on a tour to Kangra from August 6 to 8. The health authorities have now started contact tracing. BJP workers had flouted social distancing norms during the chief minister’s visit. The party workers had gathered in large number at places the CM visited during his tour and many of them were not even wearing masks. Veteran BJP leader Shanta Kumar had advised the chief minister to avoid field visits and follow social distancing norms strictly. Besides the two security personnel, two new Covid-19 patients were reported in Shimla. A youngster admitted at Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, tested positive, while a migrant labourer from Bihar was found infected with coronavirus in Rohru sub division.

Ten people tested positive in Kinnaur were primary contacts of a Covid positive couple back from Delhi. The infected people had attended the last rites of a family member of the couple on August 2. The couple had returned from Delhi in the first week of July and tested negative after completing quarantine. They tested positive when a retest was done two days ago.

14-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Poetry, in the time of job loss||He lost his job in April. Because of the coronavirus pandemic. Saquib Hussain, 28, was an online strategist working for a multinational company.Even so, he is feeling very excited these days. This Friday, he has a visa-related appointment with the embassy of Ireland. If all goes well, he will be flying to Dublin for his Master’s in September.“It will be my first trip outside India,” says the gentleman calmly, while speaking on WhatsApp video from the isolation of his windowless basement studio in Gurugram’s DLF Phase 3.Meanwhile, Mr Hussain isn’t taking the job loss personally, though he does feel bad for his team as well as for his team leader—they were all told during a post-lunch meeting in the office that their contract wouldn’t be renewed, with an assurance that they would be contacted in the future. “My Master’s was already planned. The firing gave me a few extra days as a break to do the things that I really like.”Such as reading and writing poetry.Mr Hussain is fond of Mirza Ghalib, Faiz Ahmad Faiz (in fact, he is holding a copy of Faiz’s verses right now), Gulzar and many others including Rahat Indori, who died a few days back. “Rahat Indori saab had a great stage presence, and had that magical ability to swiftly earn the wah-wahs and claps from the audience.”Mr Hussain writes poems in Urdu but pens them in English alphabets “because my written Urdu is very bad.” Blame his “English medium background.” Indeed, if it weren’t for Fasiha Jabin, his mother, he wouldn’t have developed a taste for Urdu, and poetry, at all. Nobody else in Mr Hussain’s family, except perhaps for his younger sister Varisha, has a pulse for poetry “but Mumma is a great poetry lover... she seems to have read almost all the poets and can recite verses by great many including Tulsidas, Kabir and Rahim.” He says his mother often tends to suddenly break extempore into a verse or two, spurring him to Google immediately the poem and its author. She lives in Kolkata, where Mr Hussain grew up, with his father, a physician.Today, Mr Hussain agrees to share one of his poems, entitled “Muaafi”, with us. He wrote it at a time in his life “when I was emotionally into pieces due to a series of unexpected, unexplainable and untimely events, and a few months before I had finally reached out to a therapist for help.” This poem, he says, keeps him going. He himself translated it into English.Forgive, and ask for forgiveness.Forgive him, but forgive yourself first.Forgive, for he’s your own.Bid him adieu, if you may.Or hug him.But first, forgive him.Forgive him as it makes us feel humane,And the forgiven feels fortunate.And, if you want to be the bigger man?If you want to be the bigger man,forgive him, even before he asks you to.Forgive him, for you have His light in you.Forgive him, for he may feel a li’l blessed too.Forgive him, for anger is forbiddenand grievance is anger’s ally.Forgive, for there is helplessness,Responsibilities and humiliations for all of us.Forgive, for you both need peace,Forgive, for someone else may have forgiven you.Even if they didn’t, you do.As you are grateful for the empathy in you.Forgive, for lately sleep is expensive and worry’s quite a bargain.Forgive, for life has become smaller than,while we became bigger than life itself.Forgive, for it’s ego’s cure.Forgive, for may be, may be this legacy lives on.Forgive, for Ghalib once saidforgiving and asking for forgiveness makes life easier.Forgive and ask for forgiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-poetry-in-the-time-of-job-loss/story-NKaSuJ7ZUf9iawUJRszmnO.html

14-08-2020||Mumbai||0.42% of 3 lakh recovered Covid patients donated plasma: FDA||Despite repeated appeals by the state government, till August 5, less than 1% of the three lakh recovered Covid patients from Maharashtra donated blood plasma for convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) for the patients. Health experts said cured patients refuse to return to hospitals to donate plasma due to the fear of contracting the infection again. Individuals infected with Sars-Cov-2— the virus that causes Covid-19 – develop antibodies as part of the body’s natural immune response to the foreign pathogen. This antibody invades pathogens and works to eliminate the novel coronavirus in patients.During CPT, these antibodies are infused into Covid-19 patients to help them fight the virus. Till August 5, 290,343 patients have recovered in seven divisions – Konkan, Nashik, Aurangabad, Greater Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Amravati – that account for 70% cases in Maharashtra. But only 1,236 units of plasma were donated, a mere 0.42% compared to the total number of recovered patients, according to the data provided by Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, actual number of donors could be far lower, as the data provided by FDA also includes donors who have donated more than once. “This is a new virus and people lack basic knowledge about the spread. Once they recover, they refuse to come back for donation. It is just like organ donation. Despite having lakhs of possible donors, donations are less than 1%,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). Of the seven divisions, the maximum number of donations is from Mumbai, with 662 units of plasma till August 5, of which 511 units have already been used. Mumbai is followed by Pune division, which has obtained 378 units, of which 266 have been used. Konkan region which covers Nalasopara, Thane and Navi Mumbai that fall under the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases among the seven. Despite this, the division has received only 34 units of plasma, even lower than Aurangabad (46), Nagpur (44) and Nashik (40) with relatively fewer cases. Dr Behram Pardiwala, internal medicine expert, Wockhardt Hospital, who has treated 20 patients through plasma therapy, said, “I haven’t lost a single patient who has been treated with plasma therapy. In the treatment of patients with Covid-19, timing is the most essential thing. If we can treat moderately ill patients in time with the therapy, the recovery rate can be 100%.” Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said they are trying to sensitize people through several awareness programs.“The response is better than at the beginning of the therapy (around May),” he said. At the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital, 189 units of plasma helped treat 174 patients. The success rate of the treatment is above 95% at the hospital. At Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, which is also known as Sion hospital, where more than 3,000 Covid-19 patients have recovered, is lowest on the list with only 10 units. Nanavati Hospital is the only private hospital, which has received 94 units of blood for plasma therapy, of which 93 have been used till August 5. Dr Rinku Bhatia, heading the blood transfusion medicine department at the hospital, said, “The response has improved in the past two months. People often refuse to come forward due to several myths attached to the infection. Some people believe that donating plasma will make them weaker and affect their immunity, which is completely wrong.” Bhatia added that due to low haemoglobin levels among women, the hospital often refuses their donation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/0-42-of-3-lakh-recovered-covid-patients-donated-plasma-fda/story-ygZFrybJ03RWGLKiHRUsRJ.html

14-08-2020||Mumbai||413 deaths take Covid toll to 19,063; state tally is 560,126||Maharashtra reported 413 more Covid-19 fatalities on Thursday, taking the state’s death toll up to 19,063, while 11,813 fresh cases pushed up the tally of infections to 560,126. Of the 413 deaths, 288 were from the past 48 hours, 74 from last week and 51 from the period before last week. Mumbai recorded 1,200 new Covid-19 cases, taking its tally of infections to 127,556. The city’s toll rose by 48 to 6,991. While cases in Mumbai have plateaued over the past month, Pune district, which comprises Pune City, Pune Rural and Pimpri-Chinchwad, remains the worst affected in terms of daily rise in cases and fatalities. On Thursday, Pune City reported 1,148 new cases, Pimpri-Chinchwad 848 and Pune Rural 396. The district’s tally is inching closer to Mumbai’s with 122,020 cases against 127,556. Mumbai has 19,314 active cases, while for Pune district, the number is 40,225. Thane district has 19,589 active cases. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) has continued to remain high, 3.4%, against the national CFR of 1.98%. According to a state health department report, which was submitted on August 10, Solapur city has the highest fatality rate of 7.12%, followed by Malegaon city (7.03%), Mumbai (5.51%), Malegaon (5.47%) and Nandurbar (4.96%).The rise in daily fatalities over the past few days and the state’s failure to bring down CFR has been a major cause for concern. In its letter to district and civic administrations, in the first week of July, the state health department had directed them to put in efforts to bring the positivity rate below 10% and fatality rate to less than 1%. “We have been able to reduce the CFR, although it is not as fast as at the national level. It is because of the monsoon and related ailments and the limitations our machinery is facing. We have been working tirelessly to bring it down. The local authorities have been told to concentrate on containment zones and increase tracing for high- and low-risk contacts. It is true that there is fear among the people about hospitalisation and it leads to late referrals,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, director, directorate of health services.Neeraj Hatekar, Mumbai University economist, said the high CFR in Mumbai is because of various socio-economic compositions, while in other districts like Kolhapur, Sangli and Nandurbar the reasons vary. “There were hardly any elderly persons among the migrants who went back to their states in May. The elderly people with comorbidities stayed back in Mumbai. Similarly, the critical patients with comorbidities are referred to Mumbai, which leads to the high rate of fatality in the city. The rate may be high in Solapur, Sangli and Nandurbar for some other reasons like weak infrastructure,” he said. Hatekar, however, said CFR is high in some districts also because of the taboo about Covid-19. “People have fear about the infection in the areas where it is newly penetrated, like it was in cities initially. This leads to high fatality rate. Creating awareness and community participation may help authorities to get patients admitted to the hospitals early,” he said.The state, meanwhile, conducted 67,203 tests in a day on Thursday, and has a positivity rate of 17.58%. The recovery rate of Maharashtra stands at 69.8%, with the number of recovered patients rising to 390,958 after 9,115 people recovered on Thursday. The country’s recovery rate is 70.38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/413-deaths-take-covid-toll-to-19-063-state-tally-is-560-126/story-NgxODuFZIQ6W6EBZLaY0PP.html

Councillor Gurpinder Kaur’s husband, Baljinder Singh and police reached the spot and pacified the protesters.A resident Ankur said, “The road is full of potholes but the councillor has only made tall claims in the past and nothing has been done at ground level to improve the condition. Accidents take place due to deep potholes and it becomes difficult even to step out of our houses during rainfall, due to water accumulation.”Baljinder Singh said, “An estimate to reconstruct the road has been approved and the construction work would commence after the monsoon season.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-protest-against-dilapidated-condition-of-roads/story-hyzFTWulCjNE5GEE5FiOKP.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Fewer guests, police in PPE at Red Fort for August 15 celebrations||Fewer guests at the rampart, photojournalists tested for Covid-19,police personnel quarantined for 14 days before the event and those frisking guests at the gates donning PPE kits — the Independence Day celebrations at Red Fort on Friday will see many firsts, as the occasion reconciles itself with the needs of the Covid-19 era.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation, he will be surrounded by a fifth of the guests he was at last year’s celebrations, senior officials in the home ministry privy to the preparations said. The 140-odd guests will include cabinet ministers, senior bureaucrats and Supreme Court judges. No spouses have been invited, and a majority of the guests will be seated below the ramparts. “Last year, there were around 800-900 guests at the rampart, primarily because a lot of VVIP guests had come with their spouses. The number is much lower this year to ensure social distancing. Most guests will be seated below the rampart. Some may not come because of concerns about their health,” a senior home department officer said. HT had on August 5 reported that the guest list for the At Home function on August 15 evening in the Rashtrapati Bhawan complex had been kept at a maximum of 90 — down from the normal gathering of 1,500 dignitaries. As per the protocol for the ceremony this year, there will be no spouses, no live food counters, no freedom fighters will be present, and no free interaction with VIPs. Even the number of photographers who will be at the ramparts has been capped, with just 10 to be in attendance, as against 80-90 last year. Further, on Wednesday, the government conducted RT-PCR Covid-19 tests for around 10 photojournalists who will be at the rampart in close proximity with the Prime Minister as he delivers his speech. A photojournalist from a foreign press agency, who asked not to be identified, said, “For some of us who will be at the rampart, we were told it was mandatory to take the test. But for our colleagues who will be positioned elsewhere within the Red Fort complex, it was not compulsory to take the test. I have taken the test and am told the results were negative.” The tests were conducted at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. Around 350 police personnel, of which around 100, who will form the guard of honour that Modi will inspect, are already in 14-day-quarantine at a police complex in Delhi, since August 1. Until Friday evening, the national capital had 10,975 active Covid-19 cases. Till date, the city has reported 149,460 cases. Of them, 4167 persons have died, while 134,318 have recovered from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fewer-guests-police-in-ppe-at-red-fort-for-august-15-celebrations/story-NCWIPUhm4nqEBJ7DVL9NaJ.html

The pilots urged Puri for a meeting in the interest of passenger safety.In their letter written to Puri by the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) and Indian Commercial Pilots Guild (ICPA) unions of Air India on Thursday, the pilots highlighted flight safety and working conditions of pilots of Air India group companies and the recently-imposed policies implemented by the Air India board, imposing steep pay cuts that pilots said are implemented targeting pilots across Air India, Air India Express and Alliance Air. Pilots also said the Air India management has tried to burden frontline workers with massive pay cuts to safeguard the salaries and perks of senior management. The letter read, “Aviation policymakers are creating a caustic work environment without any reproach or consequence. It is paramount that the safety of the travelling public is not compromised. In this, you are our singular hope.”After the Kozhikode crash, that led to 18 casualties including two pilots, had recently also demanded the resignation of DGCA chief and demanded to replace him with a person from the aviation field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-group-pilots-seek-meeting-with-aviation-minister-to-discuss-challenges/story-PZDBXELRX6tYaE9oA6ECMO.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Dedicated channel for exempted international passengers at Delhi airport||International passengers arriving in Delhi by Vande Bharat flights may not have to stand in long queues to exit the airport anymore. After launching Air Suvidha, an e-service that allows passengers to fill self-declaration forms online and upload their non-Covid-19 reports to seek exemption from institutional quarantine, the Delhi airport operator has now set up a dedicated channel for exempted passengers to speed up their exit from the terminal.Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport announced last Friday that it has developed Air Suvidha—a portal wherein passengers can apply for an exemption from mandatory institutional quarantine.Before this facility was started, all international passengers were screened at the airport upon their arrival, were divided into groups of 20, and were escorted by Central Industrial Security Force personnel up to the triage area where Delhi government officials allotted them hotels for seven days of quarantine. “Because passengers started being exempted from institutional quarantine, it was decided that a dedicated corridor be set up to facilitate quick immigration and customs clearance. With the new set up, it does not take more than 2 to 2.5 hours for an international passenger to exit the airport, which is the usual time the procedure took even before the pandemic,” an official from the airport said, wishing not to be named. However, only passengers exempted from institutional quarantine can avail the new facility, the officer added.The officer said a dedicated channel will take the passenger out of the Terminal 3 building through the immigration counters and customs area. The passengers can then leave right away to quarantine at home. The Air Suvidha facility was started on August 8, under which passengers seeking exemption under five categories—pregnancy, death in the family, serious illness, accompanied by children below 10 years and tested negative for Covid-19 via a recent RT-PCR test—will need to fill up an e-form on the Delhi airport website, www.newdelhiairport.in, and submit supporting documents, including a copy of their passport, at least 72 hours before boarding their flight.A spokesperson from Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) said passengers who have applied in advance for online quarantine exemption through the Air Suvidha portal on Delhi Airport’s website will have to show their approved e-Exemption pass after arriving at the airport. “This will provide them with a hassle free experience, with digital pre-approved exemption from institutional quarantine. DIAL has created a special corridor at Delhi Airport which will help them walk out of the airport safely, avoid mixing with other passengers and save time as well,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dedicated-channel-for-exempted-international-passengers-at-delhi-airport/story-XjQ4wgrxGJ7sLtylpXwVTL.html

This was part of 11 other demands put forward by residents during a webinar with the top officials, including Noida authority additional chief executive officer Shruti (goes by first name) and officer on special duty Avinash Tripathi.The officials and residents discussed issues related to water supply after a complaint was filed with the Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari on the issue on August 8. Maheshwari had directed the water department officials to discuss the issues and take required measures. Residents sought to authoritys attention on 11 points -- purification of rainy well water; regular cleaning of water tanks; compulsory cleaning of water supply line; augmentation of water supply; end to leakages in pipeline; poor water pressure in sectors; repair of defunct tubewells; irregular water supply; future planning of supply; replace old water pipes; and rectification of total dissolved solids (TDS) quotient. “We have asked the Noida authority to focus on regular cleaning of supply lines, water tanks, augmenting supply and also improving quality of water as many areas still get muddied water. We hope that the authority will address our 11 demands,” PS Jain, president, Confederation of Delhi-NCR Residents’ Welfare Associations (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs, said. Residents said that quality of water in sectors 11, 12, 19, 20, 34, 50, 51, 52 and 53, among others, is poor. “There are times when the water supplied by the Noida authority is smelly and muddy. This happens either because the water pipelines have multiple leakages or the network is not cleaned properly. We have brought the matter to the notice to the authority in the past as well but it is yet to address the issue properly,” Arun Chauhan, a resident of Sector 34, said. Currently, the total demand for water in Noida is 332 million litres per day (MLD). The authority is supplying 240 MLD of Ganga water to residents and the remaining is procured through groundwater resources. The authority supplies 70% Ganga water and 30% groundwater in most areas of the city. “The authority should replace the rusty pipelines and faulty tubewells on a regular basis. We kept getting sand in out water and the issue persists despite complaints,” Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Sector 12, said.OSD Tripathi said the authority will address all the grievances raised by residents.“We have assured the residents that we will take all measures to improve the quality of water and also address their grievances. We will ensure regular cleaning of water storage tanks, pipelines and also work on the constructive suggestions to further improve the supply. However the authority already does the supply network regularly. But the suggestions made by the residents will be looked into,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-complain-of-poor-quality-drinking-water-want-authority-to-address-their-11-demands/story-Kqkg7lpTao76yud4nbQZMN.html

14-08-2020||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar gets dedicated helpline for cybercrime||Victims of cybercrimes will soon be able to register their complaints with the police over the phone in Gautam Budh Nagar. It is one of the 18 districts in the state for which the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday released a dedicated helpline to deal with cybercrimes.“The helpline number (7839876650) will be activated soon. The state government has released helpline numbers for 18 major districts in UP. The idea behind the move is to have a more proactive approach in fighting cybercrimes. Complainants will be able to register their issues directly with the helpline. In case, victims approach police stations with their complaints, they will be redirected to the new helpline,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, crime.A cyber police station for Noida has been in the works for a while already and the new helpline number is one of the steps in dealing with cybercrime better, said the police. A special email address—cyber.ps.gbn@gmail.com— has also been set up for the purpose.Pandey said with the level of digitisation all around, cybercrime cases have been on the rise and it is important to nip such trends in the bud itself.“We have to be prepared from the start when dealing with cybercrime cases. We are working on developing a sophisticated infrastructure that will help us in cracking these cases. Fraud on the pretext of helping people with employment, or enticing them for lottery schemes are some of the most common criminal cases happening these days. Many kinds of frauds involving ATM cards also fall under the category of cybercrime and are rampant,” said Pandey.Police officers said that the increased pattern of cybercrime had continued during the lockdown as well with people resorting to illicit activities for additional income in case of job loss. However, the department did not have specific figures for any trends.In 2019, the district cyber cell had received 3,050 complaints related to various online frauds.

14-08-2020||Delhi||NGT approves penalties of up to Rs 1 lakh for causing noise pollution||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has cleared hefty penalties for violation of noise pollution norms, proposed by the Central Pollution Control Board, which may go as high as Rs 1 lakh. In an order dated August 11, NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel also ordered the constitution of a monitoring committee headed by retired high court judge SP Garg to ensure compliance of noise pollution rules in the national Capital. In a report submitted to the NGT on June 12, the CPCB had proposed penalties for various violations. Approving the fines, Goel said, “We are of the view that the compensation scale laid down by the CPCB for defaulters may be enforced throughout India. The CPCB may issue appropriate statutory orders for the purpose of being complied with in all States/UTs.”According to the CPCB report, a fine of Rs 10,000 would be levied for misuse of loudspeakers and public address system, besides seizure of equipment. Noise pollution from diesel generators of more than 1000 KVA capacity would attract a fine of ₹1 lakh and the equipment would be sealed. Noise beyond permissible levels at construction sites would invite a penalty of ₹ 50,000 and seizure of equipment. Permissible noise levels for residential areas is 55 decibels (dB [A]) during the day and 45 dB(A) at night. The standards for industrial areas are 75 dB (A) during the day and 70 dB (A) at night. The standard noise limit for silence zones such as hospitals and educational institutions during day time is 50 dB (A) and 40dB (A) during the night.The central board had also proposed heavy penalties for bursting firecrackers that cause sound beyond the permissible limits. A person can be fined Rs 1,000 for bursting crackers in a residential area and Rs 3,000 in a silence zone. The fine for the same offence in a public rally or procession would be Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 for residential and silence zones respectively. “In case of repeat violation within a fixed premise, the penalty will be doubled to ₹20,000. More than two violations will cost the defaulter, a penalty of ₹ 1 lakh and sealing of premises,” the CPCB had proposed in its report. Senior CPCB officials did not offer a comment, saying the anti-pollution body had submitted the detailed report to the NGT.Currently, the use of loudspeakers or playing loud music at weddings, events and restobars is not allowed beyond 11pm and can result in confiscation of equipment, a fine of upto ₹ 5,000 as well as imprisonment up to 5 years, depending on the gravity of the violation under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000. With regard to the constitution of a monitoring committee in Delhi, the NGT said besides the retired HC judge heading the body, it may also have representatives from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Delhi Police and the Delhi chief secretary as its members. “The committee may seek assistance from experts or other public institutions and submit a report before the next hearing,” Goel said in his order. The NGT will hold the next hearing on April 15,2021. In a report submitted on August 6 to the tribunal, the DPCC had stated that 26 new noise monitoring systems have been set up in addition to the existing five at various locations, including residential, commercial, industrial and silence zones. However, the DPCC had said that except for industrial areas, noise levels had exceeded the day and night permissible limits at all other locations. Omesh Saigal, former Delhi chief secretary and a petitioner in the matter of noise pollution, said, “It is an important step and may create a deterrent. But the important bit is the enforcement of the order. Each time an order is passed, it lacks enforcement. If implemented well, it can create public consciousness that noise pollution is actually harmful for health and help bring a positive change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngt-approves-penalties-of-up-to-rs-1-lakh-for-causing-noise-pollution/story-st7WrjrfXQin7jzuvFPjdL.html

On August 11, Kashyap, through his counsel Rajeev Tiwari and advocate Vimal Tiwari, sought interim bail stating that he needed to appear for the examination. They contended that Kashyap had been falsely implicated.In response to the court’s query for a status report, the superintendent of the Mandoli jail informed the court that the investigating officer had confirmed that Kashyap had to write an exam on August 14. The superintendent said that they would facilitate him to do so.The crime branch had, on June 25, filed a charge sheet in a Delhi court regarding the murder of 22-year-old Monis, a daily wager, who was waylaid on Brijpuri Road and beaten to death by a mob on February 25.The mob had also set several private and public properties on fire. Investigators arrested and charged seven persons.“All seven of them have been charged for rioting, murder, arson and criminal conspiracy,” said a senior police officer associated with the probe, requesting anonymity.Kashyap was arrested on April 1. Advocate Rajeev Tiwari, Kashyap’s counsel, said that his client was arrested on the testimony of a planted witness and he would soon file a discharge application in the court.“My client has been arrested based on the statement of an eyewitness Shashi Kant, who allegedly saw the incident take place from his home situated quite a distance away. However, even if he had been on the road, nothing beyond 800 metres would have been visible. Also, the road is curved. There is no chance of my client being involved in the murder,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-court-permits-riot-accused-to-write-du-exam-in-jail/story-wP9nL9NEfRqmYBg5lSpujJ.html
14-08-2020||Delhi||Part of Bhalswa landfill collapses after rain, 3 waste-pickers hurt||Three waste-pickers were injured when a section of the Bhalswa landfill in north Delhi collapsed on Thursday morning after overnight rain -- sending a grim reminder of the 2017 Ghazipur dumpyard collapse that claimed two lives. Civic officials said the injured persons were immediately taken to hospital. Two were discharged within a few hours while the third one was undergoing treatment.Ira Singhal, spokesperson of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said a small portion at the back of the landfill collapsed in the morning due to overnight rain. “Three waste pickers were trapped in the slide at Bhalswa. They were all taken to hospital. Two have already been discharged. No personal details of them are available,” she said. The Bhalswa landfill site is an open dumping ground near GT-Karnal road. Created in 1984, it is spread over 70 acres. Till October 2019, the landfill had attained a height of 65 metres, eight metres less than that of Qutub Minar. It had reached its saturation point in 2006 but the landfill still receives about 2,100 metric tonnes of mixed waste every day. More than 80 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste (old solid waste material) are dumped here.The civic body had last month claimed to have reduced the height of the landfill by 12 metres by processing legacy waste with the help of 15 trommel machines. The officials said nearly 5.8 lakh tonnes of legacy waste had been segregated and processed till July 2020.Vikas Goel, leader of opposition in the north corporation, blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party, which rules Delhi’s three civic bodies, for the accident. “Three people were injured and 2-3 livestock were trapped in the debris. Had the portion of the landfill collapsed on the road, it would have led to serious casualties. The BJP is responsible as it failed to devise a permanent solution to the problem of dumping of waste at the landfill. The mayor of the corporation should take moral responsibility and resign,” Goel said.Responding to the allegations, north mayor Jai Prakash said the municipality was making an effort to reduce the height of the landfill by segregation of waste. “A small portion of 15 metres in length at the back of the landfill had collapsed. No casualty was reported. We are concerned about the landfill and that’s why we have deployed 15 trommel machines to segregate and process 4,500 metric tonnes legacy waste every day. By this process, we have reduced the height of the landfill by 12 metres in nine months,” the mayor said.In September 2017, two people had died and several others were injured when a huge portion of the Ghazipur landfill in East Delhi had collapsed, sweeping away motorists on a nearby road into a canal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/part-of-bhalswa-landfill-collapses-after-rain-3-waste-pickers-hurt/story-pWb7e92ZvWhWoXQoPfsZRN.html

Revisiting the memories on the occasion of what is now the centenary year of India’s “Olympic Games debut”, the Pune District Amateur Athletic Association (PDAAA) and Deccan Gymkhana felicitated Olympians from the city at the Deccan Gymkhana on Thursday. Rekha Bhide-Mundphan , hockey (Moscow Olympics, 1980), Manoj Pingale, boxing (Seoul Olympics, 1988) and Balkrishna Akotkar, runner (Tokyo Olympics, 1964) graced the occasion. Recounting the events leading up to India’s participation at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, the PDAAA stated that it happened soon after the First World War. It was industrialist Sir Dorabji Tata, who requested the governor of the time, Bombay Presidency’s Sir George Lloyd, to ensure permission for the athletes from London. On November 8, 1919, the Indian Olympic Association was formed at the Deccan Gymkhana. Sir Dorabji Tata was elected its first president. A selection tournament was held from April 1-8 in Mumbai, and in Pune, from April 23-24. “It was a great era when the Indians started to participate in the Olympics. In our time we on our own created a ground to practice. India today is on the right path of surging ahead as far as the Olympics go,” said Balakrishna Akotkar. Rekha Bhide-Mundphan added, “I am thankful to PDAAA and Deccan Gymkhana for felicitating us and during the time of corona if given a chance I am ready to serve society in whatever way the government requires.” Manoj Pingale, who runs his academy in Kondhwa, aims to produce an Olympic medallist from the city. “I am training young boxers very hard and it is my dream to give the city one Olympian,” Pingale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/100-years-of-india-at-the-olympics-deccan-gymkhana-honours-punekar-olympians-in-memory-of-how-it-all-began/story-WEEBy7LeC9VGUnaFrtvxRI.html

The victim is 42 years old and the accused is from Kerala. According to the police, the accused identified as Rahul Srivastava got in touch with the victim in one of the WhatsApp groups related to fashion industry. He promised her a role in film industry and asked her to meet another person named Sameer at a hotel in Salunke Vihar. After the meeting, the accused told the victim that Sameer was inclined to offer her a role in the industry. However, he laid a condition that she will have to appear for a screen test before coming to Mumbai for the final audition.Inspector (crime) Mahadev Kumbhar of Kondhwa police Station, the investigating officer in the case, said that during a video call with the victim, Srivastava clicked pictures and later morphed them. “He asked her to have physical relationship with him which she refused. He even told her that he would circulate those pictures on the social media which she ignored. Later, the accused circulated one of the pictures in the common WhatsApp group after which she exited the group and blocked her number. She also lodged a case against him at the police station,” he said. However, he did not stop his act and kept sending obscene messages on WhatsApp and other social media platforms, police said. The police have invoked Information Technology (IT) Act, IPC 354(molestation), 354 A (sexual harassment), 354D ( stalking ) and IPC 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/youth-in-pune-booked-for-circulating-obscene-pictures-of-a-fashion-designer/story-eSdpFX49Dd7OA51xOothxJ.html

14-08-2020||Chandigarh||Solar-powered water pumps offer ray of hope for Spiti’s farmers||Solar-powered water pumps have come as a ray of hope for tribal farmers of the remote Spiti valley of Himachal Pradesh that otherwise offers limited livelihood options due to the harsh climate and inhospitable terrain. The cultivated fields in the valley are situated along nullahs and the Spiti river and many farmers still depend on rain-fed agriculture. Besides barley, the agriculture department has encouraged green pea production since the ’80s. Realising that age-old farm practices are not enough to meet the requirement of expanding families, farmers have begun to adopt new agriculture techniques. Since electricity supply in the region is erratic, most farmers rely on diesel generators to irrigate fields. With fuel prices on the rise, it is a drain on their pocket and the pollution caused by operating such pumps is also an environmental concern. Tandup Chhering, 45, who has been farming for 25 years at Sichling village in Spiti, says he bought a diesel-operated pump to irrigate his fields but found it difficult to meet the cost of running it. A diesel pump costs Rs 30,000 and running it comes up to Rs 2,000 a day. He shared the concern with the agriculture department that advised him to install a solar power water lifting pump under the Pradhan Mantri Kusum scheme, which provides subsidy up to 90% for installing such pumps that range from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Dorjey Tandup, a farmer from Kaza village, is among 27 farmers who have installed solar-powered pumps. “The solar pump is easy to operate and it has reduced irrigation cost. Fetching diesel in jerrycans and carrying them to the fields was difficult,” he says. State technical education and tribal affairs minister Ram Lal Markanda, who represents Lahaul and Spiti segment and was the agriculture minister, also encouraged residents to avail benefits under the Central scheme. “The terrain and climate are hostile so we encourage farmers to adopt new techniques that will transform their lives,” he says. “Farmers are now showing interest in solar-powered pumps and the demand has gone up,” says agriculture development officer Subash Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/solar-powered-water-pumps-offer-ray-of-hope-for-spiti-s-farmers/story-wRU3dFKseGM5AyEKhvsgRM.html
14-08-2020||World||Flurry of India-China diplomatic activity in Beijing amid talks of dialogue deadlock||The Indian envoy to China Vikram Misri on Friday shared India’s views on the situation on the Sino-India border in eastern Ladakh with a senior officer of the Central Military Commission (CMC) as part of New Delhi’s ongoing efforts to reach out to different sections of the Chinese government to find a way to resolve the crisis.The CMC, which is headed by President Xi Jinping, is overall in-charge of the administration of China’s armed forces.Misri met Major General Ci Guowei, director of CMC’s office of international military cooperation and “briefed him on India’s stance of vis-à-vis the situation on the borders in eastern Ladakh UT (union territory),” the Indian embassy tweeted Friday afternoon.No other detail of the meeting was available.Misri’s Friday meeting with Ci comes two days after he met Liu Jianchao, who is the deputy director of the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) central committee’s foreign affairs commission office.The two meetings held in Beijing this week comes amid several rounds of diplomatic and military negotiations that have been held since June to de-escalate the situation along the line of actual control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The Indian embassy has not shared details about either of the two meetings – or for that matter why they were held as both the Communist party hierarchy as well as the Chinese government are aware of New Delhi’s stance on the border.The Chinese side too has been silent about the meetingsAt the top of both hierarchies -- of the CPC and government -- is President Xi Jinping, who is the general secretary of the CPC, and chair of the CMC.In 2016, Xi took on a new military title as the commander in chief of the military’s Joint Operations Command Centre.It was not immediately clear if new developments at the LAC led to the two quick meetings in Beijing or whether no progress in the diplomatic and military talks held so far led to them. The increase in Sino-India diplomatic activity in Beijing could also be seen in the backdrop of reports from India, which say that the disengagement process between the troops of the two countries is not progressing as expected with People’s Liberation of Army (PLA) troops not pulling back at certain friction points in the region.Chinese troops are said to have pulled back from the Galwan Valley, the site of the June 15 clash, and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of its troops has not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso, Gogra and Depsang as demanded by India, reports from New Delhi say.A Chinese foreign ministry to the Hindustan Times this week said the “At present, the two sides have disengaged in most of the border areas and will continue to coordinate and consult through military and diplomatic channels to further ease the tension and maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.” the statement in Mandarin said.It has been more than a month since the formal process of disengagement began between the two neighbours, scarred by the deaths of soldiers after decades of no casualties along the disputed boundary.The graded disengagement began on July 6, a day following a conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councilor Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area. Until now, diplomatic talks have been held under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs while military talks have been headed by major general-level officers from both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flurry-of-india-china-diplomatic-activity-in-beijing-amid-talks-of-dialogue-deadlock/story-LR2gZI3MKcISYQ8eILUBQL.html

ISKP leader Aslam Farooqi, a Pakistani national with links to LeT and Pakistan’s Tehrik-e-Taliban was arrested by Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security along with 19 other terrorist cadres on April 5.Af-Pak watchers say that ISKP units in Kabul and the border province of Nangarhar are already under the firm control of former HQN commanders and Sirajuddin Haqqani, Deputy leader of Taliban, who are launching attacks on Afghan capital. Besides being part of the intelligence and reconnaissance gathering network, ISKP cadres are also attacking Kabul in tandem with the HQN group.Also read: Pakistan proxies in fight to the finish in Afghanistan, but India too needs to prep | AnalysisThe HQN’s influence in ISKP is not only restricted to the cadres joining the outfit but also transcends into various other levels such as leadership control, military and intelligence commissions and district levels Emirs of the global terrorist group. The ISKP is currently divided into three factions - Aslam Farooqi, Mauvviya and Imam Bukhari.However, the attempt to take over ISKP by the Haqqani Network with the help of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is not without its own set of challenges. The three factions are apprehensive of the Rawalpindi-backed group and are vehemently resisting the Haqqani Network’s effort to join the ISKP in Afghanistan.The ISI, however, is helping the HQN try to open channels with the ISKP’s Imam Bukhari faction to bring it within the fold of “Khilafat-e-Islami Khorasan” and maintain strong operational cooperation.“The HQN take over of ISKP could be a game-changing development as it will create a mega terror group of the Al Qaida variety with its handlers based in Rawalpindi getting Pakistan deniability of any attack in Indian sub-continent or in the west,” said a senior counter-terror official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/backed-by-isi-haqqani-network-is-making-a-game-changing-move-in-afghanistan/story-LZG67eCHjGiDazcFEXwVpO.html

14-08-2020||World||Launching frugality drive, Chinese President Xi calls for ‘sense of crisis’ on food security||China is mulling mechanisms to prevent wastage of food days after President Xi Jinping called the amount of food wasted in the country “shocking and distressing”.Xi’s renewed call for the “clean plate campaign” comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has battered the Chinese economy into contraction this year, and the worst floods in years impacting rice production areas in China.Chinese official media, Xinhua, quoted Xi calling the issue of food waste “shocking and distressing” and said it was important to “…maintain a sense of crisis regarding food security”.The phrase “sense of crisis” about food also recalls the time of Chinese leader Mao Zedong in the early 1960s when the country was ravaged by famines.Beijing, however, has said that despite the twin problems of epidemic and floods, the agriculture sector has yielded “bumper harvests” this year.Catering groups, reports said, responded to Xi’s call by embracing a so-called “N-1 policy” -- urging customers to order one dish fewer than the number of diners at a table. No new national statistics is available about food wastage in China but a 2018 report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said consumers wasted 17 million to 18 million tons of food served in big cities in 2015.The amount wasted could have fed 30 million to 50 million individuals or the total number of people living in South Korea, officials had then pointed out.Following the publicity given to Xi’s call, short-video platforms have begun to crack down on “competitive eaters”, many of whom waste or spit out the food they ordered.“Such shows have been condemned by many netizens and generated heated discussions on Sina Weibo. The related hashtag had been viewed more than 830 million times as of Thursday afternoon,” a state media report said.Xi had first launched a similarly titled campaign against food waste in 2013 but rather than the general public it focused on feasts and banquets hosted by Communist Party of China officials on government funds.Xi’s call on food waste, an editorial in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post pointed out also recalled Mao’s time during the Great Leap Forward between 1959-62“China’s leader has urged the country to maintain a sense of crisis about food security…It is a reminder of the Mao Zedong era when Chinese leaders, prompted by natural and man-made disasters, encouraged people to store food. It was a time of widespread hunger and starvation,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/launching-frugality-drive-chinese-president-xi-calls-for-sense-of-crisis-on-food-security/story-TJ004dwkrNczTiV0anaT3L.html
14-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Joe Biden’s campaign||In her first two days as Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris has fired off the campaign’s sharpest criticism of President Donald Trump’s shortcomings. She has vouched for Biden’s character on race and more. And the enthusiasm surrounding her historic candidacy has brought in a record $36 million, including contributions from 150,000 new donors.The campaign hopes it is just the beginning.With less than three months before the election, Harris is rapidly embracing her new role. Democratic operatives and Harris allies believe she’ll energize what has been a relatively quiet campaign that has often preferred to keep the attention on the turbulence of Trump’s White House. She’s already making a vigorous case for Trump’s defeat, allowing Biden to focus more on his own policy prescriptions and less on direct attacks.“We always look for surrogates and validators that help close the deal and can speak to voters who needed another reason to say, ‘Yes, I’m gonna support Joe Biden,’” said Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chair who also ran Al Gore’s 2000 campaign. “She fills in the gap.”Harris was known during the Democratic presidential primary for wearing Converse sneakers and dancing with staff and supporters in unscripted moments. Biden allies expect her to deliver enthusiasm among some Democrats who oppose Trump but aren’t yet energized to vote for a candidate they feel may be out of touch with their concerns.Harris’ “ability to connect” is part of what California Rep. Barbara Lee, who served as one of her campaign chairs, believes will help her deliver the campaign message to voters who may be otherwise tuned out.“She loves to dance. She loves to cook. She’s a person who does normal things that everybody does. They can relate to her,” Lee said.Still, Harris, the first Black woman selected for a national ticket, has faced her own criticism from young voters and progressives in the past, namely over her record on police misconduct as a district attorney and later California’s attorney general. Critics say she opposed key criminal justice reform measures, including police body cameras statewide, and didn’t address a number of wrongful convictions on her watch.But during her time in Congress she’s embraced greater reforms to law enforcement, particularly in recent months in the nationwide reckoning over racism sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. She has been a leading Democratic voice on the issue.Some progressives still point to Biden’s past support for the 1994 crime bill as reason to doubt his commitment to criminal justice reform. And Harris herself was a critic of Biden’s record on race, notably assailing him during a primary debate for previously opposing federally mandated busing. But Harris signaled Wednesday that she’ll offer a strong defense of Biden’s record on race.During her first appearance with the former vice president, she said Biden “takes his place in the ongoing story of America’s march towards equality and justice” as the only person “who’s served alongside the first Black president and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate.”Biden campaign officials see her as a strong messenger against Trump, pointing to both her vigorous criticism of the Republican president during her primary campaign, when her pledge to “prosecute the case” against Trump won her support, as well as her sharp comments Wednesday. She said Trump “cares more about himself than the people who elected him” and accused him of “making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve.”Brian Brokaw, who ran Harris’ campaign for attorney general in 2010, said her questioning of Trump officials during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings hints at the case she’ll make against him on the campaign trail and during the vice presidential debate with Mike Pence.“No one should forget that she had cut her teeth in the courtroom,” he said. “Anybody who has been on the receiving end of the Kamala Harris cross-examination, whether it’s a witness on the stand or Jeff Sessions or Bill Barr knows that if you’re in her crosshairs, it’s an uncomfortable place to be.”Biden’s allies believe a main Harris advantage is demonstrated by the Republicans’ struggle to settle on a line of attack against her. In the short time since she was announced, Trump has called her everything from “extraordinarily nasty” to “a madwoman,” from “phony” to “radical left.” On Thursday he said he had “heard” rumors that she is ineligible to run for national office because her parents are immigrants. She was born in Oakland, California, and there is no doubt she is eligible.Harris is already delivering for the campaign in a tangible way: with a record-breaking fundraising haul.While fundraising is traditionally one of the running mate’s top priorities, a number of donors said her presence would be particularly helpful for Democrats because of her connections in California and beyond. Through her nearly two decades in California politics, Harris built a network of deep-pocketed donors in Hollywood and the state’s legal circles.Andrew Byrnes, a California donor who supported Harris, then moved to Biden in the presidential primary, said he got about 50 messages from donors wanting to get involved after Biden selected her.Michel Kraut, a Los Angeles lawyer and major Harris contributor, said he’s already had donors asking him about putting together events in the area.“It allows Kamala’s nationwide fundraising machine to get reinvigorated,” said Kraut, who has already been raising money for Biden.“There’s this new energy that the person we wanted to be president and now is on the presidential ticket has created. It’s not just, “I’ll raise money,’ but, ‘I’ll be dedicated to do this.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-bringing-energy-dollars-and-more-to-joe-biden-s-campaign/story-zbvJqsUU5A5RlUdljBkxXL.html
14-08-2020||World||Heatwaves, fires, storms: Blame climate change for summer misery||It’s hot out. Cue the headlines showing yet another temperature record above the Arctic circle, fires deep in the Amazon, and more intense floods and droughts anywhere in between.Also look for the self-described rational skeptics, the eco-pragmatists, and other hyphenated attention-seekers pointing out how, yes, it’s summer in the northern hemisphere, how it’s been hot in the past, and how we need to look at hardnosed statistics rather than headlines and emotions.Let’s.Yes, there have been Biblical floods and droughts long before humanity began burning fossil fuels. It’s also true, of course, that modern societies are better prepared to weather these extreme events, and that some observed impacts are due to more people and their wealth having moved in harm’s way (sadly often supported by misguided government policies).But it’s precisely a closer look at statistics that tells us why even relatively small changes in global average temperatures are such a big deal.Climate is weather. Not literally, of course. Climate is the long-term batting average, while weather is what happens in any one baseball game. Climate is your personality, weather is your mood today. Climate, in short, is weather averaged.This chart from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows how the two are intimately linked.We see so many record hot temperatures precisely because global average temperatures have increased by over 1°C by now. Those relatively small increases in mean temperatures don’t just make hot weather a bit more likely. They increase the chance of hot weather extremes by a lot. Add more temperature variability to the mix, and the chance of extremes goes higher still.Heat kills. Whether the temperature outside is 21°C or 22°C (around 70°F or 72°F) makes little difference. The latter might even register as a bit more pleasant. Increase it to 32°C (around 90°F), however, and all sorts of bad things begin to happen. If you’re a New York City high school student taking the Regents exam, you’re suddenly over 10% more likely to fail.Hotter temperatures make workers and, with it, entire economies less productive. They kill crops. They kill animals. They kill people, especially the poor. One additional day above 32°C increases the chance of dying that year by 0.11%. And that’s in the United States.Indians are 5 to 10 times more likely to die because of extreme heat, driven by rural India. Relatively richer urban Indians have the same mortality rate from extreme heat as the average American, pointing to the impact of extreme poverty. The rich adapt. The poor suffer.If climate change is your personality and weather your mood, climate change is making all of us moodier. That goes for increased road rage and car crashes on hot days as much as for increased police aggression, robberies, domestic violence, assaults, and murders. And heat on the baseball field leads to more pitchers hitting batters with errant balls as retaliation.These individual effects extend to increased peasant rebellions in Qing China, political instability in Medieval Egypt, ethnic riots in India, communal conflict in sub-Saharan Africa, and civil conflicts and political coups globally. The link between climate and conflict is strong, and unmitigated climate change all but ensures that it’s getting stronger.A few more sultry nights may well sound pleasant after hiding in (Covid-19-transmission-proof) air-conditioning all day. But those small increases in global averages go hand in hand with large increases in extremes. These extremes are not just unpleasant. They are all too often deadly.(Gernot Wagner writes the Risky Climate column for Bloomberg Green. He teaches at New York University and is a co-author of Climate Shock.

14-08-2020||World||UK’s Princess Anne to mark 70th birthday in low-key fashion||Queen Elizabeth II’s only daughter, Princess Anne, will be celebrating her 70th birthday on Saturday in a no-nonsense manner befitting her reputation in Britain.Whatever is planned for the princess, it will have to be a scaled-back affair because of the coronavirus pandemic. Not that the pandemic has stopped Anne.She’s been as busy as ever helping out the many charities with which she is associated, such as Save the Children. She also has been seen remotely assisting her mother get to grips with online video calls while the queen and Prince Philip are locked down at Windsor Castle.Mike Tindall, the former England rugby player who is married to Anne’s daughter, Zara, said the family had planned to mark his mother-in-law’s milestone in Scotland but that alternative arrangements had to be made.“I’m sure we’ll do something as a family to celebrate her 70 amazing years. She’s just an incredible woman in terms of how much work she can get through in the year,” Tindall told the BBC. “We will be doing something. As yet, I don’t know whether she knows, so my lips are sealed.”As part of the birthday celebration, Anne has been the subject of an ITV television documentary, more than a year in the making. It features unseen family footage and conversations with her daughter, her son, Peter Phillips, and with her husband, Vice Admiral Tim Laurence.Anne, whose formal title is Princess Royal, is widely admired for her work ethic, sporting pedigree - she competed as an equestrian in the 1976 Olympic Games - and for a particularly dry British sense of humor that she donned with such effect during a kidnapping attempt in 1974.Born on Aug. 15, 1950 at Clarence House, one of the royal family’s London residences, she is the younger sister of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and elder sibling to princes Andrew and Edward. She is currently 14th in the line of succession.Anne has plowed her own path since she was a young girl. She certainly hasn’t been the traditional sort of princess seen in fairy tales.“As a young princess, I was a huge disappointment to everyone concerned,” she once remarked. “It’s impractical to go around in life dressed in a long white dress and a crown.”While Anne is connected with more than 300 charities, organizations and military regiments, and regularly tops the list of royals carrying out the most public engagements, she is probably best known in Britain for her prowess in the saddle.She — and her horse Doublet — won the European Championship eventing individual gold medal in 1971, an achievement that earned her the admiration of the nation and the coveted BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.Sport has featured in her life ever since. As well as winning a place in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Anne has been a long-standing member of the International Olympic Committee. She also played a central role in London’s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, and was a member of the organizing committee.Zara Tindall inherited her mother’s horse-riding skills and won a silver medal in London as part of the British eventing team. Anne, of course, was the appropriate person to present Tindall with her medal..Before having children, Anne and her first husband, army Capt. Mark Phillips, survived an attempted kidnapping in 1974 while she was being driven to Buckingham Palace. When the armed would-be abductor, Ian Ball, told her to “Come with me for a day or two” because he wanted 2 million pounds, the princess replied it was not “bloody likely, and I haven’t got 2 million pounds.”Anne said she was “furious at this man who was having a tug of war” with her and for ripping her favorite blue velvet dress.That dry sense of humor will no doubt be on display Saturday, whatever goes on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-princess-anne-to-mark-70th-birthday-in-low-key-fashion/story-vxX3CqJRVDdlf1I23UGweP.html

Josephine was expected to strengthen over the next day or so, forecasters said.No coastal watches or warnings were in effect.Josephine was the earliest tenth Atlantic named storm on record, breaking the previous record of Jose, which formed Aug. 22, 2005, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard, Fay, Gonzalo, Hanna and Isaias have also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storms of their respective place in the alphabet. Only Hanna and Isaias this year have developed into hurricanes.Isaias killed two people in the Caribbean earlier this month. Several others across multiple US states were then killed when the storm made landfall in North Carolina and moved through the East Coast, leading to floods, tornadoes, fires, and widespread power outages.Last month, Hurricane Hanna slammed the Texas Gulf Coast with high winds and rains that flooded streets and knocked out power across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-josephine-weakens-slightly-in-atlantic-ocean/story-qqCxOJwUmN7CJrC2KEKPeI.html
14-08-2020||World||Covid-19: France, Netherlands added to UK’s 14-day quarantine list||Hundreds of thousands of British holidaymakers on Friday faced the prospect of having to go into self-isolation for 14 days when they return home after the British government reimposed quarantine restrictions on France following a recent pick-up in coronavirus infections.In an announcement late Thursday, the government said France is being removed from the list of nations exempted from quarantine requirements because of rising coronavirus infections, which have surged by 66% in the past week. The Netherlands, Malta, Monaco and the Caribbean islands of Aruba and Turks & Caicos are also being added to the quarantine list.The requirement to spend 14 days in self-isolation will apply to anyone returning to the UK after 4 a.m. local time on Saturday, a timeframe that may prompt many — particularly those who cannot work from home — to try to return before then.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision shouldn’t have come as a big surprise given that the government has consistently said it will continue to monitor infection rates when assessing its list of safe countries.“Unfortunately, this virus doesn’t play ball,” he told Sky News. “So people will look at their own situations. I think a lot of people would have been aware that this was a possibility in France and in some of these other countries.”Any rush back is likely to be most prominent in France, the second-most popular holiday destination for British tourists after Spain, which was put on the quarantine list last month. Travel companies are urging anyone considering a swift return home to check whether they will be able to do so.Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel rail service linking Britain and France, warned travelers that they may not be able to get back in time as services are heavily booked.John Keefe, Getlink’s director of public affairs, told the BBC that trains were “already pretty much fully booked” on Friday.He said there was “some possibility of adding additional trains in the off-peak periods” but insisted that would-be travelers have to check online before heading to the terminal.While the number of new infections in Britain is also rising, they are not thought to be increasing at the same pace as in the countries added to the quarantine list. The latest 14-day cumulative figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show 32.1 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in France, compared with 18.5 in the UK.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday that everyone “understands that in a pandemic you don’t allow our population to be re-infected or the disease to come back in.”The decision is a big blow to France’s tourism industry, which is heavily reliant on tourists from Britain.France’s junior minister for European affairs, Clement Beaune, indicated that that France would respond in kind.He said in a tweet that this is “a British decision that we regret and which will prompt a reciprocity measure, in the hope to get back to normal as soon as possible.”The UK’s quarantine approach has been criticized by many travel companies, some of whom are urging a change of tack, such as a ramp-up in testing of all arrivals in the country.Shapps said that proposal “isn’t quite as straightforward as it sounds” because many people may not test positive for the virus at the point of arrival but may end up doing so a few days later.“You need to have a system which is more accurate than that before you can say to people you’ve now been tested and you don’t need to quarantine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-france-netherlands-added-to-uk-s-14-day-quarantine-list/story-c5HUdxQlEaNJ8qv0YhJlKO.html
14-08-2020||World||UK relaxes more Covid-19 curbs, mask violators face £3,200 fine||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday announced more easing of restrictions from Saturday, allowing marriage receptions for up to 30 people and reopening casinos, skating rinks and beauty salons, but raised fines for those not wearing masks up to £3,200.The enforcement measures include doubling the fine to a maximum of £3,200 for those who repeatedly flout face covering rules, and new fines introduced for people hosting raves or other unlawful gatherings of more than 30 people.The relaxations are the same that were to come into effect two weeks ago, but were paused due to a rise in infections. Officials said: “The situation now appears to have levelled off”. As of Thursday evening, the UK had recorded 41,347 deaths and 313,798 cases.The piloting of a small number of sporting events to test the safe return of spectators will resume from August 15 with a view to reopening competition venues for sports fans, with social distancing measures in place from October 1.Johnson said: “Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus, but we must remain focused and we cannot be complacent. That is why we are strengthening the enforcement powers available to use against those who repeatedly flout the rules”.“At every stage I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional and that it relies on continued progress against the virus. Today, we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed”.“However, as I have always said, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus”.Business secretary Alok Sharma announced that new in-principle agreements had been reached to secure 60 million doses of the Novavax vaccine and 30 million doses of the Janssen vaccine, adding to the portfolio of promising vaccine candidates currently under trial.With Friday’s announcement, the UK has now secured access to six different vaccine candidates, across four different vaccine types, including the University of Oxford’s vaccine being developed with AstraZeneca, as well as agreements with the BioNTech/Pfizer alliance, Valneva and GSK/Sanofi Pasteur.Sharma said: “Today’s agreements will not only benefit people in the UK but will ensure fair and equitable access of a vaccine around the world, potentially protecting hundreds of millions of lives”.“While we are doing everything we can to ensure the British people get access to a successful vaccine as soon as possible, nobody is safe until we are all safe so global cooperation is absolutely critical if we are to defeat this virus once and for all”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-relaxes-more-covid-19-curbs-mask-violators-face-3-200-fine/story-FcRgOt0oxLC4DcDUrdLUHI.html
14-08-2020||World||Forced isolation may be the only way to stop resurgence of coronavirus||Flare-ups from Australia to Japan show the world hasn’t learned an early lesson from the coronavirus crisis: to stop the spread, those with mild or symptom-free coronavirus infections must be forced to isolate, both from their communities and family.In Australia, where Victoria state has been reporting record deaths, some 3,000 checks last month on people who should have been isolating at home found 800 were out and about. In Japan, where the virus has roared back, people are staying home but aren’t in isolation: 40% of elderly patients are getting sick from family members in the same apartments.The failure to effectively manage contagious people with mild or no symptoms is a driving factor behind some of the world’s worst resurgences. But lessons from Italy, South Korea and others that have successfully contained large-scale outbreaks show that there’s a tried-and-tested approach to cutting off transmission: move them out of their homes into centralized facilities while they get over their infections, which usually doesn’t require longer than a few weeks.“A laissez-faire approach naively trusting everyone to be responsible has been shown to be ineffective, as there will always be a proportion who will breach the terms of the isolation,” said Jeremy Lim, adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.Faced with a new cluster this week after 102 days without a locally transmitted case, New Zealand has quickly enacted this strategy, placing around 30 people -- including at least two children below the age of 10 -- into centralized quarantine.But other countries facing sustained spread like Australia and the U.S. are not broadly enacting the policy despite its proven track record. Their unwillingness -- or inability -- to do so underscores the challenges faced by liberal democracies whose populations are less likely to tolerate measures that require individual sacrifice for the greater good.Not at HomeThe existence of a large group of carriers who hardly feel sick is a unique feature of the coronavirus crisis, and a major factor that has driven its rapid spread across the globe. Unlike in previous outbreaks like the 2003 SARS epidemic, many infected people don’t feel ill enough to stay home, and so spread the pathogen widely as they go about their daily lives.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 40% of Covid-19 infections are asymptomatic.In Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged last year, mildly sick patients were originally turned away from hospitals and told to rest at home, given that the overwhelmed health-care system needed to tend to the most severe cases. But health experts soon found that these people would infect their family members and others as they moved around in the community, precipitating a deluge of cases.Bringing mild or asymptomatic patients to designated facilities -- re-purposed convention centers, hotels and stadiums -- for basic medical care marked a turning point in the city’s fight against the coronavirus. Simply separating them from healthy people halted the pathogen’s silent spread through the community.The strategy has since been used in Italy, Singapore and South Korea at the height of their own coronavirus outbreaks earlier this year. Faced with a resurgence last month, Hong Kong converted an exhibition center to accommodate mild Covid-19 patients and is building more such facilities.In New Zealand, the government put “a lot of thought” into enacting the policy, and is asking family members of confirmed cases to go into centralized quarantine with them if they require care, said director general of health Ashley Bloomfield.The approach is effective firstly because it prevents people from infecting family members in the same household -- over 80% of cluster infections in China cities were in households after mild patients were allowed to stay home, said a Lancet study. In Europe, the surge of household infections drove Italy’s Milan to start putting such cases in hotels, enabling the country to gain control over its outbreak in early May.Beyond household spread, the strategy is necessitated by a facet of human nature that’s been seen time and again across countries and cultures: left to their own devices, some people just won’t follow the rules.In Australia and Japan, infected people who’ve been told to stay home have gone out for a variety of reasons -- some can’t work from home and need the income, while others want to pick up groceries and supplies. One woman in Tokyo traveled cross country by bus after having her infection confirmed.“It is far better to be more aggressive in the short term with even mild cases than it is to allow such cases to slip under the radar,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong.Locked UpBut forcibly moving mild or asymptomatic patients into centralized facilities has been met with backlash in some countries where citizens are not as accepting of government directives. Some people might lose their jobs if they disappear for two weeks, or have caretaking responsibilities for young children or older parents where it’s unfeasible to be separated.“People would be wondering what on earth they’re doing locked up in a hospital,” said Stephen Leeder, emeritus professor of public health and community medicine at the University of Sydney. “From what I know about the Australian psyche, I don’t think it would go down all that well.”In places like Venezuela and India where conditions in quarantine facilities are poor, the prospect of being taken away has caused some to avoid being tested or to lie to contact-tracers for fear of being found positive, making the work of health officials more challenging.In an emailed response to Bloomberg News queries, the Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria said the government provides alternative accommodation for quarantine, but that these are for health workers “who may not be able to safely live at their normal address” and other vulnerable groups.Rather than forcing isolation on mild cases, authorities have locked down 5 million residents in Melbourne and are tightening restrictions until new cases come under control.Officials are using a combination of stepped-up checks and fines of A$4,957 ($3,550) to convince infected people to stay home, while repeat offenders risk a A$20,000 penalty in court. More than 500 military personnel are helping the police conduct checks on 4,000 households every day to ensure those who are supposed to be staying home are there.To be sure, aggressive and thorough contact-tracing and case follow-up have successfully contained outbreaks in countries like Germany without a centralized quarantine strategy. But these places relied on an army of efficient workers hunting down every chain of transmission, a resource not many governments have had time to build up.“The classic practice in public health is to identify, trace and quarantine,” said Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “But how that is carried out depends on popular sentiment and the country’s resources.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forced-isolation-may-be-the-only-way-to-stop-resurgence-of-coronavirus/story-tUjebmXyng5GKA58D0I9OP.html

The whistleblower has not been allowed to see his partner and sons, nor meet his lawyers in person, due to social distance restrictions.It even took months for the prison authorities to give him a pair of reading glasses and a radio receiver he had requested, Narvaez commented.He also recalled that when the extradition trial began in February in a London court, Assange was not allowed to sit with his lawyers, and was instead forced to watch the process from behind high walls made of glass panel.“The British judicial system has been particularly hard on Assange, and not just me, but many international lawyers think that he is not being granted the right to a fair trial,” Narvaez stressed.Asked about the new “superseding indictment” against the Wikileaks founder that the US prosecution made public even before formally presenting it to British court dealing with the extradition request, Narvaez called it a “publicity stunt”.“They [the US prosecutors] know they have nothing new. They just want to attract public attention,” he claimed.The US federal government charged Assange with 18 criminal charges related to endangering US national security by conspiring to obtain and disclose classified information.If the UK court consents to his extradition in the trial that is due to resume on September 7, Assange could be sentenced to 175 years behind bars.At the last administrative hearing held on July 27, Assange appeared by video link from prison for the first time in months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assange-will-never-have-chance-of-fair-trial-in-uk-us-ex-ecuadorian-consul/story-Se6ZGQDcac53EpexV0g5RL.html

But documents have emerged in the wake of the explosion that show the country’s top leadership and security officials were aware of the chemicals being stored in the city port.The blast has changed the face of the capital and forced the government to resign. Lebanon’s Parliament on Thursday approved a state of emergency in Beirut in its first session since the tragic explosion last week, granting the military sweeping powers amid rising popular anger and political uncertainty.Some 120 schools, used by 50,000 students, have been damaged. More than 1,000 of nearly 50,000 residential units were severely damaged, the UN report said.At east 13 refugees, including at least two Palestinians, were among those killed and more than 170,000 residents’ apartments were damaged, according to the UN report.Despite damage to the silos in the Beirut port, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said food shortages are not expected.The blast struck Beirut in the midst of a crippling financial and economic crisis, and the UN predicted people may have difficulties restoring or fixing their homes. But at least 55% of buildings assessed were rented, which may allow people to move elsewhere, the UN said.According to the world body the Beirut port is operating at 30% capacity and the Tripoli port in the country’s north, at 70%. That is allowing for food and goods to continue to flow. The World Food Program is bringing in a three-month supply of wheat flour and grains.The agency said however it is concerned about a surge in coronavirus cases, particularly as social distancing is relaxed during the widespread volunteering to help those affected by the blast and protests against the government and political elite.The government resigned on August 10 and the Cabinet remains in caretaker capacity. Protesters are demanding officials be held accountable for the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-explosion-178-killed-30-still-missing-says-united-nations/story-OUcI23qZWNV0ioPgAuNIyL.html
14-08-2020||World||New Zealand PM extends Covid-19 lockdown in Auckland by 12 days||Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern extended the lockdown of New Zealand’s largest city Auckland for 12 days as authorities try to stamp out the nation’s first outbreak in more than three months.Under the level 3 restrictions, people will be urged to stay home and consumer-facing businesses will be shuttered until August 26. Across the country, level 2 restrictions that include social distancing and gathering limits, will also be extended until the same day.The move is in line with New Zealand’s philosophy of “going hard and going early,” Ardern told reporters. To help people cope with the economic shock of the lockdown, a wage subsidy program and mortgage payment deferral scheme will be extended.After eradicating community transmission, New Zealand’s 102-day Covid-free run ended this week when an initial four new cases were detected in an Auckland household. Ardern responded to the fresh outbreak by putting Auckland, a city of 1.6 million people and a hub of commerce, into an initial three day lockdown and reimposed social distancing rules across the rest of the country.The prime minister said she will make a decision on whether to delay the Sept. 19 election within 48 hours.New Zealand recorded 12 new confirmed local cases of the coronavirus on Friday including 2 in the North Island town of Tokoroa. That takes the cluster, all linked to the Auckland outbreak, to 30, including one probable case. The nation now has 48 active cases, which includes 18 people who tested positive during the 14-day quarantine that’s mandatory for anyone returning to the country from overseas.While the origin of the outbreak is yet to be determined, the earliest case dates to July 31 with the infection of a worker at the Americold cold storage plant in the Auckland suburb of Mt Wellington, Ardern said.“We have found this outbreak relatively early in its life,” she said. Some 30,000 tests have been carried out this week, and the country has stockpiles sufficient for another 303,000 tests, she said.Businesses and investors are wary that an extension of the restrictions would stall the economic recovery that has been underway since a seven-week nationwide lockdown that ended in mid-May. The first lockdown -- a so-called alert level 4 -- saw manufacturing and construction closed, tipping New Zealand into recession for the first time in 10 years.“If this is just a scare and the alert levels are raised only briefly, then the economic implications are small,” said Dominick Stephens, chief New Zealand economist at Westpac in Auckland. “If New Zealand goes into another strict level 4 lockdown, the economic implications would be more severe.”Still, international experience shows that losing control of the virus would be much more damaging to the economy, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-extends-covid-19-lockdown-in-auckland-by-12-days/story-YNiw9gIXhmD7yTby0LvvJJ.html

Trump” to be published on Sept 8||NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Cohen’s memoir about President Donald Trump will be released Sept. 8 by Skyhorse Publishing, which confirmed the news Thursday to The Associated Press. The book is called “Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”“‘Disloyal’ is the most devastating business and political horror story of the century,” according to a Skyhorse statement shared with the AP. “It is a story that you haven’t read in newspapers, or on social media, or watched on television. These are accounts that only someone who worked for Trump around the clock for a decade — not a few months or even a couple of years — could know.”Earlier in the day, Cohen had released the book’s foreword, writing of his estranged former boss, “He wouldn’t mind if I was dead.” He did not list a publisher for the book and, as of midday Thursday, it was not listed on Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble.com.Cohen is completing the last two years of a three-year prison sentence at home after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress. He was released from prison in May amid coronavirus fears, only to be returned in July after making it known that he planned to publish “Disloyal.” The US government dropped its effort to silence Cohen late last month after an agreement was reached between government lawyers and Cohen attorney Danya Perry that lifted a ban on Cohen speaking publicly.Cohen’s charges stemmed from his efforts to arrange payouts during the 2016 presidential race to keep the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from speaking out about their alleged extramarital affairs with Trump, who has denied the affairs. He has said that Trump directed him to make the payments.Skyhorse has a history of taking on books by controversial public figures, including a memoir this spring by Woody Allen that had been dropped by Hachette Book Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michael-cohen-book-disloyal-the-true-story-of-the-former-personal-attorney-to-president-donald-j-trump-to-be-published-on-sept-8/story-hW7WuSijAQD9IP5h5LCSlI.html

The premier is seen as a steward of economic management and naming Kim Tok Hun to the post to replace Kim Jae Ryong could deflect blame off the North Korean leader for any hardships coming from a poor harvest.The official Korean Central News Agency report said “Kim Jae Ryong was relieved from the premiership.” Kim Tok Hun is a senior cadre who serves as the head of the parliamentary budget committee.“The North Korean economy is facing a serious challenge now and someone had to take political responsibility,” said Choi Kang, vice-president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “This looks like a precautionary measure to offset complaints from North Korean people.”Kim Jong Un said at a Workers’ Party politburo meeting that flooding has taken a toll but North Korea shouldn’t accept foreign aid because of the coronavirus risk, KCNA said. North Korea has said it doesn’t have any coronavirus cases -- a claim doubted by US and Japanese officials -- and placed Kaesong on lockdown last month after the former defector crossed into the country.The leader “decided to lift the lockdown of Kaesong city based on scientific evidence,” KCNA added, noting he also ordered measures to further support flood victims.North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month, as torrential rains threaten to wipe out farmland and the virus-damaged economy heads for what might be its biggest contraction in more than two decades. The flooding has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.Agricultural production is a key element of North Korea’s economy and flooding in its summer months has led to diminished harvest, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the state for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”In addition to damage to farmland, Kim’s decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade the state has, and could send the economy this year into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-replaces-minister-kim-jae-ryong-as-economy-hit-by-floods/story-HB5lJWe2WpZlCz84svNQrL.html
14-08-2020||World||TikTok and its employees prepare to fight Trump over app ban||TikTok and its US employees are planning to take President Donald Trump’s administration to court over his sweeping order to ban the popular video app, according to a lawyer preparing one of the lawsuits.The employees’ legal challenge to Trump’s executive order will be separate from a pending lawsuit from the company that owns the app, though both will argue that the order is unconstitutional, said Mike Godwin, an internet policy lawyer representing the employees.Also read: TikTok and WeChat expose big tech’s lack of innovation | OpinionTrump last week ordered sweeping but vague bans on dealings with the Chinese owners of TikTok and messaging app WeChat, saying they are a threat to US national security, foreign policy and the economy. The TikTok order would take effect in September, but it remains unclear what it will mean for the apps’ 100 million US users, many of them teenagers or young adults who use it to post and watch short-form videos.It’s also unclear if it will make it illegal for TikTok to pay its roughly 1,500 workers in the US, which is why some of them came to Godwin for help, he said. The order would prohibit “any transaction by any person” with TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance.“Employees correctly recognize that their jobs are in danger and their payment is in danger right now,” Godwin said.TikTok said in a statement last week that it was “shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process.” It declined to comment on Thursday on whether it is pursuing its own lawsuit.“We have no involvement with and are not coordinating on” the employee-led initiative, said TikTok spokeswoman Hilary McQuaide said via email. “We respect the rights of employees to engage in concerted activity to seek due process of law.” The Fifth and 14th Amendments to the US Constitution safeguard life, liberty and property from arbitrary government action lacking “due process of law.” Microsoft is in talks to buy parts of TikTok, in a potential sale that’s being forced under Trump’s threat of a ban.Also read: French privacy watchdog opens preliminary investigation into TikTokWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump’s TikTok and WeChat orders on Thursday, telling reporters he was exercising his emergency authority under a 1977 law enabling the president to regulate international commerce to address unusual threats.“The administration is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber threats and these apps collect significant amounts of private data on users,” said McEnany, adding that the Chinese government can access and use such data.TikTok said it spent nearly a year trying to engage in “good faith” with the US government to address these concerns.“What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,” the company’s statement said.Godwin said he was retained by Patrick Ryan, who joined TikTok from Google earlier this year as a technical program manager. Ryan posted a public fundraising pitch on GoFundMe this week to raise money for attorneys who can “fight this unconstitutional taking.” “This is unprecedented,” Ryan wrote. “And it’s frankly really uncool.” Unlike other Chinese tech companies targeted by Trump, such as telecom giant Huawei, TikTok’s widespread popularity among Americans adds a layer of complexity to its legal and political challenges. The looming ban has annoyed TikTok users, some of them Trump supporters like Pam Graef of Metairie, Louisiana.The 53-year-old fitness instructor found nearly instant TikTok fame after downloading the app this summer and posting a video of herself dancing frenetically in a kitchen as someone pretending to be her embarrassed daughter shouts that she’s doing it wrong. The video has nearly 3.5 million views.“I don’t want it to be banned. It’s just a blast,” Graef said. “It’s a way for me to promote my virtual training and virtual classes.” She said Trump won’t lose her vote over this, but she doesn’t understand all the fuss about the app’s Chinese ownership. “What are they gaining by spying on us?” Graef said. “We’re just doing stupid videos and having fun.” The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that, until late last year, the TikTok app was able to track users of Android phones without their consent by collecting unique phone identifiers in a way that skirted privacy safeguards set by Google. TikTok responded that the technique it used is a common way to prevent fraud and said it no longer collects the unique identifier.The company has repeatedly said that the way it collects data is typical for thousands of mobile apps. “We have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request,” said its statement last week.Trump’s actions follow the lead of India, which has expressed similar security concerns and earlier this summer banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps amid a military standoff between the two countries.Godwin said the employees’ legal challenge will be focused on worker rights, not on the national security claims underlying Trump’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-and-its-employees-prepare-to-fight-trump-over-app-ban/story-gNOeRkjgPgtrb4rtlrhpcL.html

This gave the South Asian community in the United States a reason to cheer.Harris came to the US as an immigrant from Tamil Nadu in India.Since her nomination, a lot is being said about Harris and her Indian roots. Now, an old video has resurfaced in which the senator is seen making dosa with actor Mindy Kaling, who also has Indian roots.The dosa-making was done at Kaling’s home in Los Angeles where the two women also bonded over their shared South Indian roots. It was posted on social media channels of Harris.As the video begins, Kaling starts off by talking about Indian spices kept in small jars which she said has been done by her father. Harris says she is reminded of her own home by seeing this and the dishes her mother used to make.Kaling talks about the long process to make dosa batter and introduces a readymade stuff available in the US market. Harris then makes a confession.“I have never made a dosa,” she says in the video.They also talk about the immigration stories of their respective parents. Harris made history on Tuesday as the first Indian-American and Black woman to run for vice-president. She has credited her Indian-born mother for inspiring her into a life in public service that led her to this historic moment.She appeared for the first time with Biden after he named her his running mate. “Don’t just sit around and complain about things,” Harris, 55, said her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would tell her and younger sister Maya Harris when they were growing up. “Do something.”Gopalan, who came to the United States from Chennai and was a breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009. But she has remained the most enduring influence in Harris’s life, the US senator wrote ahead of her failed White House bid in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-ve-never-made-a-dosa-after-her-nomination-kamala-harris-old-video-resurfaces/story-KYL1WvWXloMbMMozrwhl8K.html

The decision made amid this context by the Israeli authorities on suspending the annexation of the Palestinian territories is a positive step, which must become a final measure,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on late Thursday.The minister expressed hope that the Israeli-UAE agreement would also boost the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a two-state solution, which is “the only way to reach fair and stable peace in the region.”On Thursday, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalise their relations, and an agreement on the mutual establishment of embassies is expected to follow in the coming three weeks. In exchange, Israel said it would halt its plans to formally annex parts of the West Bank.Both ruling Palestinian movements, Fatah and Hamas, have already denounced the agreement.

14-08-2020||World||Covid-19 shaping up to be battle for years even with vaccine||The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be a challenge for years to come even with a vaccine, according to pharmaceutical and public-health experts.While a vaccine will provide some measure of protection to societies around the globe, the virus is likely to flare up from time to time and be constantly battled, much like the flu and other pathogens.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We know this virus is not going away any time soon. It’s established itself and is going to keep on transmitting wherever it’s able to do so,” Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, at the “How Covid-19 Is Reshaping the Global Healthcare Ecosystem” event hosted by Bloomberg Prognosis. “We know we have to live this this.”Humanity’s record against viruses is poor. Only one virus has been fully driven out of existence in humans – smallpox. The rest are managed, with brushfires stomped out when they flare up.“I think what’s realistic to expect is that with a combination of drugs and vaccines we can get to a stable place where the pandemic is manageable,” said Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan. He called the actual elimination of the virus “unlikely.”There are 29 different vaccines in human trials around the world, according to a World Health Organization report released Thursday. More than 20 million people have been confirmed infected around the globe, with at least 751,000 killed by the virus.While the rush to rapidly test vaccines has potentially cut years off of the time before one will be ready, a first round of inoculations will likely go only to health workers and high-risk populations, with the general public having to wait until sometime next year to get a shot.“The longer you wait, the more knowledge you’re going to have on the vaccine,” Narasimhan said. ”With reasonable confidence, we could have a safe and effective vaccine before the end of next year that could be used broadly.”Also read: Govt panel on Covid-19 vaccine protocol discusses delivery mechanismTwo of the furthest along vaccines are being developed by Pfizer Inc. and by the University of Oxford, which is working with drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc. But scientists working on the trials said it was important to collect a robust set of data rather than rush to look at early results.The Oxford vaccine is being tested in the United Kingdom in a 10,000-person trial that has signed up most of its participants. It’s set to run for as long as a year gathering results, potentially with an earlier look.“We don’t yet have clarity on the timelines for those trials,” said Sarah Gilbert, the Oxford professor who has led development of the vaccine. She warned against early looks into the trial -- a process called unblinding -- that can taint the results. “We can’t have multiple looks at the data,” she said.Pfizer said it, too, would not rush into an early look.“We won’t unblind the study too early,” said Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development. “If we are successful, yeah, we can declare success early.”With vaccines, which are given to healthy people, longer sets of data are crucial to find out how safe they are in the long term and how long protection lasts.“We won’t know until we follow patients in clinical trials, in particular the vaccine trials, for six months to a year,” said Novartis’s Narasimhan.Ongoing riskPandemics like Covid-19 are rare, occurring perhaps as infrequently as once in 200 years, said Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College London who advised the U.K. government on its early-stage response. Yet more new viruses and outbreaks are likely to appear as urbanization and deforestation bring humans and animals into closer contact.Over the past decade there have been an “increasing number of viruses and bacterial infections spilling over into humans,” said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. “As long as we have close contact between animals and humans we will continue to have spillover events. And we’re seeing that through urbanization, deforestation, having wet markets.”There are steps that can be taken to reduce the risks of future pandemics, mainly involving the reduction of human interaction with wildlife, Ferguson said. One of the big risks is killing game for food, along with sales in markets in Asia and Africa.“Frankly, stopping those we could reduce the risk, but not completely,” he said.While hundreds of vaccines are in development that could slow or even halt the coronavirus, that’s just one step along the way to protection. Covid has wreaked havoc in rich and poor countries alike, suggesting that public health systems have been found lacking even in countries with strong systems of care, according to Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization.The WHO has been heavily criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said the group failed the prevent the outbreak and is too politically close to China. The U.S. currently has one of the world’s worst ongoing outbreaks.“We haven’t invested in public health responses,” said Swaminathan. “The countries that have really responded well have done so because the political leadership took it seriously, took early note of what was happening, and relied on scientific expertise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-shaping-up-to-be-battle-for-years-even-with-vaccine/story-iOA3bVsavU4Qo1m26pbreK.html
14-08-2020||World||Jimmy Lai says he was arrested on ‘trumped up’ charges||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai said he was arrested on “trumped up” charges, pushing back against landmark national security legislation that has raised questions about press freedoms and the future of the democracy movement.“They’re trumped up. I can’t go further on the details,” Lai said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday morning. “Before any evidence, they just claimed and presumed that I’m guilty. This isn’t the way the law is. I should be presumed innocent. We have never supported the independence of Hong Kong.”He said Hong Kong’s future as Asia’s main financial hub was uncertain if there was no respect for the rule of law under the new security measures.“The future of Hong Kong is the future of any other Chinese city,” he added. “Without the rule of law, the international financial center will be finished.” He added that the law sent a “very negative” message to the business community in Hong Kong and overseas.Lai has the highest profile of more than 20 democracy activists so far arrested under the national security law, which bars subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. Hong Kong police on Monday arrested Lai along with his sons and senior executives of his media company, Next Digital Ltd., on suspicion of collusion under the security law imposed by China on June 30.Next Digital reversed an earlier decline to rise 32% as of 9:58 a.m. It declined Wednesday and Thursday after a 1,100% gain in the first two days of this week triggered a warning from Hong Kong’s securities regulator.The case has put new strain on already-fraught ties between the US and China, with President Donald Trump calling the arrest “a terrible thing” at a Thursday briefing. The Trump administration has slapped sanctions on senior Hong Kong officials including Chief Executive Carrie Lam and has led international condemnation of the law, calling it an attempt to crush Hong Kong’s political opposition.Reporters on Monday live-streamed a handcuffed Lai being led through the headquarters of his flagship Apple Daily newspaper. Its vocal criticism of the pro-Beijing establishment and support for last year’s historic protests helped make it a symbol of the press freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony.“We will persist,” Lai said of the newspaper. “There’s no doubt.”His arrest was part of an investigation into an online activist group that received more than HK$1 million ($129,000) in funding from overseas bank accounts, the South China Morning Post reported this week, citing unidentified people. Lai told Bloomberg Television that he had never given “one cent” to the protest movement and had no ties to prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong’s political party, which was disbanded as the national security law came into effect.More UncertaintyThe arrest drew calls among opposition supporters to buy Lai’s newspapers and stock in his company, fueling a 1,100% surge in its share price and prompting the market regulator to urge investors to “exercise extreme caution.” The Securities and Futures Commission has requested brokerages’ transaction records and client information related to Next Digital’s shares, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported Monday, citing unidentified brokers.The law has injected an additional measure of instability to Hong Kong as a fresh challenge to businesses in Asia’s main financial hub, which was once known for predictability more than protests. The city’s economy had faltered even before the law was enacted in June, following months of often-violent rallies and turmoil fomented by Covid-19.A survey released Thursday by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong showed almost half of businesses reported feeling pessimistic about the city’s business prospects, while others were almost equally worried about surprise retaliatory moves from the US.One member company described being “caught between a rock and a hard place,” with mainland Chinese clients unwilling to work with American firms and American firms unwilling to work with companies located in Hong Kong. “Frankly impossible to do anything right now, until there is clarity,” the respondent said.Protest EvolutionLai said Hong Kong’s protests have been curtailed by the new security law, but that pro-democracy supporters would find new ways to continue supporting the cause.“The protest movement has been reduced quite a lot,” he said. “A lot of young people have left or are about to leave. And some of the pro-democracy movement people have stepped aside.”“Those that remain are still very strong. And more people are reacting to the national security law in a different way,” he said. “I think the movement will go on. I don’t know how they’re going to go on. We can no long have 2 million people walk on the street. Are people going to scatter into small groups? I think in the future there will be innovation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jimmy-lai-says-he-was-arrested-on-trumped-up-charges/story-Z8eXDUlmv65ysdaNgPbcFM.html
14-08-2020||World||US, China to discuss trade deal amid Covid-19 disruption||Negotiators from the United States and China will on Saturday discuss the “phase one” trade deal signed earlier this year -- before the coronavirus slammed the world economy and relations between the two economic powers took a turn for the worse.Washington and Beijing’s January deal represented a partial truce in their months-long trade war, and obligated Beijing to import an additional $200 billion in American products over two years, ranging from cars to machinery to oil to farm products.But purchases of those goods have been lagging, while US President Donald Trump has stepped up rhetoric against China ahead of what’s expected to be a tough fight for a second term in the November elections, raising questions about the deal’s fate as well as the possibility of a second phase of the truce.“The outcome of the trade talk will signal if both sides are willing to continue to keep the deal, which will signal whether the relationship will deteriorate further,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at financial services giant ING. Neither the US nor the Chinese government confirmed the talks to AFP but the deal mandates meetings every six months after it takes effect, which would be Saturday.Even with tensions high and both countries reeling from the shock of Covid-19 -- which has caused a historic contraction in global growth and trade -- analysts don’t expect the talks to produce major changes in the agreement. And if anything does happen, Washington would be the catalyst.“Until now, China has been relatively passive and the United States has been relatively proactive,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at ANZ bank. “In my opinion, there shouldn’t be much change coming from China in terms of trade, cooperation or opening up the market, the key still lies in the US side.”Tensions worseningThe comity of the deal’s signing in Washington has been overshadowed in recent months as Washington and Beijing have traded barbs over who is to blame for the coronavirus, which first surfaced in China.Also worsening tensions are China’s crackdown on Hong Kong, which Washington has responded to with sanctions, and the Trump administration’s order to bar Chinese internet giants TikTok and WeChat from operating in the US.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in June said China would follow through on its commitments while Washington eyes a second deal, but that same month a Chinese State Council counsellor said the Covid-19 pandemic has had an “impact” on the deal and that relations between the countries are “very unsatisfactory.”The US-based Peterson Institute for International Economics said Chinese agricultural purchases at the end of June were far from where they should be at that point in the year.They had reached only 39 percent of their semi-annual target, according to US figures, or 48 percent, based on Chinese figures.Beijing “is lagging but it looks like China still wants to commit, despite the escalation of the US-China tensions,” said Tommy Xie, head of research on China at OCBC Bank.Bert Hofman, director of the East Asian Institute in Singapore, said Chinese agricultural purchases may improve later in the year but it will struggle to hit targets for energy products, given low global prices.However he said language in the agreement would allow both sides to modify the targets in response to a disaster like the coronavirus pandemic, which would be “a good outcome” but could be passed over for political considerations.“It will be politically hard to change the agreement in the run-up to an election in which President Trump has made containing China a key plank in his re-election campaign,” Hofman said. “Rather than amending the agreement, he may prefer to cancel it shortly before the US elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-to-discuss-trade-deal-amid-covid-19-disruption/story-XZvKO3ZDomLxAv0agGOjYO.html

These flights have connected several cities in India with the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. They have so far ferried nearly 9,000 persons back to India, and with 20 more such flights scheduled for this month, that number is expected to cross 10,000.Meanwhile, the Canadian Government, through its High Commission in Delhi and its Consulates in India, has also operated 41 repatriation flights, but those were chartered. Air Canada will return to India after nearly five months. Though the current arrangement of three-flights-a-week between Delhi and Toronto is only listed till the end of August, it is expected to be extended.The two countries were prompt in establishing the air bubble, with the Canadian Government seeking permission to this effect last week. “It adds to the convenience of Indian and Canadian citizens,” India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria said.The Indian Government is also working at synchronizing sharing of data with Air Canada for smooth implementation of restrictions and precautions related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Canadians of Indian origin holding Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards will be able to travel on these flights to India. This underscores the importance of these cards, since those who do not have it will have to apply for an emergency visa to travel, Bisaria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-under-air-bubble-agreement-between-india-and-canada-start-aug-15/story-KgfBghTsiMGRFbkeFuhR9L.html

Later test results on the man were “inconclusive”, according to the World Health Organisation.Coronavirus prevention measures had stabilised the risk in the area, Kim said in a statement carried by KCNA.While easing the lockdown within the country, Kim said that border controls should remain tight and ordered communities not to accept any external assistance related to the floods caused by weeks of heavy rain.“The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,” Kim said in a statement carried out by the KCNA.The monsoon season caused extensive damage in several provinces, with farmlands inundated with floodwaters, around 16,680 houses and 630 public buildings destroyed or flooded, and many roads, bridges and railroads damaged, KCNA reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-lifts-lockdown-in-border-town-after-suspected-covid-19-case-inconclusive/story-bhysx83JWK0VHVEenxXaGN.html

He also kept older cars in the company’s rental fleet longer to lower depreciation costs without disclosing the change to investors, the SEC said.Hertz reaffirmed earnings guidance in November 2013 despite internal projections that showed lower earnings per share figures, according to the SEC. The company then revised the results in 2014 and restated them in 2015, cutting previously reported pretax income by $235 million, the SEC said. Hertz agreed to pay $16 million to resolve SEC claims over the misstatements.Frissora, who agreed to settle without admitting or denying the SEC’s claims, will pay a $200,000 fine in addition to returning nearly $2 million in incentive-based pay. He left Hertz in September 2014 after investors pushed for his removal and went on to serve as president of Caesars Entertainment Corp. for four years through April 2019.Hertz, which filed for bankruptcy in May, said earlier this week that it is seeking debtor-in-possession financing. That came after the SEC raised questions about a plan to issue as much as $500 million of equity, forcing Hertz to terminate the offering after raising just $29 million from investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-ceo-of-hertz-to-repay-2-million-over-misstatements-in-2013/story-lQHYRXJvJF2bYMhYEecl6I.html

This was their first meeting after a week.The details of the meeting have not been disclosed. The sources close to the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) said the talk ended on a positive note. Sources said as Prime Minister Oli agreed to hand over the total command of the party to Prachanda during the meeting, an agreement could be closer.The leaders are expected to meet on Friday too.Oli during a television interview on Wednesday said that the ongoing intra-party tussle will be settled down within five days. Oli and Prachanda have held at least ten meetings in recent weeks to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the NCP.A bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP since the last few weeks after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” They are also against Oli’s autocratic style of functioning.The differences grew further after Oli said that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.The two leaders are also engaged in tightening their grip within the party with the escalation of the intra-party feud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oli-prachanda-meet-to-resolve-their-differences/story-rtwu3UyVRun6TuMKdFjEnM.html
14-08-2020||World||Palestinians recall ambassador from UAE over Israel deal||The official Palestinian news agency says the Palestinian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates is being recalled.The move comes after the UAE and Israel announced a deal on Thursday to establish full diplomatic ties that would see Israel suspend its plans to annex parts of the West Bank.The Palestinians have slammed the deal, calling it a “betrayal” of the Palestinian cause and have demanded its retraction.Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced Thursday they are establishing full diplomatic relations in a US-brokered deal that required Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians.The historic deal delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the deal amounts to “treason,” and should be reversed.The agreement makes the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full diplomatic ties with Israel. They announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between Israel and the UAE were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Trump called the deal “a truly historic moment.” “Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.In a nationally televised news conference, Netanyahu echoed Trump’s remarks.“Today we usher in a new era of peace between Israel and the Arab world,” he said. “There is a good chance we will soon see more Arab countries joining this expanding circle of peace.” But Netanyahu said the annexation plan was on “temporary hold,” appearing to contradict statements from Emirati officials who said it was off the table. Emirati officials described the deal in pragmatic terms, saying they had dealt a “death blow” to an aggressive Israeli move and hoped to help reshape the region.“Is it perfect? Nothing is perfect in a very difficult region,” said Anwar Gargash, a top Emirati official. “But I think we used our political chips right.” He said the deal dealt a “death blow” Israel and the UAE do not share a border and have never fought a war. But the UAE, like most of the Arab world, long rejected diplomatic ties with Israel in the absence of a peace deal establishing a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in 1967.That steadfast support for the Palestinians, however, has begun to weaken in recent years, in large part because of the shared enmity toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the day-to-day ruler of the UAE, also shares Israel’s distrust of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gaza Strip’s ruling Hamas militant group.Netanyahu has long boasted about fostering closer behind-the-scenes ties with Arab countries than publicly acknowledged. The UAE has made little secret of those budding ties, allowing Israeli businessmen to enter the country on foreign passports and welcoming Israeli officials and sporting figures. Next year, Israel will take part in the UAE’s delayed Expo 2020, the world’s fair being hosted by Dubai. A secret synagogue also draws practicing Jews in Dubai.Still, the timing of the deal was unexpected, and perhaps tied to the upcoming US election.For Trump, it gave an important boost to a president trailing in opinion polls and facing heavy criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. It was also a rare achievement for his Mideast team, led by adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose Mideast plan has made little headway since it was unveiled early this year.Israel and the UAE are among Trump’s few close international allies, and Thursday’s deal may have been seen as an election gift.U.S.-Israeli author Joel Rosenberg, who met with the crown prince in 2018 alongside fellow evangelical Christians, said the announcement could influence religious voters who may “struggle to decide” between Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.Thursday’s agreement offers “a feel that this is historic” and a change for Trump to “have a series of big moments in the months ahead.” In a statement, Biden praised Israel for freezing the annexation plan.“The United Arab Emirates and Israel have pointed a path toward a more peaceful, stable Middle East,” he said, adding that a Biden presidency “will seek to build on this progress.” Netanyahu also chalked up a diplomatic victory at a time when his shaky coalition government has been plagued by infighting and facing the possibility of early elections. But even his rivals praised the deal.Netanyahu has seen his popularity plummet as the country grapples with a renewed coronavirus outbreak, mass street protests and skyrocketing unemployment as the result of earlier lockdown measures.For the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers. It also removes the stigma of recognizing Israel and could open the door for neighboring countries to follow suit.The Gulf state of Bahrain welcomed the deal.All in all, Netanyahu paid a relatively minor price. Although the hoped-for annexation plan is on hold, a half-century status quo remains in place in which Israel maintains its occupation of the West Bank and continues to expand its scores of settlements while Palestinians live in small autonomous enclaves. Those settlements are now home to some 500,000 Israelis.The Palestinians claim all of the West Bank, captured in the 1967 Mideast war, as the heartland of a future state. The Trump Mideast plan envisions granting Israel permanent control over 30% of that territory, while offering the Palestinians limited autonomy in the remainder. After embracing the plan, Netanyahu backed away from moving forward with annexation last month in the face of fierce international opposition and misgivings by White House officials.The Palestinians have rejected Trump’s Mideast plan out of hand.Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, convened a meeting of his top leadership Thursday night, and afterward his spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeneh, said the agreement amounted to “treason.” He added that the UAE must reverse the decision and urged other Arab countries not to follow suit “at the expense of Palestinian rights.” In Gaza, Hamas called the deal a “stabbing in the back of our people.” Moving to head off the Palestinian criticism, UAE officials said the deal had prevented the annexation and kept hopes alive for Palestinian statehood.“The UAE is using its gravitas and promise of a relationship to unscrew a time bomb that is threatening a two-state solution,” Gargash said.Netanyahu also came under criticism from Israeli hardliners who accused him of missing an opportunity to annex parts of the biblical land of Israel. Naftali Bennett, a pro-settler lawmaker, welcomed the agreement but said it was “tragic that Netanyahu did not seize the moment.” Netanyahu insisted there was “no change” to his annexation plans. He said Israel would “wait temporarily” at the request of Trump.Still, by dropping the annexation plan Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Biden has made clear that he would oppose any annexation.Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, said the deal would solidify Netanyahu’s legacy among Israel’s greatest leaders.“There’s Rabin with Jordan, Begin with Egypt,” he said, referring to the prime ministers who reached Israel’s other peace deals. “Now there’s Benjamin Netanyahu. He’s going to be in the history books.” (AP) ANB ANB||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-recall-ambassador-from-uae-over-israel-deal/story-xEGaScjbVPqYUPq9TaYYHN.html
14-08-2020||World||Aware of threats to CPEC, periodically enhancing security measures: Pak Army||The Pakistan Army on Thursday said it was aware of the threats to the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and security measures were periodically enhanced to deal with the emerging dangers. Speaking to the media in Rawalpindi, Army Spokesperson Major General Babar Iftikhar said, “The security of the CPEC has been increased. It is a continuous process and its security requirements are increasing as the project is going ahead.” “We are aware of threats and there is no compromise on its security because this project is linked with the future of our country,” the spokesperson said. He said that the war against terrorism was ‘hard-earned success’. The spokesperson said “more than 18,000 terrorists were killed and 400 ton explosive material was seized” from militants during the war on terrorism in the country. He said Pakistan supported the Afghan peace process because peace in Pakistan is lined with Afghanistan. “Peace in Afghanistan means peace in Pakistan and peace along our western borders. So if there is anyone who wants peace in Afghanistan after Afghans, it is Pakistan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aware-of-threats-to-cpec-periodically-enhancing-security-measures-pak-army/story-FOsF4rp83kT1nL7dUx0UbM.html
14-08-2020||World||Bipartisan resolution introduced in US senate China on aggression against India||A bipartisan resolution was introduced in US Senate Thursday that seeks to condemn China’s use of military aggression to change the Line of Actual Control with India and calls for a diplomatic solution.Senators John Cornyn (Republican) and Mark Warner (Democrat) moved the resolution that “condemns the People’s Republic of China’s use of military force to change the status quo at the Line of Actual Control, as well as its refusal to de- demarcate that Line in accordance with past bilateral agreements with India.”And it calls for a “ diplomatic solution that rapidly restores the April 2020 status quo at the Line of Actual Control”.Without specifically mentioning the Indian ban on Chinese apps, the resolution seeks to “commend India for taking steps to secure its telecommunications infrastructure from Chinese security threats and seeks a commitment to to “deepening defense, intelligence and economic ties” between the United States and India and supports bilateral and multilateral partnerships such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, “to promote a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific”.“The June 15 conflict between China and India, resulting in the deaths of approximately 20 Indian soldiers, should set off alarm bells regarding the PRC’s provocative actions in disputed territory,” Warner said in a statement.He added: “This resolution condemns PRC’s actions to change the Line of Actual Control, especially in the midst of diplomatic negotiations between the two countries; and encourages the two nations to find a diplomatic resolution that restores the April 2020 status quo at the LAC.”“I commend India’s commitment to standing up to China and maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific,” said Cornyn. “It is more important than ever that we support our Indian partners as they defend against Chinese aggression.”The two senators are co-chairs of the India Caucus in the senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bipartisan-resolution-introduced-in-us-senate-china-on-aggression-against-india/story-deqZlUjPPSRwOrnYkCxBPM.html
14-08-2020||World||Indian mother taught me to fight for change: Kamala Harris||Appearing with Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, for the fist time after he named her his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday credited her Indian-born mother for inspiring her into a life in public service that led her to this historic moment.“Don’t just sit around and complain about things,” Harris, 55, said her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would tell her and younger sister Maya Harris when they were growing up. “Do something.” Gopalan, who came to the United States from Chennai and was a breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009. But she has remained the most enduring influence in Harris’s life, the US senator wrote ahead of her failed White House bid in 2019. Harris made history on Tuesday as the first Indian-American and Black woman to run for vice-president.“Kamala is smart. She’s tough. She’s experienced. She’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class,” Biden said in his first public explanation of why he picked Harris, from the 11 other women candidates he considered for the job.And, after listing out her accomplishments, the former vice-president said, “As the child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country, as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up Black and Indian-American in the United States.” He added: “Her story is an American story – different from mine in many particulars, but also, not so different in essentials.” The former vice-president then went on to frame his pick in a larger context of a changing America: “And this morning, all across this nation little girls woke up – especially little Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — but today, maybe they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way. As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.”Biden and Harris used their first public appearance together after the announcement to launch a blistering attack on President Donald Trump. “As someone who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and {vice president} Mike Pence is open and shut,” said Harris.After the historic announcement on Tuesday, Wednesday was a quiet affair, held at a school gymnasium in Wilmington, Delaware, which is Biden’s home-state. There were no on-stage handshakes or hugs, and the candidates stayed socially distanced for the photo-op, joined by their spouses. And they put on their masks as they left. “Just look where they’ve gotten us,” Harris said, taking aim at the Trump administration for its handling of the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic. “When other countries were following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News.” Polls show a large chunk of Americans do not approve the Trump administration’s response to the biggest public health crisis faced by the US since the 1918 flu epidemic that killed 675,000 people in the country.The president’s changing position on social distancing and use of masks and his “delusional belief that he knows better than the experts”, Harris said, are the reasons why “an American dies of Covid-19 every 80 seconds, why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good.”Continuing to hold Trump personally responsible for the crisis and the resulting unemployment, among other consequences, the Senator said, “He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden — and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.”Harris also spoke of her commitment to “root out systemic racism from our justice system”, pass a Voting Rights Act, support for dreamers and immigrants, LGBTQs (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queers) and identified herself with the anti-racism protests, saying, “All across this country, a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice, and chants of hope, on which I was raised” during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. On November 3, voting day, she said: “We need more than a victory … We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are, or who we aspire to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-mother-taught-me-to-fight-for-change-kamal-harris/story-5MGPvzG7GsDRfXO7ItEXUJ.html
14-08-2020||World||In US-brokered deal, UAE and Israel to normalise ties||Israel and the United Arab Emirates will open diplomatic relations, US President Donald Trump said on Thursday in a surprise announcement of a deal that would halt Israel’s planned annexation of Palestinian land.“This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential of the region,” said a joint statement by the US, the UAE and Israel released by the White House.The UAE and Israel will sign an agreement at the White House some time in the future, President Trump told reporters. The two nations will open embassies. Delegations from the two sides will meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements on areas including energy, tourism, direct flights, investment, security, communication and technology, the UAE foreign ministry said in a statement . The White House statement said Israel will “suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined” in the President’s Vision for Peace unveiled earlier and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world. It said the three countries are “confident that additional diplomatic breakthroughs with other nations are possible, and will work together to achieve this goal.”The UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said the agreement to normalise relations with Israel was done to deal with the threat that further annexation of Palestinian territories posed to the two-state solution. He urged the Palestinians and Israelis to return to the negotiating table.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal represented a “historic day” for Israel, and ushered in a “new era” in its relations with the Arab world.The agreement broke new ground in Israel’s outreach to Gulf Arab countries with a common fear of Iran’s regional influence. But the Hamas militant group accused the UAE of stabbing the Palestinians in the back. “This announcement is a reward for the Israeli occupation’s crimes,” said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. “The normalisation is a stabbing in the back of our people.” The Islamic militant movement seeks Israel’s destruction and has fought three wars against Israel since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007.A top official in the West Bank settler movement said freezing the annexation plan was a “fair price” for establishing relations with the UAE. Oded Revivi, a top leader in the Yesha settler council, a strong advocate of annexation, tweeted: “The Israeli agreement to postpone the application of Israeli law in the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria is a fair price. The reaction could be a sign that even Israeli hard-liners who pushed for annexation will not criticize Netanyahu for abandoning their dream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-brokered-deal-uae-and-israel-to-normalise-ties/story-BabtcYzxGZikbUGHNw0O5L.html
14-08-2020||World||‘Harris may help Biden with women, youth, GOP voters’||Nearly nine out of 10 Democrats approve of US Senator Kamala Harris as their party’s vice presidential nominee, and she is more popular than presidential candidate Joe Biden among women, young voters and some Republicans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.The August 11-12 public opinion survey also found that 60% of Americans, including 87% of Democrats and 37% of Republicans, considered the selection of Harris - the first Black woman and Asian American nominated for vice presidency - to be a “major milestone” for the US.The California senator is viewed about as favourably or better than Biden in most major demographic groups, the poll showed, highlighting her potential to help the former vice president expand his support in November’s election.The poll showed Biden’s lead over Republican President Donald Trump was effectively unchanged after he announced his running mate choice, increasing by 1 percentage point among all Americans to an 8-point advantage - well within the poll’s credibility interval - when compared with a similar poll that ran on Monday and Tuesday.Forty-six percent of U.S. adults said they would vote for a Biden/Harris ticket, while 38% would vote for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. A similar poll that ran on Monday and Tuesday showed that 44% would vote for Biden while 37% would back Trump.The latest poll also found that 56% of Americans have a favourable impression of Harris, which is about the same as the number who favour Biden. Forty-two percent of US adults say they have a favourable view of Trump and 47% said the same of Pence.Among women, 60% said they have a favourable view of Harris, compared with 53% who felt the same way about Biden. In addition, about 25% of Republicans said they had a favourable view of Harris and approve of her choice as Biden’s running mate. Only about 20% of Republicans said they have a similarly favourable view of Biden. Harris also is a little more popular among American adults who are younger than 35 years old: 62% said they view Harris favourably, while 60% said the same of Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-may-help-biden-with-women-youth-gop-voters/story-jHpfd2RH7cVPnVVIDSLXHM.html
14-08-2020||World||Global Covid death toll passes 750,000||he global death toll from Covid-19 passed 750,000 on Thursday, with some countries toughening controls as caseloads once again creep up.The Latin America and the Caribbean region remained the global epicentre, accounting for almost one-third of all deaths and housing two of the worst-affected countries - Mexico and Brazil. Fear is growing in other regions, with countries including New Zealand and Italy tightening measures in a bid to secure hard-won gains in fighting the virus, which has now infected more than 20 million worldwide.New Zealand, which earlier this week broke a streak of more than 100 days without a new infection, is scrambling to find the source of 17 new cases in its biggest city Auckland - which faces the prospect of a three-day lockdown being extended.People living in London and those of Indian and Asian background are most likely to have been infected by the coronavirus, a key study by Imperial College London published on Thursday said, adding that 6% of England’s population has been infected so far. The 6% reflects about 3.4 million people. Over 100,000 volunteers took part in the study. Billed as the “world’s largest home antibody testing programme for coronavirus”, it tracked infections across England after the first peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-death-toll-passes-750-000/story-ffW9STcJC3YJJcw3UnqwVI.html
14-08-2020||World||Donald Trump rant prompts easing of shower standards||The US government proposed rule changes on Wednesday that would allow shower heads to boost water pressure, after President Donald Trump repeatedly complained that bathroom fixtures do not work to his liking. The Department of Energy plan followed comments from Trump last month a White House event on rolling back regulations. He said he believed water does not come out fast enough from fixtures.“So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect.”Last December, Trump said environmental regulators were looking at sinks, faucets and toilets to revise rules meant to conserve water and fuel that heats it. “People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once,” Trump told a meeting of small business leaders at the White House.Consumer groups decried the plan, saying current rules saved consumers money by conserving water and fuel.The proposal would effectively allow shower fixtures to include multiple shower heads that would get around the 2.5 gallon (9.4 litre) per minute standard Congress set in 1992, when Trump’s fellow Republican George H.W. Bush was president. The Energy Department also proposed easier standards on clothes washers. The Trump administration says its regulatory rollbacks save average American households $3,100 a year. But conservationists say easing bathroom fixture standards could boost energy and water costs. It was uncertain whether the plan would be finalised. Trump is campaigning for reelection in November and trails in opinion polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-rant-prompts-easing-of-shower-standards/story-zBUk9FWMwZVbtOxVERstcK.html

CIUSs, many of them based on college campuses, are a long-established Chinese-government funded programme dedicated to teaching Chinese language and culture in the US and other nations.The Trump administration shut down the Chinese mission in Houston recently alleging it had become a den of spies.The US had also designated several Chinese media outlets operating in the country as “foreign missions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confucius-institute-a-foreign-mission-us/story-DXjwF3JgLq8xSKd3B3O2bN.html

Given the current restrictions in place due to the pandemic, many of the regular events will now migrate online, including the traditional hoisting of the flag at the Indian High Commission in Ottawa and the Consulates in Toronto and Vancouver.The flag will also be featured at other significant Canadian locations, including over the 553 metre high CN Tower, the most striking building in the skyline of Canada’s largest city, Toronto. Another quintessential landmark in the city, the three-dimensional Toronto sign near City Hall in Toronto will be illuminated in the colours of the Indian flag.These displays will continue through the weekend, as the flag raising at Niagara will take place on the evening of August 15, while the flag will flutter over CN Tower on Sunday, while the Toronto sign will stay illuminated over both evenings.India’s Consul General to Toronto Apoorva Srivastava said, “It is a matter of great pride that this Independence Day, iconic locations like Niagara Falls, CN Tower and the Toronto sign will be illuminated in Indian tricolour.”Each year, Toronto witnesses the signature event for the community in the country, the India Day Parade. Last year, it attracted a crowd of a record 85,000 at its downtown venue. However, given measures prohibiting the gathering of large numbers of people due to the coronavirus crisis, this event will occur virtually this year, which will be streamed live. While the event featured floats from various states and community groups in the past, this year, it will showcase 10-minute videos comprising the culture and cuisine of the various parts of India, as part of a virtual Parade.Another virtual event to mark the occasion of Independence Day, Taste of India, also took place in the digital sphere this year, and featured cuisine from different parts of India as well a recipes from celebrity chefs.Srivastava said these events have been planned ‘keeping in mind the safety regulations and social distancing.” She also said there will be a symbolic planting of 74 saplings in Brampton, a city in the Greater Toronto Area, followed by a rally which will feature cars displaying the India flag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-tricolour-to-be-hoisted-in-niagara-falls-on-august-15/story-8lNDJcMtivX4mWUs2lRnUO.html
14-08-2020||World||Trump fans ‘birther’ slur against Harris||President Donald Trump on Thursday resurrected the racially charged “birther” controversy he had fanned for years to question President Barack Obama’s eligibility for the presidency. His target this time is Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and Indian American to run for vice-president.Since the announcement of her pick as the running mate of Joe Biden, some fringe conservatives have sought to question Harris’s eligibility arguing that while she was born in the United States, her parents — mother from India and father from Jamaica — were not naturalized citizens of the US at the time.Therefore, they have argued, while Harris may not be a “natural born citizen” as required by the constitution to become president and, by extension, vice-president.“I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements, and by the way the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented,” Trump told reporters at a briefing when asked about questions being raised about Harris’s eligibility as an “anchor baby”, a term used for children born to non-citizens during visits to the US aimed to help the rest of the family immigrate to the United States. Trump had referred to a column in the Newsweek that first made this argument.“I have no idea if that’s right,” he added. “I would have assumed the Democrats would’ve checked that out before she gets chosen for vice president.”Instead of dismissing the clearly absurd theory, the president lingered. “Thats a very serious... they’re saying she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country?” he asked.When told Harris was indeed born in the United States and that her parents may not have been legal resident or naturalized citizens at the time, he said. “I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I will take a look.”Harris, 55, was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, which makes her a natural born citizen, eligible to run for the White House or any other officer in the US. Her parents had met as graduate students at University of California, Berkeley.The Biden-Harris campaign had not responded to the president’s tacit support of the unfounded theory, to fan it, till hours after, but Maya Harris, the younger sister of Kamala Harris, did: “There are no gradations of birtherism. You’re either in or you’re out,” she wrote on twitter, joining a growing call for ignoring the attempt to resurrect the “birther” controversy.Trump started the “birther” movement in 2011 when he first seriously considered a run for the White House. He began by questioning then President Barack Obama’s eligibility for the White House, alleging wrongly he was not born in the US. Obama was born in Hawaii but he felt compelled to release a long-form record of his birth.Trump acknowledged he was wrong years later. But in intervening years, he used the same strategy to diminish Ted Cruz, the last of his primaries challengers. Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada to father who was from Cuba and mother, who was a natural-born American citizen. Cruz lost the primaries and soon resurfaced as a strong support of President Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-fans-birther-slur-against-harris/story-DpwYiayWykBdgNir5RoFAP.html
14-08-2020||India||Kerala CM, 7 ministers in quarantine after 23 officials test Covid +ve||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and seven of his ministers went into quarantine on Friday after 23 state government officials who were part of the rescue operation at a plane crash site in Kozhikode tested positive for coronavirus. In a brief statement, the CM’s office said he will be going in self-quarantine and won’t be able to unfurl the Tricolour on Independence Day and it will be done by the state tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran. The CM and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan had visited Kozhikode in north Kerala with a big team a day after the air tragedy that claimed 18 lives, including two pilots. The decision came after Malappuram district collector K Gopalakrishnan and police superintendent U Abdul Kareem tested positive, along with 21 other officials who supervised the rescue work with local people after the Air India Express evacuation plane from Dubai skidded and crashed last Friday. Seven ministers, including health minister KK Shailaja and state director general of police (DGP) Loknath Behera, have put themselves into quarantine. District officials were at the crash site for many hours and led the rescue operations with the aid of local people. In fact they were in quarantine after two injured in the crash tested positive. “Some symptoms were there since yesterday and later it was confirmed positive. This is part of our job. I am relieved we could limit the death toll to 18,” said collector K Gopalakrishnan, who reached the spot in 20 minutes and took command of the rescue work. Though the airport is known after Kozhikode, it is in Malappuram district, at least 25 kms away from Kozhikode city. Earlier the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) had also asked its personnel who took part in the rescue operation to go in quarantine. Kondotty, where the airport is situated, was a containment zone but youngsters came out in large numbers which was later lauded by many, including Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Air India. Local people are also in quarantine and their test results are yet to come. Meanwhile, the state reported 1569 new cases and 10 deaths. Death toll went up to 140 and total cases stood at 41, 246. State health minister KK Shailaja said cases are likely to peak by next month and experts have warned daily cases will go up to 15,000. Kerala was the first state to report a virus case in the country in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-7-ministers-in-quarantine-after-23-officials-test-covid-ve/story-EnyH3Vl3okYYxaoin0TjkM.html
14-08-2020||India||Heavy rain likely in central India||The monsoon is likely to be very active over northwest and central India over the next two weeks with high chances of extremely heavy rains (over 20 cm) in parts of Gujarat and eastern Rajasthan, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday. Unlike in July, the monsoon has been active in the first half of this month with the country receiving 13% excess rain from August 6 to 12.IMD said 12% of 685 districts have got large excess rains (60% excess or more), 17% have recorded excess rains (20 to 59% excess), while 42% are in normal (19% deficient to 19% excess) and 26% in deficient (20 to 59% deficient) and 3% in large deficient category (more than 60% deficiency) since the monsoon season began on June 1.Above normal monsoon rains are expected in August and September because of several consecutive low-pressure areas forming over the Bay of Bengal. But chances of flooding and extremely heavy rain are high in Gujarat and Rajasthan over the weekend and coming week. All districts of Gujarat recorded large excess rains except Gandhinagar on Thursday. Many districts of eastern Rajasthan have also recorded large excess rains.The low-pressure area over north coastal Odisha is likely to move west-northwestwards to north Madhya Pradesh during the next 2-3 days. Another low-pressure area is likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal on August 19. “Monsoon trough likely to shift southwards and remain active. The convergence of strong southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterlies from the Bay of Bengal at lower levels very likely over northwest and central India. Southwest monsoon is very likely to be in an inactive phase with above-normal rainfall activity over central India, northern parts of south Peninsular India and most parts of plains of northwest India,” an IMD statement said.Heavy to very heavy rain was likely in Gujarat, Konkan, Goa, Ghat areas of central Maharashtra, eastern Rajasthan and parts of central India. Extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) is also likely over Gujarat and eastern Rajasthan during the next 2-3 days.“The Madden Julian Oscillation (an eastward spread of large regions of enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall, mainly observed over the Indian and Pacific Ocean, according to UK Met Office) which was over the western Indian Ocean has started moving towards the Pacific,” said D S Pai, senior scientist, IMD. “This was helped with formation of low-pressure areas over western Pacific, the remnants of which are forming low-pressure areas over Bay of Bengal leading to several low-pressure areas forming that can intensify monsoon rain over India. The sea surface temperatures over the Bay of Bengal are also above average.”In July, there were no low-pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal and hence the monsoon was subdued over the core monsoon region (parts of east and central India). Pai said monsoon rains are likely to be above average both in August and September.The monsoon trough is likely to remain active and positioned near to its normal position during most days of the week between August 20 and 26. “Rainfall activity is very likely to be normal to above normal over most parts of the country, except Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar, where it is likely to be below normal. Thus the currently above normal rainfall activity for the country will continue to remain above normal for the next two weeks. It may lead to inundation of low-lying areas on some occasions over central parts of the country,” IMD said.“Due to formation of a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and the monsoon trough being near its normal position, we can expect very heavy rains in Gujarat and Rajasthan in the next 2 to 3 days and very active monsoon conditions over the country in the next two weeks,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.Monsoon rains are presently 2% excess over the country with 22% excess over the south peninsula, 19% deficient over northwest India, 8% surplus over east and northeast India.Very light rain is expected around Red Fort on Saturday morning and may coincide with the Independence Day function, said Delhi’s Regional Meteorological Centre.Delhi recorded heavy rain on Thursday with around 83.8 mm recorded at the Safdarjung weather station. “The monsoon trough is slightly south of its normal position passing along Jaipur, Gwalior, Sidhi, Daltonganj, Jamshedpur to the Bay of Bengal. There is high moisture incursion towards northwest India both from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. So we are expecting light rain in the capital on the Independence Day,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-likely-in-central-india/story-LbvIseZABF3251Z4o7cu4H.html
14-08-2020||India||How Ashok Gehlot managed the crisis||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot won a vote of confidence in the assembly on Friday with the ruling Congress party hoping political uncertainties that erupted in the state in mid-July was over for now.As the crisis — triggered by the rebellion by now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and doused by a truce call earlier this week — unfolded, Gehlot had his task cut out. He had to fight a two-pronged battle — on the internal and the external fronts. In the end, the outcome was in his favour.While central Congress leaders credit former party president Rahul Gandhi with breaking the ice — he met Pilot on Monday before an announcement on the breakthrough — Gehlot monitored the efforts on the ground to rescue his government.A challenge for him was to keep the over 100 legislators loyal to him (including those representing allies) together. Hence, they were first taken to the Fairmont Hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur on July 13, a move aimed to ensure there are no defections in the ranks. Then, the MLAs were shifted to a resort in Jailsamer on July 31. They returned to Jaipur only on Thursday, a day before the commencement of the assembly session and after the truce declaration.His first moral victory came soon after the rebellion began. On July 12, three rebel MLAs of the Congress — Chetan Dudi, Danish Abrar and Rohit Bohra — came back the party fold after Gehlot spoke to them through Bohra’s father Pradyman Singh, a senior Congress leader.And then, Gehlot identified three independents — Kushveer Singh, Suresh Tak and Om Prakash Hudla — in the Pilot camp who the chief minister thought could return. Gehlot, through his emissaries, got in touch with them, but they expressed their inability to do so.“This gave him confidence that the government was safe,” a second senior Congress functionary said, requesting anonymity.Till the end of the tussle and before the peace deal, Pilot had the support of 18 Congress dissidents and the three independents.Gehlot also attacked the BJP’s high command, accusing it of trying to topple the government — a charge repeatedly denied by the opposition party. He remained soft on the state BJP leadership, trying to project what he called differences in the opposition party.Congress leaders said Gehlot steered the party’s legal strategy from issuing show-cause notices to the 19 rebel Congress MLAs to drafting requests to state governor Kalraj Mishra for an assembly session without mentioning the trust vote on the agenda.When the governor insisted on a 21-day notice to convene a session, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Gehlot. “He agreed for 21 days once he got reports that the rebel camp was getting jittery over the prolonged crisis,” said the second Congress party leader, privy to the developments.A third Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that another challenge for Gehlot was to keep the morale of his camp high as the crisis dragged on. For that, he would every day visit the legislators supporting him at the resort on the outskirts f Jaipur, and later frequent the Jaisalmer resort.“He gave a pep talk to legislators almost every day and appreciated their patience in dealing with the crisis. He would stay with them till 2.30-3.00am and urge them to ensure that the BJP’s designs do not succeed,” added the third leader.Gehlot also wrote a letter to all legislators, including those from the BJP, reminding them how he, as the Rajasthan Congress president in 1996, prevented an attempt to topple the government of then chief minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat of the BJP.And in the final phases of the crisis, when the Congress leadership brokered a truce with Pilot and his supporters, the CM sent out a peace message and asked the legislators backing him to bury the hatchet and unite again.Before going for the floor test, Gehlot shook hands and hugged Pilot at a Congress meeting at the chief minister’s residence in a show of unity, in an indication that he had left behind the bitterness of the past month involving his personal attacks on the rebel camp.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said the resolution of the month-long crisis has bolstered Gehlot and underscored his political acumen.“Gehlot made it appear that it was another attempt of the central BJP leadership to overthrow another Congress-ruled state. Except his comments against Pilot, Gehlot’s strategy was flawless, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-gehlot-managed-the-crisis/story-NYNQizS5w8qn0WdZDxfs0H.html
14-08-2020||India||I will be the shield, club, and spear: Sachin Pilot||Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot made two interventions during a discussion on the confidence motion moved by the ruling Congress party in the Rajasthan assembly on Friday, responding to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders who named him in connection with the recent political crisis triggered by his rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot.His first intervention was during the address by Rajendra Rathore, the deputy leader of opposition and a BJP leader who asked why a notice was issued by the Rajasthan Police’s special operations group (SOG) to Pilot and why he rebelled against the party. The 42-year-old former deputy chief minister rose from his seat and said: “They are taking my name repeatedly. Prior to my seat being changed, I was safe and part of the government. Then I thought why our speaker and chief whip [Mahesh Joshi] have given me a seat here? I thought for two minutes and then saw that this is a border.” “On one side is the ruling party and on the other is the opposition. Who is sent to the border? The strongest warrior is sent,” Pilot added.On Friday, Pilot, who was dismissed as the deputy chief minister on July 14 after his rebellion, sat in the second row — near the opposition benches — in the House. In the last session in March, he sat next to the chief minister in the front row. The new seating arrangement prompted jibes by the Opposition.The SOG notice that Rathore raked up asked Pilot to record his statement regarding an alleged attempt to topple the Congress government and triggered the revolt that had been in the offing for months. Though the Congress said a similar notice was sent to Gehlot, leaders close to Pilot called it a “joke”; for it is the chief minister who is in charge of the home department that oversees the police force. Pilot’s camp said the notice was yet another move to “humiliate” him and “undermine” his authority.Pilot, who announced a truce earlier this week after a dialogue with the Congress high command in Delhi, also said: “Having completed all the talks (to resolve issues that triggered his rebellion), we have come to the assembly today. It may rain fire at this frontline, but we all and I will be the shield, club and spear and will protect (the party).”The Tonk legislator rose again during the address of leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, who said the Congress should laud Pilot for its achievements in The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the state. Pilot was the rural development minister from December 2018, when the Congress formed the government, till he lost his portfolios on July 14. “It would be better if you argued on the merits and demerits of the confidence motion,” Pilot told Kataria. He said many things have been said during the discussion on the trust vote. “Over time, everything will be revealed,” Pilot added.“Whatever I or my colleagues had to say or do, we went before a doctor and after treatment, all of us, all 107 of us, are united in the House,” Pilot said amid the thumping of the desk by Congress leaders. He was apparently referring to his Monday meeting with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi that doused his rebellion. Later that night, the party announced the setting up of the panel to look into issues raised by the Pilot and the 18 rebel legislators who backed him and questioned Gehlot’s style of functioning. After the assembly was adjourned till August 21, Pilot said outside the assembly that the BJP should not worry about what was happening in the Congress. “We don’t speak about dagger drawn among the BJP leaders,” he said.During the crisis, a section of the Congress alleged that he was working in coordination with the BJP, though Pilot publicly clarified that he will not join the opposition party.“I have full confidence that the road map (by the Congress high command) will be revealed in a time-bound manner and all our concerns will be dealt with in a satisfactory way,” he said. Pilot said the state government will complete its term and work to fulfil the expectations of the people. “We will work together to face challenges related to coronavirus, economic issues, farmers and youth in the coming days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-will-be-the-shield-club-and-spear-pilot/story-n570ZenNrREPvVi8RnufyO.html

14-08-2020||India||India criticises Pakistan for hosting events on Kashmir with Mahathir, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar||India on Friday criticised Pakistan for giving a platform to former UN-designated terrorist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad to speak on the Kashmir issue through events organised by that country’s missions. Hekmatyar, who now heads the hardline Hizb-e Islami party, participated in a webinar on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir hosted last week by the Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan and said India should “learn a lesson from the Afghan jehad” and the only solution to the Kashmir issue is to give Kashmiris the right to self-determination. Mahathir spoke at an event organised in Kuala Lumpur by the Pakistani mission last week to mark the first anniversary of the revocation of Kashmir’s special status and criticised India’s actions. During his last stint as Malaysia’s premier, his comments on the situation in Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had taken bilateral ties to a new low. Asked about Hekmatyar’s presence in the webinar organised by Pakistan, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “We have seen the media reports of the participation of the former UN-designated terrorist in an event organised by the government of Pakistan. “This is nothing new. Pakistan not only harbours terror outfits but also encourages them. We hope that such participation in public events by a former UN-designated terrorist would not go unnoticed.” In 2017, the UN removed Hekmatyar from its list of designated terrorists after he signed a peace deal with the Afghan government. In response to a separate question on Mahathir’s presence at the Pakistan government event, Srivastava said: “You are aware of the outlook and position of Mahathir Mohamad on this issue. As a saying goes, you are known by the company you keep.” On the Afghan peace process and the Afghan government’s decision to release 400 Taliban prisoners, Srivastava said, “We have taken note of the development. As far as India is concerned, we strongly support the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan. We also support the intra-Afghan negotiations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-criticises-pakistan-for-hosting-events-on-kashmir-with-mahathir-gulbuddin-hekmatyar/story-Y5CDqTyOb3X1BMGorkDW3O.html
14-08-2020||India||India an unprecedented story of success, but challenges remain||When India became Independent, there was joy. A long freedom struggle and the sacrifice of millions, over decades, finally led to self-rule — and what a remarkable journey it was , under the leadership of the Mahatma, for in striving for its own freedom, India showed the world the path of non-violent resistance. Indians would, finally, have the sovereign right to decide their own destiny — its Independence also inspired freedom struggles, especially in Africa, inaugurating an era of decolonisation across the world. But along with the joy, there was a clear recognition that Independence came with tremendous challenges and responsibilities. For one, the task of maintaining national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity — in the wake of Partition — became even more critical. Foreign observers were sceptical about India’s ability to remain free and united, especially given its diversity and internal lack of political and administrative coherence.But it was not just the challenge of remaining sovereign. The vision of the freedom movement did not confine itself to merely displacing a set of foreign rulers and replacing them with a set of domestic elites. The movement was not nativist, but democratic in character. Sovereignty was to reside with the people. Those who governed would do so with the consent of the people. And that is why nurturing representative democracy, creating a set of democratic institutions in a society with deep inequalities, and ensuring that freedom for the nation translated into freedom for citizens was the cornerstone of the Indian project. This, then, was the second challenge. But what was the objective of unity, sovereignty and democracy? Given India’s deprivation, the overwhelming poverty, the inequalities that permeated every sphere, Independence had to mean socioeconomic justice. Political rights had to be accompanied with social and economic rights. And the State had to shape society and battle social ills. The quest for prosperity and justice constituted the third challenge. But all of this hinged on a fourth challenge. Given India‘s breathtaking diversity, its entrenched caste hierarchies, and also its deep intercommunity divisions, especially Hindu-Muslim tensions, social harmony, peace and the accommodation of all groups was central to moving India forward. Would India be united and sovereign, democratic and free, just and equitable, harmonious and diverse? This was the fundamental challenge presented by India’s Independence. And 73 years later, the Indian project must be judged on this metric.The national unity projectFor India, territorial integrity was sacrosanct. This is true for all nation-states, but in India’s case, the wounds of the past and Partition led to even greater determination. The territory that was India’s, through bonds of civilisation, history, geography, law and culture, would not be allowed to fragment. India faced repeated challenges to its integrity — be it through Pakistan’s incursion into Kashmir in 1948 itself, the Chinese offensive in 1962, Pakistan’s attempts to marry external aggression with a sponsored internal rebellion in 1965, its patronage to terror for the last three decades and its silent conspiracy in Kargil in 1999, secessionist movements in various parts of the country, or China’s current aggression in Ladakh.These territorial challenges — including the current one — have constituted a threat. But each time, India fought back. It may not, today, have all the areas it considers its own (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin being the most prominent ones), but the fact that India has remained united, that no secessionist movement has succeeded, that Indian citizens in every corner feel integrated with the national project, is an extraordinary achievement. But along with unity, there was sovereignty. India was wounded by foreign invasions. And its leadership was clear that it would not entertain any external intervention in its internal decision making process. This post-colonial psychological imprint has been so strong that not only did it refuse to join any Cold War bloc by remaining non-aligned, but even today, speaks of strategic autonomy, self-reliance, and not entering any alliance system. To be sure, in an interconnected, globalised world, there is give and take; absolute sovereignty is a myth. But for most part, India has preserved its right to take its own decisions. 73 years later, it is clear that India has the intent and capacity and track record to resist any attempts to redraw the map of the subcontinent. But as geopolitics shifts, it must be ready for challenges to its unity and sovereignty, directly and indirectly. The democratic projectTo institutionalise the principle that the people were sovereign, India instituted — and has successfully implemented — the principles of democracy. Periodic elections have allowed citizens to choose their representatives. Independent institutions — the Election Commission, an independent judiciary, a free press — have ensured that there is a check on executive power. There is a federal structure with clearly defined division of powers between the Centre and states. A vibrant, noisy public sphere has allowed reasoned discussions to take place to chart the path forward, with democratic participation. Protests and social movements have given a voice to the weak and marginalised. Ideological battles have taken place within a peaceful framework. And India is stable because it is a democracy. This democracy, with the assertion of marginalised communities and the spread of technology, has become deeper. Yet, there are, today, legitimate questions about the quality of Indian democracy. Elections remain a true people’s festival where citizens exercise their franchise and choose among competing ideologies, parties and leaders. But some other elements of democracy have suffered. There is the rise of illiberalism. Political parties have become personal fiefdoms. Nepotism is rife. There is an intersection between crime, money and politics. There is an overcentralisation of power in select leaders. The federal compact is under strain. Institutions have become weaker, thus curtailing their ability to keep a critical watch on executive excesses. Free speech is often threatened under the garb of community sentiment. Individual liberties are often undermined. And parties resort to the most crude, violent, polarising techniques to mobilise voters in their quest for power. Make no mistake. The Indian democratic project is a success. No other post-colonial democracy, with India’s level of economic backwardness and social diversity, has sustained an almost uninterrupted democratic run (barring the Emergency interregnum). But just like unity and sovereignty, democracy is not a one-time achievement. It requires constant vigilance, perhaps more so today than earlier. The justice projectLong before India became Independent, India’s leaders were clear that this independence had to translate into substantial outcomes for citizens at large. The hope was that when India became free, it could finally address issues of structural inequality and backwardness, and citizens would enjoy the right to live with dignity, study, work, and access public services. Through a range of instruments — a mixed economy and somewhat insular approach in the early decades and a more liberalised and globalised economic policy orientation from 1991 — India adapted itself to meet these goals. More Indians today have access to basic nutritional intake, education, and work, than ever before. And this is an achievement to be proud of. But the Indian justice story hinges on growth and inclusion. In recent years, both have suffered. India was seeing a slowdown before the pandemic, and Covid-19 is now set to lead to a severe contraction in the economy. This will have a direct impact on jobs, incomes, and the quality of life.Inclusion remains a partial story, too, though the failure on this front must be shared by all governments. State institutions — be it public health system or government schools — have not lived up to the mark, thus depriving the most marginalised of critical services. Welfare programmes have helped, from the right to employment to income transfer to farmers. But they have not been a substitute for the fact that India remains deeply unequal; that a large segment of the population works in the unorganised sector with no benefits; that work is irregular; and meeting basic needs remains a struggle for many. The fact that India is a young country, with a productive population, but limited opportunities, can become a serious destabilising factor.This quest for socioeconomic justice, achievable only through both high growth and more effective inclusion frameworks, remains a challenge.The harmony project But, in a way, the most crucial challenge for India was to ensure internal social unity. To achieve this, the drafters of the Constitution and successive political regimes adopted a range of techniques. The State did not turn into a theocracy, like Pakistan. India’s Muslims would be equal citizens, with equal rights. To address the structural inequities of the caste system, untouchability was abolished, discrimination on the basis of caste was declared illegal, and the State took affirmative action measures to create a level playing field.The fact that this diverse land has remained united is a testament to the vision of the founders. India’s Hindus and Muslims have together coexisted, from villages and towns scattered across the country to political parties. To be sure, there have been riots — some devastating — but they have not upset the larger social equilibrium. In terms of caste, too, more members of backward communities and Dalits have broken free of their chains than ever before in Indian history — through education, representation, reservation, welfare, and their own remarkable endeavour. Yet, the story remains incomplete — and to some extent disturbing. There has been a turn towards majoritarianism in Indian politics. Minorities — particularly Muslims — have a sense of being excluded from power structures, with their lifestyle, food habits, cultural symbols becoming objects of suspicion. Arguably, Hindu-Muslim division is at its deepest today than at any point in the last seven decades, with the State itself seen as taking one side. Caste, too, remains a fundamental reality, with the political assertion of the marginalised not translating into their economic empowerment. Intercaste marriages may have increased but are still not the norm; atrocities against Dalits are only reported to be rising according to official data; and social divisions persist. Citizens may coexist, but if they belong to different religions and castes, especially in smaller towns and villages, they coexist by living separately, not the ideal recipe for harmony. And so, 73 years later, India is a story of success, yet a story of unfulfilled potential. It is a story of democracy which has beaten all odds, yet it is also a story of an incomplete democracy which has miles to go. It is a story of unity, yet a story of unity that is increasingly under threat due to external and internal factors. It is a story of a dream of a just society, yet a story where this quest for justice has hit some barriers. It is a story of remarkable achievement, yet a story of setbacks. It is a story of freedom, but also a story of how all citizens are not yet equally free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-an-unprecedented-story-of-success-but-challenges-remain/story-yKSQrsgKd3ivixEJJjLMvM.html
14-08-2020||India||Manipur: Congress seeks special session for repeat trust vote alleging violation of rules||Alleging “procedural lapses” in the no confidence motion won by Manipur’s BJP-led government on August 10 through a voice vote, opposition Congress on Friday requested Governor Najma Heptullah to convene a special session of the state assembly for another trust vote. In a memorandum submitted to the Governor, former chief minister and leader of opposition, Okram Ibobi Singh, said the rulings of Speaker Y Khemchand Singh during the voting on August 10 are “arbitrary and illegal” and violated Rules 311 and 360 of Rules and Procedure of Conduct of Business in Manipur assembly as well as Supreme Court orders. “The decision of the Speaker to use ‘voice vote’ in deciding an important motion on vote of confidence is contrary to the clear orders of Supreme Court to adopt division, raise of hands and counting the members physically to ascertain the exact number of MLAs voting for or against the motion,” the memorandum said. The N Biren Singh government was declared to have won the trust vote through a voice vote after 28 members of the ruling coalition expressed confidence in the government against 16 from the opposition side (8 Congress MLAs remained absent). “Voice vote, which is based on vocal assent of members, does not convey the exact number of MLAs supporting or opposing the motion, and hence it is unreliable in important motions like confidence motion,” the memorandum said. “By disallowing division of the House by the Speaker, the purpose of ascertaining if any member of Congress MLA voted against the whip/direction issued by the party whip was defeated,” it added. Congress alleged that Speaker Singh committed “serious procedural lapses” by not following the laid down provisions of the rules of conduct of business in the Manipur assembly as well as directions of the Supreme Court. A voice vote despite objections by the opposition also violated provisions of 10th Schedule of Constitution, the memorandum said. “You are requested to summon a special session of the assembly under Article 174 of the Constitution to consider, debate and vote on the ‘motion of confidence’ in the council of ministers headed by N Biren Singh afresh as the (earlier) voting was inconclusive,” said the memorandum. The 60-member Manipur assembly’s strength was reduced to 53 after 4 members were disqualified under anti-defection law and 3 BJP MLAs resigned. On the day of the trust vote on August 10, six Congress MLAs submitted their resignations to the Speaker. Resignations of five of them were accepted reducing the total strength of the assembly to 48 at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-congress-seeks-special-session-for-another-trust-vote-against-bjp-led-coalition/story-olyZyVRc24fdQHh51Abn2I.html

14-08-2020||India||Monitoring panel can’t act against residential properties flouting laws: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court said on Friday that the Monitoring Committee spearheading set up in 2006 to check illegal use of some properties does not have the power to act against residential properties that may be flouting laws, and ordered 11 homes sealed in Vasant Kunj and Rajokri areas to be unsealed and handed back to owners in three days. The SC-appointed Monitoring Committee has been spearheading the capital’s crackdown against the use of residential properties for commercial purposes, a move that has seen sealing of illegal business establishments in prominent neighbourhoods such as Defence Colony. But, the court said, it cannot take action against residential properties, the prerogative for acting against which falls under different mechanisms.The panel has anti-pollution crusader and retired bureaucrat Bhure Lal, former advisor to Election Commissioner KJ Rao, and SP Jhingon. “The Monitoring Committee is not authorised to take action concerning the residential premises situated on the private land. If there is unauthorized construction or in case of deviation, the requisite provisions are under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act,” said the bench of justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari. The Court reiterated that the committee formed under its order of February 16, 2006 had the authority to seal commercial units operating in residential areas and upon encroachment on public land. This power will not extend to unauthorised constructions carried out in private land over which the municipal authorities alone will have the authority under law. This is the first time the committee’s power was questioned since it was formed on February 16, 2006. The decision came after the committee ordered sealing of 11 properties in Pocket D-3, Vasant Kunj and some properties in Rajokari area on a letter from the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Mehrauli on February 22, 2019 complaining about unauthorised construction. The committee filed a report (Report No 149) before the Court on April 4, 2019 for approval. The bench quashed the committee’s report and other reports submitted in connection with the said report and ordered the properties to be de-sealed and possession restored to owners within three days. The court added a rider that its decision is “not at all to belittle the yeoman service done by the Monitoring Committee for protection of Delhi.” Advocate Nalin Kohli who opposed the action of the Monitoring Committee before the court spoke to HT and said that this order became necessary as the committee was expanding its powers. Kohli said, “The Committee has become an authority unto themselves. They shut down several farmhouses in Mehrauli area and this judgment will certainly be a relief to several persons whose properties were sealed despite the construction being for residential purpose and not commercial.” The Delhi government and the Centre were on the same page in this case; opposing the Committee’s action. The Court examined orders passed by it since 2006 and concurred with their submissions. Giving a 70-page judgment, Justice Mishra, who authored the decision, said: “It would not be appropriate for the Monitoring Committee to usurp statutory powers and act beyond authority conferred upon it by the Court. The Monitoring Committee could not have sealed the residential premises, which were not misused for the commercial purpose as done vide Report no 149 nor it could have directed the demolition of those residential properties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monitoring-panel-can-t-act-against-residential-properties-flouting-laws-supreme-court/story-D7HdhmaeSktWOe7vFtvpcO.html

14-08-2020||India||Ahead of I-Day, large cache of arms and ammunition recovered in Assam||Ahead of Independence Day celebrations in the state, Assam Police have recovered a large cache of arms and ammunition from several places in Udalguri district. “Based on a source’s information, Guwahati Police conducted a search operation along with Udalguri Police at several places in Udalguri district and recovered huge numbers of arms, ammunition and explosives on Thursday night,” said a Assam Police release issued on Friday. “These are suspected to belong to the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) organization. Further investigation is on,” it added. The recovered items include two AK-47 rifles, five AK-56 rifles, two M-16 rifles, seven 9mm pistols, 12 grenades, over 1250 rounds of ammunition, 1 air gun and around 20 kilogram of explosives. In January this year, four factions of NDFB, the All Bodo Students Union and United Bodo People’s Organisation, who had been seeking a separate Bodoland state for decades, gave up their demand and signed a peace accord with the Centre. Following the signing of the accord, over 3,000 NDFB cadres had laid down arms at two separate programmes. In March, two months after signing the peace accord, all four NDFB factions disbanded itself. But the recovery of a large cache of arms and ammunition suggests that the NDFB factions may not have handed over all their arms after signing the peace deal, said a senior police official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-i-day-large-cache-of-arms-and-ammunition-recovered-in-assam/story-cD8VGxsHjjyvH6VLvfL2pI.html

His remarks encapsulate the spirit of 130 crore Indians and highlight the path ahead to build a strong, prosperous and united nation,” PM Modi tweeted on Friday evening soon after President Kovind’s speech.President Kovind had earlier hailed the government’s response to coronavirus outbreak, praised medical staff at the forefront of India’s fight against the pandemic, paid tribute to Indian soldiers who died fighting Chinese soldiers in Galwan Valley, denounced China’s expansionist agenda, praised the new national education policy and welcomed the beginning of construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya.“Only ten days ago, construction of the temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi began, in Ayodhya. It was indeed a moment of pride for all. People of the country maintained restraint and patience for a long time and reposed unflinching trust in the judicial system. The issue of Ram Janmabhoomi was resolved through judicial process.

India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world. It implies that India will continue to engage with the world economy while maintaining its identity,” Kovind said.President Kovind also said that the pandemic had taught human beings some crucial lessons in the year 2020.

The external affairs ministry said a separate consignment of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical gloves and surgical gowns, is being sent to Lebanon following a spike in Covid-19 cases. This will reach Beirut in the coming days, ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.India stands in solidarity with #LebanonToday C-17 of @IAF_MCC delivered 58 MT of humanitarian aid from India to the people of Lebanon to assist relief efforts in wake of the tragic #BeirutBlast.

14-08-2020||India||Capable of giving befitting response to any aggression, says President||Exactly two months after the fierce clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan valley, President Ram Nath Kovind sent out a clear warning on Friday that India is “capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression” as he addressed the nation on the eve of 74th Independence Day. Kovind slammed the neighbour’s “misadventure of expansion” when the world needs to come together to fight against Covid, “the greatest challenge before humanity. The bloody conflict in the Galwan valley on June 15 left 20 Indian soldiers, including a colonel, and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead. Since then, the two sides are locked in discussions to de-escalate the situation but China has so far refused to move back from some critical areas. As many as five rounds of top-level military talks between the two sides have failed to break the deadlock as serious differences appeared over the Finger Area near Pangong Lake and the PLA’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims as Indian territory. “The world now realises what our sages had said long ago: the global community is but one family; ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. However, even while the world community needs to fight together against the greatest challenge before humanity, some in our neighbourhood tried to carry out their misadventure of expansion,” Kovind said. Paying respect to the Indian soldiers who lost their lives defending the borders, Kovind said: “Those worthy sons of Bharat Mata lived and died for national pride. The entire nation salutes the martyrs of Galwan Valley.” He also added, “Their bravery in combat has demonstrated that while we believe in peace, we are also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression,” expressing pride in Indian armed forces, paramilitary forces and police personnel “who protect the borders, and ensure our internal security.” Kovind also added that India has been at the forefront in evolving regional and global strategies for an effective response to the Covid pandemic and its timely and “super-human efforts” contained the Covid and saved many lives back home. He also saw the construction of Ayodhya’s Ram Temple as a “moment of pride for all”.As India gears up to an unprecedented subdued celebration of Independence Day, Kovind termed covid warriors as national heroes, said the pandemic has taught “tough lessons” of life and “demolished the illusion that human being is the master of nature.” He appealed to the humanity to “correct its course and live in harmony with nature” and said the crisis offered opportunities for economic revival. Even as the Modi government’s handling of the covid situation has come under immense criticism in the political circle, the President said that the Centre, “while anticipating the tremendous challenge, responded effectively and well in time” and added that it requires “super-human efforts for a country so vast and diverse with high population density” to meet these challenges. Kovind said India’s committed efforts that “succeeded in containing the magnitude of the pandemic and saving a large number of lives” is worth emulating by the wider world. The pandemic, like climate change, has awakened the global community to our shared destiny, said Kovind as he saw more importance in ‘human-centric collaboration’ than ‘economy-centric inclusion’. He also appealed to rise above all man-made differences, strengthen virtue in conduct, expand public health infrastructure and accelerate developments in science and technology—a reminder on how India built covid-related medical items such as ventilators or PPE kits almost from a scratch and now is able to even export to other countries. “Coronavirus does not recognise any artificial divisions created by human society. This reinforces the belief that we need to rise above all man-made differences, prejudices, and barriers. Compassion and mutual help have been adopted as basic values by the people in India. We need to further strengthen this virtue in our conduct. Only then can we create a better future for all of us,” Kovind said. Kovind’s speech, just 10 days after the bhumi pujan of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, dubbed the event as “a moment of pride for all” as he mentioned how people maintained “restraint and patience” for a long time and reposed “unflinching trust in the judicial system”. “The issue of Ram Janmabhoomi was resolved through judicial process. All concerned parties and the people respectfully accepted the verdict of the Supreme Court and displayed before the world, Indian ethos of peace, non-violence, love and harmony,” he said on Thursday. In the backdrop of the pandemic that altered lives and played havoc with global economy, the President narrated all welfare interventions such as ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana’ to help the poor and daily wage-earners—the worst-hit people in the pandemic—and enabled millions to earn their livelihood, and mitigate the impact of job-loss. He also spoke about the largest free foodgrain distribution programme to help about 80 crore people every month while ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ brought back more than 10 lakh Indians through the Indian Railways. “In responding to calls from countries for supply of medicines, India has once again shown that it stands by the global community in times of distress. We have been at the forefront in evolving regional and global strategies for an effective response to the pandemic. The overwhelming support India got at the elections for the non-permanent seat of the United Nations Security Council is a testimony to the goodwill we enjoy internationally,” said Kovind. As India embarked on a new Atmanirbhar policy, to boost its internal economic potentials, Kovind sent a message that India’s tradition has always been not to live for ourselves, “but work for the well-being of the entire world”. “India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world. It implies that India will continue to engage with the world economy while maintaining its identity,” the President said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capable-of-giving-befitting-response-to-any-aggression-says-president/story-41YnSWez4dBhpbd1Ao0UPP.html

14-08-2020||India||‘If anyone dares…’: Rajnath Singh amid Ladakh border stand-off||In the midst of border tensions with China in the Ladakh sector, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said the country reposed full faith in its soldiers and no one could grab even an inch of India’s territory while they guard the country’s frontiers. In a radio address to soldiers on the eve of Independence Day, Singh said, “If anyone dares to do this, then they will have to face dire consequences as they have in the past.” The comments come amid heightened tensions in the Ladakh sector where both Indian and Chinese armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and advanced weaponry in their forward and depth areas. He said, “Whatever we do in the realm of national security is for self-defense and not for attacking others. If the enemy country ever attacks us, then like every time we will give them a befitting reply.” Military talks with China on disengagement have hit a roadblock due to serious differences between the two armies. He said history was witness to the fact that India had neither attacked any country nor grabbed anyone’s territory. “But this doesn’t mean we will allow anyone to hurt our self-respect.” Singh also paid tributes to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in a brutal skirmish with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in Galwan Valley on June 15. “The country can never forget their bravery and supreme sacrifice. I want to assure their families that they are not alone and the entire country stands with them,” the minister said. The PLA lost an unspecified number of soldiers in the clash that has dealt a severe blow to the bilateral relationship and created a huge trust deficit between the two armies. Singh said the government was taking the necessary steps to meet the operational requirements of the soldiers and keep their morale high. Recalling that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the creation of the post of chief of defence staff in his 2019 Independence Day speech, Singh said the CDS has ensured better coordination between the three services. Talking about the Indian Air Force’s new Rafales, the minister said the jets had begun arriving and their induction marked the beginning of a new era in the country’s military history. Five of the 36 Rafale jets ordered from France reached their home base in Ambala on July 29. Singh said the IAF’s latest Sukhoi-30 squadron based in Thanjavur would give India “strategic depth” in the Indian Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-anyone-dares-rajnath-singh-amid-ladakh-border-stand-off/story-WQeZbIb7tMoE6xUHUpw4UJ.html

While India believes in peace, President Kovind said, it is also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression as he said “some in our neighbourhood” tried to carry out “misadventure of expansion”.Here are the top 10 quotes from President Kovind’s address to the nation:• The nation is indebted to doctors, nurses and other health workers who have been continuously on the forefront of our fight against this virus. Unfortunately, many of them have lost their lives battling the pandemic. They are our national heroes: President Kovind• The celebrations of Independence Day this year will be rather restrained. The reason is obvious. The whole world confronts a deadly virus which has disrupted all activities and taken a huge toll. It has altered the world we lived in before the pandemic: President Kovind• The poor and daily wage-earners are the worst hit by the pandemic. In order to support them through this phase of crisis, virus containment-efforts have been supplemented by welfare interventions.The needy are being given free food grains, so that no family goes hungry. The largest free food distribution programme in the world has been extended till the end of November 2020 to provide succour to about 80 crore people every month: President Kovind• India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world. It implies that India will continue to engage with the world economy while maintaining its identity: President Kovind• While the world community needs to fight together against the greatest challenge before humanity, some in our neighbourhood tried to carry out their misadventure of expansion. Our brave soldiers laid down their lives defending our borders. Those worthy sons of Bharat Mata lived and died for national pride. The entire nation salutes the martyrs of Galwan Valley. Every Indian feels grateful to their family members: President Kovind• I believe that in the fight against Covid-19, life and livelihood, both are essential. We have looked at the current crisis as an opportunity to initiate reforms to revitalise the economy for the benefit of all, specially farmers and small entrepreneurs: President Kovind• We have learnt some tough lessons in the year 2020. The invisible virus has demolished the illusion that human being is the master of nature. I believe, it is still not too late for humanity to correct its course and live in harmony with nature: President Kovind• The pandemic, like climate change, has awakened the global community to our shared destiny. In my view, ‘human-centric collaboration’ is more important than ‘economy-centric inclusion’, in the present context. The greater this change, the better it will be for the humanity: President Kovind• The 21st century should be remembered as the century when humanity put aside differences and collaborated to save the planet. Coronavirus does not recognize any artificial divisions created by human society. This reinforces the belief that we need to rise above all man-made differences, prejudices, and barriers: President Kovind• Only ten days ago, construction of the temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi began, in Ayodhya. It was indeed a moment of pride for all. People of the country maintained restraint and patience for a long time and reposed unflinching trust in the judicial system: President Kovind||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-coronavirus-and-ram-temple-president-kovind-addresses-india-on-74th-independence-day/story-RSTZ4BeB6mknswkaulezvN.html

They were committed to the cause of liberating Bharat Mata from oppressive foreign rule and securing the future of her children. Their thoughts and actions shaped the identity of India as a modern nation.3. We are fortunate that Mahatma Gandhi became the guiding light of our freedom movement. As much a saint as a political leader, he was a phenomenon that could have happened only in India. Troubled by social strife, economic problems, and climate change, the world seeks relief in Gandhiji’s teachings. His quest for equality and justice is the mantra for our Republic. I am glad to see the younger generations re-discover Gandhiji.Dear Fellow Citizens,4. The celebrations of Independence Day this year will be rather restrained. The reason is obvious. The whole world confronts a deadly virus which has disrupted all activities and taken a huge toll. It has altered the world we lived in before the pandemic.5. It is very reassuring to note that, the central government, while anticipating the tremendous challenge, responded effectively and well in time. For a country so vast and diverse with high population density, meeting this challenge requires super-human efforts. All state governments took measures in accordance with local circumstances. People also supported whole-heartedly. With our committed efforts, we have succeeded in containing the magnitude of the pandemic and saving a large number of lives. This is worth emulating by the wider world.6. The nation is indebted to doctors, nurses and other health workers who have been continuously on the forefront of our fight against this virus. Unfortunately, many of them have lost their lives battling the pandemic. They are our national heroes. All Corona Warriors deserve high praise. They go much beyond their call of duty to save lives and ensure essential services. These doctors, health workers, members of Disaster Management Teams, police personnel, sanitation workers, delivery staff, transportation, railway and aviation personnel, providers of various services, government employees, social service organisations and generous citizens have been scripting inspiring stories of courage and selfless service. When cities and towns go quiet and roads are deserted, they work tirelessly to ensure that people are not deprived of health care and relief, water and electricity, transport and communication facilities, milk and vegetables, food and groceries, medicine and other essentials. They risk their own lives to save our life and livelihood.7. Amid this crisis, Cyclone Amphan hit us in West Bengal and Odisha. Concerted response of Disaster Management Teams, Central and State agencies and alert citizens helped minimize loss of life. Floods have been disrupting lives of our people in the North-East and eastern states. Amid such onslaughts of disasters, it is gratifying to see all sections of society coming together to help those in distress.Dear Fellow Citizens,8. The poor and daily wage-earners are the worst hit by the pandemic. In order to support them through this phase of crisis, virus containment-efforts have been supplemented by welfare interventions. By introducing ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana’, the government has enabled crores of people to earn their livelihood, and mitigate the impact of job-loss, dislocation and disruption caused by the pandemic. The Government continues to extend its helping hand through a number of initiatives, supported whole-heartedly by the corporate sector, civil society and citizens.9. The needy are being given free food grains, so that no family goes hungry. The largest free food distribution programme in the world has been extended till the end of November 2020 to provide succour to about 80 crore people every month. In order to ensure that migratory ration card holders get ration anywhere in the country, all states are being brought under the coverage of ‘One Nation - One Ration Card’ scheme.10. Committed to taking care of our people stranded anywhere in the world, the Government has brought back more than 10 lakh Indians under the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’. Indian Railways has been operating train services, in these challenging circumstances, to facilitate travel and transportation of people and goods.11. Confident of our strengths, we reached out to help other countries in their fight against COVID-19. In responding to calls from countries for supply of medicines, India has once again shown that it stands by the global community in times of distress. We have been at the forefront in evolving regional and global strategies for an effective response to the pandemic. The overwhelming support India got at the elections for the non-permanent seat of the United Nations Security Council is a testimony to the goodwill we enjoy internationally.12. It has been the tradition of India that we do not just live for ourselves, but work for the well-being of the entire world. India’s self-reliance means being self-sufficient without alienating or creating distance from the world. It implies that India will continue to engage with the world economy while maintaining its identity.Dear Fellow Citizens,13. The world now realizes what our sages had said long ago: the global community is but one family; ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam’. However, even while the world community needs to fight together against the greatest challenge before humanity, some in our neighbourhood tried to carry out their misadventure of expansion. Our brave soldiers laid down their lives defending our borders. Those worthy sons of Bharat Mata lived and died for national pride. The entire nation salutes the martyrs of Galwan Valley. Every Indian feels grateful to their family members. Their bravery in combat has demonstrated that while we believe in peace, we are also capable of giving a befitting response to any attempt of aggression. We are proud of the members of our Armed Forces, paramilitary forces and police personnel who protect the borders, and ensure our internal security.14. I believe that in the fight against COVID-19, life and livelihood, both are essential. We have looked at the current crisis as an opportunity to initiate reforms to revitalise the economy for the benefit of all, specially farmers and small entrepreneurs. Landmark reforms have been introduced in agriculture sector. Now, farmers can have barrier-free trade and get the best price for their produce anywhere in the country. The Essential Commodities Act has been amended to remove certain regulatory restrictions on farmers. This will help raise farmers’ income.Dear Fellow Citizens,15. We have learnt some tough lessons in the year 2020. The invisible virus has demolished the illusion that human being is the master of nature. I believe, it is still not too late for humanity to correct its course and live in harmony with nature. The pandemic, like climate change, has awakened the global community to our shared destiny. In my view, ‘human-centric collaboration’ is more important than ‘economy-centric inclusion’, in the present context. The greater this change, the better it will be for the humanity. The twenty-first century should be remembered as the century when humanity put aside differences and collaborated to save the planet.16. The second lesson is that we are all equal before Mother Nature and we primarily depend on our fellow residents for survival and growth. Coronavirus does not recognize any artificial divisions created by human society. This reinforces the belief that we need to rise above all man-made differences, prejudices, and barriers. Compassion and mutual help have been adopted as basic values by the people in India. We need to further strengthen this virtue in our conduct. Only then can we create a better future for all of us.17. The third lesson is about augmenting health infrastructure. Public hospitals and laboratories have been leading the fight against Covid-19. Public health services have helped the poor cope with the pandemic. In view of this, public health infrastructure needs to be expanded and strengthened.18. The fourth lesson relates to science and technology. The pandemic has highlighted the need to accelerate developments in science and technology. During the lockdown and subsequent unlocking, information and communication technology has emerged as an effective tool for governance, education, business, office work and social connect. It has helped meet the twin objectives of saving lives and resumption of activities.19. Offices of the Government of India and of the state governments have been extensively using virtual interface to discharge their functions. The judiciary has been conducting virtual court proceedings to deliver justice. In Rashtrapati Bhavan also, we have used technology to conduct virtual conferences and carry out many activities. IT and communication tools have promoted e-learning and distance education. Work-from-home has become the norm in many sectors. Technology has enabled certain establishments in government and private sectors to work overtime to keep the wheels of the economy running. Thus, we have learnt the lesson that adoption of science and technology, in harmony with nature, will help sustain our survival and growth.20. These lessons will prove useful to humanity. The younger generation has learnt the lessons well, and I believe that the future of India is safe in their hands. These are difficult times for all of us, more so for our youth. The closure of our educational institutions would have caused anxiety among our girls and boys, casting a shadow over their dreams and aspirations for the time being. However, I would like them to remember that these difficult times won’t last and they should not give up working for their dreams. The past is full of inspiring examples of exciting reconstruction of societies, economies and countries after such devastations. I am sure that our country and youth have a bright future.21. With a view to providing futuristic education to our children and youth, the Central Government has decided to implement the National Education Policy. I am confident that with the implementation of this policy, a new quality education system will be developed and this will transform the future challenges into opportunities, paving the way for a New India. Our youth will be able to freely choose their subjects according to their interests and talents. They would have an opportunity to realise their potential. Our future generations will not only be able to get employment on the strength of such abilities but will also create employment opportunities for others.22. The ‘National Education Policy’ spells a long term vision with far-reaching impact. It will strengthen the culture of ‘Inclusion’, ‘Innovation’ and ‘Institution’ in the sphere of education. Imparting education in the mother tongue has been given emphasis in order to help young minds grow spontaneously. This will strengthen Indian languages as well as the unity of the country. Youth empowerment is essential for building a strong nation. The ‘National Education Policy’ is a right step in this direction.My Dear Fellow Citizens,23. Only ten days ago, construction of the temple at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi began, in Ayodhya. It was indeed a moment of pride for all. People of the country maintained restraint and patience for a long time and reposed unflinching trust in the judicial system. The issue of Ram Janmabhoomi was resolved through judicial process. All concerned parties and the people respectfully accepted the verdict of the Supreme Court and displayed before the world, Indian ethos ​​of peace, non-violence, love and harmony. I congratulate all fellow citizens for their commendable conduct.Dear Fellow Citizens,24. When India won freedom, many predicted that our experiment with democracy will not last long. They saw our ancient traditions and rich diversity as hurdles in democratization of our polity. But we have always nurtured them as our strengths that make the largest democracy in the world so vibrant. India has to continue playing its leading role for the betterment of humanity.25. The patience and wisdom being demonstrated by all of you in coping with the pandemic has been appreciated all over the world. I am confident that you will continue to maintain caution and act responsibly.26. We have a lot to offer to the global community, especially for intellectual and spiritual enrichment and promotion of world-peace. With this spirit, I offer a prayer for the well-being of one and all:सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः,सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः।सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु, मा कश्चिद् दु:खभाग् भवेत्॥It means:May all be happy,May all be free from illness,May all see what is auspicious,May no one come to grief.The message of this prayer for universal well-being is India’s unique gift to humanity.27. I once again congratulate you on the eve of 74th Independence Day. I wish you good health and a bright future.Thank you,Jai Hind!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-text-of-president-ram-nath-kovind-s-address-to-nation-on-eve-of-independence-day/story-HLKfDY5YsgOuUhMluuV62J.html

14-08-2020||India||India urges China to complete stalled disengagement process along LAC||India on Friday called on China to work jointly for “complete disengagement and de-escalation” on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), saying the future of the bilateral relationship is dependent on the situation along the disputed frontier. The external affairs ministry emphasised the need to complete the disengagement process “at the earliest” shortly after Indian envoy Vikram Misri met a senior general of China’s Central Military Commission (CMC) in Beijing to brief him on New Delhi’s views on the situation along the border in eastern Ladakh. Misri’s meeting with Maj Gen Ci Guowei, director of CMC’s office of international military cooperation, came two days after the envoy met Liu Jianchao, deputy director of the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) central committee’s foreign affairs commission. The meetings are part of India’s outreach to the Chinese leadership to resolve the standoff. President Xi Jinping heads CMC, which is responsible for administration of the armed forces. Misri briefed Maj Gen Ci on “India’s stance vis-à-vis the situation on the borders in eastern Ladakh UT (union territory)” the Indian embassy tweeted without giving details. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a news briefing that several meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs and corps commanders had discussed the implementation of the disengagement process and “further steps to ensure it is completed at the earliest”. More meetings are likely “in the near future”, he said. “We therefore expect the Chinese side to sincerely work with us towards the objective of complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas as agreed by the Special Representatives,” Srivastava said. “This is also necessary and essential in the context of overall development of our bilateral relationship. As external affairs minister [S Jaishankar] had noted in a recent interview, the state of the border and the future of our ties cannot be separated,” he added. Srivastava said completing the disengagement as soon as possible will require the two sides to work together as well as “mutually agreed reciprocal actions” – a nod to the process having virtually stalled because of China’s reluctance to vacate positions in territory that India considers to be on its side of the LAC. “While we would like the ongoing disengagement process to be completed at the earliest, it is important to bear in mind that achieving this requires agreed actions by both sides,” he said. The process of thinning out tens of thousands of troops deployed by both sides has run into problems at some friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, people familiar with developments said. Srivastava noted both sides had made “some progress” after reaching agreement on the broad principles of disengagement, but more needs to be done. He said “translating these principles on ground is a complex process that requires redeployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC”. He added, “It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions.” Engagements through diplomatic and military channels to ensure complete disengagement are in line with the agreement of the Special Representatives on the border issue – National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi – that “early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols and full restoration of peace and tranquillity was essential for the smooth overall development of bilateral relations”, Srivastava said. The Indian envoy’s two meetings in Beijing this week followed several rounds of diplomatic and military negotiations held since June. They also came against the backdrop of experts suggesting political intervention at the highest level is required to end the impasse. The Indian embassy hasn’t shared details of the two meetings, or, for that matter, why they were held as the Communist party hierarchy and the Chinese government are aware of India’s stance on the border. The Chinese side too has been silent on the meetings At the top of the hierarchies of CPC and the government is President Xi, who is general secretary of CPC and chair of CMC. Chinese troops are said to have pulled back from Galwan Valley, the scene of the June 15 clash that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties, and some friction points, but the troop withdrawal hasn’t moved forward in the Finger Areas of Pangong Lake, Gogra and Depsang. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the Indian envoy’s meetings in Beijing reflected a fresh effort by the leadership in New Delhi to push forward the disengagement after discussions at the diplomatic and military levels failed to yield results. “Between the bad and worse options available to India, the best way out is political intervention at the highest level. However, if the Chinese side doesn’t show any inclination to disengage even after this, that is a signal with significant implications and it could further jeopardise the entire relationship,” he said. “India has very little manoeuvring room left as domestic opinion is completely anti-China. It is now a game of who blinks first,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-urges-china-to-complete-stalled-disengagement-process-along-lac/story-MnkBzXzjt5T5KVqe7blenN.html
14-08-2020||India||Watch: President Kovind’s address to the nation on eve of 74th Independence Day||President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday addressed the nation on the eve of 74th Independence Day. Addressing the country, President Kovind said that the celebrations of Independence Day this year will be rather restrained. “The reason is obvious. The whole world confronts a deadly virus which has disrupted all activities and taken a huge toll. It has altered the world we lived in before the pandemic,” President Kovind said.  Here are the key statements from the President’s address to the nation:• It gives me great pleasure to greet all the people of India, living in the country and abroad, on the eve of the 74th Independence Day. Youth of India should feel special pride of being citizens of a free nation: President Kovind• We are fortunate that Mahatma Gandhi became the guiding light of our freedom movement. His quest for equality and justice is the mantra for our Republic. I am glad to see the younger generations re-discover Gandhiji: President Kovind• On the strength of these extraordinary efforts, in our vast country with densely populated and diverse circumstances, this challenge is being faced. State governments acted according to local circumstances. The public gave full support: President Kovind• The hardest hit of this epidemic has been on the poor and daily livelihood earners. In this era of crisis, along with efforts to prevent them, several public welfare measures have been taken: President Kovind• The government has given livelihood to crores of people by launching ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana’, to reduce the pain of losing jobs due to the epidemic, moving from one place to another and disrupting life: President Kovind• Free grain is being given to needy people so that no family has to starve. Every month, around 80 crore people are being guaranteed ration through this campaign: President Kovind• Committed to helping our people trapped in trouble anywhere in the world, more than a million Indians have been brought back home by the government, under the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’: President Kovind• Protecting the borders, our brave soldiers laid down their lives. Those sons of Mother India, live for national pride and die for that. The entire nation pays tribute to the sacrifices of Galvan Valley. Every Indian has a feeling of gratitude towards his family members: President Kovind• India’s self-reliance means being able to be self-sufficient, not alienating or creating distance from the world. It also means that India will also be involved in the global market system and will retain its special identity: President Kovind• We all learned many important lessons in the year 2020. An invisible virus has broken the myth that nature is subject to humans. I believe that humanity still has the opportunity to adopt a lifestyle based on harmony with nature, by holding the right path: President Kovind• Like climate change, this epidemic has also raised the consciousness that the destiny of each member of the world community is interlinked. My belief is that ‘human-centered collaboration’ is more important in the present context than ‘meaning-centered inclusion’: President Kovind• I believe that in the fight against Covid-19, it is necessary to focus on protecting both life and livelihood. We have seen the current crisis as an opportunity to revive the economy by bringing proper reforms in the interest of everyone, especially the farmers and small entrepreneurs: President KovindThis year’s Independence Day will take amid the unprecedented crisis brought about the Covid-19 pandemic. In an advisory issued by the Union home ministry last month, the government pressed for the “best possible use of technology” during this year’s Independence Day celebrations to avoid gathering in large numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watch-live-streaming-president-ram-nath-kovind-s-address-to-the-nation-on-eve-of-independence-day/story-twHDiFgm6nVBihEnwBBRhP.html
14-08-2020||India||Fresh effort to revive a turtle species considered ‘extinct in wild’||A new home was found on Friday for 25 hatchlings of the endangered black softshell turtle, or, as they are biologically called Nissonia nigricans, a species listed as extinct in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in a bid to boost their population in the wilderness. The month-old hatchlings were shifted from the pond at Nagshankar temple in Assam’s Sonitpur district to a facility run by Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) in Biswanath district, where they will be reared for nearly a year before their release into the wild. “Earlier, there have been attempts at taking hatchlings straight from the pond and releasing them directly into the wild. But since they were very small, chances of their survival were rather slim,” said Shailendra Singh, TSA, chief, India. “Friday’s relocation is the first time that individuals of the species have been transferred from the temple pond to a specialised turtle facility in Assam’s Biswanath district for their conservation,” he added. The black softshell turtle is native to major rivers and their tributaries in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. The majority of this species’ population, however, lives in sacred temple ponds. The Nagshankar temple pond, which has around 250-300 such turtles, has one of the biggest captive population of the species. Though the IUCN list mentions the species as extinct in the wild, in the past 10-15 years few black softshell turtles have been spotted in the Brahmaputra river basin in Assam. Unfortunately, the turtles’ presence was not documented. “We collected the turtle eggs in April and incubated them artificially in the Nagshankar temple premises. The hatchlings were born in July. We will raise them until they weigh around 1 kilogram (kg), which should take about one year. This will reduce the possibility of predation and increase their survival chances in the wild,” said Parimal Ray, project coordinator, TSA. The organisation has been working with Nagshankar temple authorities and other temple management committees in Assam since 2013 by looking after the upkeep of the ponds and their turtle population. Simultaneously, TSA has been working on a strategy to rebuild the turtle’s wild population in the Brahmaputra river basin. “This is an encouraging initiative, as the numbers of the species seen in the wild are low and not meticulously documented. Rearing them in a facility until they are a bit bigger will increase their chances of survival in the wild,” said Mukut Chandra Das, divisional forest officer (DFO), Biswanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-effort-to-revive-a-turtle-species-considered-extinct-in-wild/story-vlZplKwuSPF1DjUOaXpNnI.html

14-08-2020||India||Wanted UP MLA Vijay Mishra arrested from Madhya Pradesh district||Vijay Mishra, a Nishad Party member of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) legislative assembly (MLA) from Gyanpur in Bhadohi district, was arrested from Madhya Pradesh’s (MP) Agar district in the Malwa region on Friday, a day after he had released a video, expressing fear that the UP Police could eliminate him because of his Brahmin identity. “Mishra, the four-time MLA from Bhadohi’s Gyanpur constituency, has been arrested in MP in a case related to alleged grabbing of property and issuing death threat to the family of Krishna Mohan Tiwari. He has been booked under sections 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 347 (wrongful confinement), 387 (putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 449 (house-trespass) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC (Indian Penal Code),” said Rambadan Singh, superintendent of police (SP), Bhadohi. “The MLA had been arrested following the complaint filed by Tiwari,” SP Singh said. “A team has been sent to MP to bring the MLA back to Bhadohi. Mishra’s wife Ramlali and his son Vishnu, who are also named in the complaint, will be arrested soon,” he said On August 8, Tiwari had lodged a case against Mishra; Ramlali, the Mirzapur-Sonbhadra member of the UP legislative council (MLC); and son Vishnu, alleging that they had threatened him and had forcibly grabbed his property. On Thursday, Mishra, who had quit the Samajwadi Party (SP) before the 2017 assembly election after he was denied a party ticket and had contested and won the poll on a Nishad Party ticket from Gyanpur constituency for the fourth time, had released a video. In the video, he had alleged that the UP Police was harassing him and his family since he is a Brahmin and a four-time MLA. He alleged that police could eliminate him in an encounter. In the video, the MLA claimed, “My wife and son have been framed in a fake case. Since I am a Brahmin and a four-time MLA from Gyanpur, I am being harassed. All this is being done to ensure that a mafia from Chandauli or Varanasi or Ballia could contest the election from Bhadohi. I may be murdered.” The police, however, rejected his allegations. In a video statement, the SP said, “The allegations are false and a gimmick to divert attention from his criminal acts and to create confusion in the minds of the public. He has been charged in as many as 73 cases. The allegations levelled by him are false and baseless.” Mishra has been assigned a personal armed guard for his security, despite dozens of cases against him, the SP added.Meanwhile, Ramlali has gone missing under mysterious circumstances from Prayagraj’s George Town area since Thursday late evening, police said hours after the arrest of Mishra. Police said her personal armed guard Ishwar Chand gave the information that she has gone missing. Dr. Dharmvir Singh, SP, Mirzapur, asked Chand to file a missing complaint at George Town police station. SP Bhadohi said she deliberately went missing to evade arrest, but efforts are on to nab her soon. Ramlali, who was elected as an MLC from Mirzapur-Sonbhadra seat on an SP ticket, was expelled from the party in February 2017 for supporting her husband in the UP assembly election. A Bhadohi court has also rejected her interim bail application. Additional District Judge PN Srivastava rejected her bail plea and directed her to approach the Allahabad special MLA/Member of Parliament (MP) court. Ramlali’s daughter Rima Mishra had moved the interim bail application for her and Vishnu. Dinesh Pandey, the UP government counsel, said the court has stayed the arrest of Vishnu until the hearing of his interim bail application is over. The court will hear his bail plea next on August 20.

14-08-2020||India||Military talks with China hit roadblock as Indian Army plays hardball, say top officials||Military talks with China on reducing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) have hit a roadblock, with the Indian Army playing hardball with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in its attempts to restore status quo ante of early April in eastern Ladakh. The Indian Army has also asserted that the sanctity of the LAC is non-negotiable, top government officials said on Friday on condition of anonymity. Five rounds of top-level military talks have failed to break the deadlock due to serious differences between the two sides in the Finger Area near Pangong Lake and the PLA’s reluctance to vacate positions held by it in what New Delhi claims as Indian territory. Also read | A timeline: India-China’s deadliest border clash since 1975 explained“Talks are stuck in a stalemate because of the India Army’s insistence that the PLA must withdraw to positions held by it as of April 2020, and the Chinese reluctance to restore status quo ante in some areas,” said one of the officials cited above. The Finger Area—a set of eight cliffs jutting out of Sirijap range overlooking Pangong Lake—has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process with little hope of immediate resolution. Disengagement has progressed somewhat smoothly at friction points in Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, but its pace remains sluggish in Gogra area. “The Indian Army has clearly told the PLA that shifting of the LAC in any area is not acceptable. This was most recently conveyed on August 2, when corps commanders from the two sides met. There is no question of us budging,” said a second official. There is growing consensus among Indian officials and China experts that military talks are unlikely to deliver further results, and the resolution of the issue will require politico-diplomatic intervention. Also read: PLA still at LAC, India plans new ways to counter China’s wolf-warrior diplomacy“The PLA is facing unanticipated consequences of its misadventure in Ladakh because of the Indian Army’s strong response. It will ultimately have to look for a face-saving exit strategy. We have made preparations for a long haul,” said a third official. De-escalation along the disputed border can only begin after complete disengagement between the two armies on the LAC. The ground situation remains unchanged in Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas. On August 10, chief of defence staff Gen Bipin Rawat informed a committee of lawmakers that de-escalation in Ladakh could be a long-drawn process but the Indian military is prepared for this and has made all arrangement for the long haul through the harsh winter. “Our posturing is unambiguous – status quo ante has to be restored and we will not accept any shifting of the LAC. The ball is in China’s court now. Achieving our goal will take time and we will have to be patient,” said Lt Gen (retired) Vinod Bhatia, a former director general of military operations. The August 2 military negotiations between corps commanders came three days after Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong said his country’s traditional boundary line on the northern bank of Pangong Lake was in accordance with the LAC and there was no case of Beijing expanding its territorial claim. Sun’s contention was a clear indication of the Chinese hard line on its claims in the Finger Area. Before PLA grabbed positions on Finger Four overlooking Indian deployments, the Indian Army would patrol right up to Finger Eight that New Delhi considers within Indian territory. Also read | ‘Lies, half-truths’: India rebuts Pak charges on J&K, China’s media blanks it outThe new positions held by PLA have curtailed the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are 8 km apart. During a visit to Ladakh on July 17, defence minister Rajnath Singh said progress in negotiations should help resolve the border dispute but added he “couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation will be resolved”. The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, remains a concern, with Beijing yet to deliver on understandings regarding disengagement reached during the July 5 phone conversation of the Special Representatives on the border issue and meetings of corps commanders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-talks-with-china-hit-roadblock-as-indian-army-plays-hardball-say-top-officials/story-VwfgQ11txXNRg4JFYH29YO.html

14-08-2020||India||Industry forgets you if you reject too many projects: Pawan Shankar||After a seven-year sabbatical, actor Pawan Shankar is back to pursue his inner calling — acting! “I have learnt it the hard way. In a quest to do something different when an actor says no to a lot of projects for some time the industry tends to forget you. Whereas, if one accepts then it can open new doors for you so I have decided to give it a shot this time,” said the UPite on his comeback. Pawan was last seen playing lead in a TV show ‘Kya Hua Tera Wada’ opposite Mona Singh way back in 2013 and now in 2020 he is back on screen. He will be seen playing antagonist in the upcoming film ‘Bhuj: The Pride of India.’ “I got busy expanding my business. I organised some 250 fashion exhibitions and 50 education expos. My business engagements made my passion for acting take a back seat. Last year in October, I had a discussion with my son and decided to make a comeback. It was during the lockdown that I thought to rework on my craft and fitness,” he said over phone. Within a week of his comeback he bagged a role in a TV daily ‘Guddan Tumse Na Payega,’ which continued for three months. This was followed by ‘Bhuj…’ which he shot till mid-March this year. “Getting an impactful negative role on TV as well as playing antagonist in a feature film gave me the kind of comeback I was always looking for. I am happy to share screen with likes of Ajay Devgn, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha and Sharad Kelkar. In the film I play ISI chief,” said Pawan who also done a short film ‘You & Me.’ Talking more about his projects, the ‘Kasam Se’ actor shared that he was in talks for a few more TV shows, “I think for the time being it’s safe to take up TV shows than films. I am in talks for shows and in final stage of confirming one of them. Budgets have gone down in a big way but that is how it is. We have gone back by six-seven years in terms of remuneration. The rise of OTT has brought small and big actors both on same level. Also we are living in an era where films, TV and web all mediums are available on our mobile phones so too much work is happening but content is and will be the king always.” Other than reading Pawan went back to his childhood love — table tennis during the lockdown. He has been a sub-junior national champion and UP champion in junior. “I picked up playing table tennis again. My son’s trainer, who is coach of Indian national TT champion, started training me as well. And it’s doing well for my fitness. The phase may have been bad for my business but gave me back my game and acting,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/industry-forgets-you-if-you-reject-too-many-projects-pawan-shankar/story-aUnycd9ljTK2il9URBsHTI.html

Baghel has drawn Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar’s attention to the gaping holes in the draft EIA notification, 2020. He made an impassioned plea that the key environmental policy guideline should be in consonance with the rights of the tribals and rural bodies in a state such as Chhattisgarh. Also read: Centre gets 1.7 million suggestions on draft EIA“Bastar, Surguja, Koria, and Kavardha have been included in the ‘Scheduled Area’ under Article 244 (1) of the Constitution (Fifth Schedule), which provides protection to these areas against such laws that are derogatory to the land rights of indigenous population of Chhattisgarh. At the outset, an executive action by way of a ‘notification’ cannot override the statutory protection granted under FRA (Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers [Recognition of Forest Rights] Act, 2006) and PESA (Panchayats [Extension to Scheduled Areas] Act, 1996). The EIA notification, 2020, should be in consonance with the rights of the tribals and panchayats,” the CM stated in his letter to Javadekar. Baghel cited that the section 4 of the PESA Act empowers a gram sabha/panchayat to prevent alienation of land and to approve plans and projects. It is also mandatory to consult with a gram sabha/panchayat before acquiring land for a developmental project and rehabilitating the local population affected by the commercial venture. He pointed out that the draft EIA notification, 2020, glossed over the mandate and did not make it mandatory for the project proponent to get any such approval from a rural body that grossly undermined the rights and interests of panchayats in Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs)-dominated areas of Chhattisgarh. Baghel raised the issue of extending exemption to large number of projects from public hearing as per the policy draft, which, he argued, would adversely affect the rights of the forest-dwellers to conserve, manage and protect forests in line with section 3 of the FRA, 2006, which deals with the right to minor forest produce (MFP), a key source of sustenance for the SC and ST population of Chhattisgarh. He also expressed concern over the dilution of panchayats’ power under section 5 of the FRA, 2006 that deals with protection of wildlife, forests, bio-diversity, adjoining catchment areas, water resources and ecological-sensitive zones. Also read| Draft EIA objections: Aaditya Thackeray says ‘voice of people and mother nature must be heard’“The draft EIA notification, 2020, states that levelling of the land without any tree felling and geo-technical investigations does not require prior green clearance. Levelling of project sites may have impact on landscapes, mountains slopes causing soil erosion and can trigger landslides. Geotechnical investigation for roads, hydropower projects and other ventures, which involve heavy construction activities, may have serious impact on the environment,” the CM stated. The draft EIA notification, 2020, grants wide discretion to the executive to define certain terms like “projects involving other strategic considerations” (clause 5, sub-clause 7) without providing guidelines or broad contours to determine its scope. The notification leaves it to the executive’s wisdom to decide its scope and ambit, where there is ample room for subjectivity and arbitrariness that cannot be wished away, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-raises-objection-over-draft-eia-notification-writes-to-union-environment-min/story-X13XA2WJNtwwIZtoi1KSbM.html

Congress MLA Srinivas Murthy’s house was also attacked, looted and set on fire by the mob upset over a derogatory Facebook post by Murthy’s nephew.“SDPI is a silly organisation. We’re thinking of banning it. Two decisions will be taken shortly. First, properties of those involved in violence (in Bengaluru) will be confiscated. Secondly: banning SDPI. These two matters will be discussed in cabinet meet on Aug 20,” Karnataka minister for rural development and panchayati raj KS Eshwarappa was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read: SDPI role under scanner: Minister Earlier state deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan had also said that the government was considering banning SDPI, four of whose members have been arrested in connection with the violence.Home minister Basavaraj Bommai has said that SDPI’s role in the violence was emerging through the scrutiny of video footage of the riots.“As per the information gathered so far and video footage [available], most importantly the role of SDPI is coming to light. We are collecting more information regarding it, we are investigating deeply in this regard,” Bommai said.Senior district level functionaries of SDPI have been arrested and are being questioned by the probe teams.Watch: Bengaluru violence: Tejasvi Surya on Congress-SDPI link; says ‘make rioters pay’“Already, several SDPI office bearers have been arrested.

Putting behind the acrimony of the past month, when he rebelled questioning the working style of Ashok Gehlot, who called his former deputy “nikkamma, nakkara”, Pilot was firm in his defence of the state government.“Having completed all the talks, we have come to the assembly today. It may rain fire at this frontline, but we all and I will be the shield, club and spear and will protect,” said Pilot in Hindi as he rose up to speak. The 42-year-old leader, who was the deputy CM when he last sat in the House, found himself on the opposite end of the House, a far distance from his earlier seat next to the CM. This prompted jibes and jeers from the opposition BJP.“I was safe on the seat I used to sit on earlier. Then I thought why have I been allotted a different seat. I saw that this is the border - ruling party on one side, opposition on other. Who is sent to the border? The strongest warrior,” said Pilot, downplaying the change in seating plan. The Tonk MLA said all of them are present in the assembly and stand united. “Whatever I or my colleagues had to say or do, we have done before a doctor and after treatment, all of us, all 107 of them, are united in the House,” said Pilot, amid thumping of the desk by Congress leaders. The Congress promised to look into his grievances and formed a three-member panel to give a formal shape to his request and its seriousness to resolve the issue. In a House of 200, the Congress has 107 MLAs and the support of independents and allies. The BJP has 72 members. The BJP, despite lacking the numerical strength, has decided to move a no-confidence motion against the Gehlot government. The CM, in a counter move, has sought a trust vote, which will buy his six months’ time to put his own in order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-be-shield-club-spear-for-party-sachin-pilot-in-rajasthan-assembly/story-CWK5SCifjZQK3u5JKkZAgL.html

We may report between 10,000 to 20,000 cases per day,” she said in a video campaign urging the youth to join the “Covid Brigade” to halt the pandemic spread.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNoting that the death rate graph will start rising if the positive cases shoot up, the Minister said it should be stopped.“We must also understand that the death toll will increase with the rise in the number of cases. So, we need to put a hold on the rise in cases. For that the people must cooperate. They should strictly follow the health protocol of wearing masks, handwashing and social distancing in order to break the chain of virus from spreading,” Shailaja said.India’s first Covid-19 case was reported from the southern state on January 30 when a woman medical student tested positive on her return to the state from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus.The second and third cases in the country were also Wuhan returnees.On May 5, the state had 500 cases, which doubled to 1000 by May 27.On July 4, Kerala reported 5000 cases, by July 16 the state breached the 10,000 mark and by July 28, over 20,000 cases were reported.On Thursday, Kerala recorded 1,564 cases, taking the total infection tally to 39,708. Three deaths were also reported yesterday, taking the toll to 129.Appealing to the youth to join the ‘Covid Brigade,’ which will become a model to the world, she said thousands of health workers and other personnel are fighting the pandemic. There is a need for more volunteers -- both medical and non medical -- to come forward and join the war against the disease. Practitioners of modern medicine as well as ayurveda, homeo, dental along with lab technicians, pharmacists and nurses can join the brigade.“People from non-medical fields like MSW, MHA, MBA holders, are required for the fight and they should also register for joining our Covid Brigade. All those who wish to volunteer should register for joining. This historic move will be a model to the world,” she pointed out.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on July 23, announced the formation of the ‘Covid Brigade’ consisting of doctors, nurses, para medical staff and volunteers to man the First Line Treatment Centres (FLTC).“More people are needed to strengthen Covid defensive operations in view of the rising numbers of cases.

14-08-2020||India||Supreme Court rejects bail plea of Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra, Ajay Chandra||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to grant bail to Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra.A division bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said that the two brothers have not complied with the October 2017 order of the Supreme Court as per which Rs 750 crore was to be deposited with the registry of the court by December 31, 2017, to be eligible for bail.The two brothers had claimed in their fresh bail application that they had deposited more than Rs 770 crore. The court, however, noted that the deposit was made after the deadline.Further, a part of the amount deposited by the two came from monetisation of assets of Unitech and from tax refunds.The court, therefore, refused to release them on bail while also making it clear that any modification of October 2017 order can be made only by a three-judge bench since the 2017 order was passed by a bench of three judges.Sanjay Chandra was granted interim bail on July 7 for one month taking into account the fact that both his parents were infected with the coronavirus disease. With the period of interim bail having expired, the apex court asked Chandra to surrender before the authorities by Monday.He was arrested by the Economic Offices Wing of the Delhi police in March 2017. Investigating authorities have maintained that prima facie probe indicated that money which has been realised from the flat buyers has been siphoned off.A forensic audit report submitted before the Supreme Court by Grant and Thornton in December 2019 revealed that an amount of Rs 14,270 crore was collected by Unitech from 29,800 homebuyers. Out of that amount, Rs 13,364 crores was traced to the bank statements. Almost 90 per cent of the money was received between 2006 to 2014, the report said. The report also said that the money trail analysis revealed that out of the collections from the homebuyers amounting to Rs 13,364.55 crore, approximately Rs 5,063.05 crore, or 40 per cent, was potentially not utilised by the Unitech group towards the construction/execution of the 74 identified projects.The court had in January this year accepted the central government’s proposal to replace the board of directors of Unitech with nominee directors. It ordered supersession of the board of directors of Unitech in order to facilitate the takeover of management by the directors constituted in terms of the proposal submitted by the Union government. The new board is headed by retired IAS officer Yudhvir Singh Malik.In October 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered that Chandras will be entitled to bail upon deposit of Rs 750 crore with the court registry.However, since the condition was not complied with, they continued to remain in jail. The top court had in, January 2019, rejected their bail plea for the same reason.“At this stage, the admitted facts before the court indicate that the order for the deposit of Rs 750 crore has not been complied with. The prayer for enlargement on bail is misconceived because the petitioners have been admitted to bail, subject to the condition of deposit which is not fulfilled,” the court had said in its 2019 order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-unitech-promoters-sanjay-chandra-ajay-chandra/story-oZgfm2WScyTigdKPa2ZtOJ.html

The two-member HC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Surendra Tavade, was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Associate for Aiding Justice, seeking reopening of places of worship for all faiths. Advocate Dipesh Siroya, the petitioner’s counsel, submitted before the court since the Central government has allowed reopening of temples and also because the pandemic situation in Maharashtra has improved, the state government should follow suit. He pleaded that the government might not allow religious functions to be held in temples and could also restrict the number of devotees’ visit to a shrine, but the public can still be allowed darshan. The bench, however, refused to accept the claim that the pandemic situation in Maharashtra has improved. “Please pray at home and if have some love left for the humanity, please don’t press for these prayers,” said the bench. “If the situation improves, this court, being the temple of justice, will be the first to reopen, before any other temple opens for devotees,” it added. Nisha Mehra, assistant government pleader, opposed the PIL and pointed out that the state government on Wednesday (August 12) had rejected the representations for reopening of temples, and a co-ordinate bench had refused the prayer for interim relief for reopening of Jain temples for the nine-day holy festival of Paryushan, which starts from Saturday (August 15). The bench also directed Siroya to clarify the status of the petitioner body after noticing that it has been registered as a company. “How can a company espouse religious rights?” the bench asked. The PIL will be heard next on Tuesday (August 18).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/situation-in-maharashtra-not-yet-conducive-to-reopening-of-temples-bombay-hc/story-7xuwuTmMrqvonMgNnkTAYP.html
14-08-2020||India||Inspector MC Sharma, killed in 2008 Batla House encounter, gets 7th gallantry medal||Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who died in the 2008 Batla House encounter, has been awarded gallantry medal posthumously. Sharma worked in the Delhi Police’s Special Cell.The Union home ministry on Friday released the list of police personnel who have been awarded the medals a day before the Independence Day.While 215 police personnel have been given the medal for gallantry, 80 will get the President’s Police Medal for distinguished service and 631 for meritorious service.Sharma, then 44, had suffered three bullets when he went to capture five suspected terrorists hiding in south Delhi’s Batla House September 19, 2008. He later succumbed to the injuries in a hospital.He had joined Delhi Police as a sub-inspector in 1989 and soon proved himself to be a cop with a nose to the ground. Sharma was given an out-of-turn promotion and made inspector in 1995.However, the citation which mentions the act of bravery of an award winner has not been released so far. So it is not clear if Sharma has been given the award for the encounter or any previous act of gallantry. He was awarded the Ashok Chakra in 2009.This is Sharma’s seventh gallantry medal. He was awarded the president’s medal seven times.This year, the gallantry awards list is topped by the police personnel from Jammu and Kashmir who have won 81 medals. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) with 51 medals is at the second spot.The home ministry officials familiar with the selection process said that majority of gallantry medals went to these two forces due to counter-insurgency operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inspector-mc-sharma-killed-in-2008-batla-encounter-gets-7th-gallantry-medal/story-0vYLmNOKbsrcSwK89n6K2I.html
14-08-2020||India||Shiv Sena downplays Pawar’s comment on kin||Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Friday downplayed the public admonition of Ajit Pawar’s son Parth by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, saying the young politician should take the rebuke as a blessing. An editorial in Saamana, however, wondered if Parth was being used by someone to damage Maharashtra’s “pride and identity” through the demand for a CBI probe in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s case. The NCP president on Wednesday said he attached “absolutely no importance” to his grandnephew Parth’s recent demand for the CBI probe into Rajput’s death, and described the young leader as “immature”. Pawar said he had faith in Mumbai Police, but added he wouldn’t oppose anyone wanting an investigation by the central agency in the case. The editorial in Saamana said Pawar’s statement was “blown out of proportion” by the media and it was “not even a storm in a teacup”. It said: “These news channels create artificial storm for their livelihood. Pawar’s comments on Parth are being construed as a sign that not all is well in the Pawar family and that Ajit Pawar has been warned...Actually, this is all meaningless.” It added, “Sharad Pawar is a senior leader and head of a political party. He can admonish the young. Even late (Shiv Sena founder) Bal Thackeray has done that.” Parth had demanded a CBI probe into the actor’s death in a letter sent to Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on July 27. Similar demands have been made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal opposition party in Maharashtra. “Parth Pawar wrote to home minister Anil Deshmukh stating that CBI should probe Sushant Singh Rajput case. He said on social media some filmmakers should also be investigated. It would be foolishness to demand a CBI inquiry in the Sushant case. Some experienced people are backing the demand for the CBI inquiry. It should be understood that there is a conspiracy going on to hurt Maharashtra’s self-respect and identity. Is the young Parth Pawar being used for this?” the editorial questioned. The Shiv Sena advised Parth to use the experience of senior leaders in his party to learn. “Parth Pawar is new in politics and he was unsuccessful in winning the Lok Sabha election. He has to work hard. There is a political gymnasium in his house. Therefore, he has a chance to prepare himself,” it said. The editorial welcomed Parth’s stance on the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and said, “There is nothing wrong in speaking in favour of Ram mandir which is being constructed with the Supreme Court’s approval. (Congress leaders) Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, too, have expressed their views. “Uddhav Thackeray visited Ayodhya. But nobody wrote long letters to express their views like Parth.” It added the NCP chief’s daughter and MP Supriya Sule too had said that going to Ayodhya is similar to praying at Pandharpur for many people and there should be “no criticism” of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-downplays-pawar-s-comment-on-kin/story-rZm0a4cLpM4fd2zDutpPjL.html

14-08-2020||India||‘I am back..hopefully as a better and trained actor’||Dancer, actor, TV anchor, comedian, Raghav Juyal feels that he has finally arrived as a performer, “I started with a dance reality show and there was no looking back as I kept getting work and simultaneously, was doing films too. But something was missing. I felt I had to understand the art of acting too. I realised it was time to work on my acting skills and become a ‘real’ actor not just a filler.”Hailing from Dehradun, Raghav was in his hometown for almost four months before work beckoned him back to Mumbai. “When the lockdown was announced, I decided to reach home and be with my family as I need them with me always. Once in Doon, I met up with childhood friends, and soon we were our old selves. What fun I had here.“Initially there were no Covid-19 cases here, so we used to play football. I tried my hand at guava farming and relived my school days. It was during one of those fun football games that I fractured my knee ligament, so I had to undergo complete rest. Soon, I got a call for a shoot in Mumbai. Though my family was a bit apprehensive of me going back to Mumbai but I persuaded them as I feel I have ‘Pahadi’ immunity and that will keep me safe.”Raghav believes that honesty and impulsiveness that has been inculcated in him since childhood has helped him always. “Yes, these traits have supported me throughout my journey. Though life and people in the industry have been kind to me and helped me but being a small town guy with no TV or film background was surely challenging. I have never shied from asking if I don’t know a thing, be it acting or dancing. That’s the reason I went ahead with acting training and film-making workshops in the last few years.“I trained under acting coach Saurabh Sachdeva and did quite a few plays with him too. This I had to do to polish my craft and make a mark in acting too. Then I gave auditions and started clearing them at the first go. Now, I feel I am back in business, hopefully as a better and trained actor,” said Raghav who was seen in films like ‘ABCD 2,’ ‘Street Dancer 3D’ and ‘Nawabzaade.’Talking about his upcoming projects, he said, “I completed a film ‘Bahut Hua Sammaan’, directed by Ashish Shukla, and with biggies like Sanjay Mishra, Swanand Kirkire and Ram Kapoor. Trust me, it was a truly learning experience for me.” ‘BHS’ was completely shot in Varanasi.“I’m absolutely thrilled to play a dark character in one of my upcoming web series ‘Abhay-2’ directed by Ken Ghosh. It is an eight-part suspense thriller with each episode having a different villain and something different from what we have seen. I think the audience will enjoy it. It was a good experience and I got the chance to share the screen with senior artistes like Chunky Pandey, Kunal Khemu, Asha Negi and many more experienced actors,” Raghav concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-am-back-hopefully-as-a-better-and-trained-actor/story-k13A3djRqXdjHh1MI020xI.html

The dissident MLAs (Pilot and 18 others) have now returned to the party fold.Also read: Rajasthan Assembly session: After truce, CM Ashok Gehlot to move confidence motion, BJP to counter itThe Congress has said that it is united to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is planning to bring a no-confidence motion against the Ashok Gehlot government.The BJP had said on Thursday that the truce is temporary. “This government won’t last long,” former chief minister and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje had said yesterday.Both Pilot and Raje are present in the House.The Gehlot government has already indicated that it is keen on a floor test despite the truce because the party thinks it is the perfect way to send across a message of unity. A floor test will also give some breather to Gehlot to let him put his house in order since a motion can be moved only once in a session.With the return of the rebels, the Congress alone has 107 legislators, including the speaker, in the 200-member House where the majority mark is 101. It also appears to have the support of all 13 independents; three of them backed Pilot and have now pledged support to Gehlot. Five MLAs from other parties, too, back the government in the House.

14-08-2020||India||Surpeme Court holds Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court||The Supreme Court on Friday held advocate Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt of court over his tweets casting aspersions on Chief Justice SA Bobde and the top court. A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra pronounced the judgment at 11 am, and said it will hold a separate hearing to decide the punishment to be given to Bhushan. “We find you guilty of contempt of court. We will hear you on sentence aspect,” ruled the bench that included justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari. The hearing on the sentencing will be held on August 20. According to the contempt of courts act, the offence carries a punishment of up to six months in prison or a fine up to Rs 2,000 or both. Bhushan had posted two tweets, one against the Supreme Court on June 27 and another against Bobde on June 29. He was served notice by the Supreme Court on July 22. The first tweet, reproduced in the court order, said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.” The second referred to the Bobde and was also cited in the order. It said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!” Bhushan had refused to apologise for his tweets, contending they are protected by the freedom of speech guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution. He cited the speeches on dissent made by Supreme Court judges DY Chandrachud on February 15 and Deepak Gupta on February 24 to buttress his case. Deepak Gupta retired on May 6. Another suo motu contempt petition is pending before the same bench against Bhushan for calling past chief justices corrupt in a 2009 interview to Tehelka magazine. Bhushan, in that case, had offered an explanation for his statements but the Supreme Court refused to accept it and ruled, on August 10, that it will proceed with the case. That case is now listed for hearing on August 17. The court closed contempt proceedings against Twitter Inc accepting it’s explanation that it is only an intermediary and had also shown it’s bona fides by suspending the controversial tweets immediately after the top court initiated the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-holds-prashant-bhushan-guilty-of-contempt-of-court/story-dkfu19bg3GvDTviCc2Kr2O.html

Raut had previously said that the actor was not on good terms with his father. The actor’s family members had raised an objection to Raut’s remarks and even asked for an apology. On Friday, Raut said that he has full sympathy for Rajput’s family. “Yesterday I just said that they should’ve some patience but it was shown that I’ve threatened them. Was that a threat? Trust Mumbai Police. If you think they’re not doing a good job, then go to CBI.” he said. The Shiv Sena MP said that Rajput “was our son” and Bollywood is Mumbai’s family. “What enmity will we have? Even we want his family to get justice. We want the secret behind his death to come out,” he added. On Wednesday, Rajput’s cousin and BJP MLA Neeraj Kumar Bablu sent a legal notice to Raut over his controversial remarks on the late actor’s family, his lawyer said.He had asked Raut to apologize publicly in 48 hours or “Raut has told the media that Rajput’s father had married twice, which was the reason the slain actor was unhappy with his father. This is completely untrue and baseless”, MLA’s counsel Birendra Kumar Jha said. Raut, in his response, said that his remarks were based on the information he has. “If there has been any kind of miss on our part, we will think about it. But I will have to look into it. What I have said so far is based on the information I have, Sushant’s family is speaking on the basis of information they have,” Raut had said.The thirty-four-year-old actor died by suicide on June 14 and was found dead at his Bandra residence by Mumbai Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-was-our-son-want-his-family-to-get-justice-sanjay-raut/story-zn30hXXZ4z3PlOKp4yYhzM.html
14-08-2020||India||Possibility of consent can’t be countenanced in case of a 13-yr-old rape survivor: Bombay HC||The possibility of consent cannot be countenanced in case of a minor rape survivor (13), the Bombay high court (HC) said while rejecting plea of a rape convict for bail during pendency of his appeal. “The prosecutrix (survivor) at the time of the incident was only 13 years of age, and, as a result, the argument that it could be a consensual act cannot be accepted,” said Justice CV Bhadang while rejecting application of Sagar Sahi, a driver, who was, ironically, employed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for the welfare of children. Sahi was convicted last year for raping a minor in 2015 and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. He had moved a plea before HC seeking bail during pendency of his appeal against the conviction and the sentence. It was argued, on his behalf, that the medical report of the survivor would show that there were no external injuries on the person of the rape survivor. Expressing possibility that the act could be consensual and the rape survivor could be a consenting party, the lawyer of the convict submitted that it was necessary to bring on record the call data record of conversations between the convict and the rape survivor, but the investigating officer (IO) of the case failed to do so. Justice Bhadang, however, refused to accept the contention as far as consent is concerned. The judge added that the absence of external injuries cannot be prima face considered a proof in favour of the accused, while citing the definition of rape under section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The judge also pointed out to the irony that the convict was employed by an NGO as a driver to work for the welfare of children but has been charged and sentenced for sexually assaulting a minor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/possibility-of-consent-can-t-be-countenanced-in-case-of-a-13-yr-old-rape-survivor-bombay-hc/story-TLXjtAyopwQ8IsZ9IY1S1K.html
14-08-2020||India||Villagers reject Goa govt’s overture to exclude temple from IIT campus||Panaji: Goa government’s overture to exclude 45,000 square (sq) metres (m) from the Indian Institute of Technology’s (IIT)-Goa campus has been rebuffed by the residents of Xel Melaulim village, as they have reiterated their opposition to setting up of the institute citing environmental hazards such as razing up to 10 lakh sq m of pristine forestland.They have warned of intensifying the stir, if their demands are not paid heed to. The villagers rejected the state government’s proposal following a Cabinet decision for the exemption on Wednesday. “In a single day, you can pass a Cabinet resolution that 45,000 sq m be excluded from the setting up of the IIT. Then, in a single day you can also take a decision to denotify the land for the institute. Why can’t you do what we want?” Shankar Naik, a resident of Xel Melaulim, where the proposed IIT permanent campus is being planned, told media persons. Another villager Shubham Shivolkar echoed Naik and said their grievances are yet to be redressed. “We have written to Chief Minister Pramod Sawant that the land is our sole source of sustenance. Why do you want to evict us?” he asked. On Wednesday, CM Sawant had announced that the village temple and the surrounding land in Xel Melaulim, measuring up to 45,000 sq m, would be excluded during the construction of a permanent campus for IIT-Goa. “Another parcel of land of a similar area size will be included for the IIT campus. I request those opposing the project to withdraw their opposition,” the CM had appealed. But, the unfazed villagers have sent a fresh letter to the CM reiterating their stand. “We are shocked beyond belief that the state government is trying to portray itself like a kind donor, giving 45,000 sq m of our land for our temple. The entire 12 lakh sq m, bearing survey number 67/1 of Xel Melaulim, belong to us, including religious places of worship, agricultural land, forests, grazing ground, and water resources,” stated the fresh letter, undersigned by 104 villagers. “The morally, legally and socio-economically correct position is that the land belongs to local communities and not the state government,” it added. “We are dependent on our land for sustenance. We oppose the setting up of the IIT campus in our village. We will intensify our agitation, if the state government refuses to pay heed to our warning and still goes ahead with its plan,” Shivolkar warned. However, the government has all along maintained that the villagers have no rights over the land since it is a state property. Xel Melaulim village is located in Goa’s eastern corner in the foothills of the Western Ghats and over 50 kilometres (km) away from the state capital Panaji. Rumblings of protest and murmurs of discontent were started by residents of Xel Melaulim village and from adjoining hamlets in early February, when the state government made it known that it would hand over the land for the IIT’s permanent campus in May. The proposed IIT campus’s setting has a dense vegetation interspersed with cashew trees that the villagers claimed have sustained them for generations. The agitating villagers have been demanding that the campus be shifted to another location that doesn’t entail such severe ecological damage. Though Xel Melaulim village falls in an eco-sensitive zone, it hasn’t been formally declared as one because the state government’s notification to that effect is still pending. Goa was allocated an IIT in 2014, but it has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College. Earlier, though the state government had identified two sites --- in Canacona and Sanguem sub-districts – to set up a permanent IIT campus, both were scrapped due to public protests and after the opposition had alleged a land scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-reject-goa-govt-s-overture-to-exclude-temple-from-iit-campus/story-h4IORHjSdcuiJHLFRnsSaK.html
14-08-2020||India||Supreme Court holds Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt for tweets against court, CJI SA Bobde||The Supreme Court on Friday held lawyer Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt for tweets against the court, and chief justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde.Bhushan had posted two tweets, one on the Supreme Court on June 27 and the second one on CJI Bobde on June 29. He was served notice by the apex court on July 22.The top court had on August 5 reserved its verdict in the matter after Bhushan defended his two alleged contemptuous tweets saying they were against the judges regarding their conduct in their personal capacity and they did not obstruct administration of justice.The first tweet, reproduced in the court, said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.” The second tweet said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Bhushan, in his affidavit, regretted saying Bobde was not wearing a helmet. He added he failed to notice the bike was stationary and that the CJI was not riding but merely sitting on it.On July 22, the top court had issued a show cause notice to Bhushan after initiating the criminal contempt against him for his two tweets.Another suo motu contempt petition is also pending before the same three-judge bench against Bhushan for calling past CJIs corrupt in a 2009 interview to Tehelka magazine. Bhushan had offered an explanation but the Supreme Court refused to accept the same and ruled, on August 10, that it will hear the matter in detail. That case is now listed for hearing on August 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-holds-prashant-bhushan-guilty-of-contempt-of-court-for-tweets-against-cji-sa-bobde-sc/story-mChDvJ23SOIjQE5rMdDbUP.html

The statement issued by the hospital said that the former president is under intensive care and continues to be on ventilatory support. “His vital parameters are presently stable,” it added. The hospital, in its morning update on Thursday, had said that Mukherjee is “deeply comatose with stable vital parameters and he continues to be on ventilatory support”. Mukherjee underwent a critical brain surgery to remove a clot in his brain after he suffered a fall at his Rajaji Marg residence on Sunday. Rumours about his health condition were doing the rounds on social media, but Mukherjee’s family took to Twitter to refute them.“My Father Shri Pranab Mukherjee is still alive & haemodynamically stable! Speculations & fake news being circulated by reputed Journalists on social media clearly reflects that Media in India has become a factory of Fake News,” Mukherjee’s elder son and former Congress MP Abhijit tweeted.His daughter and Congress leader Sharmishta urged media not to call her. “Rumours about my father is false. Request, esp’ly to media, NOT to call me as I need to keep my phone free for any updates from the hospital,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-president-pranab-mukherjee-continues-to-be-on-ventilator-medical-condition-unchanged-hospital/story-ThwS9gzPR4f3lHGO5d5rHM.html
14-08-2020||India||ED probes scam linked to embezzlement fraud in Brazil||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) last month launched an investigation against several Indian businessmen and companies for alleged money laundering linked to a provincial governor in Brazil, who is accused of embezzling funds worth $ 161 million, officials familiar with the development said. Based on a request from Brazil, the central anti-money laundering agency last month froze 67 bank accounts belonging to Indian businessmen and companies, the officials added, asking not to be named. In a letter by ED to State Bank of India’s 11, Sansad Marg branch on July 13, the bank was asked to freeze the accounts of J K Tyre, Hamilton Housewares Pvt Ltd, K P Sanghvi & Sons and six more companies as “ED is investigating a case under prevention of money laundering act (PMLA)”. It asked the bank not to allow any withdrawal from the accounts without its permission. HT has reviewed the ED’s letter to SBI. Similar letters were sent to other banks across India for freezing accounts of 58 more companies last month, officials cited above said. Responding to a plea by advocate Vijay Aggarwal on behalf of Hamilton Housewares challenging the freezing of the account, ED counsel Amit Mahajan informed the Delhi high court on Thursday that the agency has acted on Brazil’s request as there is a mutual legal agreement between the countries. ED, without sharing the name of Brazil’s provincial governor or investigation details from the South American nation, informed the high court the probe involves 53 countries and a sum of $161 million . Aggarwal argued the company’s business has been affected by ED’s action and it is not able to perform day-to-day business. He argued the action has been taken when it is not even known whether a scheduled offence has been registered or not and that ED has not supplied to the company “reasons to believe” to freeze the bank account. Aggarwal said there has been single payment of Rs 12.27 lakh in Hamilton about seven years ago for international transportation of goods and was reported to the Reserve Bank of India, which is said to be under investigation but the primary account, which has over Rs 45 crores, has been frozen. He pointed out that “due to the freezing of account, Hamilton has defaulted in payment of interest on its loans to the tune of Rs 14.73 lakh”. The company pleaded before the court that it be allowed to access its account so that business is not adversely affected. “Company has received a letter from the office of ED. We are ascertaining the relevant details from them,” said Neha Tiwary , chief manager, corporate communications at J K Tyre in an email reply. KP Sanghvi & Sons didn’t respond to email queries. Brazil has been plagued by corruption scandals since 2014 including the famous “Operation Car Wash” in which hundreds of politicians and businessmen are being investigated for money laundering and receiving kickbacks. Operation Car Wash began in 2014 as an investigation into allegations that executives at the state oil company Petrobras accepted bribes from construction firms in lieu of contracts. India and Brazil signed a mutual legal agreement treaty (MLAT) in January this year for cooperation in criminal matters. Sherbir Panag, international legal expert on white collar crimes, said : “It’s a welcome step that India is honouring its MLATs with other countries. It helps set a precedent that through such steps, India’s requests will also be reciprocated expeditiously. All of this notwithstanding, it’s time that guidelines are framed for freezing of accounts by investigating agencies. The freeze quantum should be on the basis of the proceed of crime amount and appropriate buffer, so that genuine business activity is not affected pending investigation. Blanket freezing, especially at a time when companies are struggling to get back to business due to the pandemic is unsustainable and unjustified”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-probes-scam-linked-to-embezzlement-fraud-in-brazil/story-G61sDvjuV9qB4IsBhBcb3N.html
14-08-2020||India||Congress spokesperson seeks civility in TV debates, writes to I&B minister||A day after Congress leader Rajiv Tyagi died of a heart attack after participating in a heated TV debate, his party colleague Jaiveer Shergill on Thursday asked the information and broadcasting ministry to restore “civility” in talk shows and issue an advisory to enforce a code of conduct for news channels. In a letter sent to information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, Shergill said it is imperative to restore civility through a code of conduct to “tame the slanderous beast” that television debates have become. “Constant interruptions coupled with toxic and defamatory smears impact the mental and physical well-being of all individuals on the panel,” he wrote. Shergill said issuing an advisory to media houses to follow the News Broadcasting Standards Authority’s (NBSA) guidelines to ensure mere civility is a must, and will serve as an appropriate tribute to Tyagi. Also read: Congress leader Rajiv Tyagi dies after cardiac arrestTagging his letter, Shergill tweeted, “My letter to I&B Minister Shri Prakash Javdekar Ji requesting him to issue an advisory to media to enforce a code of conduct to curb slanderous, sensationalist and toxic TV debates.”  My letter to I&B Minister Sh @PrakashJavdekar Ji requesting him to issue an advisory to Media to enforce a Code of Conduct to curb Slanderous,Sensationalist & Toxic TV Debates-High time to reinforce civility & mutual respect for sake of well being of participants & democracy pic.twitter.com/z3ooQjbX5fTyagi’s death has triggered a debate within the Congress over the participation of its spokespersons in TV debates. A Congress leader said while the party has not yet made a decision on boycotting TV debates, there are voices against the move. “It is high time TV channel owners, editors and anchors introspect on how some in the industry have reduced news debates into a meaningless, poisonous and potentially fatal activity. At times words can have the same impact as bullets,” tweeted senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel. The party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala criticised the alleged “poisonous debate and venomous spokespersons” and the “TRP business” on news channels. “How long will the poison of Hindu-Muslim division continue to engulf the soul of this country?” he asked. Congress leader Manish Tewari also took to Twitter to hit out at the alleged race for “TRP” among news channels. “Sad demise of Rajiv Tyagi reflects extreme stress spokespersons of political parties work under pro-bono. Some get Covid-19 due to stress induced lowered immunity, others just die while TV channels generate TRPs/revenue at their expense with some anchors becoming channel owners,” he said. Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma shared the concerns expressed by Shergill over the alleged “damage done by competitive sensationalism” in the media. “The brazen violation of NBA (News Broadcasters Association) guidelines and code need honest reflection and course correction,” he tweeted. Another Congress leader, Shashi Tharoor, said the issue raised by Shergill requires serious consideration, with due regard to freedom of expression and Article 19 provisions, as well as existing guidelines for conduct. “Since the subject is currently under discussion in the parliamentary committee, I will seek a report from the ministry,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-spokesperson-seeks-civility-in-tv-debates-writes-to-i-b-minister/story-Fuw1PfiLt9sSRXssSVM3DP.html

Based on the complaint, police arrested 12 people. They were later released on bail on Wednesday. However, according to Nagarik Suraksha Mancha general secretary Diptendu Nath, none of their members attacked the other group’s members. “The Manch members violated the lockdown norms by trying to hold meeting. Our members objected to it and later they had an altercation with them. But they didn’t attack anyone,” said Nath. A member of the Manch said that their aim is to maintain peace and harmony among all the communities in the state. “But our members were attacked and also injured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/members-of-pro-rss-group-claim-attack-by-locals-12-arrested-released-on-bail/story-m2V5hk9GwgpSUvbg34FlXJ.html
14-08-2020||India||Rajasthan Assembly session: After truce, CM Ashok Gehlot to move confidence motion, BJP to counter it||A crucial session of the Rajasthan Assembly will begin on Friday where chief minister Ashok Gehlot will move a vote of confidence to prove the majority of his Congress government.The chief minister chaired a Congress legislature party (CLP) meeting at his residence on Thursday, where the decision to move the vote of confidence was taken.Also Read: Gehlot, Pilot meet; BJP, Congress talk floor testThis came three days after a patch-up between Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot, who had rebelled against the chief minister over his style of functioning. Gehlot said he could have proved his majority even without the support of Pilot and 18 of his supporters, but that would not have given him happiness.“We could have proved our majority even without these 19 MLAs but it would not have given us happiness. We will bring a vote of confidence,” the chief minister said. Pilot was also present at the CLP meeting on Thursday and both the leaders shook hands and flashed victory signs.Also Read: ‘Forget what happened’: Sachin Pilot among audience, Ashok Gehlot hits resetThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, said that the truce between the two factions is temporary and announced it will move a no-confidence motion in the state Assembly. “This government won’t last long,” former chief minister and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje said on Thursday.Speaker CP Joshi can use his discretion to decide whether to allow the government or the BJP motion, according to analysts. An official at the assembly secretariat, who did not want to be named, said the government’s trust motion was likely to get preference. “This has been the tradition of the house,” said the official.With the return of the rebels, the Congress alone has 107 legislators, including the speaker, in the 200-member House where the majority mark is 101. It also appears to have the support of all 13 independents; three of them backed Pilot and have now pledged support to Gehlot. Five MLAs from other parties, too, back the government in the House. On the other hand, the BJP (72) and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party (3) have a total of 75 seats.The Gehlot government has already indicated that it is keen on a floor test despite the truce because the party thinks it is the perfect way to send across a message of unity. A floor test will also give some breather to Gehlot to let him put his house in order since a motion can be moved only once in a session.In a related development, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Thursday issued a whip for the second time to six of its MLAs in Rajasthan to vote against the Congress in any no-confidence motion or any other proceedings in the state Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-truce-rajasthan-assembly-session-to-begin-today-congress-bjp-talk-floor-test/story-g3BfgdyLpcFmzTQe65Gj3M.html

14-08-2020||India||Environmentalists oppose 3 infrastructure projects in Goa, CM Pramod Sawant suspects ‘foreign hand’||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday that he suspected the involvement of a foreign hand in opposition to projects in the state. Swant was talking about the protests against three projects - the Railway double tracking, the highway four laning and a power line all of which will pass through the wildlife sanctuaries and come at a huge cost to the environment.Speaking at the sidelines of an event, Sawant said that the opposition was more from abroad, than from locals residing in the vicinity.“The opposition is coming from Africa, England and Russia. Those who have not seen Goa and Mollem, are now commenting about it from foreign countries. On the other hand, those who stay in Mollem, say that if the road is widened it will be beneficial to them,” Sawant claimed.“We want power and water 24x7. We want good transport and road facilities. And at the same time we also need a good environment. Government is not keen on destroying the environment. We want to preserve it. If we cut 10 trees, we replant 100 trees. People do not understand this,” Sawant also said.Sawant’s comments come a day after a BJP leader at a press conference defended the project claiming the trio of projects would be beneficial for the state while also benefiting the wildlife. “It is because those in the past built infrastructure that today we are benefitting from it. What we build today, the future generations will thank us for,” a former BJP legislator Siddharth Kuncalienkar, said with the government and party eager to push back to the mounting opposition to the projects that will slice through the western ghats. The campaigners against the projects have, however, hit back at the ruling party. “Any observer including the BJP needs to be clear that destruction is not equal to development of the state and is a fallacy unless ‘the state’ now means ‘wealthy individuals and selected business interests’,” a statement issued by the group campaigning against the projects said.The activists have long believed that the projects, especially the railway line, is being built solely to facilitate the transport of imported coal from Goa’s Mormugao Port to steel plants in North Karnataka for whom Goa is the closest port. The railway line, by far the biggest of the three projects, will come at a cost of diversion of 113.857 hectares of forest land and felling of 18,541 trees. The second project - the four-laning of the existing two-lane highway that was constructed by the Portuguese colonial government between Panaji in Goa and Belgavi in Karnataka - will cost 31.015 hectares of forest land and 12,097 trees. Thirdly, a 400KV power line - 3.5 km of which passes through protected forest area - is also proposed. It will provide additional feed to Goa.These clearances have now been challenged before the Central Empowered Committee as well as the Bombay high court at Goa on grounds that they have been cleared in haste and threaten the rich bio-diversity of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environmentalists-oppose-3-infrastructure-projects-in-goa-cm-pramod-sawant-suspects-foreign-hand/story-AFCKhXt3LuKgxwA7LmxXKI.html

14-08-2020||India||Odisha to increase fines for violating Covid-19 guidelines to Rs 1 lakh, will amend epidemics act||With Covid-19 cases surging, Odisha government now plans to bring an ordinance to amend the epidemics act for increasing the punishment for non-compliance of the guidelines laid down for containing the spread of the pandemic.Chief secretary Asit Tripathy said that Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 would be amended to increase the imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or fine which may extend up to Rs 1 lakh or with both. As the state Assembly is not in session, the amendment to the act would be done through ordinance route, the chief secretary said. The move to make the punishment for violation of Covid-19 guidelines tougher was significant as the number of coronavirus disease cases in the state has crossed 52,000 and death toll stands at 314.Though the Centre had promulgated the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 on April 22 to include protection for healthcare personnel combating the disease and expanding the powers of the central government to prevent the spread of the pandemic, the state government now wants to amend the act for better implementation of the Covid-19 guidelines.“Though the Covid-19 guidelines in the state were being implemented through executive order, it needed a legislative teeth. So the Epidemic Diseases Act is being amended through ordinance. Till now the Centre issued most of the orders on Covid-19 through Disaster Management Act. As health is a concurrent subject, the state is amending the Epidemics Diseases Act to be in better control of the Covid-19 situation,” said a senior official of the health department.Senior advocate Pitambar Acharya said the amendment was necessary as even after imposing certain restrictions under the old act, states are struggling to stem the spread of the disease as there are no specific provisions in the Act which can guide the governments to act in a prescribed manner. It is more than 120 years old and had come at a time when the British officers wanted to limit public gatherings led by the freedom fighters. The old act does not define the term epidemic or disease and has no specific measures or directions to the government to follow at the time of an epidemic. The amendment would help the state handle the pandemic in a better way,” said Acharya.However, senior lawyers said raising the penalty to Rs 1 lakh for anyone found violating the amended Epidemic Diseases Act may be a bit steep. “In a pandemic, a slumdweller caught not wearing mask may not be able to fork out Rs 1 lakh if convicted. The enforcement authorities in the state are just coming to terms with the pandemic. Rs 1 lakh fine amount is all fine, but one needs to see how many can pay it,” said senior HC advocate Surya Prasad Mishra.Meanwhile, the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) said on Thursday that one-third population of Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BeMC) in the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam district has developed antibodies to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. RMRC director Sanghamitra Pati said that a sero survey in Berhampur town found 31% prevalence at community level in the municipality area. “The survey indicates that 1.5 lakh people in the city were infected with the virus and developed antibodies. At the high risk group level in BeMC, the sero prevalence is 23.4%.“The sero survey was carried out jointly by BeMC, MKCG medical College and RMRC with support from the Health and Family Welfare department,” said Pati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-increase-fines-for-violating-covid-19-guidelines-to-rs-1-lakh-will-amend-epidemics-act/story-0LYUUqHvQV3YgQ2HFzW71L.html

They have been instrumental in cracking three different rape and murder cases in which minors were the victims. In two of the three cases, the accused were awarded death penalty while in third case, the accused was sentenced to life imprisonment.The names of the 10 police officials figured among 121 officials selected from across the country for the honour, as per official information.The police officers from Madhya Pradesh include Additional Superintendent of Police Hansraj Singh, Sub-Divisional Officer of Police Punnu Singh Parastey, and inspectors Sunil Sharma, Sanjeev Kumar Chouksey, Praveen Kumar Kumre, Arvind Singh Tomar and Gopal Ghasle. Kewal Singh Parte, Deepti Mishra and Priti Patil, all sub-inspectors, have also been given the prestigious medal.According to police officials, Chouksey, who is presently posted in Bhopal, had investigated a case regarding rape and murder of a seven-year-old in neighbouring Vidisha district when he was in charge of Civil Lines police station. The crime was committed in 2015 and the trial court awarded death penalty to the convict in September 2019. Ravi Toli, who was convicted, was out of bail in connection with a molestation case when he committed the crime. Expressing his joy over the award, Chouksey said, “It was a tough case to crack and our team had to make a lot of efforts to get to the accused. But our efforts ensured justice to the victim and her family.” Chouksey had played key role in arrest of a serial killer Adesh Khambra too in 2018, who belongs to Mandideep in Bhopal and whose accomplices killed more than 30 truck drivers and cleaners and looted goods in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and other states. Similarly, Kumre had investigated a rape case when he was posted in Piparia town of Hoshangabad district in 2018, in which a four-year-old girl was raped and murdered. Agitated over the heinous crime, people had staged a massive protest and ghearoed the police station. The accused was tracked down after police continued its intensified investigation round the clock and several days at a stretch. The accused was sentenced to capital punishment. Kumre said, “There was tremendous pressure on the entire police force to nab the criminal. We looked into footage of more than 50 CCTV cameras. My jeep was like my residence for four to five days during investigation. We produced all the evidence and the accused was given death penalty.” Tomar had solved a kidnapping, rape and murder case in Ujjain in 2019. The victim was a four-year-old girl who was raped and whose dead body was thrown in Shipra river in June 2019.He said during intensive investigation more than 50 suspects were questioned when they found a porn video in the mobile phone of one of them. That man turned out to be the accused. The court delivered its judgment in 84 days and sentenced the accused to life imprisonment till his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-cops-win-medal-of-honour-from-madhya-pradesh-3-inspectors-among-them-cracked-rape-and-murder-cases/story-qgr32DCDqJ63Y5pctOY4LP.html

The total tally of Covid-19 cases stand at 11,302.On Thursday morning, Ram Sharan Nautiyal, father of Bollywood singer Jubin Nautiyal and former Dehradun district panchayat head took to his social media platform to inform people that he had tested positive for Covid-19. “Due to initial symptoms, I got myself tested for Covid-19 and was found positive. I am fully healthy and admitted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh on the advice of doctors. My entire family and staff who come in contact with me on a daily basis were immediately tested and their results came out to be negative,” he wrote on Twitter.Three Covid-19 positive persons also died in the state on Thursday, of which one death was due to coronavirus while the other two were due to co-morbidities. A total of 143 Covid-19 positive patients have died in Uttarakhand till now with 25 deaths attributed to coronavirus, according to the health officials. The remaining corona infected casualties were attributed to co-morbidities and other causes, added health officials.A total of 7,014 infected people have recovered successfully, bringing the recovery rate in the state to 62.12%.US Nagar district reported 192 of the 416 fresh Covid-19 cases reported on Thursday. The situation in other districts was as follows: Almora (1), Bageshwar (9), Champawat (16), Dehradun (36), Haridwar (107), Nainital (15), Pauri (5), Rudraprayag (4), Tehri (16) and Uttarakashi (15).Haridwar district has so far reported a total of 2,678 cases - the most cases in the state, followed by Dehradun (2,272), US Nagar (2,176) and Nainital (1,624).Also, 327 Covid-19 patients were discharged from different hospitals in the state on Thursday with maximum 216 in US Nagar district.

14-08-2020||India||In self-reliance push, Rajnath Singh launches weapons system made by Ordnance Factory Board||Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday launched a number of weapon systems developed by different factories of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) as part of the Atma Nirbhar Week programme. At a programme in Delhi, Singh remotely launched Namica, a missile launching platform for the third generation anti-tank fire and forget missile “Nag”, a new 8.6x70mm sniper rifle developed by the Rifle Factory Ishapore, a dual calibre anti-material rifle developed by the Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli and an upgraded commander’s thermal imager-cum-daysight for T-90 tanks developed by the Opto Electronic Factory Dehradun. The OFB said in a statement issued from its headquarters in Kolkata that Namica uses an indigenously produced infantry combat vehicle with amphibious capabilities. It has been jointly developed by Ordnance Factory Medak and DRDL. The platform can fire six missiles with a gap of 20 seconds between the shots. The 14.5/20mm anti-material rifle is a dual calibre modular weapon used for destroying enemy bunkers, light armoured vehicles and radar systems.The upgraded thermal imager-cum-daysight for T-90 tanks has a range of detection at 8,000 meters at night. “It will also be retrofitted in T-90 Tanks already in service and will lead to substantial foreign exchange savings,” the OFB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-self-reliance-push-rajnath-singh-launches-weapons-system-made-by-ordnance-factory-board/story-ohUTGtjxPYhBZ3JzgWQegI.html
14-08-2020||India||Gehlot, Pilot meet; BJP, Congress talk floor test||Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot shook hands and flashed victory signs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting in a show of unity on Thursday, the first such interaction between the two leaders since Pilot rebelled over a month ago and triggered a political crisis that threatened the state government.Three days after the Congress high command brokered a peace deal that ended the turmoil, Gehlot said at the meeting that his government will move a confidence motion in a crucial assembly session beginning on Friday and emerge victorious, a move aimed at sending a message of stability after the month-long tussle, according to party leaders.On the day the warring factions reunited, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the truce was temporary and announced that it will move a no-confidence motion against the government, which appears to be comfortably placed in terms of numbers, especially after the return of 19 dissident legislators, including Pilot, to the Congress fold. The BJP, which also asked its MLAs to prepare for polls, did not ask for a floor test at the height of the crisis that began unfolding in mid-July.Speaker CP Joshi can use his discretion to decide whether to allow the government or the BJP motion — both seeking a floor test, according to analysts. An official at the assembly secretariat, who did not want to be named, said the government’s trust motion was likely to get preference. “This has been the tradition of the house,” said the official. Political analyst Narayan Bareth said the motion by the ruling side gets preference in such a situation. “When a confidence motion and a no-confidence motion are moved simultaneously, the assembly tradition is that the ruling side gets preference. However, the final call is of the speaker,” he said.With the return of the rebels, the Congress alone has 107 legislators, including the speaker, in the 200-member House where the majority mark is 101. It also appears to have the support of all 13 independents; three of them backed Pilot and have now pledged support to Gehlot. Five MLAs from other parties, too, back the government in the House. On the other hand, the BJP (72) and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party (3) have a total of 75 seats. At the CLP meeting in Gehlot’s residence, all 19 legislators, who protested against chief minister over his style of functioning and alleged that Pilot was being sidelined, were present. “Apne to apne hote hain [they are our own],” Gehlot said in his peace message, referring to the dissidents. At the same time, he also said the Congress would have proved its majority in the House even without the rebel MLAs, but that “would not have made us happy or given a stable government”, according to legislators present at the meeting who did not want to be named. To be sure, the Gehlot government has already indicated that it is keen on a floor test despite the truce because the party thinks it is the perfect way to send across a message of unity. A floor test will also give some breather to Gehlot to let him put his house in order since a motion can be moved only once in a session. On Thursday, the Congress also revoked the suspension of seven-time legislator Bhanwar Lal Sharma and former tourism minister Vishvendra Singh, two Pilot loyalists who were accused of being part of a conspiracy to topple the government. Gehlot assured all MLAs that their grievances will be addressed and he was ready to meet them wherever they want. Pilot said he was in the Congress and will remain in the Congress, a Rajasthan Congress leader said, requesting anonymity. Pilot also thanked all for supporting him during his tenure as the state Congress chief for over six years and for the post of deputy chief minister. “If the style of functioning or governance has to be changed, then we should not hesitate,”Pilot said, according to the leader cited above. Addressing MLAs, Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said the month-long crisis was a “nightmare for all of us” and asked MLAs to refrain from blaming each other. “It is time for unity in the larger interest of the government and the party. Without the party ,we are nobody,” he said.“No more post-mortems...Congress president Sonia Gandhi has told me to convey this to you,” he told the legislators. He said the high command decided on the truce in consultation with Gehlot. Venugopal’s message was meant to convey to the MLAs who have backed Gehlot during the crisis that the chief minister was always part of the discussions with the Pilot camp, a central Congress functionary said. He said there was some resentment in the Gehlot camp over the return of Pilot and the other rebels who threatened the stability of the government. The chief minister and other senior leaders had to persuade them. “Now, they are willing to work with the rebels,” the leader said. After the meeting, Congress leaders Venugopal, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ajay Maken and Govind Singh Dotasra, among others, posed for photographs along with Gehlot and Pilot. Before Thursday’s CLP meeting, Gehlot tweeted, asking MLAs loyal to him to “forgive and forget” in the interest of the country and the state. The BJP, too, held a meeting of its legislators where former chief minister Vasundhara Raje is believed to have asked them to prepare for polls. “She [Raje] said this government would not last long and that we should be ready for elections,” a BJP lawmaker present at the meeting said on condition of anonymity. Gulab Chand Kataria, the leader of the opposition, said his party readied a no-confidence motion proposal and 40 lawmakers signed it. Raje separately denied reports of a division in the BJP. “Some people are spreading news about a division in BJP. Let me tell them that the BJP is a family and we are all together” she tweeted. State BJP president Satish Poonia said Gehlot made “cheap allegations” against the BJP, referring to the Congress’s charge that the opposition party was trying to topple the government. “This government does not have a future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-pilot-meet-bjp-congress-talk-floor-test/story-R00vti7SBjZh1QqHDsYemN.html
14-08-2020||India||Scientists urge use of monoclonal antibodies||Global scientists have urged pharmaceutical companies, governments and academic institutions to make monoclonal antibodies used to treat life-threatening diseases available to people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that act like natural antibodies in fighting disease. Derived from human immune cells, these proteins act specifically against targets ranging from cancerous cells to viruses and bacteria, or alter precise immune pathways to augment a person’s ability to fight disease. At least 120 monoclonal antibodies have been approved in the 30 years since the first one was licenced to prevent and treat several chronic and life-threatening diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune disorders and some infections, including the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Around 80% of licensed monoclonal antibodies are sold in Europe, the US and Canada, with only 20% sold to countries that account for 90% of the world’s population. Availability and affordability are two of the biggest barriers to availability in LMICs, said the report titled Expanding Access to Monoclonal Antibody-Based Products: A Global Call to Action, released by Wellcome, an independent global health foundation, and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit scientific research organisation. “India is one of the best case scenarios among middle-income countries, but still only a fraction of products available in the US are available in India. In fact no monoclonal antibody treatments for cancer are available in the Indian public health system,” Wellcome said in a tweet. Neutralising antibodies, whether natural or monoclonal, can bind directly to portions of viruses that they use to attach to and enter cells, preventing them from initiating infection. According to the Wellcome-IAVI report, monoclonal antibodies can potentially complement Covid-19 vaccines, especially for those who may not benefit from a vaccine because of age or medical conditions.If successful, the new approaches and partnerships forged for Covid-19 can set precedents to support increased global access to monoclonal antibodies targeting many other diseases, the report said. Earlier this week, the US began enrolling healthy adults for two Phase 3 gold-standard randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials to test whether experimental monoclonal antibodies can prevent infection from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The trials are enrolling adults who are at risk of infection due to close contact at work or home with people infected by Sars-CoV-2. Last month, the Drugs Controller General of India approved the indigenous psoriasis drug Itolizumab to treat moderate to severe Covid-19. This monoclonal antibody has been manufactured and marketed by Biocon since 2013 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Also ongoing are multi-centric trials to evaluate the standard use of the monoclonal antibody drug Tocilizumab, which is a second-line drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. “Tocilizumab is approved to treat moderate to severe Covid-19 patients whose condition is worsening, and the trial will also evaluate whether the drug will prevent the progression of stable moderate disease to severe Covid-19 needing oxygen or ventilator,” said Dr Arvinder Soin, national lead, Indian multi-centre trial on Tocilizumab, and chairman, Medanta Liver Institute, Medanta, Gurugram. “We have already recruited 138 of 180 patients for the Tocilizumab trial, which is being done across 14 hospitals in 10 cities. The majority have moderate disease, with some severe cases. The trial is going fine,” said Dr Soin. The trial will be conducted in several hospitals in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region), Haryana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Monoclonal antibodies have dramatically improved cancer survival rates and are being evaluated for their potential to prevent and treat infectious diseases including Ebola, and HIV, but they are among the most expensive pharmaceutical products in the world and inaccessible to most of the world’s population. “Monoclonal antibodies are used for immunotherapy and antibody drug conjugates to treat several cancers, including melanomas, cancers of the head and neck, urinary bladder, stomach, oesophagus, and stomach, among others. But they are very expensive, with each injection – usually given once every three weeks – priced at around ₹3 lakh. They are not available in the public sector in India,” said Dr Pramod Kumar Julka, senior director, Max Institute of Cancer Care, and former professor and dean, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, who introduced monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer at AIIMS in 2015.The report proposes four parallel actions to ensure widespread access in LMICs: Increase advocacy and awareness of the life-saving potential of monoclonal antibodies to make them more widely accessible, develop expanded policy and regulatory pathways to increase availability, Invest in and apply new technologies to lower development costs, and establish alternative business models to enable innovative market approaches to promote global access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-urge-use-of-monoclonal-antibodies/story-1QHChVRPjRHjzHoEPf2DYI.html
14-08-2020||India||Study confirms BCG vaccine efficacy||Yet another study has established that BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine increases the ability of the immune system to fight off Coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According the preprint study available on medRxiv, an open access server for health sciences, some staff members of the Emirates International Hospital in United Arab Emirates was administered a booster BCG vaccine at the beginning of March. By the end of June, the hospital staff was tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.The participants were divided into two groups: booster vaccinated, and unvaccinated members.“…Results: 71 subjects received the booster vaccination. This group had zero cases of positive Covid -19 infection. 209 subjects did not receive the vaccination, with 18 positive PCR confirmed Covid -19 cases. The infection rate in the unvaccinated group was 8.6% versus zero in the booster vaccinated group…,” says the research paper that has not yet been peer reviewed.“Our findings demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the booster BCG vaccine, specifically the booster in preventing Covid-19 infections in an elevated-risk healthcare population,”the paper adds. This is at least the fifth study to show the possible benefits of the BCG vaccine, which has been administred to most Indian children for decades. BCG protects against childhood tuberculosis (TB) in countries such as India, where it is administered to newborn babies as part of the immunisation programme. India’s low Covid-19 case load has been partly attributed to BCG vaccination that is a part of the National immunisation programme for about 50 years.India is conducting its own study on the vaccine’s efficacy. “One of the reasons for low mortality due to Covid-19 in India is said to be the BCG vaccine which is being given at birth to all children since 1962-63. ICMR study is to establish that and is being conducted among elderly population. AIIMS, Delhi, is one of the trial sites. The work has started and ethics committee clearance is also in place. The vaccine will be given on OPD basis especially in people from hotspot areas,” said Dr AB Dey, head, geriatrics department, AIIMS, Delhi.The Indian Council of Medical Research- National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (ICMR- NIRT) has initiated a multi-centric study to see if BCG can reduce the severity of Covid-19 among individuals aged 60 years and above residing in hotspots.About 1000 healthy volunteers above 60-years of age are being recruited in six states with high Covid-19 disease burden, and will be followed up for six months.“The process has begun at NIRT, which is identified the nodal institute to spearhead the study. It is too early to comment on the results, but we will share information when there is an update,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR. The states where the study has been planned are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi.The researchers of the medRxiv study, however, do acknowledge there were certain limitations that could somewhat impact the results. “…such as lack of clear understanding and documentation of any confounding factors between the two groups that could have influenced the transmission and infection rate, sample size, and discrepancy between the number of subjects in the two groups. Staff comorbidity as well as any over the counter supplements that the staff could have taken in attempts to prevent Covid-19 infection was not documented. Despite the limitations of this study, we feel that our findings of 8.6% versus zero percent infection rate is significant enough to suggest the promising effectiveness of an up-to-date BCG booster vaccine in prevention of Covid19 infection,” they said in the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-confirms-bcg-vaccine-efficacy/story-zj9Si5vLpKZAJOwDN6ZJJI.html

14-08-2020||India||Daily Covid-19 tests inch closer to targeted 1 million mark||India tested in excess of 800,000 samples for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Wednesday, inching closer to its target of conducting a million tests a day even as infections of the viral disease have continued to mount steadily.In total, India has performed 26.8 million tests since January 22 when Covid-19 testing started with one lab at the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Virology in Pune. As of Thursday, testing is being done in 1,433 labs across the country — 947 in the public sector and 486 private ones.Experts say that to control the outbreak, aggressive testing is crucial. In this case, the number of Covid-19 cases diagnosed in the country is likely to see an increase before it starts seeing a dip, indicating that the spread is slowing. Until Thursday, India recorded 2,459,275 cases and 48,140 deaths. India has conducted 20,140 tests per million residents — much lower than other countries that have comparable caseloads. In comparison, the United States and Brazil, the only two nations with more cases than India, have conducted 204,130 and 62,197 tests for every million residents.The country’s target of conducting a million tests a day would mean that it would be conducting 750 tests per million per day — significantly higher than the World Health Organization (WHO)’s recommendation of 140 tests per million residents a day. To be sure, India is still testing much above the WHO advisory – in the last week, the country has tested an average of 503 people per million every day.For the week ending August 12, India’s daily tests have increased by 2.8% every day on average. This number was the same the week before that. If this rate of increase in daily testing remains constant, then the country may touch the 1 million-daily-test mark in 12 days, according to HT’s projections.The four highest single-day tests conducted across the country have all been reported in the past five days — 830,391 daily tests on August 12; 733,449 on August 11; 719,364 on August 8 and 698,290 on August 9 – highlighting the recent increase. On August 9 (Sunday) 477,023 samples were tested. To be sure, Sundays are historically days when daily testing drops as many labs function with low staff and few people step out. “India’s ‘test, track and treat’ strategy has helped us bring down the fatality rate from its peak of 3.36% on June 17 to 1.96% within two months... We have been ahead of all our testing targets. The target of 100,000 tests was May 31; we crossed it on May 10. In July-end, I said in an interview that the target was to reach a million tests in 12 weeks, we are geared to reach it in two to three weeks,” Union health minister Harash Vardhan said on Thursday. A July 7 column in this newspaper suggested a target of a million tests a day. “We are trying our best to meet the target (by August-end),” said ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava.The recent increase in testing has also brought down the weekly average positivity rate — the fraction of tests that come back positive — in the country from 12.5% (the highest recorded so far) on July 25 to 9.4% on Thursday. Overall, 8.9% of all tests in the country have come back positive. According to WHO recommendations, the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least 14 days before it can be assumed that an outbreak is under control and lockdowns can be relaxed.Much of the recent increase in testing can be attributed to the growing role of antigen tests in the states. Antigen, or rapid, tests usually provide results within hours and are relatively cheap. These kits are designed to detect antigens (substances in our bodies that stimulate an immune response) and can be performed in mobile stations and don’t necessarily need labs. The downside is that they have a far higher chance of returning false negatives (showing infected people as uninfected), and thus can let cases slide under the radar.The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, on the other hand, is the gold-standard for Covid-19 testing and is the most definitive test available. It is used for the detection of nucleic acid from Sars-CoV-2 and is based on PCR, a process that duplicates and amplifies genetic fragments of the virus, so that it becomes easily detectable. The downside is that the process, from samples collection to results, for these can generally take 24-48 hours and needs dedicated machines.During the weekly Covid-19 press briefing on August 5, Union health ministry officials had said that antigen tests accounted for at least a quarter of all tests conducted in the country until then. ICMR has also said the proportion of antigen tests is increasing. “When we started, antigen tests comprised only 5-6% of the total tests, but this proportion is consistently rising. Today, total antigen tests are nearly between 25-30% tests of the total number of Covid-19 tests done so far,” Dr Bhargava said on August 5.Only four states — Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka and West Bengal — give a breakup of testing numbers based on antigen and RT-PCR/other nucleic tests. Among them, of the 1,034,537 samples tested in the last week, a majority (50.3%) have been antigen tests.HT has repeatedly pointed out that antigen tests are best used when time is a constraint and results are needed quickly -- in a containment zone or a hot spot, for instance. In terms of states, the wide disparity in testing rates remains as higher-than-average testing states have continued to fuel the nationwide boost to testing numbers in the past weeks. Among the 20 major states, Assam has conducted the highest number of tests in the country for the week ending on August 12 — 10,649 tests per million. Andhra Pradesh features on the second spot with 7,930 tests per million in the last week, followed by Delhi, with 7,210 tests per million. To be sure, these states all have a testing rate that is higher than the national average.At the lowest end of tests in the last week, are Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with 1,360, 1,384 and 1,702 tests per million. And much like the top, these states have overall lower-than-national-average testing rates. Bihar, the state with the lowest overall testing rate, appears to have improved its testing in the last week – the state tested 4,467 samples per million in the last week against the national average of 3,523.“For a small state like Assam we have been crossing several milestones in testing. On July 30, we conducted 50,000 tests on a day and on August 4 we did more than 75,000 tests. On August 12, we had kept our target as 100,000 tests, but when we tallied the figures at the end of the day, we found we conducted more than 1.43 lakh tests. We were quite surprised,” said Assam’s principal secretary (health) Samir Kumar Sinha. “This has required lot of mobilisation, lot of people on the ground, large number of test kits. Nearly 90% of the tests that we are doing these days are rapid antigen tests and the rest RT-PCR,” Sinha said.Andhra Pradesh commissioner of health Katamaneni Bhaskar said only around 40% of the tests being done are rapid antigen tests. Out of 55,692 tests done on Thursday, only 26,000 tests were antigen tests. “We have been doing antigen tests only as per ICMR guidelines. And they are also reliable. If a person tests positive in antigen tests, he is positive for Covid-19,” Bhaskar said.Officials in Bihar said they have been working on increasing their testing rate. “We are increasing our testing every day. During the last 24 hours, 104,452 people were tested and so far 137,742 tests have been conducted in the state,” the state’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit said.Experts, however, said that other than ramping up the number of tests, the pricing needs to be controlled as well. “There is a need to increase testing for Covid-19 across the country as our testing per million still continues to be low. For this, we need not only trained staff but the cost of the testing has to be brought down further. An RT-PCR test costs about ₹2,400, it needs to be brought down to about ₹1,000. It can be done through bulk procurement by one agency for the entire country and scaling up manufacturing,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-tests-inch-closer-to-targeted-1-million-mark/story-n5pX5z9QclRLKGABl8cClN.html
14-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The coronavirus disease, Covid-19, has ravaged the world. As of this writing, there have been 20.6 million cases of the disease registered and three quarters of a million people have died from it. Almost every one of the 195 countries in the world has seen cases.The US, the world’s largest economy and also its most powerful country, has been laid low by the disease, with around 5.2 million cases and around 167,000 deaths. India has thus far seen 2.4 million cases and around 47,000 deaths.The disease has forced countries to lock down, transport networks to collapse, and people to work or study from the relative safety of their homes. Economies have been roiled — the global economy is expected to contract by around 5% this year according to IMF. India, too, is expected to see its economy contract by at least that much (although most experts believe that the contraction could be sharper here).The way we live and the way we work (and the way we party and play, if anyone is in the mood for those) has changed. Yet, life and work, have gone on — and for that, we must thank the internet. Purists may count the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic of 2002-2003 as the first epidemic of the Information Age. There were just around 700 million internet users back then, and broadband was still a novelty (relatively), and social media, e-books (in any significant way; the Kindle was launched only in 2007) and OTT platforms were yet to make an appearance. And so, this writer would like to think that Covid-19 is the first pandemic of the Information Age — and thank God for that (the internet, not the pandemic).Tomorrow (Saturday, August 15) marks the 25th anniversary of the then state-owned Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd’s (VSNL) launch of internet services (for the public) , offering the tearaway speed of 9.6 kbps for ~15,000 (for 250 hours of internet access a year). All such access was through a dial-up modem, the sound of which is embossed on my auditory nerves to an extent that no number of WhatsApp alerts can erase — beeps, bops, bloops, and screeches as one waited to go down the rabbit hole.The internet (even this newsroom only recently stopped capitalising it) has made Covid-19 bearable. It has allowed people to work remotely. It has allowed students to learn remotely. It has allowed consumers to shop remotely (something they were already doing, though these past few months have probably helped the whole internet economy leapfrog years into the future). Meanwhile, the popularity of social media had already familiarised us with virtual networks of family, friends, even strangers with shared interests. Even those in enforced quarantine and self-isolation have been able to inhabit the same virtual universe as their connections.The internet has also made it easier to manage the pandemic. At a very basic level, the latest research on Covid-19, and the most recent discovery on therapies, is immediately available to health care workers around the world. At a slightly more involved level, the internet has made telemedicine a reality. And, at the most controversial level, contact tracing apps have the ability to show who is safe and who isn’t.The fact that the internet has established its centrality in just about every aspect of life during the pandemic, and the fact that the internet economy has jumped ahead in time to where it may have been in 2030, however, poses two very significant challenges that are worth repeating on the 25th anniversary of the internet in India.The first is the digital divide, which, despite its cliche-ridden usage, is a reality, and has been sharply felt over the past few months, increasing the distance between the (digital) haves and the have-nots. The second is the need for an overarching privacy and data protection law that allows people to benefit from the good the internet can do (and it can do a lot of that), without having themselves or their data exploited.Onward and upward!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-bFMczkeTDWBJAu4ZamqSUI.html
14-08-2020||India||SC to pronounce its verdict in Prashant Bhushan contempt case today||The Supreme Court will pronounce on Friday its judgment in the contempt of court case initiated suo motu (on its own) against lawyer Prashant Bhushan for his tweets against the Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra and also comprising justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari will deliver its verdict at 11 am.Bhushan posted two tweets, one on the Supreme Court on June 27 and the second on CJI Bobde on June 29. He was served notice by the SC on July 22.The first tweet, reproduced in the court order, said: “When historians in the future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the SC in this destruction, and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.” The second tweet said: “The CJI rides a Rs 50-lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without wearing a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC on lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”Bhushan, in his affidavit, regretted saying Bobde was not wearing a helmet. He added he failed to notice the bike was stationary and that the CJI was not riding but merely sitting on it. The court had reserved its verdict in the matter on August 5.Another suo motu contempt petition is also pending before the same three-judge bench against Bhushan for calling past CJIs corrupt in a 2009 interview to Tehelka magazine. Bhushan had offered an explanation but the Supreme Court refused to accept the same and ruled, on August 10, that it will hear the matter in detail. That case is now listed for hearing on August 17.Meanwhile, a petition filed before the apex court by Bhushan along with former Union minister Arun Shourie and journalist N Ram challenging the law criminalising contempt of court was withdrawn by them on Thursday.Senior counsel Rajeev Dhavan, who represented the petitioners, sought the permission of the court to withdraw the petition citing pendency of similar cases against Prashant Bhushan before the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-pronounce-its-verdict-in-prashant-bhushan-contempt-case-today/story-PJRQRUxZNo9hOicoEt9j7M.html

14-08-2020||India||Modi set to become longest serving non-Congress PM||Narendra Modi who took oath as prime minister for his second term on May 2019 is set to become the longest serving non-Congress leader to occupy the office. With 2,272 continuous days in office as of Friday, Modi will match the record held by the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee who served in office for 2,272 days across three separate terms. On Saturday, he will surpass it. In May 2014, Modi was first elected PM when he led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections winning 282 seats in the Lower House. Five years later, he returned to power with an unprecedented 303 MPs. Vajpayee who was first elected PM in 1996, was in office between May 16 and June 1, a tenure that lasted 13 days. His second stint came in 1998, when he was PM for 13 months between March 1998 and April 1999. This was followed by a five-year term between 1999 and 2004. While Vajpayee resigned on May 27, 1996, after his 13-day stint, and after delivering one of the best speeches Parliament has ever heard, his successor Deve Gowda was sworn in only on June 1. Technically, Vajpayee was the caretaker PM for those days, a fact some calculations of his tenure overlook.  Other than Vajpayee and Modi, PMs with long tenure include India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who assumed office on August 15, 1947 stayed in the seat till May 27, 1964, a total of 6,130 days or almost 17 years. His daughter Indira Gandhi who first assumed office on January 24, 1966 continued till March 24, 1977; she returned as PM on January 14, 1980 and continued till her assassination on October 31, 1984. She was in office for 5,829 days. Dr Manmohan Singh was PM for 10 years between May 22, 2004 and May 26, 2014, a total of 3,656 days. Then come Modi and Vajpayee. On Modi’s term, BJP national vice president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said his leadership has left an indelible mark on polity as well as governance. “Some PMs left a mark on polity while others on governance. He has made a mark on both.” Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, “Prime Minister Modi will be remembered for setting scary, disappointing and nation-damaging records.” “He is the first Prime Minister to give the unwarranted gift of highest unemployment, giving clean chit to land grabber China apart from being the architect of biggest and scariest economic disaster existent in India,” Shergill added. Abhay Deshpande, a political commentator, said, “He’s taken the BJP from a party with a fractured mandate to a party with a clear mandate. It is obvious he will be in a position to create a record for being the longest serving non-Congress PM.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-set-to-become-longest-serving-non-congress-pm/story-TPlRxQekmFp6uLzMeChzrK.html
14-08-2020||India||Connectivity gets better but parts of India still logged out||When India celebrates its 74th independence day this Saturday, it will also mark 25 years since the internet was first made available for public use in the country. The internet was first used in India in 1986, but was available to a limited educational and research community. It was thrown open to public use for the first time on India’s 49th independence day in 1995. No doubt the internet is now at the core of the communication network – there are more than 700 million internet subscribers in India – but there is still a significant population not connected to the internet.The number of internet users in India has grown significantly in recent years, according to data compiled by the World Bank. It was almost seven years after the internet was first thrown open to the public that more than 1% of India’s population used the internet. It took another nine years for this figure to cross 10%. But then, in just six years, the share of the population using the internet grew by 24 percentage points – from 10% in 2011 to 34% in 2017. Globally, 50% people used the internet in 2017. The figure is much higher in developed countries -- 87% in the United States, 82% in France, 91% in Canada and 87% in Australia. In China, it is relatively low at 54%.Another set of figures from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India shows that the internet has penetrated even deeper into the society after 2017. There were about 34 internet subscribers per 100 people in India in 2017, which grew by 20 percentage points in just two years. By the end of 2019, there were about 54 internet subscribers per 100 people. To be sure, this does not necessarily mean that 54% of Indians use the internet, because one person can be using more than one internet connection. In absolute terms, there were 719 million internet subscribers in India by the end of 2019. Mobile telecom networks have played an important role in increasing internet access in India. 3G internet service was first launched in 2008 and 4G in 2012. Between 2013 and 2019, there was a 68% increase in the number of wireless internet users (from 220 million to 696 million) compared to an 18% increase in the number of wired internet users (from 18 million to 22 million). The share of mobile internet users in total internet users grew from 92% to nearly 97% in this period.Even as the number of internet users has been growing rapidly, there is still a large population with no access to the internet – particularly in rural areas, poorer states and in poorer households.The Delhi telecom circle (which includes parts of the national capital territory outside Delhi as well) had 169 internet subscribers per 100 people by the end of 2019, according to TRAI data. This is the highest among 22 telecom circles in India. Again, the number being higher than 100 here is because of people using more than one internet connection. Himachal Pradesh and Punjab service areas are at the second and third position in terms of the number of internet subscribers per 100 people. But this figure is as low as 32 in Bihar (including Jharkhand). There are less than 50 internet subscribers per 100 people in at least six telecom circles.These headline figures hide the significant rural-urban gap in internet penetration. Nationally, there are 106 internet subscribers per 100 people in urban areas compared to just 30 in rural areas. This gap is seen across telecom circles. In urban areas, there are more than 100 internet subscribers per 100 people in 12 telecom circles. This figure is more than 80 in six others. But in rural areas, this figure is less than 60 in all circles except the rural parts of Delhi. To be sure, this figure is not available for three telecoms circles – Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh (West) and West Bengal (including Sikkim). Internet usage also varies significantly with class and gender. According to the 2017-18 National Statistical Office survey on consumption of education services in India, nearly 24% households in the country had access to the internet. This figure increased with increasing monthly per capita expenditure of households. In rural areas, it was nearly 7% in the poorest 20% households compared to 27% in the richest 20% households. In urban areas, it was 20% in the poorest households and 62% in the richest. (See chart 3)Another survey finding shows that 40% people in the age group of 15 to 29 years were able to use the internet, but this figure was 48% among men and 32% among women, a gap of 16 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/connectivity-gets-better-but-parts-of-india-still-logged-out/story-VSqXriMdGUudWb7eBcWzjN.html
14-08-2020||India||Congress leader urges Centre to restore ‘civility’ in TV debates||A day after Congress spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi died of a heart attack after participating in a TV debate, his party colleague Jaiveer Shergill on Thursday wrote to the information and broadcasting ministry, seeking steps to restore “civility” in television debates and an advisory to news channels to observe a code of conduct. In a letter to information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, Shergill said it was imperative to restore civility through a code of conduct in order to “tame the slanderous beast” that television debates had become. “Constant interruptions coupled with toxic and defamatory smears impact the mental and physical well-being of all individuals on the panel.”Shergill also said issuing an advisory to the media houses to follow News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) guidelines to ensure more civility is a must and will serve as an appropriate tribute to Tyagi. Tagging his letter, Shergill tweeted, “My letter to I&B Minister Shri Prakash Javdekar Ji requesting him to issue an advisory to media to enforce a code of conduct to curb slanderous, sensationalist and toxic TV debates.” Tyagi’s death has triggered a debate within the Congress over its participation in such panel discussions on television channels. A Congress leader said the party had not yet taken a decision, but there were voices against the move. “It is high time TV channel owners , editors and anchors introspect on how some in the industry have reduced news debates into a meaningless , poisonous and potentially fatal activity. At times words can have the same impact as bullets,” tweeted senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-urges-centre-to-restore-civility-in-tv-debates/story-bNQolkLZiGz718Mez93QTK.html
14-08-2020||India||J-K police in Rajouri to collect DNA samples of relatives of 3 ‘militants’ killed in encounter||A Jammu and Kashmir police team from Shopian reached Rajouri on Thursday to collect DNA samples of three families to match them with those of three young men allegedly killed in a fake encounter and buried in Baramulla, a top official said.“Today a police team from Shopian reached Rajouri. It will take DNA samples of the families before returning. Thereafter, an analysis will be done and then something may emerge. The Shopian police team has just reached and the formalities are being completed by them,” Rajouri district commissioner Nazir Sheikh said,“There is no decision to send these families on August 16 to Baramulla and there is no such communication with us as of now but families did approach us,” he said.The DC said there is no authentication that the three men were killed in a fake encounter by security forces.“Matching the DNA with three bodies may take place at a later stage but only missing persons’ complaint has been lodged with us and we are working on the basis of it. We can’t say anything else on it because there is no authentication as of now”. The three men have been missing since July 17.Lal Hussain, uncle of Imtiyaz Ahmad, one of the three missing men said, “The families are in a state of shock. The pictures that went viral on social sites are of my nephew Imtiyaz Ahmad and two other relatives Ibrar Ahmad and Ibrar Ahmad Khan. He claimed that the administration had promised to send the families to Baramulla on August 16 where the bodies of the “terrorists” have been buried. “In 2018 my nephew Imtiyaz Ahmad had gone to Shopian to work in an apple orchard. In 2019 he cleared his 12th class examination and wanted to pursue his studies but his father is just too poor. This year he again went to Shopian on July 2 and was joined by the other two on July 17 to work in apple orchards but they never returned,” he said. Ibrar Ahmad, 26, son of Mohammad Yousuf of Tarkassi had worked in Kuwait for four years as labourer on a working visa. He was the father of a 15-month-old boy.. “They were simple nomads, who wanted to support their families. They never indulged in any terror activities,” Hussain asserted. The families of three labourers had lodged a missing report with Rajouri police on August 9. The three young men aged 21, 26 and 18 years had left Rajouri and reached Shopian via Mughal Road on July 2 and July 17 to work as labourers but since then remain missing. Lal Hussain had last spoken to his nephew Imtiyaz on July 17 at 7.30 PM. Defence spokesperson of 15 Corps and 14 Corps, Colonel Rajesh Kalia on August 10 had said, “We have noted social media inputs linked to the operation at Shopian on July 18. The three terrorists killed during the operation have not been identified and the bodies were buried based on established protocols. Army is investigating the matter”. On Tuesday National Conference leaders headed by provincial president Devender Singh Rana urged the administration to mobilise the police for tracing the missing men earnestly and let their families know about their welfare and whereabouts. NC also constituted a two member team of the party functionaries, comprising advocates Choudhry Liaqat and Muzaffar Ahmed Khan, to explore all the legal options and if needed file a habeas corpus petition in the High Court about the three men . CPI (M) leader MY Tarigami and Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari have also demanded an order by the Lt Governor for a time-bound judicial probe. “The incident of three labourers from Rajouri going missing from Shopian district from July 17 is a serious issue and needs a time-bound judicial probe,” said Tarigami. According to media reports the trio went missing just a day before the security forces claimed it killed three unidentified militants in Shopian. “There are unverified reports that the missing labourers have been killed in a fake encounter in Shopian on July 18. This is shocking and must be probed by a sitting High Court judge in a time-bound manner,” he added. “In the past also unfortunate incidents of civilians being killed in fake encounters for rewards and promotions have been reported in Kashmir. The 2010 unrest was the creation of the Machil fake encounter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-police-in-rajouri-to-collect-dna-samples-of-relatives-of-3-militants-killed-in-encounter/story-7vxkJYQRHjay1mspKETHeK.html
14-08-2020||India||Dial-up dreams to Wi-Fi wonderland||On August 15, 1995, Indians woke up to the tariff plan of a new sort of communication service they could purchase: dial-up internet. At Rs 15,000 a year, it was not quite something the average Indian could afford then. The subscription would run out if someone connected for more than 250 hours over the year. The speed, breathtaking by the standards then, was 9.6 kilobytes per second.Today, internet connectivity is at least 4,000 times as fast, and costs a fraction of what it did 25 years ago. It had in 1995 all of 23,500 websites (compared to 1.8 billion now, according to Internet Live States). The most novel use at the time was sending and receiving e-mails. Today, it’s the backbone on which tomorrow’s self-driving cars, autonomous robots and immersive virtual reality are being built. In India, it is now where conversations in the smallest of towns take place.But, like most agents of epochal change, India’s internet journey began with slight trepidation, heaps of excitement, and the collective efforts of a small but a driven group of people.“In the years before 1995, there were a few institutions or groups that were experimenting with access to internet. One was the academic network, called ERNET and the other was the Internet Users Club of India which was led by none other than Shammi Kapoor,” said Brijendra Kumar Syngal, the then managing director of Videsh Sanchal Nigam Limited (VSNL) and the man largely credited with bringing commercial data connectivity to the country.VSNL’s service, called the Gateway Internet Access Service (GIAS), was available first in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. The company held a virtual monopoly till 1998 when Satyam Infoway began internet service operations. “The launch was the result of a great camaraderie between all those people, the enthusiasts, the scientists – no one at any point tried to pull anyone down,” added Syngal. To understand what the launch of dial-up connections meant, it is important to look at the state of the internet in India prior to that. Surfing the World Wide Web, at the time a collection of mostly text-based web pages, and email were possibly the only applications that most people used the internet for. A large proportion of these were scientists, researchers and professors in seven of the country’s top colleges who became part of ERNET (Education and Research Network) that began in 1986, sharing insights about their respective fields. But this was still time when telecommunications in India was too rudimentary to sustain data links over phone lines. “With telecom lines being very unreliable IIT Kanpur started an ‘F-Mail’ where every week all e-mails would be copied onto a floppy and couriered to NCST Bombay that would send out the mails and copy back the incoming mails and courier the floppy back to IIT Kanpur,” wrote professors S Sadagopan, the director of IIIT-Bangalore, and N Mohanram, the former Director General of ERNET India, in an op-ed piece for telecommunications website Voice&Data.If this was the beginning of the cocoon phase for India’s internet story, the metamorphosis to when it finally took wings happened roughly around 1995 and 1996. While VSNL’s service was active, it suffered from teething troubles. “I will admit, we made mistakes in the beginning. We did not anticipate demand and the infrastructure was extremely inadequate,” said Syngal, adding: “if you ask me, everything that could go wrong went wrong”. The VSNL team was criticised by the media as well as the administration, as people kept reporting dropped connections. At the same time, however, the fledgling software industry and the enthusiasts clubs, particularly led by the techno evangelism of Bollywood star Shammi Kapoor succeeded to sell the vision of an internet boom to the labyrinthine bureaucracy. “At one point, we tried to make what was the closest to a video call between the then telecom minister and his family members in Bihar. It was not like today’s video calls, it was more of a one-time video message, sent purely to demonstrate the potential of the technology,” said Harish Mehta, one of the founders of Information Technology collective NASSCOM and among the people who was part of the early internet advocacy groups.Among these people was Dewang Mehta, who went on to become one of the most prominent faces of the Indian software lobby group. “Dewang came up with the slogan -- roti, kapda, makaan aur bandwidth -- and a minister we met at the time had no idea what bandwidth was. This is how new it was to explain connectivity to the powers in Delhi even though the world was becoming aware,” said Mehta, adding that the slogan was one of the starting points from where the close coordination with the government began. Dewang Mehta died in 2001 at the age of 38, but left a significant legacy in India’s IT industry: He was named by Computerworld Magazine as Software Evangelist of the Year three years in a row. In late 2000, the Geneva-based World Economic Forum selected him as one of the 100 “Global Leaders of Tomorrow”.Harish Mehta, at present the executive chairman of Onward Technologies Ltd, was also among people who started the Bombay Computer Club, which would grow into the Internet Users Club of India and draft Kapoor as the one of its star advocates. “In services sector, we use a concept of selling something that is not visible – it’s a solution. In marketing, we would bank on something called evidence-based marketing where we would cite our past record. We asked Shammi ji to use the same model to sell the internet vision in India, because it was still not a concept anyone knew,” he said. And after all, Kapoor was, as a wag pointed out at the time, the original Yahoo. “Shammi ji was a great orator. We took him to Bombay, Delhi, Bangalore, everywhere. We took him to Syngal’s office, the ministry and we talked about why internet was necessary,” he said, adding that one particular event in 1996 at NASSCOM’s Nehru Centre was a key turning point. On that day, when Kapoor told his story about the internet, hundreds of people turned up. “All that excitement culminated into nudging the government to allow more private companies to offer internet services,” Mehta added.This phase sowed the momentum for an inflexion point that was marked by a “dramatic drop in costs”.“After 1997, with proper internet infrastructure now erected across India, the cost of telecommunication services plummeted. We used to budget somewhere around 4-5% of our topline as our communication spend. It became close to 0 all of a sudden,” Mehta said. The infrastructure referred to by Mehta was the setting up of nodes and servers across multiple locations – which increased capacity. “But more than the gains from lower costs, it was the increase in productivity that being online brought to every company,” he said.By 1998, cyber cafes began mushrooming across India-- at first in the metro cities, before they became profuse in tier II cities by the turn of the millennium. Till late 2004, internet bandwidth grew steadily as ISDN networks complemented home dial-up connections, which became cheaper by the way. In 2004, the government announced the Broadband Policy, defining 256kbps download speed and an always-on feature as crucial conditions for a service to be classified as broadband. This set off a home broadband revolution, which powered an over 1,300% rise in internet subscribers in the country between 2005 and 2015. Today, most people in India access the internet on their mobile phones. “The communications revolutions, now when I look back at this two decade journey, was integral to the India Inc story. It helped us arrive in Silicon Valley, take our products global,” Mehta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dial-up-dreams-to-wi-fi-wonderland/story-rFoaWmEbLJagTgH6VqpXnN.html
14-08-2020||India||Digital archives keep track of lost websites, lapsed domain names from the early years||What do you remember of the first time you used the internet? The screee-beep of the modem connecting? The joy of seeing little computer icons linking to each other in your taskbar, indicating that your dial-up was working? Or paying the cyber café guy Rs 10 to book your train ticket?When India first got online 25 years ago, it was slow going. Pages took ages to load (with the hourglass icon turning endlessly). But once we got comfortable, we were hooked. You filled your Muzik folder with MP3 files, saw the MSN-Yahoo rivalry unfold like a repeat of the ’80s cola wars, did a web search through Ask Jeeves. And it was all free, and ad-free.Users got their first taste of power in 1994, with public-journal formats that allowed anyone to post their thoughts for the world. We didn’t even call them blogs until 1999, but by 2004, Blog was the Oxford English Dictionary’s Word of the Year.The internet’s first-ever website, Info.cern.ch, has been saved for posterity by the guys who built the internet. But where do you go to see the rest of it? When domain names lapse, or companies collapse, the websites can vanish without a trace. You can’t pull an old one from the shelf. That’s probably why The Internet Archive is such a gem.HIT REWIND Born 24 years ago — just a year after India connected to the Internet — The Internet Archive is an American non-profit organisation that digitises films, books, letters, images, audio, video and software programmes. Its key project, The Wayback Machine trawls the web, copying pages, to build a library of the internet itself. The Machine lets you see what a page looked like when it was archived, even if the site has changed or been taken down. More than 458 billion pages have been saved so far. It’s not nearly enough. The internet has more than 60 trillion web pages. And with social media, there’s more to archive than ever. Meanwhile, not everyone’s thrilled about record-keeping. Because the Wayback Machine collects site caches without asking, it’s raised questions about copyright infringement and privacy. In 2017, Internet Archive was among 2,600 sites banned by the Indian government as part of the fight against digital piracy. And earlier in the coronavirus disease lockdown, publishers sued the non-profit for making its digitised library available globally. PIECES OF THE PAST Symbolics.com, the first domain name ever registered on the internet, was already 10 years old when India logged on in 1995. It used to be a computer programming business. But it is now the Big Internet Museum. Meanwhile, ArchiveTeam.org has been keeping track of sites and companies about to go bust and archiving their online material, since 2009. They describe themselves as “a loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage”, and also offer advice on how to archive your own data. Some governments are taking big steps too. In Sweden, every web page that ends in .se has been saved by the National Library’s Web Archive division. The British Library has archived 6 billion pages. India doesn’t have such an archive, except for election-related data. But the Wayback Machine has been paying attention to India almost from the start. There are more than 34,000 captures for just the Hindustan Times site, for instance, some dating back to 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-archives-keep-track-of-lost-websites-lapsed-domain-names-from-the-early-years/story-GS11TJHLJmNKYjsuQ6YLzO.html
14-08-2020||India||4 states write to EC for deferring by-elections amid Covid concerns||Four states -- Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat -- have written to the election commission to defer the upcoming by-elections to the state assembly, citing rising Covid-19 cases and heavy rains, according to officials familiar with the matter.Elections to 56 assembly constituencies and one parliamentary constituency, including the eight which were deferred last month, are scheduled to be held from September. So far, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has only held elections to some Rajya Sabha seats, and the assembly council of states, where voting is open to specialised electoral colleges rather than the general public.According to the ECI officials cited above, the chief secretaries of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat, and the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Kerala, have written to the commission apprising it of the situation on the ground. The by-polls are to be conducted across eight states, Tamil Nadu, Assam, UP, MP, Kerala, Gujarat, Haryana and Nagaland. A break-up of the same is not available.The Kerala CEO has cited “heavy rains and floods” as the primary reasons for deferring the polls. Before writing the letter, he sought feedback from district magistrates in the state, said an EC official, referring to the letter. “Tthe people involved in the relief operations are the same who are likely to be involved in conducting the elections,” said an EC official who asked not to be named. “The deployment of election machinery is a potential hurdle.” Kerala is getting heavy rains, leading to flooding, and the death toll in the Idukki landslide hit 55 on August 13. The ECI official said that the Gujarat chief secretary has attached a detailed report from reputed health associations to apprise the commission of the rising Covid-19 cases in the state. He added that the commission is monitoring the situation closely and will take all reports into account before taking a final call. “The situation is dynamic and changing everyday. We will take a call on when to hold the bypolls at an appropriate time.” According to the Health ministry, Gujarat had 57,421 cases as of August 13, while Madhya Pradesh had 31,239 cases and Haryana, 36,694. The situation across the country is worsening, with over 60,000 cases reported on Thursday. A second ECI official, however, said that the bypolls would have no bearing on the assembly election scheduled to be held in Bihar later this year. “Bypolls can be deferred, as in most cases there are only a few vacancies,” said the second official. “But the Bihar elections are on schedule at present. If we do not conduct the Bihar elections, president’s rule will have to be imposed in the state.” Polling in the state is due in November.The Commission, on July 24, deferred bypolls to eight states till September 7 though the mandatory six-month period to conduct these elections has lapsed. Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the commission is supposed to hold by-elections within six months of a seat getting vacated, either due to resignation or the death of a legislator. The six-month period has not yet lapsed for the other 48 other assembly seats and one parliamentary seat. According to former chief election commissioner Vikram Sampath, the EC will evaluate the situation and take a call. “The rule is that the bypolls have to be held within six months,” said Sampath. “But there is a provision to postpone these polls. The EC holds a consultation with the Law Ministry and can defer them.” Sampath added that there is no rule on how long these polls can be deferred, or what reasons can be cited to delay the polls.“It is a judgement-based call,” said Sampath. “The commission will have to monitor the severity of the pandemic, and situation on the ground, and decide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-states-write-to-ec-for-deferring-by-elections-amid-covid-concerns/story-Jq15rFICScYNbDb9l9HpAO.html
14-08-2020||India||SC declines stay on merger of 6 BSP MLAs with Congress in Rajasthan||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to stay a September 2019 decision by Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi allowing the merger of six MLAs elected on the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket with the Congress party. The move should come as a shot in the arm of the state’s Congress government, which is still recovering from an internal revolt that is on the way to being resolved and which faces a no-confidence motion by the opposition when the assembly session starts on Friday.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra said that the issue regarding the validity of the speaker’s decision is pending before a single-judge bench of Rajasthan high court, and declined to grant interim relief to the petitioner, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Madan Dilawar, who sought disqualification of the six BSP MLAs for defection.“We are not inclined to grant any interim relief,” said the bench, which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari.The top court adjourned the case until Monday after senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing on behalf of the speaker, said the agenda for the Rajasthan assembly session will be decided at 10 am on Friday, and also submitted that the opposition is free to move a no-confidence motion.“They have not moved a no-confidence motion. They can do that anytime,” he said.The decision on the no-confidence motion had not been taken at the time of the hearing. Senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for Dilawar, sought a stay on the speaker’s decision, stating that if a no- confidence motion ensues, then the BSP and Congress party will issue whips and there will be uncertainty on whose whip will hold good with respect to the six MLAs.“If the speaker’s decision is later struck down by the high court, then the six MLAs, in order to escape disqualification, can claim that the speaker’s decision was in force at the time when they voted (against the BSP party whip),” Salve said.“Court cannot pass orders based on what may or may not happen in the house,” Sibal responded.Dilawar moved the Rajasthan high court on July 28, seeking disqualification of the six former BSP legislators on grounds of defection under 10th schedule of the Constitution.The six MLAs -- Lakhan Singh, Rajender Singh Guda, Deepchand, Joginder Singh Avana, Sandeep Kumar and Vajib Ali -- were elected to the Rajasthan assembly in December 2018 on a BSP ticket. They later submitted a joint application to the assembly speaker on their unanimous decision to merge with the Congress party on September 16, 2019. The request was approved by the speaker on September 18, 2019.This was challenged by Dilawar, who filed a plea before speaker in March 2020 for disqualification of the six MLAs for defection. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. One of the grounds for disqualification, as per paragraph 2 of the 10th schedule, is voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker is elected.The speaker rejected Dilawar’s plea on July 22 after which the latter approached the high court challenging the speaker’s decision. A single-judge bench of the high court issued notice to the speaker on July 30, but declined to stay the decision. A division bench of the high court also declined to grant a stay and requested the single-judge bench to hear and dispose of the matter within one day.Dilawar then approached Supreme Court seeking a stay on speaker’s order.“When the Rajasthan high court is hearing the matter, how can we pass an order? ” justice Mishra asked Salve.Archana Sharma, the Rajasthan Congress spokesperson, said the merger of BSP MLAs with the Congress was legally valid and there was no ambiguity on that. “We welcome the SC direction,” she said.The hearing of the case will continue before the Rajasthan high court on Friday.Petitioner Dilawar’s lawyer Ashish Sharma said they would wait for the Rajasthan high court’s verdict, expected on Friday, to decide on the next course of action. “The arguments are expected to the completed on Friday and our next course of action will depend on the court’s order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-declines-stay-on-merger-of-6-bsp-mlas-with-cong-in-raj/story-5w6A1am4m9rlZFP8BDQ88H.html
14-08-2020||India||SC lifts registration ban on BS-IV vehicles sold until March 31||The Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the freeze on registration of BS-IV vehicles sold during the initial days of the Covid-19 lockdown until March 31. Modifying its July 31 order, a bench of Justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said: “Those vehicles sold and registered during the month of March on the E-Vahan portal and those vehicles whose temporary registrations were made, to that extent, registration is allowed. We cannot allow registration of [39,937] vehicles not uploaded on the E-Vahan portal [of the ministry of road, transport and highways].”The court on July 31 ordered the freeze after it saw abnormally high sale of vehicles in the days leading up to March 31 when business across the country came to a standstill on account of a nationwide lockdown announced in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The court on Thursday went by a chart presented by the ministry, which verified details of vehicles sold and registered on e-Vahan from March 12-31. As per the Federation of Automobile Traders Association (FADA), a total of 2,25,257 vehicles were sold during this period. On verification, the ministry found data of 1,45,152 vehicles on its portal that were granted permanent registration while 29,834 were awaiting registration. These vehicles can now be registered as per the court’s latest order.Out of the balance 50,261 vehicles, the ministry contacted states which are yet to connect on the e-Vahan portal. These states included Andhra Pradesh, and few regional transport offices in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Andaman Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. The Centre located data of 10,324 vehicles in these states but found no details about 39,937 vehicles shown as sold by FADA. The court refused to permit registration of this category of vehicles.Prior to passing the order, the bench asked senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, who appeared for FADA, to explain how so many vehicles were sold during the lockdown. The court told Vishwanathan that on March 27, the court allowed the sale of vehicles beyond March 31 in lieu of the difficulty faced by automobile dealers due to lockdown restrictions.According to the ministry, between March 12 and March 31, the e-Vahan portal recorded sales of 9,56,015 vehicles which included two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial and passenger vehicles. The maximum sales occurred on March 29 (78,525), March 30 (94,054) and March 31 (55,334).Vishwanathan explained that several vehicles were sold online while some were sold by dealers that were later sold as second-hand vehicles.“There is no advantage being taken of the court’s order. We want to dispel the notion that the FADA has tried to manipulate or play fraud on the court. The dealers were under tremendous pressure to sell the stock prior to March 31. For this reason, attractive discounts were offered. Now by denying registration, they will be placed in great financial distress.”The dealers even pointed out that during March, several days were auspicious, which recorded heavy sales. But the bench refused to accept this argument and said, “We will not permit mahurat sales. It cannot violate the law. We will make it un-mahurat (unauspicious) for you.”The bench was even keen to knock out the sale of BS-IV vehicles in Delhi as it felt this was impermissible under orders passed on October 24, 2018. But Vishwanathan clarified to the court that the restriction on the sale of BS-IV vehicles in Delhi was applicable to the sale post-March 31 and not prior in time....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-lifts-registration-ban-on-bs-iv-vehicles-sold-until-mar-31/story-PVpd9tl2BYPFY03FIZKKlL.html
14-08-2020||India||PLA still at LAC, India plans new ways to counter China’s wolf-warrior diplomacy||With the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) holding out on de-escalation at some points of its transgressions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh -- Gogra-Hot Springs as well as Pangong Tso -- the Narendra Modi government is considering new ways to counter China and ensuring that the troops are back to their peacetime locations.According to people familiar with the matter in the government and the military, contrary to China’s public posture that building trust with India is one of its diplomatic priorities, the PLA continues to sit on the green top of the Finger 4 feature on the north bank of Pangong Tso. This allows China a dominant sweep from Finger 3 to Finger 8. All the PLA has done is to vacate the saddle and the ridge beyond the brown top on the contested Finger 4.The situation in the Gogra-Hot Springs area near Kongka La is no different -- the PLA is where it transgressed, with an objective to come up to the Kugrang River, a tributary of the Shyok River.This obstinacy is matched only by the Chinese portrayal of even a routine meeting between the Indian ambassador to Beijing and a deputy director in the Foreign Affairs Commission as path-breaking, the people, none of whom wished to be identified, added. Meanwhile, they said, Beijing’s refrain about meeting India halfway is beginning to grate because “it is the PLA that is the aggressor, not the Indian army” as one official put it.The official added that this would appear to be part of China’s strategy. “The Chinese projection of normalcy with India is a suggestion that New Delhi must accept the PLA ‘s aggression and move on with resuming diplomatic dialogue. This is totally unacceptable.”Last Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry posted a statement on its website claiming that maintaining peace along the disputed boundary and deepening strategic trust with India was one of China’s key priorities. The statement has no reflection on the ground in Ladakh with the PLA making no efforts to restore status quo ante, the Indian official pointed out.“For the India-China relationship, the two sides should jointly safeguard peace and security in the border areas and maintain sound development of bilateral ties,” the statement said.While another round of diplomatic parleys between the two countries at joint secretary-level are expected soon, Indian troops are now ready to call the PLA’s bluff, the Indian officials said. The Indian military has decided that the Ladakh transgressions are unacceptable, and this includes the hindrance to Indian Army patrols in the crucial Depsang Bulge area, they added.But India has to play it cool, they said, adding that the PLA’s obstinacy in moving back may be designed to provoke a reaction from the Indian Army and use it to further escalate the situation along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-tensions-india-plans-new-ways-to-tackle-china/story-sLm0ZYo5LYaB171hy0DLLK.html
14-08-2020||India||Innovation, free expression key for digital framework||Today the internet is synonymous with human freedom. It enables a broad range of facilities that has improved the lives of millions of Indians. Beyond the rhetorical value of August 15 being our Independence Day, it marks the date on which Videsh Sanchar Nagar Limited (VSNL), launched internet services for private, individual use, in 1995, 25 years ago. .A quarter of a century is a useful benchmark to examine its growth, present challenges and a tenuous future. A structural premise to examine is the existence of the “digital divide”. This hackneyed phrase cocoons the lived reality of discriminatory internet access. It exists despite consistent effort by policy makers, governments and civil society. Data published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for 2019 shows that there is more than one connection for every two indians. This same data reveals a concentration in metropolitan areas, for instance Delhi, which has more internet connections than people. Even within these islands of connectivity, research points to a deprivation on the lines of caste, gender and income. The concern on access is further compounded in hamlets across our vast country. According to a reply in Parliament in February, around 27,721 villages lack the underlying network infrastructure for basic tele-connectivity. The gains are impressive, but inequity prevails. We cannot consider internet access without accounting for its muscular deprivation through internet shutdowns. By several estimates India leads the world in this harmful practice that undermines fundamental rights and economic growth. As noticed by the Supreme Court in its decision in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the existing regulation authorising internet shutdowns lacks elementary safeguards of a periodic review. Generally, the issue of internet access is a threshold issue, which is vital to a core development framework that will be addressed given its cross- partisan appeal. It is the initial layer of human freedom, but as much as it is achieved, social justice and liberty must match this rollout. Here, issues become contentious, as they consider competing visions of the internet -- even a digital India. While there are several areas to consider, three are significant. These are free expression, privacy and innovation which branch into several associated liberties and threats. With increase in internet access, the nature of censorship has become complex. It relies on antiquated models of criminalisation and bans that are mixed with online abuse, organised disinformation and a deluge of information on social media. Today, voter manipulation, non-consensual sexual abuse imagery, and user additiction are germane issues which provide a choice between a rights-based framework or growth of authoritarianism to public officials and policy makers. These trends, incorrectly posed as trade-offs are similarly evident in the domain of individual privacy. This denominative value of privacy for the ordinary Indian is the facility of independent choice. This is being gradually eroded under the guise of ease and convenience. Personal data is being amassed and surveillance systems are being deployed as the internet transforms from a communication technology to being integrated with physical facilities and access controls. Here, data, rather than citizenship will determine fundamental rights and this requires a spirited defence of fundamental rights. Finally, the mantra of innovation continues to hold promise for entrepreneurs when it permits value for users through the creation of new products and services. Here, there is reason to be guarded against the doctrine of hyperscale and monopolies -- by Silicon Valley platforms, influential technologists, telecom companies and even by the government. After all, we should heed the lessons of liberalisation that was premised in ensuring a market environment based on competition. It would be amiss to note these challenges without considering the impact of the ongoing pandemic. The internet has been vital in overcoming its challenge, for instance in ensuring remote healthcare for millions. Here, rather than a tryst with destiny, we would be well served to look back at a difficult time in our national history. When we faced external aggression, economic distress and continuing religious tensions. Reflecting on these challenges, Prime Minister Nehru on August 15, 1963 stated, “Free India is still a child, for what are sixteen years in the life of a country?”. In a similar sentiment, even if we do not consider the internet a child, for this transformational technology a quarter of a century only marks an early teenage. We must be hopeful, but honest to our constitutional vision as we look towards a digital India.(Apar Gupta, is an advocate and the executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/innovation-free-expression-key-for-digital-framework/story-GQwh69PtLE69SKNpQMwwBJ.html
14-08-2020||India||Gehlot is our leader, have never disputed his leadership: Vishvendra Singh||Vishvendra Singh, the former Rajasthan minister for tourism and a part of the 18 dissident Congress leaders, who had backed sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot in his bitter power struggle against CM Ashok Gehlot, spoke to HT about the recent political high drama in the desert state. Edited excerpts of the interview: Were you in Delhi or Manesar in Haryana for all these days? Why were the lawmakers camping in Haryana? Initially, we went to Delhi. But since Delhi hotels were shut because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, I decided to stay at my residence in the national capital, Mr. Pilot stayed at his and the rest of the MLAs (members of the Rajasthan legislative assembly) decided to stay at one place ... they wanted to stay at a central place in Haryana. Besides, Manesar and Gurgram are both close to Delhi. We went to Delhi to update the party high command that the election manifesto was not being implemented at a pace it should have been, and the coordination between the two – the government and the organisation – had left a lot to be desired. We wanted to apprise the high command about all these sticking points. Also read: Congress revokes suspension of 2 Rajasthan MLAs from Sachin Pilot camp ahead of key meetWe also heard a statement allegedly from the Pilot camp that the Gehlot government is reduced to a minority and Pilot had the support of 30 MLAs. Was there an attempt to topple the democratically elected government? There’s a leader, and always only one leader. We went under the leadership of Mr. Pilot as the PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee) chief and deputy CM. We all along had maintained radio silence about our misgivings. Though we have been abused by a section of people, we did not react to those statements. We are part of the same family and we wanted to convey a unified picture to the party high command. ALSO WATCH | ‘Gehlot head of the family, never disputed his leadership’: Vishvendra Singh There was a perception that the Pilot faction was hobnobbing with the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and the latter was behind the political turmoil because it had wanted to cash in on the factionalism and form its own government. How do you react to this perception? How are we supposed to be linked to the BJP? Each one of us (MLAs) has paid our own bills, and each one of us has paid the lawyers. Mr. Pilot has all the relevant documents to back my assertions. If we were allegedly hobnobbing with the BJP, then we would not be having this discussion? Who’s your leader? Gehlot or Pilot? Our leader is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. At the Centre, it is also Rahul Gandhiji and Priyanka Gandhji. At the state level, it is Mr. Gehlot since he is the CM and the head of the family … we have never disputed his leadership, neither has Mr. Pilot joined issue over it. Else, Mr. Pilot would not have settled for the deputy CM’s portfolio. Whoever the high command chooses is our leader. If the high command would have decided Mr. Pilot as the CLP (Congress legislative party) leader, then he would have been our leader. However, Mr. Gehlot was chosen by the high command, while Mr. Pilot is the leader of the state organisation, as the PCC chief. Will you attend the CLP happens, as and when it is convened? Why not? I’m not guilty of any wrongdoing. Did the high command give you any assurance about restoring your Cabinet berth? No. We have put no condition … the only condition is that we want self-respect and we want protection from the high command and that the promises made to the public must be fulfilled without any further delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-is-our-leader-have-never-disputed-his-leadership-vishvendra-singh/story-WODtwEtuQDwyzq23VRLnGJ.html
14-08-2020||Editorials||The SC must introspect||In India’s complex institutional architecture, the judiciary occupies a special place. It is the upholder of the Constitution and the final arbiter of justice. It evokes faith due to its rigour and independence. It protects citizens from the excesses of the State, ensures that the political system cannot use an electoral mandate to change the basic structure of the Constitution, settles disputes between the Centre and states, between states, between the State and citizens, and among citizens. These have helped reinforce the reputation of the courts, especially the Supreme Court (SC), as truly independent. And that is why it is disappointing to see SC hold senior advocate and activist Prashant Bhushan guilty of contempt. Mr Bhushan had posted two separate tweets — one in which he accused SC, and especially the past four Chief Justices of India, of aiding the “destruction” of democracy, and another in which he made a personal remark about the Chief Justice in the context of courts remaining locked down. This newspaper does not endorse the content of either of Mr Bhushan’s tweets, but the issue here is the manner in which court has dealt with the issue, which is more about individuals and less about the court itself. There is a certain rationale for the provision of contempt. But for it to have legitimacy and effectiveness, it must be used in rare circumstances — when the State or citizens refuse to abide by the order of the court, when there is clear evidence of obstruction of justice, and when the court itself is being targeted. A 2012 United Kingdom (UK) Law Commission report provides an excellent template in this regard, where it recommended that the offence of “scandalising the court” was an infringement of freedom of expression that should not be retained; this was subsequently implemented by the UK Parliament. In India too, contempt must not apply to criticism of judges because that doesn’t necessarily mean criticism of the court. And even criticism of the court should be allowed. If citizens point out what they think is a shortcoming of the court — be it in terms of how it is prioritising cases or adopting a certain process of jurisprudence or the logical inconsistencies in a certain order — allow it. These criticisms may not always be well-reasoned or even fair, but it is through discussion in the public sphere that institutions become stronger and democracy thrives. The apex court needs to have a far more liberal interpretation of the contempt provision, even as it safeguards the sanctity of the judicial process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-sc-must-introspect/story-jFEDAiL10bmFSNRGK6talO.html
