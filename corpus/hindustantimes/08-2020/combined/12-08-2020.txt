Chinese troops intruded into areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh region where the Indian tactical presence was thin and there is an October 1962 sense of déjà vu.In a puzzling development, the ministry of defence (MoD) uploaded some details of the transgression by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops in the Ladakh region on its website on August 4. Within two days, this was removed without ascribing any reason. This lack of consistency on a grave national security matter was avoidable.But as per media reports, the gravity of the challenge posed by PLA and its transgression in Ladakh was formally conveyed to a committee of lawmakers by the Chief of Defence Staff General, Bipin Rawat, on August 10. Currently, there is a stalemate in the de-escalation process which has compelled the Indian Army to deploy heavily along LAC and the committee was informed that this may be a “long-drawn process”.The Indian military will have to prepare for a long haul in manning LAC so that there are no more “surprises” in other sectors. The Pakistan factor remains a perennial operational concern. Thus, the robustness of the inventory and logistics-maintenance depth of the three armed forces will be a critical factor in the short-term, as India prepares to manage a post-Galwan bilateral relationship with China.In this context, defence minister Rajnath Singh put out a series of tweets on August 9 that underlined the resolve of the Narendra Modi government to redress long-festering structural issues pertaining to defence imports. Over the last decade, India has been in the very top-tier of global arms importers and this blunts the claim to “strategic autonomy” and major power status that Delhi aspires for. The flip side is that, during this period, Beijing has emerged as a major arms exporter and a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) study of January indicated that currently “China is the second-largest arms producer in the world, behind the United States but ahead of Russia.”In the latest defence imports iteration, MoD listed 101 items as part of military platforms and equipment whose import would be embargoed progressively from now till 2025. This is a reiteration of a 2016 policy that the objective would be to encourage/compel the Indian armed forces to source these products from an indigenous manufacturer and thereby reduce import dependency. The list is large and varies from sniper rifles and self-propelled /towed artillery guns to different types of warships, combat aircraft and missiles.This resolve to buy Indian-made military products is desirable and unexceptionable. A nation that imports a high percentage of its critical military remains vulnerable to the reliability of the supplier even while imposing high fiscal costs. However, the realisation of this objective — buy only make-in-India products — is predicated on a central assumption: That the domestic techno-industrial ecosystem has acquired the necessary competence to produce in a timely and cost-effective manner what the military needs, to acquire and sustain the optimum operational profile necessary to deal with the complex security challenges that are now more visible.This proven competence level is yet to be arrived at. Consequently, while the intent is laudable, the wherewithal across the Indian military design, research and development (R&D) and manufacturing landscape need much greater infusion of resources — both material and human than what obtains now.Successive governments have sought to prioritise the “make-in-India” objective but with limited success. There is a paradox here, for India has attained a commendable degree of design-cum-manufacturing sufficiency based on the indigenous effort in certain strategic capabilities — viz nuclear weapons, satellites, missiles and nuclear propulsion (albeit with Russian assistance) but not in the conventional arms domain.Yes, some major platforms are assembled or made in India such as fighter aircraft or tanks (MIG and T-72) but according to an imported design. The one area where there has been a commendable success is in warship design and building but even here, the equipment that accords the naval ship its war-fighting capability, the ordnance (guns-missiles) and the advanced surveillance are mostly imported.Regrettably, there were a few design successes in the military domain. Though encouraging when they blossomed, they died a nascent death due to lack of strategic vision, political vacillation and institutional turf battles that turned venal. The story of the HF 24 fighter aircraft and the navy’s Advanced Panoramic Sonar Hull Mounted (APSOH) sonar is a case in point.The bigger constraint in the Rajnath Singh announcement is that no additional funds are being earmarked to give a fillip to the new Make in India policy. Further, a pandemic-afflicted economy will have little to spare for the military-defence complex to nurture R&D and design skills across the board.The R&D-cum-design shortcomings in India are endemic and best illustrated by the saga of the combat boots. As a former army commander lamented, “India manufactures some of the best shoes in the world but the Indian army wears the worst combat boots in the world which has remained unchanged in design for 130 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-quest-for-self-reliance-in-defence/story-GizPLPQRc1kJDphuzJTyeN.html
12-08-2020||News||How government policies are harming the IT sector | Opinion||It has often been said that the only reason why the Indian information technology (IT) industry scaled the heights it did was because the government never quite understood how it worked, and, so, did not impose on it the sort of regulatory burdens that it did on other sectors. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Thanks to a series of misplaced policy choices, the government has systematically eroded the permitted operations of the Indian outsourcing industry to the point where it is no longer globally competitive.Foremost among these are the telecom regulations imposed on a category of companies broadly known as Other Service Providers (OSPs). Anyone who provides “application services” is an OSP and the term “application services” is defined to mean “tele-banking, telemedicine, tele-education, tele-trading, e-commerce, call centres, network operation centres and other IT-enabled services”. When it was first introduced, these regulations were supposed to apply to the traditional outsourcing industry, focusing primarily on call centre operations. However, it has, over the years been interpreted far more widely than originally intended.While OSPs do not require a license to operate, they do have to comply with a number of telecom restrictions. The central regulatory philosophy behind these restrictions is the government’s insistence that voice calls terminated in an OSP facility over the regular Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) must be kept from intermingling with those carried over the data network. To that end, OSPs are required to design their networks so that they can demonstrate a separation between voice and data calls.While these restrictions may have made sense a decade ago, when data wasn’t as ubiquitous as it is now, the insistence on maintaining such arbitrary distinctions between different types of calls in today’s world seems daft. Everyone I know prefers to call me over WhatsApp, Skype or any one of a number of data-based call services because the regular voice network cannot be trusted. To require IT companies that operate on the cutting-edge of technology to maintain this distinction when, just outside their gleaming campuses, the average man on the street can choose whichever service suits him, is incomprehensible.Central to the enforcement of these regulations is the Electronic Private Automatic Branch Exchange (EPABX), a piece of telecom equipment that was once the central junction box through which all telecom connections into and out of an office flowed. The utility of an EPABX has dwindled in a world where the vast majority of telephone conversations happen over the mobile network, but, in OSPs, it remains a central fixture. In the early days, OSPs were required to maintain separate EPABXs for voice and data ensuring that the data network was kept physically separate from the voice network. These restrictions have since been relaxed and OSPs can now have a central EPABX through which voice and data calls flow so long as the EPABX maintains a logical separation between voice and data.But even this is anachronistic. All global businesses today manage their call and data networks centrally using a single global EPABX located in any one country in which they have operations. This allows them to deliver the sort of converged user experience that customers have come to expect with modern service offerings. In addition, having data centrally managed allows businesses far greater control over their sales and customer conversion rates than is otherwise possible. However, since Indian regulations require OSPs to have an EPABX physically located in India, global businesses with operations in India are forced to re-engineer their networks to specially account for these restrictions.For companies already operating in India, this is often treated as an additional cost of continuing to do business in here, even though clients I have spoken with have confirmed that we are the only country they have operations in that imposes these restrictions. For companies that are evaluating whether or not to use India as a base for new operations, this is, more often than not, viewed as an unreasonably onerous restriction that imposes an unacceptably high level of constraints on the way in which they can structure their operations. As a result, this is often the single biggest reason why they end up choosing some other less restrictive jurisdiction in which to establish their operations.It is not clear to me why India continues to persist with this regulatory model. There was a time when the government had a legitimate concern that if they allowed voice and data networks to intermingle with each other, the resulting toll bypass would have meant a significant reduction in licence revenues. Given that today ordinary citizens regularly switch between voice and data on their mobile phones depending on the reliability of the available network, this is surely no longer the case. Why India continues to implement these antiquated regulations even after it has become evident that these restrictions are affecting its global competitiveness is simply beyond me.The IT industry accounts for close to 8% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is the metaphorical goose that lays golden eggs. Let’s try not to kill it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-government-policies-are-harming-the-it-sector/story-qu4JUCEQEnXzjHKStyWsMK.html
12-08-2020||News||L-G Sinha must create a politically inclusive J&K | Opinion||Manoj Sinha’s appointment as the new Lieutenant Governor (L-G) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is a refreshing change. Sinha — a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader — has proven political and administrative skills, having been a part of the Union government in the railway and telecom ministries, where, by all accounts, he did a competent job. As a leader rooted in the complex politics of eastern Uttar Pradesh, he also brings to the table political skills in managing social groups, and an understanding of the intersection between politics, administration and law and order.These skills will be essential in J&K — which has been stuck in a political stalemate ever since the effective nullification of Article 370. His appointment is a signal that the Centre now wants to break this impasse and move the political process forward.But to understand how the stalemate deepened, one has to go back to developments in the aftermath of August 5. The constitutional changes were welcomed by citizens in the rest of India, and it was received with elation in Jammu and Ladakh. But the regional parties of Kashmir Valley and stakeholders in the Shia-dominated Kargil area were opposed to the changes. Anticipating a civil disobedience movement, particularly in the Valley, the Centre decided to impose the writ of the State through a set of hard measures.This had three significant implications.The first was that democratic forces and anti-democratic forces were treated in a similar manner. And this led to a convergence in their opposition to the Centre’s moves, not physically on the ground, but in principle. Second, it led to a series of media reports, both within India and internationally, pointing to the debilitating impact of these restrictions on normal civilian life and democracy. And three, there was an international reaction. Pakistan predictably kicked up a storm — though its campaign to discredit India hasn’t worked. United States President Donald Trump offered to mediate, but Washington has gone back to its position of treating the issue as a bilateral one. And China became active in the Kashmir theatre — both by shepherding Pakistan’s efforts at the United Nations, and objecting to the changes in the administrative status of Ladakh. Many observers believe that China’s recent aggression across the Line of Actual Control could be traced back to the changes in J&K.It is in this broad political-security context that Sinha has taken over.The new L-G should not — even if this sounds counter-intuitive — get too bogged down in the minutiae of security operations in Kashmir. This is not to suggest that there aren’t security challenges. There is the ever-present threat from Pakistan, and more so now, since it could intensify its activity at the border in sync with China. There is also the emergence of a cadre of technologically-savvy young, radicalised men of South Kashmir who are targeting all those associated with democratic institutions. And then, there are the terrorists sent in by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba and Al Badr who are limited in numbers, but high on resolve in inflicting terror.But, over the years, the J&K Police has developed an effective response to threats emanating from terrorist groups. The army is capable of dealing with both the external fronts. And together, all the security system stakeholders — the army, state police, CAPFs, and the wider intelligence community — have the experience of working in sync. Sinha needs to, of course, be familiar with the overall security situation and provide direction when needed — but he need not make this the focus of his term.What Sinha, instead, must focus on is creating a politically inclusive set-up for all sections of Kashmiris. He needs to be aware of a key grievance of the “pro-India” element of the polity. These segments rightly feel they have been treated at par with the pro-Pakistan and the pro-independence elements of the polity. For all their weaknesses, it must be recognised that these democratic forces have the support of a large section of citizens, and their assessment that status quo will only breed further alienation must be taken into account.To tackle this, the L-G must personally meet all the leaders of both national and regional political parties of the Union Territory in general, but the Valley in particular — both in delegations as well as individually to establish a personal rapport with them. If Kashmiris feel they have a patient, attentive and sensitive listener, that itself will go a long way in bridging the trust deficit. He must also push for the release of all mainstream democratic leaders and drop charges against them — even as secessionist leaders remain under detention.The L-G should also take into account recent policy actions — such as domicile certificates to non-residents and housing schemes for security personnel — which have not gone down well with the people of all regions. Sinha must also lead the effort to convince the Centre and the security apparatus to restore 4G connectivity. He must closely assess the detrimental impact of both government measures as well as the pandemic on normal everyday life — and seek to resolve it. Better connectivity, for instance, can enable more effective online classes across educational institutions. He must ensure that at the district level, Covid-19 is accorded the highest priority in terms of public health.Once Sinha understands the political contours, establishes communication and trust with the Valley’s political leaders, and takes steps which improve everyday civilian life, he must come up with a political report on how to revive the electoral process in J&K.It is time for all stakeholders to give Sinha time, and for Sinha to live up to the trust reposed in him by PM Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/l-g-sinha-must-create-a-politically-inclusive-j-k/story-IhguvDhCivA13PPXG2UwJI.html
12-08-2020||News||Who’s undermining the global order?||In 2018, in a speech at the Raisina Dialogue, the conference held by the ministry of external affairs and the Observer Research Foundation, the late foreign minister Sushma Swaraj, declared that the world was in transition— there was now a “departure from longstanding practices,” “a shift away from multilateralism and alliances,” and a retreat from globalisation. While Swaraj was circumspect, many others have since been more candid. A few days ago, for example, former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd argued that the global order was being reshaped by China. These statements articulate the prevalent anxiety behind a question that many have been grappling with — is the current international order in decline? In particular, is the United States (US)-led order under threat of revisionism by China and other actors? The answer to this question often relates to where one stands on the political spectrum, and consequently tends to fall into black-and-white categories of either singular affirmation or denial. In reality, however, the answer is complex because international order is complex. Disagreements between China and the US are not the same as disagreements between China and international order. To understand this, it is important to understand what international order is and what it implies.Princeton professor G John Ikenberry has called international order “the organising rules and institutions of world politics…through which [countries] do business”. His work and that of many others imply four facts about the international order. First, order is not a passive outcome but an active creation by powerful countries. Second, it rests on shared ideas. Third, these ideas are shared across not one but many issues. Finally, participating countries need to be willing to buy into order. So if we argue that a country is revisionist of the international order, what we mean is that it is deliberately trying to reorganise these rules and institutions, trying to change the shared ideas that underpin order, that it is doing so across issues, and that it has the help of countries willing to buy into its proposed changes.Which brings us to the current international order and how these implications play out. The international order today was created and led by the US and its allies after World War II, and its byword was multilateralism. The principles of the 1941 Atlantic Charter in which Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill declared a shared commitment to free trade and collective security were more formally enshrined during the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 — a new economic and security order with international institutions for multilateral cooperation emerged and thrived. But today, who is revising and who is accommodating these institutions that are the bedrock of the post-World War II international order does not play out along neat lines. For example, Donald Trump’s assertion of America First has led to a decline in long-standing collective security arrangements — last month, he withdrew 9,500 US troops from German soil undermining the US-German solidarity that was the foundation of the trans-Atlantic security cooperation and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Trump has also criticised multilateral agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that could restrain China — for example, by setting or preserving information and communication technology (ICT) standards that would impede China trying to set Chinese technology as the standard for the hard infrastructure of Internet connectivity.China too has rejected or violated the shared ideas of some of the international institutions it has joined — it has not, for example, ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (although neither has the US) and argues that it is compliant with international human rights norms. But as Columbia University professor, Andrew Nathan, points out, it has also partially or wholly complied with many other shared ideas, particularly because in many cases it has served its interests to do so. Its embrace of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), for example, has been highly selective and biased towards its own interests — in accordance with the norms of UNCLOS, it expects to dispatch spy ships into other countries’ exclusive economic zones to monitor both their economic (which is legal) and military activities (subject to interpretation) without incident but objects to and occasionally harasses other countries for allegedly violating its own space in the South China Sea. Its embrace of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been more wholehearted and straightforward where it has worked to make domestic changes in order to bring China into compliance with the WTO’s accession agreement, leading one study to conclude that Beijing operates within the WTO system. And as its share of global investment has increased, many experts have found that Beijing has become a defender of the interests of capital, borrowing its norms directly from the West.What we find from these examples is that countries that we expect to buy into the current order may revise aspects of it while countries we expect not to buy into the order may accommodate important parts of it, especially when it speaks to their interests. Nor can we assume that the builder of international order, in this case the US, will also be the upholder of it in every issue area. Finally, it’s worth remembering that since creating and sharing the norms of the international order rests on a concert of countries, this leaves room for multiple influential actors and not simply the most powerful ones.Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor of international relations, Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University, and a research associate at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, University of OxfordThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/who-s-undermining-the-global-order/story-V44PpDshKk7o9S1D93RPIO.html

These properties include booths, double storey shops, shopping and office complexes spread across estate office 1 and 2. HSVP officials said that these properties are at prime locations and they expect it to generate around ₹100 crore in revenue. The success of the auctions is crucial as HSVP is facing an acute financial crisis with large loans to pay for land acquisition and enhancements. The properties in the estate office I listed for auction fall in sectors 4, 5, 7 extension, 9, 9A, 10A, 15 part one and two, sector 21 and those located on the jail land. The properties listed in estate office II are located sector 38, 39, 45 and 56. The base price of commercial spaces in estate office 1 has been fixed ₹3.5 crore, while in estate office II, it is ₹4.5 crore.Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer 1 said, “We hope to sell these properties at prime locations. In the mean time, the auction of residential plots is still on hold pending a court decision. We are preparing a list of plots that would be reserved for those whose land have been acquired and thereafter, we shall seek permission to sell the remaining plots.” HSVP in June had said that it had identified 163 commercial plots, 137 residential plots and 27 institutional plots that would be put on auction. The authority has also identified 26 sites for schools that include two high schools, eight primary schools and 15 nurseries that would be put on the block.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-to-auction-85-commercial-properties-on-friday/story-2U7vvu2793HkYJHLU8H7CM.html

She had been running a fever for the past 10 days.“The officials at Meerut informed us about the death and also that she tested positive for Covid-19 after tested with the help of TrueNat machine. The exact cause of death will be known after the death audit. Her family had delayed bringing her to the L-1 (mild care) district women’s hospital and she was immediately referred to Meerut,” said Dr NK Gupta, district chief medical officer. An official at the women’s hospital said that she had tested negative in the antigen test before she was referred to the Meerut hospital.More surveillanceThe district magistrate has instructed different surveillance teams on door-to-door surveys to take more comprehensive efforts to detect more possible cases in order to reduce the number of patients requiring critical care. “The teams are carrying out surveys in containment zones as well as outside. Their primary job is to identify the cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (Sari). But they have also been directed to keep track of patients with co-morbidities and also anyone who underwent deliveries or any surgeries. The idea is to locate more people who could develop severe conditions,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate (DM). “The general public is also requested to cooperate with the survey teams.” According to the health department, the officials have a set of about 861 teams who are taking up surveillance activities on day to basis in containment zones while other teams comprising of 3047 booth level officers and 237 of their supervisors are also taking up door-to-door surveys in the district. The block level officers (BLO) have also been directed that they will keep track whether the suspected cases have undergone tests or not and will further inform the integrated control room where team of doctors will motivate people to take up testing in case they fail to take up Covid-19 test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/30-year-old-woman-dies-of-covid-days-after-delivery/story-ugn1JcTMKLOiBOw3UjN9ZN.html
12-08-2020||City||Luxury cars, properties worth ₹1.2 cr of eight gangsters attached||Noida: The Noida police commissionerate on Tuesday attached assets, including luxury cars and properties, worth ₹1.2 crore of eight known gangsters and mafias across the district.The move is a deterrent against organised crime and known criminals active in Gautam Budh Nagar, said the police. “One of them is related to the Shahberi incident also. He is a Ghaziabad native and we have attached his SUVs, among other vehicles,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.Nine people were killed in the twin building collapse in Shahberi village on July 17, 2018 while several builders were booked under the Gangster Act for allegedly selling unauthorised plots in the area. Under Section 14a of the Gangster Act, movable and immovable assets of criminals booked under the act can be attached if they are obtained by fraudulent methods. Earlier, the power to attach such assets resided with the district magistrate. However, with the formation of the commissionerate system in Gautam Budh Nagar, the power is now in the hands of the police commissioner.“We have attached a total of nine four wheelers, two 2-wheelers and two tractors. The total worth of all the assets is around ₹1.2 crore. Action has been taken against eight gangsters and mafias, most of whom were wanted in major loot and dacoity cases. We will continue to take more action against them,” said the DCP. Four of these suspects are from Ghaziabad while the rest are from Gautam Budh Nagar, said the police. They were identified as Suraj Chandra Sharma (related to the Shahberi incident), his father Mahesh Chandra, Sanjeev Kumar, Rishi Tyagi, Hajendra, Harish, Rohit and Vikas Chaudhary respectively.In a similar move in July, assets worth more than ₹14 crore of various suspects were attached.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/luxury-cars-properties-worth-1-2-cr-of-eight-gangsters-attached/story-XBGq2Sq0hMWoUGunrEzPQL.html
12-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad police recommends cancellation of 125 arms licences for violations||The Ghaziabad police has recommended the cancellation of 125 arms licences after their holders were allegedly found misusing or violating the licence conditions during a special drive. The police said they have sent a report to the district administration recommending their cancellations. During the drive in the past one week, the police of various police station areas were directed to inquire about weapons whose license holders have criminal records; or their close relatives were involved in crime; or those who gave their weapons to any other person and also those who were found not having possession of the weapon. The list also included those persons who did not renew their licences despite expiry of licences. “The idea behind the drive is to ensure that arms are used properly by licence holders and strictly comply with conditions. It has come to light that there are use of illegal weapons in crime and even instances wherein people violate licence conditions. We have identified 125 such cases wherein there has been violation of conditions. A report has been sent to the district administration for cancellation of such licences,” SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said in a video recorded message sent to the media. “We will also initiate action under the Arms Act,” he added. He did not respond to calls when contacted. The officer further added that since January 1, the police have registered 755 cases under the Arms Act and also arrested about 100 persons for posting photos or videos while holding weapons on the social media. “The current operation is also being speeded up. The SHOs have been asked to find out if licence holders have given their weapons to anyone else or not using properly the cartridges issued to them. They have also been asked to find out instances wherein people have deposited their weapons in shops and have not taken them back. The current drive will continue,” he said. Of the 125 licence holders, the police found that 27 of them had close relatives or family members having criminal history while 55 had either criminal cases against themselves or their close relatives. There were another 10 instances wherein licence holders did not renew their licences and 13 were those who had tried to terrify others with arms. Another seven instances were those who were involved in celebratory firing while eight others were found to have loaned their weapons to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-police-recommends-cancellation-of-125-arms-licences-for-violations/story-xUT1jvB12lw2XWsnnL4QJP.html

12-08-2020||Mumbai||25% students of civic-run schools unable to access online learning: BMC||Around 25% students enrolled in schools under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have not been able to join online learning in the current academic year, data obtained by the civic body’s education department has revealed. Some of the key reasons behind a large number of students not being able to take part in online learning are migration of parents due to loss of livelihood, unavailability of android phones, not being able to afford internet connection and schools not having updated contact details of parents. In a circular released on Tuesday, the education department has asked schools and teachers to take measures to ensure that 100% students are able to access online learning. To begin with, schools have to compile data for each student which has to be sent to the civic body. Every school also has to form a committee, consisting parents, school principal, representatives of NGOs etc, which has to meet online at least once every 15 days to take a stock of the situation and ensure that all students are accessing online education. For students who are ‘out of school’ due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation, schools have been asked to identify palak mitra (friends among parents) who will help other parents with online learning, sharing of resources etc. Similarly, principals have been asked to ensure that they take up learning activities in communities keeping in mind social distancing norms. “It is worrying to see that some students are not able to join online learning due to several challenges. While the situation is unprecedented, it is also important for us to ensure that not a single child is left out. If that happens, chances are that students might drop out. Schools should take up the necessary actions to ensure that this doesn’t happen,” said Mahesh Palkar, BMC education officer. As per the data obtained by BMC in June, the migrant exodus displaced nearly 1.15 lakh or 21% of the total students enrolled in civic and private primary schools in Mumbai. “While some families have come back home, several others still remain in their hometowns waiting to find work to be able to return. There is poor connectivity in rural areas, so we try to call them whenever we can to give them guidance about how to study,” said a teacher who works at a BMC school in the suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/25-students-of-civic-run-schools-unable-to-access-online-learning-bmc/story-2oA8KeSDv6NPf224j4inIM.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||HC directs state to respond to PIL seeking taskforce to curb sale of gutkha||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to file an affidavit in reply to a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought directions to constitute a special task force led by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to deal with manufacturing, selling, trading of banned products including gutkha, khaini, zarda and other products which could contribute towards the spread of Covid-19. The plea seeks stringent laws to implement the ban as well as immediate action against cartels, hoarders and transporters from Madhya Pradesh.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the PIL filed by lawyer Arvind Singh, was informed by senior advocate Jamshed Cama along with advocates Anil Mishra and Jindagi Shah that one of the contributors to the spread of Covid 19 was banned products like gutkha, khaini and zarda. Cama submitted that as Covid-19 spreads through droplets from the mouth, infected persons who consumed these products could transfer the infection through their saliva when they spit in public places. Cama further submitted that smoking could also result in the spread of the virus.Cama further submitted that though the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations, 2011 banned the use of gutkha and nicotine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Maharashtra had banned the use of these products from time to time through orders. He also submitted that the Maharashtra FDA had, on February 7, announced that persons found manufacturing gutkha would be booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) Act.He submitted that as the ban was in place, the products were coming from Madhya Pradesh after the district magistrate of Indore allowed pan masala wholesalers and retailers to sell their products outside the district. He submitted that a large consignment of gutkha had entered Maharashtra which posed a huge threat to the lives of the citizens, and hence immediate steps should be taken to stop it.Cama stressed there was an urgent need to form a special task force to be led by CBI to unearth the trade routes, manufacturing units and selling points to stop the use of gutkha and related products. After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state to file an affidavit in response to the plea and posted the matter for hearing on September 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-state-to-respond-to-pil-seeking-taskforce-to-curb-sale-of-gutkha/story-Q7rKlfRDSn2Jx98lZ7ButL.html

The slots can be booked on the Covid dashboard of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), informed civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma. TMC had issued several guidelines last week for the ten-day festival and also assured to increase idol donation centre in the city to curb the crowd at immersion sites. The pre-booking is another initiative to aim at easing the crowd. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC said, “The city this year will have 13 artificial lakes and 20 idol donation centres. People will be allowed to book their time slots at all these sites and will be allowed to immerse idols as per their slots. The bookings for slots will be opened from Friday, August 14.” The slots can be booked on www.covidthane.org. Malvi said, “There will be a list of artificial lakes and donation centres. Devotees will have to choose one centre, day, date and time slot. We appeal that maximum residents should book their immersion slots beforehand and avoid overcrowding.” The slots will not be allowed for those residing in containment zones. The residents in containment zones will have to immerse the idols within the zone or at their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-residents-can-pre-book-immersion-slots-online-to-avoid-crowding/story-YrXVVrTYYmDRDijHvU7QiK.html
12-08-2020||City||Ulhasnagar residents’ association demands cancellation of tenders for Covid facilities||In a letter addressed to the commissioner of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) earlier this week, the Ulhasnagar Residents’ Association has asked to cancel five tenders issued by the civic body for Covid facilities worth around ₹18 crore. The association claims the expenses will be a waste of public funds as the additional treatment infrastructure will not be required. The residents’ association, in its letter, mentioned that UMC had issued tenders worth ₹1.60 crore to set up a 400-bed Covid centre at Tabor Ashram, and other tenders worth around ₹16-₹17 crore to acquire various medicinal instruments and equipment for Covid hospitals and Covid centres. Moti Ludhwani, founder of the association, said, “The civic body has plans to build a 650-bed Covid centre in its Town Hall, so why build another 400-bed facility at Tabor Ashram, which is around 10km away from Ulhasnagar when patients will not be willing to go there. We feel it is a waste of money as the number of active cases in the city is around 400-500 now, and there are enough beds, of which 85% are vacant as per the civic body’s website. We want UMC to cancel this tender.” The association also alleged that the tenders issued for the materials and medical equipment are overpriced and need to be cancelled. “We have asked the civic body chief to take expert views before finalising the tenders and spending more,” said Ludhwani. Yuvraj Badhane, public relations officer, UMC, explained that the infrastructure is required as the pandemic is not over. “The health infrastructure is not up to mark in Ulhasnagar, so we are setting up this infrastructure with a focus on the future. At present, we have to send patients to quarantine at the Tata Amantra at Kalyan-Bhiwandi road, which is far away. Comparatively, Tabor Ashram is nearby and well-equipped with facilities,” Badhane said.He said that the corporation will take into account expert views before issuing tenders for the remaining infrastructure and equipment, which are necessary to tackle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ulhasnagar-residents-association-demands-cancellation-of-tenders-for-covid-facilities/story-wr0ZTNoBgcQgUMIuEJ22vK.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||Demand for office spaces to go down as work from home becomes the norm||A pan-India report to understand the impact of Covid-19 on cities and mobility has revealed that there will be a significant reduction in demand for commercial real estate and office spaces post-lockdown as companies may encourage employees to continue working from home. Of the respondents, who include business leaders, policymakers, researchers and academicians, 60% felt the demand for office space would reduce post-lockdown.According to the report, ‘Project Impact: Impact of Covid-19 on Cities and Mobility’, which surveyed more than 350 decision-makers and experts across cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, etc, 89% respondents said that going forward, the ‘work-from-home’ concept would have greater acceptance; 79% said that office sizes would reduce, while 49% said that people would prefer bigger houses if work from home becomes a norm.The survey was conducted between June and July via questionnaire and interviews by Cities Forum, a global organisation looking into urban issues; the Gujarat-based CEPT Research and Development Foundation (CDRF); a German development agency, and Ideal Management Consultants. The organisations had previously released a similar global report based on a survey of industry leaders across 45 countries in June 2020.Shailendra Kaushik, co-founder, Cities Forum, said, “This is an opportunity for smaller cities to grow, as people would prefer living in smaller cities with larger tenement sizes, in the post-lockdown scenario.”DS Mishra, secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, who has been quoted in the report, said, “Covid-19 pandemic has engulfed the entire world, adversely impacting lives and livelihoods of citizens. It has severely stressed the urban systems, including healthcare infrastructure. However, this pandemic has given us an opportunity to rethink the way we live, work, shop, study, socialise, travel or pursue any other activity.”According to the survey, 88% of the respondents said that cities need to invest more in cycling and walking infrastructure. The organizing institutions hope this research helps to drive policy decisions.An overwhelming majority also feel that there will be a drastic decrease in public transport trips in cities. Additionally, 93% said that public hygiene needs to be given more importance, followed by frequency and flexible routes, to make public transport more reliable. The majority of respondents said that there would be an increase in cycling, walking and usage of personal vehicles considering the safety factor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/demand-for-office-spaces-to-go-down-as-work-from-home-becomes-the-norm/story-8NKjOfF4PYQg4ZMwUYHEWJ.html
12-08-2020||City||Despite 16 infected staffers, no contact tracing at Ludhiana MC’s offices||Even as two employees of the Ludhiana municipal corporation have succumbed to Covid-19, while 16 have tested positive in the recent past, the district’s health department has yet to track their contacts.Though the family members of the infected staff have been home quarantined, nothing much has been done to check the spread of the virus in the various MC offices, posing risk to hundreds of employees and daily visitors. Among those positive are a joint commissioner, superintendent, sub-divisional officer, MC commissioner’s personal assistant, an inspector deputed in the house tax wing at Zone D office, a staffer aligned with a councillor and several sanitation workers. The deceased are two sweepers from Zones C and D, while four staffers, including the joint commissioner and three sanitation workers, have recovered. Besides, three councillors – Manpreet Grewal, Rakesh Prashar and Sukhdev Shera – had also tested positive in the past.A staff member, requesting anonymity, claimed that the health department had not conducted contact tracing in any of these cases. “Even as the inspector deputed in the house tax wing at Zone D office has contracted the infection, his colleagues are still working there without getting tested. Also the staff at MC commissioner’s office is working without any check-up. While the office was sanitised, not a single person was quarantined,” the employee said.“Only verbal directions are issued by senior officials to the staff concerned to get themselves tested. But neither does the staff follow the directions nor do the officials follow-up. Some employees had also demanded that the affected offices be closed for some days to break the chain of infection, but in vain,” he said.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “The attached staff were immediately told to get the tests done after some employees started testing positive. Precautions are being taken in MC offices, with everyone entering the premises being scanned for body temperature. Residents should avoid visiting offices for now and forward their concerns online.” On the health department’s part, district epidemiologist Dr Ramesh said, “The department has increased the number of teams for contact tracing. Some teams will also be sent to the MC offices in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-16-infected-staffers-no-contact-tracing-at-ludhiana-mc-s-offices/story-cRgx63neXDnNlbCIlzDiAJ.html
12-08-2020||City||45 hot spots in Kalyan-Dombivli have zero cases since past 2 weeks: Civic chief||As the average number of Covid-19 cases in Kalyan-Dombivli has witnessed a continuous decline since the start of August, the civic commissioner announced that no new cases were reported in the last 15 days in 45 slum pockets. Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) chief Vijay Suryavanshi said that early detection and strict quarantine has helped curb the spread in these areas. As per the civic body, no new Covid-19 cases were recorded in 10 slums and 33 chawls in the twin cities. “The areas which were once hot spots have had no cases since the last 15 days. This is due to the testing and strict quarantine procedure by the civic body. However, the survey in these areas will continue, to avoid any new cases. Antigen testing based on the Dharavi pattern too, has helped to detect more cases and ensure timely isolation,” said Suryavanshi. KDMC recorded 386 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 26,046. The corporation also recorded 15 new deaths, taking the toll to 554. To date, the civic body has conducted 8,338 antigen tests, and private doctors in the city have helped the KDMC get information on around 4,300 fever cases. Of the 57,828 tests performed to date, 49,490 were reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, and the rest were rapid antigen tests. Daily, the civic body conducts 600-700 antigen tests. On Wednesday, Suryavanshi made RT-PCR tests mandatory for all high-risk contacts of Covid patients, within five days. The civic chief has warned that if high-risk contacts fail to get tested, they will face action under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Areas with no cases: Govindwadi in Kalyan, Bhoi Wada, Saparde Gaon, Parsi Galli, Kranti Nagar Slum, BSUP (Dombivali) Lahuji Nagar, Patra Chawl, Patil Nagar, Atali, Ambivali, Jyoti Nagar in Dombivli, Samata Nagar, Sai Balaji, Sainath Wadi, Gangubai Jadhav Chawl, Tukaram Nagar, Manik Mhatre Chawl in Manjunath Urban Health Center Dombivali, Chickan Ghar Health Centre in Kalyan, Uro Patil Chawl, Sanjeevani Chawl, Laxmi Nagar in Dombivali, Manpada, Sandapgaon, Ghariwali village, Kala Talao in Kalyan, Jetha Compound, Vallipir Road, Pilaji Bagh, Sanglewadi,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/45-hot-spots-in-kalyan-dombivli-have-zero-cases-since-past-2-weeks-civic-chief/story-49dcWIRFva7UOng139ZC0N.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||Ahead of 2nd sero survey at the end of this week, BMC starts sensitisation programmes||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will begin the second round of serological surveillance, or sero survey, by the end of this week. The survey will be conducted in M (West), F (North) and R (North) wards, which are the same wards where the first sero survey was carried out in July. Researchers said the surveying the same wards would allow them to compare data to better understand the spread of Covid-19. Results of the sero survey should be out in September. In a sero survey, a group of individuals undergoes blood tests to detect the presence of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies, which are produced by the body’s immune system upon exposure to a virus. This helps identify individuals who have recovered from infections. In July, the first sero survey was conducted with samples from 6,936 individuals, in three wards, in collaboration with NITI-Aayog and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). “We need comparative data to see the nature of the spread in two phases. This has to be done in the same places, though not on the same individuals,” said Suresh Kakani, assistant commissioner, BMC. For the second survey, which is expected to start by the end of this week, BMC will test 6,200 individuals from slums and non-slum areas in Tilaknagar and Chembur in M (West) ward; Matunga, Sion and Wadala in F-North ward; and Dahisar and Mandapeshwar in R (North) ward. Officials started sensitisation and awareness programmes on antibody testing in these areas from August 10. “It is essential to undertake the survey in the same areas to understand if the pandemic curve has actually flattened or more people are getting undiagnosed. For instance, in the first sero survey, BMC found 57% infection prevalence in slums. So, in the second survey, we have to see if the presence of antibodies has declined or increased in the same crowd. Also, there is a need to include more areas as each ward has its own demographic prevalence,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonary medicine specialist at PD Hinduja Hospital. Last week, principal investigator of the survey and a professor at TIFR, Ullas S Kolthur held an online interaction on the survey with fellow TIFR professor Sandeep Juneja. They said these three wards had been selected due to the high prevalence of Covid-19 cases at the beginning of June. “F (North) and M (West) are neighbouring wards, which are also closer to G (North) ward which covers Dharavi, the biggest slum in Mumbai. As we didn’t want to cover such a big slum area, we decided to take the surrounding two wards to gauge the extent of the spread of infection. Also, we had to take one ward which is in the northern part of Mumbai so we decided to take R (North) where cases were showing a gradual rise [since June],” said Juneja. Dr Behram Pardiwala, internal medicine expert, Wockhardt Hospital, said the scope of the sero survey should be extended to other civic wards. “Experts should focus on a more general population. This will help to provide a better picture of the exposure of the virus demographically,” he said. BMC said it would decide on expanding the sero survey after the conclusion of this second round. “We are already in talks to include more areas but that would be done after the conclusion of the second survey,” said Kakani. As HT had reported earlier, BMC faced a lot of resistance from individuals in non-slum residential areas during the first sero survey. Compared to the original target of 4,000 people from non-slum areas, field workers managed to collect samples from 2,702. This time around, BMC has been conducting door-to-door surveys in the three wards since August 10, to raise awareness about the survey. “We have started with fieldwork where volunteers are conducting workshops and sensitizing people from residential areas about the sero survey and its importance,” said Kakani. Sandhya Nandekar, ward officer of R (North) ward, said, “Slum dwellers are more co-operative than those from residential societies. Those in slums voluntarily come forward whereas the latter hid because from fear of getting quarantined.” HT spoke to field workers involved in collecting blood samples in Matunga who said they were often insulted by residents and housing society members. “There is so much fear among people of getting diagnosed with Covid-19 that they won’t even allow us to go inside. Guards were asked to keep the gates locked. Several housing society members would behave rudely and make us go away,” said one field worker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ahead-of-2nd-sero-survey-at-the-end-of-this-week-bmc-starts-sensitisation-programmes/story-O8B9MiGA6M1uNJqiunbYFL.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||Self-testing identifies only 20% cases: BMC||More than a month after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) liberalised the testing policy, the civic body said that a majority of new cases of Covid-19 remain from close contacts of patients or detections at the testing camps, with 10-20% from among those who get tested on their own. From July 7, BMC had allowed anyone to get tested at private labs without any medical prescription. The city has been reporting around 900-1,200 cases daily for over a month. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “A majority of cases being reported daily is not from those getting tested on their own. Around 10-20% daily cases come from people who get tested on their own. The rest are from our efforts. This includes testing high- and low-risk contacts of patients and our camps. It is a good sign. It indicates the situation is under control, considering the daily positivity rate is around 20% for the past few days.” BMC started to screen citizens from Mumbai airport since January 18, and conducted the first test on February 3. The first positive case in Mumbai was reported on March 11. In the past two months, the number of tests has also doubled in the city, partly owing to usage of 1 lakh rapid antigen kits procured by BMC. As of August 10, Mumbai had conducted 6.13 lakh tests. The one-lakh-test mark was crossed on May 6, two lakh on June 1, three lakh on June 24, four lakh on July 14, five lakh on July 29 and six lakh on August 9. Although Mumbai’s testing has increased, it is lower than Delhi that has tested around 12.04 lakh samples until August 10, according to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard. On August 11, Mumbai conducted 9,218 tests, taking the total to 6.22 lakh, with an overall positivity rate of 20.10 per cent. BMC has traced around 20 lakh citizens in the past five months, of which 3 lakh are low-risk and 7 lakh are high-risk contacts. The civic body has also screened around 1.79 crore citizens, including 7.83 lakh senior citizens. Kakani said, “We are also starting the second phase of sero-surveillance survey from Thursday. The sero-survey will be conducted in the same areas of Dahisar, Borivli, Matunga, Dadar and Wadala. We will collect 6,500 samples. The results in the second phase will help us ascertain the spread, and will also help us take decisions on lockdown relaxations. However, the third phase will be taken up at a later stage.” In the first phase of sero-survey, BMC had tested around 6,900 samples. Further, the number of recovered patients crossed 1 lakh on Wednesday, with the total reaching 100,068. The recovery rate in Mumbai was 79.1%. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,132 fresh cases and 50 new deaths, taking the city’s tally to 126,356 and toll to 6,944. There were 19,047 active cases in the city and fatality rate was 5.49%, according to the state health department data.Dharavi recorded nine new cases on Wednesday, bringing the case count to 2,643, of which 2,298 have been discharged. Kakani said, “We are contacting all patients who were discharged in the earlier days. This will help us understand the symptoms, and help patients mentally. We will also appeal to the recovered patients to donate plasma, but that is last on our agenda of following up.” Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a private health consultant from Mumbai, said, “It is a good sign that new patients are from those who are being traced by BMC. BMC should also disclose the number of tests conducted by citizens on their own. We need to understand if the number of those testing on their own is substantial, increasing or decreasing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/self-testing-identifies-only-20-cases-bmc/story-ioNCpT7MLwa7UNGTMF8BLN.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||RT-PCR test rates in Maharashtra slashed by ₹300||The state on Wednesday reduced the cost of the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests — considered the gold standard of Covid-19 testing — by Rs300 in each of the three slabs.Now, a test through a private laboratory will cost ₹1,900, ₹2,200 or ₹2,500, depending from where the swab sample was collected.State health minister Rajesh Tope announced the decision, which is the second time the state has reduced the Covid testing rates. Earlier, the test cost was ₹4,500, which was reduced to ₹2,800 for home collection.“A committee was appointed to revise the rates of these tests. Now it has been reduced further by ₹300. Now, the collection of swab at laboratories will cost ₹900, instead of ₹2,200. For swab collection at Covid Care Centres and institutional quarantine centres, the tests will cost ₹2,200, instead of ₹2,500. For swab collection at home, the cost will be ₹ 2,500, instead of ₹2,800,” a statement from the health department said.

The nodal officers will personally monitor it. Earlier too, hospitals were given instructions to ensure that patients are not fleeced,” said Bangar.He said that the civic body has received several complaints of some hospitals charging unreasonable amounts to Covid patients. “A special audit committee led by the additional municipal commissioner has investigated the complaints. Following the investigations, prima facie, 10 private hospitals have been found to be at fault. Hence, I have issued show-cause notices to them,” said the civic chief.He went on to state that the corporation would not tolerate misconduct in any hospital. “If anyone has any complaint, they should approach us and our special audit committee will give its decision within 24 hours,” Bangar said, adding, “We shall continue to take strict action against those violating the norms and causing hardship to patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nmmc-sends-notice-to-10-hospitals-for-inflated-bills/story-Qp7jeGPs6fTJIbjNiKKv7O.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees 12,712 new Covid cases; Mumbai crosses 1L recoveries||Maharashtra on Wednesday saw its second-highest single-day jump in the number of Covid-19 cases with 12,712 new infections, taking the state’s tally to 548,313. The state now has 147,513 active cases. The state also recorded 344 fatalities, pushing its toll to 18,650. Mumbai, meanwhile, recorded 1,132 new infections, taking the city’s tally to 126,356. Mumbai also recorded 50 new fatalities, pushing the toll to 6,943, while also crossing the 1 lakh mark in recoveries on Wednesday. Now, the city has 19,047 active cases.Of the fatalities reported in the state, 238 were from the past 48 hours and 66 were from last week. The remaining 40 deaths were from the period before last week, according to the state health department. Even as the case fatality rate (CFR) is gradually reducing, the absolute number of deaths reported daily is on the higher side. In August so far, the state has reported 3,676 fatalities. Sanjay Kumar, chief secretary, said that the state government is striving to bring it down and results will show in a few weeks. The top bureaucrat said the CFR of Maharashtra will be under 2% within a month. The CFR of the state stood at 3.4%, as on August 12. “One will have to have patience. All efforts are being taken, but results will appear after some time. If you see, the death rate has come down from the past three months. It will come down further with better infrastructure created, better management. Our goal is to bring it below 1%. Within a month or so, we will reach [between] 1.5% and 2% [CFR],” he said.In the past two months, Maharashtra has witnessed a shift in the pattern of the spread of the coronavirus disease from largely being concentrated to urban areas, to semi-urban centres and rural parts of Maharashtra. Since the outbreak in March, the spread of Covid-19 was largely limited to Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune rural, and parts of Nashik district. There were sporadic cases in other parts of the state, but it had not shot up.The data provided by the state Medical Education and Drugs department showed a significant rise in the number of active cases between June and August. On June 12, active cases from centres other than Mumbai, MMR and Pune district contributed only 14.13%, while on August 12, the active cases in rest of Maharashtra have shot up to 46.58% of the total active cases in the state.On June 12, Mumbai, MMR and Pune district had 41,188 active cases, while the active caseload from rest of the state was 6,780. On July 12, the active caseload from rest of Maharashtra shot to 24,081 cases, while Mumbai, MMR and Pune district had 75,121 active cases. As per the data, the rest of the state, as on August 12, had 69,204 active cases, while Mumbai, MMR and Pune district have 79,349 active cases.Kumar said, “Naturally once the restrictions are lifted, there is movement in urban and rural areas. Increase in cases was bound to happen, but we have things under control.” A senior state government bureaucrat added, “Expecting the rise in cases, the government did not open up activities in one go. There was a calibrated approach in relaxing curbs. The rise in cases seen today is due to increased movement of people from one part of the state to another.

12-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC allows 16-year-old rape survivor to terminate pregnancy||The Delhi High Court on August 10 allowed a rape victim, a minor, to terminate her 22-week pregnancy, following the report of a medical board set up by Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital.The court clarified that the order is subject to reports of further blood tests, required to assess if there is any additional risk to the girl.According to Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, terminating a pregnancy is not permitted if the gestation period is more than 20 weeks. An amendment to the act, in the form of a bill, was introduced in Lok Sabha on March 2, 2020, to increase the gestation period to 24 weeks. However, it has not been passed by the House yet.Justice Vibhu Bakhru said that the pregnancy would be terminated only if there is no added risk. Earlier, the court had directed the medical superintendent of RML Hospital to constitute a medical board to examine the girl and report whether terminating the pregnancy would involve a risk to her.“This court considers it apposite to allow the present petition and direct that the petitioner (girl) be admitted to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the necessary procedures be carried out for termination of the pregnancy,” justice Bakhru said.The court passed the order while hearing a plea by the 16-year-old rape survivor. The girl approached the high court seeking direction to the Delhi government and a hospital to terminate her pregnancy.During the video conference hearing, the judge interacted with the girl and her father and noted that the minor was under considerable distress and her father was insistent that the pregnancy be terminated as well. The court said the risks of terminating the pregnancy have been explained to the girl and her father.The doctors, who had joined the virtual hearing, had told the court that the girl was in considerable distress and the clinical psychologist had also reported that carrying the foetus to term would result in psychological complications.“In view of the report and psychological assessment of the petitioner (girl), it does appear that she is at considerable risk of psychological complications if the pregnancy is continued. The doctors concerned have explained that there may be some risks in terminating the pregnancy but they are not higher than what is acceptable and expected at this stage,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-allows-16-year-old-rape-survivor-to-terminate-pregnancy/story-KiciA4X5NT0I72OIiqwevN.html
12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to rope in hotels as Covid care centres||With the city witnessing a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases and hospitals overwhelmed with patients, the UT administration has decided to rope in hotels to double as Covid care centres.As per the Covid contingency plan, the administration will make use of three CITCO hotels — Mountview, Shivalikview and Parkview — besides James Plaza Hotel in Sector 17 and community centres. These facilities will be utilised to house mild to moderately ill patients. Only those community centres not surrounded by residential areas will be pressed into service.The city has 700 active Covid cases and concerns have been raised regarding accommodating critically-ill patients.Stating that there was no shortage of beds, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “We have a bed capacity of 3,000. Not all patients require to be admitted in a hospital, but those who do will not face any issue.”“We are also putting into use GMCH-48 and facilities will be expanded in GMSH-16 as well,” said Parida, adding that the administration had also put in a request for procuring more ventilators with the Union ministry of health.COVID HELPLINE TO BE LAUNCHEDThe UT is all set to launch a helpline to facilitate Covid patients in getting admission in hospitals. “In a couple of days, we will be starting the helpline to resolve any issues related to treatment and availability of beds. Any patient who wants any advice, ambulance, or wants to get admitted and doesn’t know where (s)he will get a bed will be assisted within half an hour,” said Parida.The helpline will be manned by two doctors and other supporting staff of the Chandigarh Housing Board.KHER TWEETS #HELPMYCITYCity MP Kirron Kher in a tweet on Wednesday tagged PMO, home minister Amit Shah, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Bandore, and BJP president JP Nadda, and said, “#HelpMyCity PGI & other hospitals are under immense pressure. If medical facilities are not allowed in various parts of the city there will be fatalities due to #nobeds. I urge the Administration to take necessary action.”Reacting to Kher’s tweet, Congress leader Devinder Singh Babla said, “It is very unfortunate that even during these hard times, the MP is nowhere to be seen. These occasional tweets will do no good for the city. Instead, the MP should at least participate in the war room meetings.”Kher had earlier asked the UT administration to allow new nursing homes to be built on residential plots, but a committee of the advisory council had rejected it last month.Meanwhile, Parida said they will act on the suggestions of the MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-to-rope-in-hotels-as-covid-care-centres/story-L5p4e7KoPfqdQTAyB8FZcP.html

12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Fund starved Chandigarh MC sitting tight on vacant properties, arrear recovery||Trying to rise above its financial crisis, the municipal corporation is planning fresh taxes and user charges on city residents even as its commercial properties worth more than Rs 208 crore are lying vacant and unsold.Besides losing out on this major chunk of revenue, the civic body also has not recovered arrears worth more than Rs 9.2 crore against its over 1,000 properties allotted on freehold, leasehold and monthly rent basis. This, when the corporation is facing a deficit of Rs 16 crore in its budget. Against its total committed liabilities of Rs 597 crore, MC has only ₹581 crore, which comprises projected revenue receipts of just Rs 241 crore, while the remaining funds will come through grants.The figures of revenue loss against MC’s properties form a part of a report submitted by various MC departments to a civic body panel set up to suggest ways to improve its financial condition, which has worsened amid the Covid-19 pandemic. To explore ways to augment its revenues and curtail expenditure, mayor Raj Bala Malik had constituted a committee comprising councillors and MC officials.The panel had further asked MC departments to submit reports detailing their current financial position, steps taken to improve it and recommendations.200 SITES UNSOLDThe MC estate branch in its report states that over 200 commercial properties under its purview are lying vacant. Several attempts to auction these properties had failed to bear fruit. For instance, it tried to sell off 105 booths at Mauli Jagran six times, but failed. Similarly, a 24-acre site for a specialty hospital with a reserve price of Rs 81 crore was offered twice for sale, but found no takers. As many as 51 commercial sites in Sector 17 are also lying vacant as two auctions went in vain.MC officials blame the mess on UT administration’s reluctance to allow sale of these properties on freehold basis. “Freehold properties will find more takers. But the administration is adamant,” said a senior MC official, wishing not to be named.“Besides, several arrear cases are in court. The reports will be studied to find a way out,” the official added.Criticising the incumbent BJP-led MC, Congress councillor and leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla said, “It is a total failure of the municipal corporation. While the civic body keeps burdening the common man with new taxes, it is unable to raise funds through a large pool of its commercial properties.”“Worse, properties are available on freehold all over the city, but the administration is not allowing the same for MC properties. Leasehold properties will not elicit any interest in the market,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fund-starved-chandigarh-mc-sitting-tight-on-vacant-properties-arrear-recovery/story-gvMedppaoapVhu3gAK7IaI.html
12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University chancellor closes inquiry into sexual harassment allegation against former V-C Arun Grover||The inquiry into the allegations of sexual harassment against former Panjab University vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover has been closed by the chancellor on the recommendations of an independent internal committee (IIC).The report of the committee that was headed by Dheera Khandelwal, additional chief secretary, environment, Haryana government, was submitted to the office of Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the chancellor of Panjab University. The chancellor’s office has sent a communication to Grover along with the report of the minutes of the meeting of the committee held on June 16, 2020. Grover said he has been informed that the chancellor has accepted the report.However, PU registrar Karamjeet Singh said the varsity has not received any communication from the chancellor’s office yet.WOMAN PROF FAILED TO APPEARAccording to the report, which has been accessed by HT, all IIC members unanimously recommended to close the inquiry proceedings.“It appears that the complainant did not want to stand to her complaints/allegations, as despite due notices and receipts by her, she has failed to appear before the committee and as the procedure requires there is no jurisdiction to further proceed with the present enquiry into the complaints made by the woman, professor in the Panjab University (sic),” states the report.The committee had given the professor three opportunities to appear before it, but she through multiple representations had questioned its jurisdiction, stating there was no employee-employer relationship between the office of the chancellor and Grover, whose term ended in 2018. Grover was appointed as the V-C in July 2012 and retired in July 2018. The woman professor levelled the allegations against him in 2015, following which the PU committee against sexual harassment (PUCASH) started a probe into the matter.In October 2019, the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) had upheld the varsity’s decision to constitute an IIC to look into the allegations, after the woman professor raised objections against some names in the panel that were approved by the chancellor and approached court in September 2018.GROVER SEEKS ACTIONAfter receiving the communication from the chancellor’s office, Grover on Wednesday wrote to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar, requesting disciplinary action against the woman professor for not cooperating with the inquiry.“Now, it is the responsibility of the university and its senate to take action against the person who has made allegations against me and did not join the inquiry,” he said.Despite several attempts, the women professor was not available for comments.CASE SO FARApril 15, 2015: A woman professor accuses then PU V-C AK Grover of sexual harassment in a complaint to the then chancellor, Hamid AnsariApril 17: A panel gives clean chit to GroverMay 8: The National Commission for Women writes to the UT IGP to submit a report on fresh allegations made by the woman professor in a letter to the panelMarch 20, 2018: PU receives communication from the chancellor’s office, approving an independent internal committee under Haryana IAS officer Navraj Sandhu to probe the caseJuly 11: Chancellor sends a letter to varsity to discuss the complainant’s representation in syndicate and senate meetingsSeptember: Woman professor approaches HC raising objections against constitution of the committeeOctober 2019: HC upholds PU’s decision to constitute an IICJanuary 17, 2020: Chancellor nominates Dheera Khandelwal as new IIC headJune 16: IIC recommends to close down the inquiry proceedings||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-chancellor-closes-inquiry-into-sexual-harassment-allegation-against-former-v-c-arun-grover/story-REpojDy0KiFcP8yGYgxVCP.html

12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Private sector job quota: Haryana governor in a fix over ordinance, politics may influence decision||Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya seems to have been caught in a dilemma over whether or not to promulgate an ordinance to provide 75% quota in private sector jobs for local candidates. The state cabinet had sent the proposed law for promulgation to him three weeks ago. Arya’s predicament stems from conflicting pieces of advice given by state’s top two law officers as well as the political ramifications attached to the issue. The ordinance is designed on the lines of a law enacted by YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh, challenged on the grounds of constitutional validity in the high court. The Haryana governor may well get more time to deal with the matter if the cabinet on August 13 announces dates for convening the monsoon assembly session. In the event of assembly being convened, the state government will have to table a private sector quota bill in the house, get it through and send it to the governor for assent. Dilemma before Arya Under Article 213 of the Constitution, the governor has the powers to promulgate an ordinance or a law when the state assembly is not in session. The dilemma before the Haryana governor is that he has to deal with two divergent pieces of legal advice from the law secretary and the advocate general. While the law secretary has advised that assent of the President should be sought on the proposed legislation, the advocate general’s advice is to the contrary. Political implications in light of Bihar polls “The governor has consulted the advocate general and the law secretary again on the matter. But he is keeping his cards close to his chest,” Raj Bhawan sources said. Political analysts said that political implications of implementing a law, which would put migrants from his home state of Bihar at a disadvantage in terms of employment opportunities in private sector, would also weigh heavy on governor Arya’s mind — who himself is an eight-time Bihar MLA — particularly in view of the Bihar assembly polls later this year. The BJP is a coalition partner in the Janta Dal (U) led government in Bihar. Also, the BJP government at the Centre seems to have reservations on the issue. At least two former central ministers had answered in negative to Parliament questions regarding reservations in private jobs. The governor has three options – to agree with the advice of the advocate general and give his assent for promulgation of the ordinance, thus putting the law into effect; return the proposed law to the cabinet with a message for reconsideration; or reserve it for the President’s consideration. The proposed law if reserved for the consideration of the president would go through time consuming scrutiny of the central ministries before the President takes a call. Article 213 of the Constitution also empowers the governor to promulgate an ordinance after obtaining instructions from the President. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had recently said that governor would take a decision in his wisdom on the proposed law after consulting legal experts. Deputy chief minister and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala, who has spearheaded the private quota move, had on Monday met the governor to persuade him to expedite the official proclamation of the proposed quota law. Why Presidential assent? Officials said that law secretary’s opinion on reserving the proposed law for the consideration of the President is primarily based on two factors. “Section 23 of the proposed law gives it an overriding effect over other laws. Such a broad provision has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the parliament or an existing law and thereby needs presidential assent. Another provision providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana seemingly is also in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before law,” officials said. Advocate general BR Mahajan, however, had said that the proposed Haryana law did not violate any central law. “It also does not come in conflict with Article 14 of the Constitution,” he added. The proposed law Titled Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020, it provides for 75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having salary less than ₹50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms situated in the state. Employers will also have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law also contained a bailout clause for the industry if suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-sector-job-quota-haryana-governor-in-a-fix-over-ordinance-politics-may-influence-decision/story-0DAvrwnEAH0aWiFHaXwLXO.html

We have demanded that the government should waive off the interests to bring some relief to the sector.”“We were not able to sell the stock manufactured for summers due to the lockdown and now, we are also unable to manufacture products for winters due to shortage of labour. No relief has been provided to the sector and many units are on the brink of a shutdown. Due to this, we were forced to move the Supreme Court,” added Dawar.Advocates Ashish Virmani and Himanshu Dhuper said, “The five associations have around 2,000 members and the accumulated value of loans availed by the is around ₹3,500 crore. They pay around ₹23 crore as interest on a monthly basis.

Also read: ‘Nobody talks when farmers die’: Sharad Pawar on Sushant Singh Rajput caseThe MLA’s counsel Birendra Kumar Jha said that the legal notice has been sent to the Raut through email raising objections to the latter’s remarks and seeking a public apology. “Raut has told the media that Rajput’s father had married twice, which was the reason the slain actor was unhappy with his father. This is completely untrue and baseless”, said Jha. “Hence, you are given a chance to express regret or apologise without delay as anyone can commit a mistake,” the notice read. Earlier on Wednesday, Sanjay Raut while talking with media persons said that “if there has been any kind of miss on our part, we will think about it.” He also said, “What I have said so far is based on info I have.” Relatives and friends of Sushant in Patna denied that his father KK Singh had tied the knot again after his mother died in 2002. Her death had affected the actor deeply. The late actor’s last Insatgram post too, was a dedication to his mother.Bablu’s lawyer said that Raut is a senior political leader and should not make personal remarks against anyone without being aware of facts. He said Raut’s comments were baseless and nothing of the sort had happened.“The Shiv Sena leader might be giving the statement under political duress or that he had been misled by someone into doing so,” Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/sushant-singh-rajput-s-lawmaker-cousin-sends-legal-notice-to-sanjay-raut/story-chxFh7wZ0BrLedzwLGOGQM.html

It was reported that during the protest, the MLA and his supporters were not wearing masks and violated social distancing guidelines.“The virus does not differentiate between a leader and a common man. Several supporters had gathered to protest and many among them were not wearing masks. Anyone among them could be an asymptomatic carrier. For their safety and of others, we have asked Bains and his supporters to get themselves tested and submit the reports,” said ACP (Central) Jatinder Chopra.“We are serving them notices in this regard. Further action will be taken if the leader will not respond to the notices,” added Chopra.Sources said that the police could also proceed with cancelling the passports of LIP leader and his supporters. ‘POLICE CAN’T INFRINGE ON MY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS’Reacting sharply, Bains said that those in power are using coronavirus as a tool to quell democratic rights of the people. Leaders across the world are using the virus as a ploy to impose dictatorial rule, he added. “Punjab Police is no different. I have not received any notice. Police cannot impose their authority upon me. They cannot infringe on my fundamental rights and cannot force me to get the Covid-19 test,” said Bains.Bains said that he will hold a fortnightly panchayat against the police at Ludhiana Circuit House wherein residents facing any police atrocities could raise the issue before him and he will take the matter with those in power, pressing the authorities to act and bring justice to the aggrieved.THE TRIGGERThe Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) had staged a protest against Ludhiana police for not taking action against MP Ravneet Singh Bittu whom they accused of thrashing and tossing the turban of LIP leader Sunny Kainth on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-protest-without-masks-ludhiana-police-ask-lip-president-simarjeet-bains-to-submit-covid-report/story-pucACx8m0EXOkj2wLSXhIK.html

This time, a two-year-old girl from Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, who consumed the firm’s Cofset syrup, has developed the same complications.It was found that both cough syrups which were manufactured in September 2019 by Digital Vision Pharma, a Kala Amb based pharma company, were contaminated with Diethylene Glycol (DEG), a compound that leads to kidney failure and neurological toxicity.Even though the firm’s licence stands cancelled, around 2,800 bottles of the batch under question had been sold in the markets of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan from September 2019 to December 2019. The manufacturer has recalled around 100 unsold bottles from Bengaluru and Kolkata.FRESH TRIGGERAfter falling ill, the two-year-old Himachal girl was referred from a private hospital to Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, with the condition of kidney failure. Doctors here found the presence of poisonous compound DEG in one of the cough syrups consumed by her, following which they wrote to the Drug Controller General of India for necessary steps.Dr Bhavneet Bharti, professor at Advanced Pediatric Centre, said the girl’s condition continues to remain critical.Authorities in Himachal said they are trying to recall the product under question so that lives can be saved. “The matter is under investigation. The samples of the drug have been taken and further action will be taken once we receive the reports,” said HP drug controller Navneet Marwah.Digital Vision Pharma managing director Parshottam Goyal said they are open to any investigation and will be waiting for the sample reports taken from the firm.“I am not responsible for any unsealed product being tested at any hospital. All our quality checks were in place. We are waiting for reports of the samples taken from here. Meanwhile, we have stopped the sale of this product and also recalled 86 bottles which were lying unsold,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-firm-recalls-unsold-cough-syrup-bottles-after-toxic-chemical-found-in-drug/story-AdfYDgNLbxtoevEsYgoxGK.html

12-08-2020||Delhi||Four held for garbage collector’s murder in Delhi||Six days after the decomposed body of an unidentified man wrapped in a gunny bag was found in a forested area near Tughlaqabad Fort in south Delhi, the police on Wednesday arrested four men for the murder. Police said the man was bludgeoned to death on August 3 for not returning a push cart belonging to one of the arrested persons.The dead man was identified as Jhinaka (he goes by his first name), a garbage collector. The four arrested men are Ramji, 60, his son Kaushal, 28, Gautam,47, and Bhagirath,45 (all have single names). They too are garbage collectors, police said. On August 6, the Govindpuri police received a call that a man’s body wrapped in a gunny bag was lying near the Tughlaqabad Fort. The police found four names tattooed on the man’s right forearm. A case of murder was registered, deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said.During the probe, the police learnt that the man lived in Tughlaqabad village. Since the gunny bag and a stick attached with it are commonly used by garbage collectors, the police examined many such workers.“We learnt about quarrels Jhinaka used to have with one Gautam from Tughlaqabad village over a push cart. Jhinaka had borrowed a push cart from Gautam but did not return it,” DCP Meena said.The four were interrogated and they admitted to the crime, Meena said.“The four said that on the night of August 3, they beat Jhinaka to death after an argument over the same issue. They wrapped his body in the gunny bag and carried it on their shoulders using the sticks to throw it in a well in the forested area. They panicked on spotting a passerby and dumped the body there,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-held-for-garbage-collector-s-murder-in-delhi/story-EP2383L5INRxRE6RlpSWwO.html
12-08-2020||City||Excise dept imposes Rs 1.1 cr fine on Gurdaspur distillery||Chandigarh The Punjab excise and taxation department has imposed a penalty of Rs 1.1 crore on Adie Broswon Breweries Private Limited for allegedly violating provisions of the excise laws. The order to impose the fine on the distillery at Gurdaspur, which has been part of the high-profile Chadha Group, was issued by state excise commissioner Rajat Agarwal on Tuesday, according to a senior official in the know of the matter. A notice was issued to the distillery for excise law violations on May 23 following an inspection. During the inspection, it was reported that the distillery had manufactured beer and was trying to “evade duty by dispatching it without mandatory holograms and payment of fees and duties”. Before issuing the order, the department gave a hearing to the company representatives who denied any violation, said the official who did not want to be identified. The proceedings have been concluded in about two months. The excise department had carried out a total of 40 inspections at distilleries and bottling plants in May 2020 and noticed irregularities in 11 of these, with liquor bottles without batch numbers and holograms having been seized at several places. The stock checking was carried out after some contractors had raised the issue that liquor from other states was being pushed into Punjab and distilleries here were not supplying alcohol to other states and selling their stock in the state only. The official said notices were issued to these distilleries and bottling plants, but some of them started adopting delaying tactics during the hearing of the cases by expressing their inability to join for physical hearing. However, the department has started holding hearing through video conference and continued the proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/excise-dept-imposes-rs-1-1-cr-fine-on-gurdaspur-distillery/story-akbb4UkhLOh298ube4D0TN.html

It’s one of the sweets that one can have during fasting. There are various kinds of panjiri.I make the one with nariyal gond and dry fruits.”On Janmashtami, the most popular version that’s often prepared in temples and even in some households is dhaniya panjiri. “Panjiri is a traditional north Indian dessert that is made with whole wheat flour, sooji, powdered sugar or boora, ghee and various dry fruits and nuts,” says Gurugram-based home chef Shahla Ahmed, adding, “Generally we add khand or khandsari (which is desi raw sugar) to it. You can also add jaggery powder or white sugar powder or organic unrefined cane sugar. If you do not get desi khand, you can grind the regular sugar and then add it. We usually make this whole wheat panjiri for the kids in the family. There is a variation in this recipe too, where you could use 2:1 proportion of whole wheat flour and sooji (rava) respectively.”   Panjiri It’s a winter staple in most North Indian households but panjiri is also a special Prasad for Krishnaji. It is said that the chappan bhog consisted of dhaniye ki panjiri. This is a simple atte ki panjiri because that is my little Gopika’s favourite. It’s simple recipe to make: In a heavy bottomed wok, add 1 cup whole wheat flour. Slow roast by stirring it till it is fragrant. Add 1/4 cup ghee. Add cardamom and dry fruits of choice. Remove from flame and add powdered mishri (I added 1/3 cup powdered) (or sugar). Mix well. Panjiri is ready.

Chef Sabyasachi Gorai shares a recipe for those keen to try their hands: “Take two tablespoons of ghee, one cup whole wheat flour, one tablespoon semolina, half cup bura or shakkar, two tablespoon almond powder, half a teaspoon cardamom powder. Heat ghee in a heavy bottom pan, add atta, suji and crushed green elaichi (cardamom). Cook these on a slow heat till they turn golden brown in colour. Remove from the heat, and add sugar and almond powder. You can even use coconut powder in place of almond; I used it because I like the nutty taste of almonds more. Cool it down and later fill a small glass jar with a layer of this panjiri, alternating with recipes of saffron rabri, and garnish with fresh fruits and flower petals. I prefer using fresh seasonal cherries around this time.

Umedpur was visiting Sonu’s native village to condole his mother, Ranjit Kaur, who lost both her sons in a span of two years. Umedpur said that the persons involved in the killing were Congress workers who were rattled after the victim’s mother, who is a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) worker, won the elections. SAD spokespersons Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal said that nothing in the name of law exists in the state. On the other hand, Congress leaders in Samrala termed the allegations baseless. Congress MLA from Samrala, Amrik Singh Dhillon said that it was a case of personnel enmity and the killer had no connection with the Congress party. “My sympathies are with the grieving family but even the victim had a tainted past and was facing several criminal charges, including illegal liquor trade,” alleged Dhillon. As per some reports, two days before his death, Sonu had thrashed the son of an affluent landlord in the area. Sources in the Akali Dal said that SAD supremo Sukhbir Singh Badal is expected to visit Khanna on August 14 and likely visit the family in Samrala. Sonu, 38, president of YAD’s Samrala rural unit, was shot dead in Seh village on Tuesday afternoon. He was taking part in a tree plantation drive at a gurdwara when four men stepped out of a Maruti Suzuki Swift car and fired at him from close range and fled. It has been over a day to the incident but the cops are still groping in the dark about the killers. Despite repeated attempts, Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harpreet Singh was not available for comments. Ravinder’s younger brother Gurpreet Singh, alias Gura Seh, was hacked to death 17 months ago following a dispute over torn posters of a rival group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-congress-target-each-other-over-yad-leader-ravinder-sonu-s-killing/story-gjKILmbnZC1geqw20Vbd9I.html
12-08-2020||Pune||Pune gets official sanction for Knowledge Cluster||The city officially received the tag of ‘Pune Knowledge Cluster’ on Wednesday through the office of the principal scientific advisor. The goal of the cluster is to connect organisations with a high-level of expertise in diverse domains of science and technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, in and around Pune. The inter-university centre for astronomy and astrophysics (IUCAA) has been designated to facilitate the project and the funding for the cluster from the advisor’s office will be dealt with by the office of the director of IUCAA. Talking at an online press conference on Wednesday Dr Somak Raychaudhary director of IUCAA who is the nodal head for the cluster said, “In this knowledge cluster, the stakeholders are not just universities and colleges but also the research institutions and industries. These three categories are brought together and often there is not much cross-talk between the three and the idea is we will take up these projects and make a seamless interaction between these three categories of stakeholders. It is a new concept and it is going on for the last year. We are very proud that Pune has been chosen as one of the first places in the country where such an initiative has been started.” The Pune Knowledge Cluster includes universities and colleges, research laboratories, research and development establishments at the national and state level that is situated in Pune, and the leading industries based in Pune. This initial project proposal was coordinated and submitted by professors Ajit Kembhavi former IUCAA director and L S Shashidhara as principal investigators on behalf of the cluster. It is among the first city-wide clusters that have been approved by the office of the scientific advisor. Similar clusters for Hyderabad and Jodhpur were approved at the same time. Talking about how the cluster will work, Kembhavi said, “Initially small-scale projects are to be developed and executed, along with awareness programmes and outreach activities which are relevant for Pune city. Then there will be studying and improvement of the tree cover of Pune, study and modelling of last-mile connectivity by e-transport, pilot study to connect electric vehicles to the grid or at home and viral epidemics, vector dynamics and other healthcare issues. This knowledge cluster will also take up pilot studies leading to projects on a much larger scale to improve the quality of life in the city. Some of these areas are integrated electric multi-modal transport, Pune digital twin and city’s water management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-gets-official-sanction-for-knowledge-cluster/story-7NlDMZ5wiQwApYEsnFGT7K.html

The forum, represented by Ranjeet Raskar, Ganesh Dhore, Bhagwan Bhadale and Sanjay Harpale, have written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, stating their intent to agitate from Independence Day if their demand is not met. The letter stated: “We are fighting for the last 30 years for the improvement of the garbage depot. Even the National Green Tribunal had issued a warning to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The PMC promised to sort out our pollution-related issues, but forget their promise once agitations in the past have been withdrawn.” Bhadale said, “Earlier it was decided that the Uruli Devachi garbage depot would be utilised only for garbage processing, but now garbage from across the city is coming in to the depot. PMC is not doing any processing, but dumping it at the garbage depot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uruli-devachi-phursungi-residents-threaten-agitation-over-garbage-depot/story-FccC1SS0Bqo9eU45Ov9RSP.html
12-08-2020||City||PMC to procure 1 lakh antigen detection kits||PUNE The civic body will procure one lakh rapid antigen detection kits, after its earlier stock of kits, also at one lakh, has been used up. This the second time the civic body is procuring the kits which have ramped up the city’s testing capacity. The one lakh rapid antigen testing kits will cost the civic body Rs 4.59 crore and will be used by ground staff during home-to-home surveys, or at the Covid care centres. Murlidhar Mohol, mayor, said, “ The decision to procure one lakh more kits was taken earlier which got an official confirmation on Tuesday. This will ramp up city’s testing capacity even more which is already testing maximum number of people in the state. We will soon get these kits.”The kits are used only on symptomatic patients who have flu-like symptoms after close contact with a positive patient. However, the ICMR guidelines do caution that the antigen test could give false negatives and need a double confirmation through an RT-PCR test. The standing committee approved the decision to procure more kits during a meeting on Tuesday, at Rs 459 per kit. This is expected to be supplied within 24 hours. The kits are used for any person suffering from heart/lung/kidney ailments, diabetes, blood pressure, or those undergoing chemotherapy. HIV positive, organ recipients, senior citizens or pregnant women who need to be operated in an urgent basis can also use the antigen detection testing kits. The testing kits are also used to test essential service providers who may have been exposed to the virus while performing their daily job. Test of the tests The RT-PCR is the gold standard for detection of the virus with a nasopharyngeal swab sample. The rapid antigen detection test too seeks to find the same. However, the primary difference between the two is the time factor. While RT-PCR detects the antigen produced by the virus in about four-five hours, the rapid antigen kit detects the antigens in less than 30 minutes. The kits are easy to use for ground staff, after a minor training. However, the antigen detection kits are also known to give false negatives and so need to be cross verified using an RT-PCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-to-procure-1-lakh-antigen-detection-kits/story-7JB8r8gSkiFzbEfRMGKRIM.html

The number of patients of this viral infection transmitted by mosquito has risen 70% over the past month, starting July 10. There are now 119 dengue patients in the state, against 70 on July 10. Most dengue cases are being reported from Ferozepur, Bathinda and Hoshiarpur districts.The figures are as per the record of the The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) wing of the health department. Nearly 10,400 cases of dengue and 1,100 of malaria were recorded in the state in 2019. This year, 53 malaria cases have already been reported to date. Experts say testing for dengue is also the key. “A person suffering from dengue also has fever, as is the case in covid-19. The only way to diagnose is to conduct a lot of testing, but the state is ignoring the need of conducting dengue tests amid the covid-19 outbreak. Till August’s initial days, the health department had not started conducting dengue tests in Punjab’s big cities, including Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana. Testing has now started and will gradually pick up pace,” said an epidemiologist, on the condition of anonymity. “To date, only three tests for dengue have been conducted in Amritsar city, of which two were found positive. Dengue tests were started from July 22 and labs are open for public. We have started awareness drives against dengue. Raids are also on destroy dengue larvae,” said Dr Amarjit Singh, Amritsar assistant civil surgeon. Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said, “Dengue testing has started and 85 tests have been conducted to date. Health workers are stretched as they are assigned covid-19 duties, as well as asked to carry out fogging for dengue.”Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, Punjab programme officer for NVBDCP and Dr Avneet Kaur, director, health and family welfare, did not respond to repeated calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-dengue-cases-up-70-over-past-month/story-Ce2txnK3kNeNZ2risvssNO.html

Congratulating Brar for the achievement, Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta said the officer has played a key role in the arrest of gangster Sukhpreet Singh aka Budha and solving Amritsar ex-sarpanch Gurdeep Singh’s murder. Brar had also busted a racket of illegal diversion of 160 firearms from gun houses to terrorists and gangsters, the DGP added. Brar had led the operation in which most wanted gangster Vicky Gounder and Prema Lahoria were killed in an encounter in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar, he said. “Brar was also the pivot of a major police operation which led to the arrest of 23 persons including two gangsters and gun house owners, and recovery of 36 illegally diverted weapons.

In Class-11, she scored 90% and bagged the second position in her school. Always regular with her classes, she was hoping to pass with flying colours this year too. But the pandemic outbreak and the subsequent lockdown seemed to spoil her plans.As schools shut down and switched to virtual classes, Simrandeep suddenly found herself unable to keep up.Having two younger sisters—one in Class 3 and the other in Class 8— and just one phone at home, Simrandeep had to skip some classes to ensure that her siblings could attend theirs. “I don’t have a personal phone. I would use my mother’s phone whenever it was free. As I sometimes had to skip classes when it clashed with my sisters’ classes, I used to take my classmates’ help in completing my notes.”The connectivity issues and additional burden of buying an internet pack every fortnight was another hassle.So when she received a smart phone from Punjab food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Wednesday, as part of the Punjab Smart Connect Scheme, her joy knew no bounds. “I can finally attend my classes without disruption,” said the teen, who dreams of becoming a computer engineer.Like Simrandeep, 16,676 other Class-12 students are set to benefit from the scheme, aimed at bridging the digital gap. As many as 10 students, including Simrandeep, received their phones at the Bachat Bhawan today.Arvind Kumar, another Class-12 student, who received the phone today, said he had not been able to attend any classes since April as he did not own a phone. “I used to take notes from my friends and gave the online assessment exam using my neighbour’s mobile. I’m happy I finally have my own phone,” he said. The elated students were seen clicking selfies with each other after the event. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma and district education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur were also present on the occassion. SOCIAL DISTANCING GOES FOR A TOSSMeanwhile, social distancing went for a toss during the event, with many, even officials, seen flouting the safety norms while handing over the phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/can-finally-attend-classes-say-elated-students-after-receiving-phones-under-punjab-govt-scheme/story-y0meog93Kt7uXwJDyFlgwK.html
12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Bail, parole time of 450 inmates of Chandigarh’s Model Jail extended by 4-7 weeks||Taking into consideration the worsening Covid-19 situation, the parole and interim bail time of over 450 undertrials and convicts who were lodged at Model Jail, Sector 51, Chandigarh, also known as Burail Jail, has been extended from four to seven weeks by the State Legal Services Authority (SLSA).As of March 26, 1,007 prisoners (947 males, 56 females, 4 children) were lodged in the jail, against the sanctioned strength of 1,120. During the pandemic, 47.56% of the undertrials/convicts were released.A meeting in this regard was held on Thursday under the chairmanship of justice Jaswant Singh, judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, and executive chairman, SLSA. The meeting was attended through video-conferencing by Mahavir Singh, member secretary, SLSA, Chandigarh, Ashok Kumar Mann, chief judicial magistrate-cum-secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Chandigarh, IG (prisons) Ombir Singh and others.It was mentioned in the meeting that earlier, the undertrials were released on special interim bail for an initial period of 60 days and thereafter, the special bail period was further extended on May 16 and again on June 20. They were due to return to the jail shortly.“In the prevailing Covid-19 situation, re-admitting those undertrial prisoners back into the jail poses enormous risk and will defeat the whole purpose of releasing them in the first place,” Mann said.Hence, the extension period of the undertrials scheduled to return between August 14 to 31 has been increased by seven weeks.For those undertrial prisoners who were scheduled to return between September 1 to 15, the extension is by five weeks; for those scheduled to return between September 16 to 30, the extension is by four weeks.Similarly, the convicted prisoners who were released on special parole for an initial period of 56 days and thereafter, the special parole period was extended from May 16 to 20, have also been granted extension from four weeks to seven weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bail-parole-time-of-450-inmates-of-chandigarh-s-model-jail-extended-by-4-7-weeks/story-P7JWvyP5xRI5r9EivJMbTP.html

12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Sector-48 resident body to put up 55 signboards to demarcate societies||To make it easier for people to look for apartment societies that form most of Sector 48, the sector’s resident welfare association (RWA) will be installing signages at 55 points in the area making it the first sector in the city to do so.Each signboard cost the RWA around ₹3,500. The project was inaugurated by additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain and local area councillor Davesh Moudgil on Wednesday morning.President of the RWA, JJ Singh, said, “It was difficult for people, especially delivery boys, to look for societies, so we decided to install signages for their convenience.”The RWA had earlier approached the municipal corporation (MC) regarding this in November 2019, but citing a lack of funds, they turned them away. The resident body had also wanted to install signages similar to the ones being used in Sectors 35 and 16, but the Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee of the UT had vetoed their proposal.“Next, we approached UT chief architect Kapil Setia to get drawings made consistent with Corbusier’s image of Chandigarh. Permission was given by MC commissioner Kamal Kishore Yadav and all 55 points where the signages will be installed were checked by officials of the MC to ensure they didn’t block the way,” added Singh.The signages that have reflective tape on them to enable visibility at night will take around three days to install. Apart from the societies, these boards will also demarcate other buildings in the sector including the police station, the open theatre and the e-sampark centre.Lauding the RWA’s initiative, Moudgil said, “This is the first time that an RWA has independently put up signages. I hope this serves as an example for the apex resident welfare bodies of the city to adopt this for other sectors as well.”Moudgil added that he had spoken to the RWAs of Sector 47 C and D as well and was hopeful they would also get similar installations in their areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-sector-48-resident-body-to-put-up-55-signboards-to-demarcate-societies/story-nLxJjuowwFa3eqgDfZkeZL.html

The three members are additional chief secretary (revenue) Viswajeet Khanna; higher education secretary Rahul Bhandari and university vice-chancellor Prof BS Ghuman. According to budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, with expenditure at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit.The commission’s mandate is to thoroughly work upon improving fiscal health of the university, which is presently in doldrums as it has been toiling hard to meet its committed expenditure. “The committee has been formed with approval from the chief minister, following which the department of higher education and languages issued the final notification,” an official said. Bhandari said the main aim of the committee is to come up with measures for overall improvement of the varsity’s financial condition.“It includes optimisation of salary budget, quality of staff and courses of the university, increasing revenues, rationalisation of pay scales and pension benefits for faculty and staff based on the guidelines of Punjab government. We want to institutionalise transparent procurement procedures,” Bhandari said, adding, “The committee will submit its report within one month.”Bhandari said the committee will also review irregular appointments made in the past for teaching and non-teaching staff and suggest action thereon.On the directions of state government, the varsity had appointed retired IAS officer Manjit Singh Narang as honorary advisor to the V-C to help it tide over its acute financial crisis last month. Narang, however, resigned, accusing the V-C of deliberately delaying his joining.For other administrative measures, the committee will suggest reviewing of courses and consequent rationalisation (including redeployment) of faculty within and across departments.

These are traitors and we will subdue them.” Also read: 5 charred to death after private bus catches fire in Karnataka’s ChitradurgaAs many as three people were killed in the police firing and scores other injured including 50 policemen in the violence that erupted on Tuesday night at D J Halli in Pulakeshinagar locality over an alleged social media post on a ‘communally sensitive’ issue posted by the MLA’s relative.The Minister said the law maker’s house was completely damaged and belongings including, sarees and jewels were looted while the rest was set on fire.“It is clear from the intensity of vandalism that the intention was to attack and finish off Srinivasa Murthy. It has to be investigated whether any anti-social elements from within the state and outside were involved,” Ashoka said.Claiming that the violence was planned to terrorise the people of Bengaluru, Ashoka said government will send across a strong message so that no one would ever dare to take law into their hands again.He also said he met the Chief Minister and apprised him of the ground situation.The Minister added that steps would be taken to rein in anti-social elements as vandalism was carried out in a manner that communities were identified to target them.Also read: ‘Miracle that am alive’: Karnataka Congress MLA describes attack, his escape“Whether Popular Front or SDPI is behind it, we will not bother. These people must be arrested. We will hunt them wherever they are holed up,” Ashoka said.Addressing the media after meeting the minister, Murthy said he wanted the government to provide him protection. “We were not at home when nearly 3,000 people with petrol bombs, clubs, came and burnt the vehicles, damaged our house.I need protection from the government after this incident,” a visibly shaken MLA said.He said for the past 25 years he has been living with the Muslim brethren but never faced such a problem. He demanded a CBI or CID inquiry into the matter to bring out the facts.Asked about his relative Naveen, whose alleged social media post sparked violence, Murthy said, “Naveen is not my relative. For the past 10 years we have not been in touch with him.” Meanwhile, BJP leaders questioned the Congress as to why it hesitated to condemn the riots by “minority groups” on the residence of its own MLA.The ruling party leaders in Karnataka projected the incident that led to violence in parts of the city as an attack on a Dalit MLA.“Dead silence by @INCIndia @INCKarnataka even after their Dalit MLA Sri Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy was attacked , house ransacked yesterday in Bengaluru. Total support for RIGHT TO RIOT ...? For them appeasement is the only official party policy,” BJP national General Secretary B L Santosh tweeted.In another tweet, Santosh said, “After 14 hours @INCKarnataka wakes up to blame Naveen (MLAs nephew) for facebook post & Police for delay in taking action . One straight question .. Does your Party support riots like this .? Why Cong hesitates to condemn riots by minority groups ..? #CongSupportsRiots.” Demanding strict action against those involved in the incident, Karnataka Tourism Minister C T Ravi said some people feel that they are above the law. This is the result of seven decades of appeasement politics, he said.Seeking to know if the “Lutyens and liberals” talk about this growing intolerance in a particular community in Bengaluru, BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje said this was nothing but the result of Congress’ appeasement politics.Karandlaje who visited Pulikeshi Nagara assembly constituency in a tweet said, “PFI-SDPI conspired this violence, they targeted only Hindu houses & burnt public properties.I strongly condemn this behaviour of a communal elements & urge @CMofKarnataka to take stringent actions against the culprits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-govt-will-deal-with-rioters-with-iron-hand-says-minister/story-2ShO6N7nkgikoEWsYY3g5L.html

The hospital has placed an advertisement seeking more doctors on daily emoluments of Rs 3,500 for serving in Covid wards. DMCH secretary Prem Gupta said the institution has placed an advertisement to meet the shortage of doctors. He said that it is for the first time that the institute has had to hire doctors on daily basis to meet the requirements. “Our doctors and paramedical staff are hard-pressed. They are working for long hours and some of them have even got infected. Most importantly, they are getting tired and mentally drained. We need more doctors to fill the gap and ease the existing staff,” said Prem Gupta.He further said that they have spared 200 beds and all their 65 ICU beds, including those having ventilator facility, are occupied and there is a huge waiting list of patients. “Right now we need doctors urgently. The number is not specific. The more doctors we get, the better it will be. We get patients not only from Ludhiana but from nearby districts of Malwa and Doaba region as well. Besides Covid-19 patients, there are those suffering from other ailments,” said Gupta. Dr Sandeep Puri, principal of the institute, said, “We are dealing with a pandemic. This means 50 Covid-19 patients are equivalent to 500 patients of dengue. To deal with the situation, we have to strategise accordingly. We need more manpower to tackle the situation. My doctors and staff are already working round-the-clock so we have decided to hire more doctors on Covid duties,” said Dr Puri. The institute had recently urged doctors to come and offer voluntary service but no one turned up.The hospital was recently served a notice by the health department after a 49-year-old Covid-19 patient, who was referred to the civil hospital, died while being shifted from DMCH.Following the incident, additional chief secretary, health, Anurag Aggarwal conducted a meeting with the authorities of city’s private hospitals, asking them to put aside at least 50 ICU beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. DMCH has also increased the number of beds. The hospital has converted Dumra Auditorium into an isolation facility. Besides this, Ram Sharnam, a spiritual centre adjacent to DMCH, has also been converted into a Covid care centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-bed-crunch-dmch-facing-shortage-of-doctors/story-Y7237ejL72a7FhPXCVZ7wL.html

The garden department garnered a revenue of Rs 1.15 crore during the first four months during the previous fiscal year and its revenue was expected to double starting May when lockdown was announced. According to the garden department officials, the losses are pegged around Rs 2 crore wherein all the main city and suburban gardens remained shut due to the strict lockdown announced by the central and state governments.The prominent gardens comprising Rajeev Gandhi animal park, Peshwe park, Katraj lake garden, Sambhaji garden, Seven Wonders garden, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj garden, Aundh rural garden, Pu La Deshpande garden have been the top grossers for the civic body as they attracted huge crowds of elders, children and womenfolk during the summer season and other times. The city gardens generate cash revenue of Rs 1.25 crore during the summer season. In 2020, the civic body was expecting double revenue but the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic dashed their hopes, garden department officials said.PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “We are closely monitoring the Covid- 19 situation in the city and gradually opening places of public importance based on the ground situation like in the case of malls and P1 and P2 parking. Similarly, the situation of gardens is also being assessed and a decision will be taken as per the Covid situation in the city. Health of citizens is far important than opening the gardens at this juncture,” he said.However, on being specifically asked about when the city gardens will actually open, Kumar did not give any deadline for restarting them.Kumar said, earnings from the garden department are also spent on workforce which maintains the gardens.RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar said, “Public gardens will keep citizens healthy and social distancing norms and masks are mandatory. When liquor shops and malls are open then why not gardens? Also the gardens are sustaining losses due to the prolonged locking of gardens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/200-gardens-in-the-city-and-rs-2-crore-loss-stares-pmc/story-Q1S7p6b9zPGgYk4wE4RYuM.html

The Dahi Handi mandals in Pune are well known for their grand celebrations with celebrities, huge prize money and the reward given to the team who breaks the handi for its grand decoration sets. This year all of these things don’t exist and several prominent mandals are going to celebrate the Dahi Handi by donating prize money for the Covid related works. Balasaheb Marne president of Hutatma Babu Genu mandal trust which is one of Pune’s biggest Dahi Handi mandal said, “This year we have cancelled the Dahi Handi celebrations as the Covid pandemic has affected all of us. Every year we give away prize money of Rs 3 to 5 lakh during Dahi Handi, for which we do not take any public contributions (Vargani). This year the mandal is going to donate the same prize money to several government agencies who are fighting against this disease and for a social cause.” The Khajina Vihir Tarun mandal in Sadashiv peth is working on similar lines. Om Kasar, president of the mandal said, “Our mandal every year celebrates the Dahi Handi in grand style with huge decorations and sound system. Teams from Mumbai, Thane, Chiplun, Baramati and Pune come to break the Dahi handi at our mandal and more than Rs 1 lakh prize money is given. This year there is no Dahi Handi celebrations instead we are going to provide meals to sex workers in Budhwar peth and will distribute 5,000 face masks and sanitizers to citizens in Sadashiv peth area.” Another prominent Dahi Handi mandal, the Suvarnyug Tarun mandal has also cancelled the Dahi Handi this year.Prakash Chavan, president of Suvarnayug Tarun mandal said, “As the Covid situation is rising in Pune city and several government agencies are working to fight against it we are going to donate medical equipment to them. An amount of Rs 1.25 lakh will be used to purchase the medical equipment and it will be handed over to the Pune district administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dahi-handi-celebrations-cancelled-mandals-aid-covid-warriors-instead/story-uOj5LXZHciT9rITId2iRoM.html
12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Green tribunal refrains from asking Punjab to run Bathinda power plant with biomass fuel||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has turned down a petition seeking its intervention in asking the Punjab government to consider converting the defunct Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant (GNDPT) in Bathinda into a biomass-fuelled facility. Disposing of the petition filed by GNDTP retired deputy chief engineer Darshan Singh, the principal bench headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, the NGT said: “The Punjab government may act in accordance with the law and if the power plant is to be converted from coal-fired to paddy straw fuelled, all norms should be complied with.” Justice SP Wangdi and an expert, Dr Nagin Nanda, were on the panel that decided the matter through a virtual hearing. The order was published on the NGT’s website on Tuesday. The tribunal’s decision was based on a report submitted by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). WILL SOLVE STUBBLE PROBLEM: PETITIONER In a petition on December 16, 2019, Darshan Singh claimed to have prepared a report for the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) on the possibility of converting Unit-IV of the thermal plant into a paddy straw fuelled unit. The petitioner said switching from coal to crop waste-based fuel will help in providing a solution for the safe disposal of stubble of major kharif crops of Punjab’s Malwa belt. The petitioner contended that PSPCL’s board of directors had put the proposal of converting the thermal power plant into a biomass facility before the Punjab government in November 2018. But the state government did not act on the proposal. He said that the cost of upgrading the defunct plant into a stubble-based facility will be cheaper than building a new biomass unit. Thus, the cost of power generation will be lower in the biomass plant. “Besides bringing down air pollution during winter in Punjab and Delhi, conversion from conventional to paddy stubble-based fuel will add to the income of rice growers in the state,” he said. PROPOSAL AT PRELIMINARY STAGE: PPCB In its report to the NGT after analysing Darshan Singh’s representation, the PPCB said that the proposal to convert GNDTP into a stubble-fired power plant was only at the preliminary stage of consideration by the state government. The PPCB said that it’s up to the PSPCL to comment on the technical and economic viability. However, the PPCB said that if the government finds the proposal viable, it will help in using the paddy residue. “While considering the implementation of the proposal to upgrade GNDTP, the state authorities have to set up an exhaustive mechanism and facilities for time-bound collection, storage and transportation of stubble generated during paddy harvesting to ensure the availability of fuel for the power plant throughout the year,” the report said. The power plant was decommissioned two years ago and the state government has already started the process to dismantle it. The Punjab government is keen to develop a pharmaceutical park on the land of the defunct power plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/green-tribunal-refrains-from-asking-punjab-to-run-bathinda-power-plant-with-biomass-fuel/story-VwQzUPweSSqeWDoCtKzNiI.html
12-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s coaching classes, study circles hit with Covid pandemic||The Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected all sectors of society, but with students gone from the city, the peth areas, home to a number of coaching classes in Pune are facing the heat. In the last 15 years, Pune has emerged as a hotspot for competitive exams and preparations. Students from across the country spend time in Pune for education. Due to Covid-19, 90 per cent of students have returned back to their villages and home towns, which affected an entire eco-system that depend on it. From coaching classes, study circles, paying guest rooms, hostels, small snack centres to food mess have been hit. In this first part of the story we will look at the impact on coaching classes and study circles where students prepared for competitive exams. Before lockdown, these study circles were full and students were on a waiting list at prominent study circles in the city. Similarly, after the completion of 10th and 12th standard, students signed up for coaching classes in preparation for their graduation course or competitive exams, however the pandemic has put this year’s admissions on hold. “This is a big loss to the entire city’s economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the last 5 months. We haven’t received official permission from the state government about starting study circles in the state. As there are a large number of students who come from outside Pune for competitive exam preparations, the city’s economy had flourished in the last few years,” said Ajaiz Shaikh president of the Abhyasika Owners Association Maharashtra Rajya (AOAMR) who also is the owner of a ‘reader’s club’ study circle in Pune. According to Shaikh, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the city largely, including the financial economy of the city that grew by Rs 3,000 crore yearly due to these students. “Students want to come back and study in Pune to prepare for competitive exams. They are in need of privacy and a continuous link to studies which is not available in their own village or towns. They can live here separately, attend coaching classes and study at their study circles,” he added.The situation of competitive exams institutions in Pune has also worsened in the last four months. Jayant Umranikar, former Pune city police commissioner and the director of competitive examination centre in Savitribai Phule Pune University said, “There are several impacts on Pune due to the pandemic, especially on students who come to Pune for MPSC or UPSC studies. Till now there are no clear cut instructions coming from the state government about how they will monitor these exams, students’ return journey or the safety guidelines to coaching classes.” According to Umranikar, due to the lack of proper guidelines hostels cannot be restarted since some of them have been converted into quarantine centres. “This impacts adversely on the financial position of the coaching classes and their hostels if they have it. There is a financial aspect, safety grounds and most importantly students are in a confuse state whether to come back or not. The accommodation of students is a big issue and how do we appeal students to come back and join classes is another one. Some of the coaching classes have started online teaching, but it is very dangerous and students can get into financial frauds by fake coaching classes taking advantage of pandemic,” Umranikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-coaching-classes-study-circles-hit-with-covid-pandemic/story-g56oVSpscY2Pg1czuOfXMK.html

The victim ran outside and immediately contacted her parents, who rushed to the police station to lodge the FIR.The police have invoked IPC Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 354 A (sexual harassment) against the doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/doctor-arrested-for-molesting-patient-in-shirur/story-gLjU7ajQeEsdZGH3YLvlYL.html
12-08-2020||City||Jalandhar OOATs see addicts drop out of treatment after lockdown relaxation||Jalandhar The district has recorded a drop out of drug addicts and a decline in new admissions from its Outpatient Opioid Assisted Treatment (OOAT) centres since the relaxation of the lockdown in May-end. The district is receiving 8-10 new admissions per day in all centres, against over 40 admissions a day, during curfew in the state in April and May.Experts attribute this trend to two causes. The availability of drugs with the addicts or shortage of medicines in de-addiction centres. The district has 10 OOAT centres and a de-addiction centre in the civil hospital that provides treatment and medicines for drug de-addiction to patients. “The availability of drugs might be a reason behind addicts not taking treatment,” said Dr Aman Sood, a psychiatrist at a de-addiction centre. The monthly data also points to the trend. In March, OOAT centres registered 353 new admissions of addicts, in April 1,432, in May 1,097, in June 382 and in July 233 patients for treatment. There is also a decline in registered drug addict patients over the past three months. In July, 3,225 dropped out against total registered 13,663 patients. In June, 2,936 did not come for treatment against total registered 13,420 patients and in May 1,837 people left the treatment, after registration with the health department.Officials admit that shortage of supply of medicine was the prime reason for addicts losing interest in treatment. A drug addict told HT that some of them had jobs and they could not risk their employment by coming frequently to the centre, as it wasted a lot of their time. “Every addict has to visit the OOAT centre every day to take his daily dose. During the lockdown, we used to give 5-7 day medicine to people so they do not have to come every day,” said a senior doctor on the request of anonymity. Dr Sood added that supply was regular, but was replenished weekly. “To cater to all registered 14,000 patients, all OOAT centres manage with available stock.” Dr Sandeep Bhola, de-addiction centre in-charge Kapurthala said, “There has been a decline in new admission and rise in drop-outs over past three months. No new woman patient had registered over these three months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-ooats-see-addicts-drop-out-of-treatment-after-lockdown-relaxation/story-O2jBkitmtH29ugfkGDA2FO.html
12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Shimla’s heart sinks as the Ridge develops fresh cracks||Shimla: The Ridge maidan (ground) in the heart of Shimla has developed fresh cracks and a portion of the ground near Lakkar Bazaar has sunk further after heavy rain this monsoon. The municipal corporation has sought suggestions from experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, to save the Ridge from sliding further though the open space has been vulnerable ever since it was built over a century ago when the British made Shimla their summer capital. The cracks developed at the north end of the Ridge before the monsoon but became prominent after the rains. A portion has begun to cave in, raising concern for the municipal corporation that has so far taken only piecemeal measures such as filling the cracks with concrete. But the temporary fixes have not worked. “We have formulated a project for finding a permanent solution. The project will cost about Rs 60 crore. The corporation has taken fresh suggestions from IIT, Roorkee,” says mayor Satya Kaundal. 2015 RESTORATION PLAN REJECTED The MC had sought the views of experts from the Roorkee institute in 2015, too. A Rs 30-crore restoration project was prepared but the then Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government did not approve the proposal. That year, the corporation conducted a survey which found muck had been dumped in a four to nine metre area when Shimla was being developed during the British Raj. “Through the Rs 30-crore self-finance plan, the MC was going to shift the Tibetan market to the Lift area and develop a park at the marketplace but the then state government did not approve our proposal,” says former mayor Sanjay Chauhan. SHOPKEEPERS WORRIED The water storage tank beneath Ridge happens to be a stone structure that is not sufficiently reinforced. The open space on the Ridge in the past has been used for holding political events such as rallies and other ceremonies. The area around Gaiety Theatre has been sinking for a while now, a phenomenon that damaged over a dozen shops at the Tibetan market in 2010. It also poses a threat to the Town Hall, which had been renovated at a cost of Rs 14 crore under a project funded by the Asian Development Bank a decade ago.Local residents and Tibetan shopkeepers are a worried lot. “The Ridge sinks about nine inches annually. The government needs to find a permanent solution,” says Kalsang, a Tibetan shopkeeper. VAJPAYEE’S STATUE IN PARK The fresh cracks have upset chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s plans of installing the statue of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the Ridge. The government had finalised the spot near Padam Dev Complex, where the statue of former prime minister Indira Gandhi is put up. But now the MC has finalised a spot in a park between the Ridge and Mall Road instead. A HISTORIC MAIDAN *The Ridge maidan or ground was built in 1910 when Shimla was the summer capital of British India. *The Ridge, flanked by a catchment of the Sutlej river basin on one side and the Ganga basin on the other, connects Lakkar Bazaar with Scandal Point on Mall Road. *It houses two heritage buildings, a neo-Tudor style construction that doubles as the Town Hall and an Anglican church dating back to 1857. The religious structure built in neo-Gothic style is one of Shimla’s landmarks. *Cracks have also appeared on a portion of the Ridge overlooking Gaiety Theatre and Town Hall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shimla-s-heart-sinks-as-the-ridge-develops-fresh-cracks/story-p09FHyWVHR68HVfdR4ZLvN.html

12-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: HC seeks police reply on Pinjra Tod member’s bail plea||The Delhi High Court has sought the police response on a plea by a member of Pinjra Tod, a women’s collective, seeking bail in a case related to the communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in February.Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notice to Delhi Police on the plea challenging a trial court’s order which had dismissed the bail application of JNU student Natasha Narwal.“Issue notice. Amit Mahajan, Special PP accepts notice and seeks ten days time to file a status report. Let the same be filed within the said period with a copy to the counsel for the petitioner (Narwal),” the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on August 26.Narwal and another member of the group Devangana Kalita were arrested in the case in May this year by the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder.They have also been booked under the stringent anti-terror law - Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a separate case related to the communal violence, for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.In all, four cases have been registered against Kalita, including in relation to the northeast Delhi riots earlier this year and violence in old Delhi’s Daryaganj area during protests against the CAA in December last year.

12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Rise in suicides underscores need for better mental healthcare in Himachal||Shimla: Himachal Pradesh has seen a rise in the number of suicides this year, particularly during the lockdown since March, which underscores the need for improving the state’s mental health facilities. Though a mental health rehabilitation centre was set up in Shimla in 1997 and a helpline number 104 was launched two years ago, these facilities are woefully inadequate in dealing with the scale of the problem. According to police data, an average of three people commit suicide in the state every day and there are only five government counsellors to address issues related to mental health of a population of 75 lakh. Initially, the helpline that functions 24 hours a day and seven days in a week, was not active but nowadays it gets 120 calls daily. Special secretary, health, Nipun Jindal says, “Mental health problems have increased during the lockdown and there is a plan to set up a helpline in each of the 12 districts.” Issues related to mental health are also being addressed on the e-sanjeevani portal. MOST VICTIMS ARE LABOURERS, HOUSEWIVES The police recorded 466 suicides till July 31 this year with an average of 67 people ending their life every month. Last year, 710 people committed suicide, an average of 59 suicides a month. Of the total suicides this year, 12% (55) were abetted and cases were registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. In the remaining 88% of cases (411), inquest proceedings were initiated under Section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Among the victims, 62% are men and 38% women. Of them, 21% (101 cases) are of labourers; 15% (72) housewives; 8% (38) students; 6% (29) private employees; and 4% (16) each are farmers and businessmen. 13% of the victims took the extreme step due to marital discord (60 cases) and 12% due to domestic disputes (58 cases), while 7% or 33 victims ended their life because of health problems. Ten people committed suicide due to loss of job. Police said that from January to April, the average number of suicides was 10 but it shot up to 25 from May to July. In May, June and July, more than 100 suicides were reported each month. The monthly average from January to April was 41. YOUNGSTERS MOST VULNERABLE People between 18 years and 35 years are most vulnerable to suicides as 111 men and 57 women in the age group ended their lives this year. They comprised students and those in their early married life. Those in the 35-50 year age group were also vulnerable with issues such as a troubled marriage and hectic professional life. Domestic violence, economic distress, failed relationships, unemployment, health, setback in business; drug abuse and alcoholism are factors that drove people to take the extreme step. PRESSURES OF SOCIAL DISTANCING “Social distancing measures, though vital to stop the spread of Covid-19, leads to isolation from loved ones. People are at greater risk of anxiety, depression and loneliness. It could lead to fear, panic, regret, guilt, a sense of loss or despair. Such emotions can lead to suicidal thoughts,” says Dinesh Dutt, the head of the psychiatry department at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla. Health experts say that not only the government but people at large can also play a vital role in improving the mental health scenario. “Social media has a responsible role to play. A suicidal act is unwarranted and undesirable,” says Dr Sanjay Pathak, the senior medical superintendent at the Himachal Hospital of Mental Health and Rehabilitation, Shimla. “Drinking, smoking and drugs are escape routes that complicate matters. Face the problem and seek help of a therapist. Meditation, yoga and music help improve mental health,” he adds.

The police also requested the invitees to follow Covid-related guidelines issued by the Home Ministry and the Health Ministry at all times during the Independence Day celebration at the Red Fort. “In the event of any invitee experiencing/having a history of any symptoms of Covid-19 within two weeks (running up to) of the Independence Day, which is yet untested or confirmed positive for the disease, the invitee may consider refraining to attend the event,” the police said in a statement.They said there will be markings at the entry gate at adequate distance and controlling officers and ushers will be on duty to assist invitees for seating inside the designated enclosures.They said that on conclusion of the function, the invitees should avoid crowding at the exit, and wait for the controlling officers to guide them. According to a senior police officer, there will be around 4,000 security personnel at the Red Fort on the occasion and they will stand maintaining social distance. No cameras, binoculars, remote-controlled car keys, umbrella, handbags, briefcases, transistors, cigarette lighters, tiffin boxes, water bottles, lunch boxes etc. will be permitted, they said. The full-dress rehearsal for the Independence Day will take place at the Red Fort on Thursday. Defence personnel from the Army, Navy and the Air Force will march across the Mughal-era structure.Earlier the police had said a multi-layer security ring, including NSG snipers, elite SWAT commandos and kite catchers, will be placed around the Red Fort, from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on the 74th Independence Day. Over 350 Delhi Police personnel, who will be part of the guard of honour at Red Fort on Independence Day, have been quarantined as a precautionary measure, they had said.These personnel of the force of all ranks -- from a constable to Deputy Commissioner of Police -- have been quarantined at a newly built police colony in Delhi Cantonment. Flying of sub-conventional aerial platforms like para-gliders, para-motors, hang gliders, UAVs, micro light aircraft, remotely piloted aircraft, hot air balloons, small size powered aircraft, quadcopters or para-jumping from aircraft etc. are prohibited over the jurisdiction of National Capital Territory of Delhi up to August 15, police had said.  The guest list likely to be pruned and children wearing clothes resembling the Tricolour will be missing this year. However, there will be no change in the security arrangements and they will be as stringent as they are every year. The police personnel involved in frisking would also don personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, the police had said. The Independence Day event witnesses attendance of ministers, senior political leaders, top officials of different ministries and diplomats. Even the general public is allowed to attend.This time, however, there was also a proposal to not allow the general public at the event and instead have 1,500 corona warriors, including 500 police personnel who have recovered from the infection, attend it. The event at the Red Fort shall consist of a guard of honour by the armed forces and the Delhi Police to the prime minister, unfurling of the national flag and firing of the 21-gun salute, address by the PM, singing of the national anthem immediately after the speech and release of tricoloured balloons at the end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-advises-invitees-not-to-attend-i-day-event-if-they-have-covid-symptoms/story-g3HpaqTV8Q2LQLa74ULbbP.html

12-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A gentleman lost in love||It’s evening. He’s lying sprawled along a grassy slope, against a background of yellow flowers. The sky is pitch blue. The air is breezy. His head is resting against his hand. He is in a light pink T-shirt. The strap of a pale blue mask is dangling out from his pants’ pocket like a piece of fashion accessory. His face is bare. He seems lost in thoughts.He must be in love.“I’m in love,” admits Muhammed Gulzar. It’s Sunday evening and the supplier of beauty parlour products (“makeup stuff such as lipstick, nail polish, mask, creams, shampoo...”) is lounging in this central Delhi park to console his heart—he uses the Hindi word tasalli. He lives nearby, in a rented room in Sarai Kale Khan.Mr Gulzar is in his mid-20s and is missing a woman called Rubeena. “I feel alone without her.” He stays silent for a while, as if preparing to open his mouth to speak a profound revelation about his life, but seems to be struggling with some dilemma. Finally, he says—“She is my wife.”He says he is also missing his son, Sufiyan. Both mother and son are away at the home of Mr Gulzar’s parents, in Madhubani.Isn’t that district in Bihar famous for its art, with people painting their own house-walls with beautiful drawings? Mr Gulzar nods. Is his house similarly decked? He shakes his head, looking amused.Intently watching at a cloud drifting over the setting sun, the brooding man gives a brief biography of his relationship with Rubeena: “We had a love marriage. I have been married to her for five years but I had known her for two years prior to that.”Rubeena’s mother used to run a small “canteen” for labourers in Nabi Karim, near the New Delhi railway station. This is where he first spotted his future wife. “She would stand beside her Ammi, speaking nothing, doing nothing... she would stay there like a statue.”Drawn by the enigma of her “chuppi (silence)”, Mr Gulzar started to daily patronise the canteen and soon the ice broke between the two.“We started to go to the zoo together, where we would spend a lot of time.”Unlike in popular love stories or romantic movies, there was no protest from the couple’s respective families.“We have always been staying together as a husband and wife, but some weeks before the lockdown, my parents suggested that she should come over to Madhubani for a few days, so that they could be with their grandchild.”Mr Gulzar escorted her and the child to Bihar and rushed back to Delhi, intending to bring them back in two weeks.And then the coronavirus arrived, the lockdown happened, and Mr Gulzar continues to be without the woman he loves.“And today I was missing her very much. So I came over to this park.”It’s been some time since the lockdown has been lifted but the lonely man is hesitating to get back his family, waiting for the pandemic to recede.He now takes out his mobile phone and scrolls through the photo album—most of the images have different poses of him flexing his muscles—until reaching the portrait of a woman in a pink dupatta with a smiling young boy in white kurta pajama—“my wife and my son.”Mr Gulzar now brings the phone close to his face, closes his eyes and kisses the screen.Not long after, it is time for the park to close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwala-a-gentleman-lost-in-love/story-sRLMPzNwmButYNC46n5s0I.html

A Press Information Bureau (PIB) release issued on Tuesday states that passenger trains along with local trains will continue to remain suspended till further notice.“Regular passenger and suburban train services will continue to remain suspended until further notice. It may be noted that 230 special trains, which are running at present, will continue to operate.

Additional special trains may be run based on the requirement,” mentions the release. The Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) operated more than 3,000 local train services daily on the suburban railway route before the lockdown was imposed. Currently, CR and WR run a total of 700 daily services only for essential service providers. Passengers have started demanding the resumption of train services, citing expensive commute by other modes of transport. A delegation of railway passenger associations met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Tuesday afternoon, demanding resumption of local train services for the general public in the city.“Nobody is thinking of the general passengers who need to travel by local trains. Some people want to travel by station trains but hey cannot reach the boarding stations as they are also not being allowed to travel by local trains. We met the Governor and raised our concerns. It is not justified.” said Madhu Kotian, president, Mumbai Rail Pravasi Sangh. The passenger association has also suggested the introduction of staggered office timings. “We have suggested that different shift timings should be introduced for companies. Train services should halt at Kalwa, Diva, Airoli and Ghansoli railway stations for emergency workers. QR-based code passes for emergency workers is not required,” added Kotian.The association stated that the Governor assured them he would address their concerns. “However, we will protest on the platforms of railway stations if the demands of general passengers are not met,” said Kotian.Meanwhile, passengers have stated that they have to spend extra money to travel to their workplace due to the suspension of train services. “I pay ₹250 daily for a journey that earlier cost me less than ₹10 by local train. Companies are slowly opening up, but why are the train services suspended till now? The government should implement a protocol for travel,” said Aarti Singh, a Vidyavihar resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/local-train-services-to-remain-suspended-in-mumbai-rly-ministry/story-Xv9QnlgiwHupyiHLqIEF7L.html

Thackeray said that though the state has been successful in bringing down cases in Mumbai’s Dharavi and Worli, the battle against the coronavirus is not over yet. The CM added that the state is working towards reducing the case fatality rate (CFR) in Maharashtra, which stands at 3.44%.Modi held a meeting with chief ministers of Maharashtra Gujarat, West Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh via video conferencing, to review measures taken to tackle Covid-19. A statement from the Maharashtra government said that Modi said that if the 10 states, which have 80% of cases in the country, win against Covid-19, then the country would emerge victorious.“Efforts are being taken to bring down the mortality rate. At the same time, there has been praise over controlling the situation in Dharavi and Worli. But the battle is not over yet. The government is working to see to it that there is no second wave in Maharashtra,” a statement quoting Thackeray said. He added that the Maharashtra government has not hidden any fatalities or confirmed cases, and the state has been “transparent” in providing all data.The state, according to the CM, has 3.5 lakh beds ready with oxygen supply, ventilators and other equipment, but there is a shortage of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers.The CM pointed out that several people who have recovered from Covid-19 have contracted other illnesses, and were forced to get institutional treatment after they tested negative.

There is a need to set up a mechanism to treat such individuals,” the statement added.

He expressed the need to research how and why different types of viruses originate.During the meeting, Thackeray reiterated the demand to cancel final-year examinations for non-professional courses, to ensure that the lives of students are not endangered. Thackeray called for a decision on the issue at the national level. He made a strong pitch to declare students as passed by giving them aggregate marks.

However, three families from Rajouri had filed a missing report about three youths and even identified the pictures of the men who were killed in the encounter in July.All the mainstream political parties have demanded a high-level probe into the encounter. On Tuesday, the police said that DNA sampling will be carried out. “Rajouri police has been approached by some families yesterday claiming that their kin who had gone to Shopian for some work are missing since July 17. They lodged a missing report at Peeru police station on August 10. Meanwhile, some reports on social media claim that the militants killed in the Shopian encounter on July 18 are their relatives,” a police spokesperson said.He said that police had provided sufficient time for the identification of bodies at Kashmir police control room in Srinagar. “The bodies could not be identified and they were buried in the presence of magistrate after conducting a post-mortem examination and taking the DNA samples. Taking cognizance of the claim by the families and media reports, Shopian police will carry out DNA sampling to match it with the family of missing youths. Besides identification, the police will also investigate all other aspects as per the law in due course of time,” the spokesperson added.The spokesperson said that the army has also initiated an investigation into the matter.Lone alleges fake encounterSRINAGAR: Peoples Conference chairman, Sajjad Lone on Tuesday castigated security forces for the alleged fake encounter in Shopian and deplored the silence of people of the country.Lone who was recently released from the house arrest tweeted about three missing youths from Rajouri and said nothing has been uttered on the fake encounter in the country. Leaders of mainstream political parties have demanded a probe into the circumstances under which three youths of Rajouri were killed in the Shopian district of south Kashmir in July and dubbed as militants.‘’The encounter in Shopian is yet again an ugly reminder of fake nature of claims made by security forces. This is the result of a culture of impunity. The tolerance for such incidents in the rest of the country is scary. Not a word has been uttered,’’ Sajjad Lone said in a tweet.On Sunday, the family of three labourers from Rajouri district, who remain missing since July 17, lodged a missing report with the Rajouri police. Three youth Imtiyaz Ahmad, 21, of Dhar Sakri in Koteranka, Abrar Ahmad Khan, 18, of Dhar Sakri and Abrar Ahamd, 26, of Tarkassi Tehsil Koteranka in Rajouri had reached Shopian via the Mughal Road on July 2 and have gone missing since July 17.

12-08-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA planning an inter-state bus terminal at Mumbai’s Wadala area||A long-pending project, aiming to curb illegal parking and traffic congestion in the city, is finally taking shape. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning to develop an inter-state bus terminal (ISBT) at Wadala’s Anik bus depot. The 16-hectare plot will also include a Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) depot, a Metro stabling yard and a commercial hub. The authority already invited bids for preparing a conceptual plan, a techno-feasibility study and an implementation plan for the project. Though a large number of public and private buses ply in the city, there is no dedicated bus terminal for buses to operate from. Passengers are picked-up or dropped at various locations, or sometimes off the road, causing inconvenience to them as well as creating congestion on roads and hurdles in the movement of traffic. According to MMRDA, the proposed land parcel will include bus platforms, operators’ offices, parking facility for buses, waiting facilities for passengers and allied facilities, bus crew facilities, pick-up and drop off points, food courts, communications centre, fuel station, bus repair and maintenance facilities, transport interchange and integration facilities as well as commercial and entertainment facilities. A senior official from MMRDA said that the terminal will also alleviate traffic congestion, as there is currently no dedicated facility for parking buses, and will improve travel conditions for passengers. Wadala is being looked at as a major transport hub, as it is already connected via the Eastern Freeway and the Mumbai Monorail. It will further be strengthened with the under-construction Metro-4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarwadavali) corridor. Recently, MMRDA also approved plans for developing a school and hospital at Wadala, which the authority is looking to develop as the central business district like Bandra-Kurla Complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-planning-an-inter-state-bus-terminal-at-mumbai-s-wadala-area/story-9we9VCNORMaiq84rp10RdM.html
12-08-2020||Mumbai||University of Mumbai’s second merit list: Marginal dip in cut-offs for undergraduate courses||The announcement of the second merit list for undergraduate courses (UG) by the University of Mumbai (MU) on Tuesday brought little relief to students, as the cut-offs for most top colleges witnessed only a marginal dip from the previous list on August 6.Bachelor of arts (BA) aspirants were in for a shock as the cut-offs in top colleges for the course barely dipped by 1-2 percentage points, with St Xavier’s College, one of the most prominent institutes for the course, having no seat left for aspirants in the general category in the second list. On Tuesday, the college only released the second merit list for aspirants who applied under the Christian minority quota. In the first merit list, St Xavier’s College had closed its list for the BA course at 92% for state board students and 98.6% for students from other boards.At KC College, the merit list for the BA course saw a dip of less than 1 percentage point from the first list, while the cut-off list for Jai Hind College’s witnessed a drop by less than 2 percentage point. At Ramnarain Ruia College, the second list for BA saw a 1.1 percentage point decline in the cut-off from the first list, with only nine seats left to be allotted under the general category.For the Bachelors of Commerce (BCom) course, cut-offs in the second merit list declined around 2-5 percentage points across top colleges.Among the unaided courses, the demand for Bachelors in Mass Media (BMM) and Bachelors in Management Studies (BMS) courses remained high, with most top colleges witnessing only 1-3 percentage points difference in the cut-off. “As we have an in-house quota, most of the seats are confirmed. So there are very few seats left for the general category. BMM (English) is a popular course and the seats for it get filled up soon,” said Anushree Lokur, principal, Ruia college.Principals are still hopeful over the availability of seats in top colleges in the third merit list. “Usually, the same student applies to more than one college, and with every list that is announced, many withdraw admissions to seek re-admission to another college of their choice. There will still be seats left for the third merit list and students need not be disheartened,” said Parag Thakkar, principal of HR College.The cut-offs for other unaided courses such as Bachelors of Accounting and Finance (BAF), Bachelors of Banking Insurance (BBI) and Bachelors of Financial Markets (BFM), too, remained high in the second list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-s-second-merit-list-marginal-dip-in-cut-offs-for-undergraduate-courses/story-nJEp4N9TMjk3kDM9zhIWiO.html
12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Youth icons of Kashmir are harbingers of hope||Kashmir has been under lockdown for a year now, initially due to the restrictions after J&K’s special status was revoked on August 5, 2019, and then due to the coronavirus pandemic since March. Yet, amid the gloom, youngsters from Kashmir offer a silver lining on how to march on with courage and a positive mindset. They not only dodged the restrictions but also overcame physical challenges to emerge winners in these troubled times. On International Youth Day today, HT’s Ashiq Hussain profiles seven such youth icons. CHAMP IN HER OWN RIGHT Captain of J&K wheelchair basketball team Inshah Bashir, 26: Inshah is a pioneer of women wheelchair basketball in Kashmir. Within two years, she has built a team and captains J&K’s national wheelchair basketball team. An accident in 2009 damaged her spine. She was in Class 11 and since then, she can’t walk or even stand with double plates in her back. She had no idea of wheelchair basketball when she went to a rehabilitation centre for the physically challenged in Srinagar in 2017. “I saw boys playing on wheelchairs at the centre and decided to join in. It was challenging, a girl playing among the boys but they welcomed me,” she says. There has been no looking back since. She played at the district level, state level but when she reached the national level, she found there was no J&K team. She joined the Rest of India team for players from different states with no state-level team at the national level. In 2018, she became Delhi team captain and in 2019 represented India in the US during a sports tour. On her return, she chose to promote the sport in her home state. “The US tour changed my life. Despite being comfortably placed, I decided to resign from the Delhi team and work on building the J&K team,” she says. When Article 370 was revoked in 2019, the J&K team was in its infancy and Inshah got injured during practice in Mohali. “Medics suggested I stop but if I quit, the team would have been disheartened as we had no substitute player. They would never have been able to overcome the blow. I played despite my injuries and the J&K team moved ahead,” she says with pride. Playing that match did aggravate her injuries but she says she has no regrets. “I wanted to be a doctor but destiny led me here. I am ready for any challenge,” says the brave youngster from central Kashmir’s Budgam, who is doing MA in social work from Jamia Millia Islamia university in Delhi. SPORTS CHANGED HER LIFE Passion for basketball to pre-Olympics Ishrat Akhtar, 23: A resident of north Kashmir’s Baramulla, Ishrat was the first Kashmiri woman wheelchair basketball player who was selected to play the pre-Olympics wheelchair basketball qualifiers in Thailand from November 26 to December 8, 2019. This transformation happened three years after a fall from the second storey of her house that left her with spinal cord injuries. She was crippled and depressed. “Suddenly, I was wheelchair-bound. It was torturous. Slowly, I came to terms with reality and understood something needs to be done. It’s then that I came across basketball players at a rehab centre in Srinagar in 2017,” she recalls. After a few national tours, Akhtar says she would have missed the opportunity to play the pre-Olympic qualifiers at the international level as she was stuck in Kashmir incommunicado after the revocation of Article 370 last year. “One day, there was a knock on the door and it was the army’s 52 Rashtriya Rifles and local police who had come searching for my house to inform me about my selection. Our coach in Chennai had approached his friend in the army to locate me,” she says. She was reluctant to travel amid the restrictions but finally decided to go ahead. “I left for Chennai the next day and was selected for the international tour to Thailand. Unfortunately, we could not qualify for the Olympics but this is only the beginning,” she says. CRICKET IS TAKING HIM PLACES No challenge too big for this fast bowler Amir Hussain Rather, 20: This left arm fast bowler, who was a part of the Indian cricket team to win the inaugural World Cup for physically challenged in August 2019 in England, played all five matches and took eight wickets. Rather, who belongs to north Kashmir’s Sopore, was only four months old when four fingers of his right hand had to be amputated after he suffered burns. Despite the disability, he grew up playing cricket in his village. In 2017, he played for the Under-19 team and was selected for J&K’s physically challenged team that toured Himachal in which he was declared the best bowler for taking 15 wickets in six matches. In 2018, he was selected for the India-A physically challenged team. A year on, came the selection for the India team. “My coach is so proud that he says I can take on players with no disability,” he says. Even during the Covid-19 lockdown, he has been taking part in local tournaments such as the Janwara Premier League in July 2020. His fielding has won him accolades, too. “I was awarded for the best catch of the tournament. I ran more than 90 metres and made a six-foot jump to catch the ball with my left hand,” he says. CRICKET GAVE HIM IDENTITY, FREEDOM No substitute for hard work, focus Waseem Iqbal, 27: The opening batsman of India’s physically challenged team was among the top three scorers at the inaugural world cup that India won in England in August 2019. He was the highest individual scorer with 89 runs and was adjudged man of the match in the semi-final against Pakistan. Trained as an electrical engineer from a polytechnic in Srinagar in 2012, Waseem says, “Cricket has given me an identity, freedom and exposure.” Waseem fractured his right leg in an accident when he was nine. Multiple medical procedures resulted left him with no ability to bend the leg. Yet, he played cricket and got a call in 2019 for trials before he joined the India team. “There is no substitute for hard work whether it’s for a so-called ‘abled’ or ‘disabled’ person. There are many distractions for youngsters in Kashmir. They should stay engaged constructively. If you work hard, nobody is going to stop you from success,” he adds. DREAMS DO COME TRUE Civil services was her calling, and she made it Nadia Beig, 23: She is the first woman from north Kashmir’s Kupwara and one of the youngest in J&K to have qualified the Union Public Service Commission exam 2019, the results of which were announced recently. She cracked the exam in her second attempt and achieved an all-India rank of 350. “It has been a daunting journey. In 2018, I could not qualify even the prelims,” she said. She did her schooling in Kupwara and went to Jamia Millia Islamia to complete economics honours in 2017. Joining the civil services was her dream since she was in Class 12. “Nothing is impossible. If you focus on a goal and work hard, you will achieve it. Yes, there were sacrifices to be made. I’m grateful for the prayers of all my well-wishers,” she adds. BUSINESS WITH VISION HER STRENGTH Woman entrepreneur with a difference Mufti Sadia, 29: She owns a fashion showroom in Srinagar which she started when she was 22. Today, she employs 12 people, including young women, who have made 20,000 masks and hundreds of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits during the Covid-19 pandemic. “In March, when everything shut down, I was concerned about the livelihood of my workers. I noticed there was a shortage of masks and the ones available in the market were of poor quality. So we started making masks on no profit basis. Within days, we started making cotton, three-layered, surgical, and non-woven masks besides PPEs,” she says. Opening a fashion showroom in a place where parents are obsessed with government jobs was challenging. “I had no business background. My father is in the police and my three sisters in government service. But I can’t work under somebody. I wanted to be independent,” she says. A math graduate, she did masters in international business before starting her venture in 2014. “I wanted to give a western touch to ethnic wear in Kashmir. Many discouraged me and I was the only woman entrepreneur to open the outlet in a mall. Many would say, she’s just a youngster, what competition can she give,” she recalls. Gradually, she built her clientele in Kashmir, across the country and abroad. “I’m thinking of going ahead with my plan of opening another outlet. I like to do something different and look forward to providing customised products for people who have a good idea of fashion in Kashmir.” SETBACKS MAKE US STRONGER Srinagar’s woman gym trainer is a winner Mehreen Amin, 25: A resident of Srinagar’s Old City, Mehreen opened a gym training centre in 2016 when she was only 21. Despite the stone pelting, restrictions and lockdown, she can boast of training 1,500 women. Becoming a gym trainer was accidental for her. It started when her own health deteriorated and she started gaining weight after she went to Delhi to live with her brother in 2012. On her brother’s advice, she joined a women’s gym and lost 20 kg in six months. “This motivated me to take my instructor’s advice and become a trainer myself. After a year’s training, I got a certificate and returned home,” she said. Back home, she started gaining weight again and on her father’s insistence decided to join a gym but she couldn’t find a proper facility for women in Srinagar. It was then that she decided to start her own gym. Her father thought she was too young for the venture but she persisted. “Finally, he agreed and gave me money which he had saved since my childhood for my wedding,” she says. “When I went to look for the space, people would say that I should bring along an elder to negotiate the rent. These things did not deter me and I succeeded.” Within three months, the gym started getting regular members and doctors started recommending her centre. She has received a citation from the government. Covid may be a temporary setback but Mehreen knows we shall emerge stronger. “Had I not started this venture, I would have been dependent on others. Today, my parents and my husband are proud of me,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/youth-icons-of-kashmir-are-harbingers-of-hope/story-wDTsVQniuqq52gmKYcI11H.html

Nandita Singh, PU’s dean international students, said, “We were not expecting the number to go up this year due to the pandemic.” “PU already has a good number of foreign students and they play a key role in motivating other students to take admission here. Most of the foreign students have sought admission in management courses followed by humanities and sciences in PU and its affiliated colleges in Chandigarh,” she said. Nalini Singhal, regional director, ICCR, said, “Our admissions process starts in December and these applications were received by us till March this year. PU alone gets the majority of the foreign students in this region and remains one of the preferred universities by foreign students.” PU professor Rajat Sandhir said, “Increase in the number of international students sponsored by ICCR to twice as compared to last year is a positive sign and would certainly improve PU’s score in various rankings.” Under the ICCR scholarship programme, the Government of India awards scholarships to foreign students from about 140 countries annually.

12-08-2020||Gurugram||Two buffalo traders from Ghasera beaten up, police deny link to earlier ‘beef’ attack||Two buffalo traders from Ghasera village in Nuh were assaulted with sticks by at least two men after being called to Begumpur Khatola area under Badshahpur police station’s jurisdiction on Tuesday on the pretext of selling them a buffalo. One of the victims suffered serious injuries on his head, chest and legs and is undergoing treatment at civil hospital. The victims, identified as Nasir, 30 and his younger brother, Mursalim, have alleged that the suspects accused them of ‘framing members of their community in false cases’, by making a reference to an incident on July 31, before assaulting them. On July31, a 25-year-old driver, Lukman from Ghasera village, was beaten up with rods and a hammer by a group of people on the suspicion that he was transporting beef. In Tuesday’s incident, the family of the victim have alleged that the police had not taken their statement and registered an FIR on their own. Police, however, denied any connection of Tuesday’s attack with the July 31 incident, adding that they registered the FIR on the statement of one of the victims and have arrested the two men. According to the FIR, the victims, Nasir and Mursalim, who sell and purchase buffaloes, came to Begumpur Khatola on Tuesday on a motorcycle after one Adesh told them over the phone that he wants to sell a buffalo to them. “When we reached, Adesh and his accomplice Dilbag, told us that the buffalo had already been sold. I told them they called us so far for no reason. At this point, Dilbag hurled abuses at me and when I protested, he hit me with a stick, which he had in his hand. When Mursalim intervened and tried to save me, Adesh slapped and punched him. Dilbag hit me with a stick on my head, legs and waist and then he also attacked my brother. As we started shouting for help, Dilbag threatened to kill us if we ever set foot in their village and then they left,” said Nasir, according to the FIR. The victims’ kin alleged that the suspects had targeted Nasir and Mursalim as they were angry about the July 31 incident, in which six people have been arrested by the police. “The suspects had planned this completely. The accused told my nephews, ‘Tum ghasera ke ho, hamara khaate ho, hum par hi ulte case karte ho’ (You are from Ghasera. You trade with us, then file cases against us). Police did not record any statement and registered an FIR on their own. The police did not read the charges mentioned in the FIR to the victims. They just took the victim’s signature for conducting medical examination. The suspects stole Rs 1 lakh from them too. Nasir’s head has been cut open and he is severely injured,” said Sallam, uncle of victims. Mursalim, who suffered minor injuries, later told reporters, “The men took us into a forested area and beat us with a stick and a hockey stick. They had been calling us for the past three days on the pretext of selling a buffalo. They mentioned the July 31 case which was reported from our village.” Police, however, insisted that the incident in Begumpur Khatola had no connection with the earlier case. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “The victims had come to purchase a buffalo from the two suspects. After they were told that the buffalo had been sold, there was an argument which escalated and the victims were beaten up. The incident was reported to the police and on the statement of the victims, the FIR was registered and the two suspects immediately arrested. The contents of the FIR do not mention anything about the July 31 incident. The allegations that the FIR was recorded under duress are incorrect. The incident happened 800 metres from the village and only two suspects were present. Linking the incident to any earlier case is an attempt to disturb harmony.” The ACP added that the victims had conducted business with the suspects several times in the past. “They were not dealing with them for the first time.”A case has been registered against the suspects under various sections of the IPC at Badshahpur police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-buffalo-traders-from-ghasera-beaten-up-police-deny-link-to-earlier-beef-attack/story-UhZYbKBRmZWoSIKJPvlgmL.html
12-08-2020||City||Fake job scam: Chief agricultural officer demands investigation||A fake job scam has surfaced in the state agriculture department, where youngsters were duped on the pretext of securing them a job in the agriculture department. Chief agriculture officer Narinder Singh Benipal wrote to commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and deputy commissioner (DC)Varinder Sharma highlighting the matter and demanded a thorough probe. CAO Narinder Singh Benipal said the matter came to light when a youngster approached the agriculture development officer in Hoshiarpur saying he was employed at the agriculture department in Ludhiana and furnished an employment letter, in which the youngster was asked to report to the office of the chief agriculture officer between August 10 to August 16. The letter reads Jaswant Singh of Mukerian town of Hoshiarpur has been appointed senior member of technical staff and was assured an in-hand salary of ₹22,000. “The agriculture department has not made any such recruitment so far,” said Benipal. He said, “Even the department’s name ‘cooperation and farmer welfare agriculture department’ is wrong as no such department exists. So far, we have come across three persons who have been duped. We have brought the matter to the notice of authorities to get the issue investigated so the culprit is sent behind the bars soon,” said Benipal. The swindlers also conducted a written examination and arranged their medical tests. “We suspected youngsters from other parts of the state were also duped,” said Benipal. Earlier in June, the department of agriculture came under fire after the owner of Brar seed store on Ferozepur Road in Ludhiana was caught selling fake seeds issued by PAU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-job-scam-chief-agricultural-officer-demands-investigation/story-0HbSlncBaeZdtm1egD5IIL.html
12-08-2020||City||‘Increased testing, targeted sampling in Large Outbreak Areas helped contain Covid’||IGurugram once among the worst-affected Covid-19 district in the state and country has been reporting less than 100 new cases daily and the fatality rate is almost 1.27%. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, tells Archana Mishra how increased testing, improved contact tracing and hospitalization of high-risks patients helped in tackling the Covid-19 situation in the district. Despite being in the Unlock phase, during which all economic activities resumed, Gurugram is seeing a decline in the number of active cases. What are the reasons behind the declining numbers?Gurugram’s test positivity rate (as on Tuesday) is 7.23%, which till two months ago was high as 18.04%. At that time only 18,000 Covid-19 tests were done. In two months, we have done almost one lakh tests — both rapid antigen detection and frontline Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Every day on an average, 2,000 tests are conducted in the city. Targeted sampling in Large Outbreak Areas (LORs) and extended containment zones for weeks till the infectivity rate of any particular area goes down to less than 5% helped in reducing the overall active numbers. We have done 89,117 tests per million population, which is the highest in the state. There has been an improvement in the contact tracing, which is now almost 90%. Experts say that the overall test positivity rate is declining as antigen tests detect false negatives. It has to be later confirmed through RT-PCR tests. The department is taking a well-balanced approach in conducting antigen and RT-PCR tests. More than 56,000 antigen tests have been done and over 70,000 RT-PCR tests. Out of the total tests conducted in a day, we are doing almost 800-1,000 RT-PCR and almost similar number of antigen tests. The test positivity rate of antigen tests is at present almost 3%, while it varies from 7% to 9% in RT-PCR. The teams are doing RT-PCR test of patients who are tested negative for the antigen but are symptomatic. Through antigen tests, more than 2000 positive cases have been traced and it has been beneficial in increasing acceptability of Covid-19 testing among citizens. How many antigen kits have been donated by the corporate companies till now? More than 15,000 have been donated till now, all of which have already been utilised. Is Gurugram getting affected by neighbouring districts where Covid-19 districts are increasing?No one district can be blamed as we are in the unlocking phase. Yes, infected people from other districts are coming to Gurugram.Data shows that in Gurugram there are not too many critical patients. The fatality rate has been stagnant for almost a week now. What steps are being taken by the department to control the fatality?Knowing that a large number of active cases are home isolated, we have been distributing Hindi booklet on do’s and dont’s to them. Every second and third day, a text message or Whatsapp call is being made to patient to check on them. Based on the response, a patient is immediately shifted to a hospital, in case his health deteriorates. Also, we are not allowing any high-risk patient to be home isolated. Therefore, ambulance calls for transferring the patient from home isolation to hospital is almost negligible.Where is Gurugram currently placed in the Central government’s plan of considering Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) as one unit?Every month we have a meeting with Niti Aayog members on the matter. Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad are working on a similar strategy to tackle Covid-19. It is for this reason that we are seeing a decline in cases in Delhi and Gurugram simultaneously. After Delhi set up a plasma bank, districts falling under NCR too had set up their own banks. Be it the availability of drugs, setting up testing or treatment, Delhi-NCR are on similar lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/increased-testing-targeted-sampling-in-large-outbreak-areas-helped-contain-covid/story-ED8HnCTVQ4v7XLHNZfKqKM.html

12-08-2020||Gurugram||Places of worship to reopen in Gurugram from August 12||The district administration on Tuesday issued an order allowing places of worship to reopen their doors to devotees from August 12, on the occasion of Janmashthami. A detailed 26-point standard operating protocol has also been drafted, to which all worshipers and operators of religious places are expected to adhere.While places of religious worship in other parts of the state had been allowed to reopen on July 19, while observing a strict set of guidelines, Gurugram was one of two districts where places of worship remained shut on account of surging Covid-19 cases. However, with a perceptible decline in number of new cases and deaths , Tuesday’s order was “passed ex-parte in view of the emergent situation.”The order mandates that all places of religious worship will dispense sanitiser to devotees before allowing them into the premises.Where ever possible, devotees have been instructed to wash their hands and feet before entering. Thermal scanning of visitors is a must, with only asymptomatic people being granted entry. The order also recommends “staggering of visitors, if possible”.The need for social distancing is emphasised multiple times in the order, which calls for “proper crowd management” and maintaining a distance of six feet while waiting in queues. The instructions also disallow touching of idols, scriptures and statues, and devotees have been advised to avoid physical contact while greeting each other. Operators have been asked, wherever possible, to designate separate entry and exit points for visitors, Distribution of physical offering, such as prasad or holy water, have been disallowed .The order also mandates wearing of masks, and visitors and operators have been instructed to ensure proper and safe disposal of any masks found within the premises. In case a person on premises is suspected to have Covid-19, or is confirmed to have Covid-19, operators have been instructed to isolate the individual until they are seen by a doctor, and to provide them with a face mask. A rapid response team will be deployed to look into the matter and take further actions to manage further possible spread of the virus. If a Covid-19 positive patient is confirmed to have been on the premises, the order calls for immediate disinfection of the place.A spokesperson of the Sheetla Mata Mandir managing committee, which reports to the Shree Mata Sheetla Devi Shrine Board on matters of day to day administration, said, “We are expecting a good amount of visitors on Wednesday, but have made adequate preparations. Designated queue areas have been created with markings to let people know where to wait. We have also engaged people for crowd management, and spoken to eateries and sweet shops in the area, informing them to take necessary precautions as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/places-of-worship-to-reopen-in-gurugram-from-august-12/story-I5oSwuLOUBHMbHCr4DffCO.html
12-08-2020||Gurugram||Illegal call center busted in DLF Phase 2, two held||Days after an illegal call center was busted in Gurugram’s Sohna Road, the city police on Monday night busted on operating from a residence in DLF Phase 2 that allegedly duped people, especially those in English-speaking countries like the US, under the garb of providing technical support. Two of the owners were arrested from the spot, said police. According to the police, they had received a tip regarding the call centre operating from a house in Block N. A patrolling party of four policemen took a round of the area. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said, “We took experts with us and raided the house. At least 12 young people were found making calls and trying to convince people to buy their technical support products.” The team told the employees to continue taking inbound calls and videographed more than 50 calls to establish the fraud, said police. Goel said they questioned all the 12 employees who allegedly revealed that they had duped hundreds of US citizens in the last six months. “They used to send an email to their IDs with fake pop-up error messages stating that a malware had infected their computer systems and if not rectified immediately, their personal and financial data would be compromised. Their modus operandi was similar to the one busted by the chief minister’s flying squad . The pop-up messages would be displayed on full screen mode and would lock the user’s browser,” said Goel. The firm did not have any permits to operate from a residence. Police said the pop-ups would repeatedly show up on a user’s computer screen with warnings such as ‘malicious malware detected’, ‘personal information is not safe’, ‘your computer has been locked’. “The victims would panic and contact at the helpline number that comes with the pop-up message to resolve the issue. Instead, they would end up being duped by them on the pretext of getting technical support,” he said. The commissioner of police, KK Rao, said the calls were answered by people who claimed to be technical experts of ‘Best Buy’ chain of stores. “The employees revealed that they would ask the victims to install a bogus paid application for a fee ranging between $100 to $3000. They took the fee in form of gift cards from iTunes or Amazon only. They never shared any bank account for any online transactions,” he said. The gift cards were routed to bank accounts in India through European countries. The bogus application, meanwhile, would also serve as a bug and allow the company to access the victims’ computers. This had the potential for data theft and identity theft. The data police recovered from the company had details of nearly 100,000 users, including their email IDs, credit and debit card numbers, and their CVV numbers. “We are verifying all the details and have assigned the task to the cyber crime unit to start sending emails to the victims, starting Wednesday,” Rao said. A case was registered under section 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and section 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) and 75 (committing offence outside India using computer network) of IT Act 2008 at Cyber police station. Police recovered three servers, ₹1.45 lakh in cash, and the script the employees were to follow while speaking to their victims. The suspects were identified as Amit Dhanda of Jind and Saurabh Chaudhary of Hoogly in West Bengal. Both of them have worked together in a private company which provided IT solutions before starting the firm. “They had started their operations in March but due to lockdown they could not operate from a residential site and reopened last month,” said Goel. Police said that despite so many arrest and crackdown on fake call centre, people are still operating by illegal means. “The employees working for these illegal establishments are also equally responsible and we will start taking strict action against them,” said Rao.The chief minister’s flying squad on Saturday had busted the illegal call centre that allegedly had over 35,000 victims and raked in millions under the garb of providing technical service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/illegal-call-center-busted-in-dlf-phase-2-two-held/story-2mFTkIZnq2n8eyexGVHaYJ.html

12-08-2020||Gurugram||Health department may reduce reserved beds for Covid patients||The district health department may look to bring down the amount of reserved beds in various private hospitals to 10-20% — from the present 25% — if active Covid-19 cases continue to decline in Gurugram. Even isolation beds in different hotels and guest houses can be brought down to 1,000 from the present 3,500 officials believe. Senior health officials said that the final decision will be taken only after consultation with the district administration and the state government.“The decision will be taken by the state only after the number of active cases in the city are less than 500,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Currently, there are 659 active cases in city, with 69 new cases reported on Tuesday. Out of these, 554 are under home isolation, 29 in Covid care centres and 76 in various hospitals. Till now, 9,840 people have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 126 have succumbed to it. Since the daily growth rate of cases is almost 0.58% and the recovery rate is 92%, most of the reserved beds in hospitals remain unutilized. “Several private hospitals of the city have approached us to lower the number of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. They have put forward a proposal to reduce the reserved beds to 10-20% from the existing 25%. Other government hospital like ESIC, where mildly symptomatic patients are admitted, might continue their isolation ward along with a minimum of 10 beds for Covid-19 patients,” said Yadav. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “We will take a decision regarding this after discussing with Gurugram administration.”No one from the district administration was available for a comment, despite repeated attempts by HT.The district administration in May had ordered all private hospitals of the city to reserve 25% of their bed capacity for Covid-19 patients. There are 40 hospitals with dedicated beds for Covid patients, including two government facilities, ESIC Hospital (58 beds) and Polyclinic (22 beds) in sector 31. At least 50 beds have been reserved in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS),Jhajjar, as well. Out of the total 4,708 hospital beds available in 40 hospitals, 1,486 are Covid-19 designated beds. This includes 192 Intensive Care Units (ICU) beds and 92 beds with ventilators. It also incudes 120-bed Medeor Hospital in Manesar which was designated by the district administration as a Covid-19 facility for critical patients.Yadav said, “There are no plans to reduce the number of beds in Medeor Hospital. But if needed, the hospital can have a dedicated Covid-19 floor with separate entry and exit.” Over the last month, the bed occupancy has dipped consistently due to overall decline in the positivity rate, according to the hospitalisation data. On June 30, at least 417 Covid-19 patients — all Gurugram residents — were admitted in government and private hospitals. By July 7, it had come down to 197, and further to 175, on July 14, and 148 on July 21. By July 31, the bed occupancy dipped to 77, further falling to 64 on August 6.Even at Covid Care Centres, which are mostly hotels and guest houses that have at least 3,481 beds reserved, the number of beds can be reduced to 1,000, according to CMO Yadav. It includes 943 beds in 24 hotels which are government paid isolation facilities and 2,538 beds in self-paid isolation facilities. Yadav clarified that the department will continue to work with a cautious approach despite slow daily growth rate and high recovery rate of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-may-reduce-reserved-beds-for-covid-patients/story-eeHTGVNC4350iCHuRz3VUJ.html

According to the advisory, people should avoid wearing gold and diamond ornaments, including chains and earrings. It also asks people to keep doors latched owing to the recent string of thefts in the city, and to have phone numbers of neighbours, police control room and beat cops handy.RL Goyal, president of the Sector 19B RWA, said: “After the recent snatching in the sector, women have started going for walks in small groups of four or five for their safety.”SK Khosla, general secretary of the RWA in Sector 40C, where a woman’s mobile phone was snatched on August 8, said, “Roads in the sector are dimly lit and police need to be more stringent with patrolling or such crimes will keep happening.”Claiming that cops carry out special drives to check snatchings throughout the year, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Charanjit Singh Virk said: “In evening, all beat cops patrol their respective areas.

Aimed at boosting business in Noida, officials said the city will attract an investment of ₹21.98 crore from private firms which bought the plots.“We conducted a lucky draw in the presence of at least 10% of the total applicants who applied for the scheme. The lucky draw was recorded on camera and also streamed live on social media page of the authority in order to maintain the transparency in the allotments. We offered a total of 22 plots out of which 21 were allotted. The remaining one plot will be allotted on August 20,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The authority said the firms, which have been allotted these plots, will create around 560 jobs in the city.The authority had received a total of 1, 371 applications for the plots ranging between 0-250 square metres in area. The authority had floated the scheme to sell these plots earlier this year in January, and investors were asked to submit their applications by Feruary-end.This scheme was floated to sell the left over plots which could not be allotted in the past.The authority’s industrial department has also been told to conduct a survey in all the old sectors to identify unsold plots under a new scheme. “The authority will come up with a new scheme of allotting plots, once we will identify an adequate number,” said MaheshwariThe Uttar Pradesh government has directed top officials across the state on encouraging entrepreneurs to invest in the state.

12-08-2020||Delhi||More than 700 have been administered plasma therapy for Covid-19 in Delhi||More than 700 Covid-19 patients in the national capital have been administered convalescent plasma therapy plasma therapy one-and-a-half months since the country’s first plasma bank was set up at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Science at Vasant Kunj. Two other dedicated Covid-19 hospitals — Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur — that had set up banks will now also provide convalescent plasma to those admitted in other hospitals, starting Wednesday. Either the patients or the hospital will have to provide a replacement donor or an undertaking of providing one at the earliest. Convalescent plasma therapy uses the blood component plasma that has virus-fighting antibodies from a patient who has recovered from Covid-19 to a person still fighting the infection to aid their immune system. According to data provided by the Delhi government, 710 units of convalescent plasma have been issued to patients from other hospitals so far — 388 to patients over the age of 60 and 322 to patient below that age. The youngest to have received plasma from the government bank was 18-years-old and the oldest was 94-years-old. The gender-wise breakup of the data shows that among the recipients 522 were males and 188 female. Several studies have shown that men are at a higher risk of dying of Covid-19 because of higher levels of ACE-2 receptors that the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease, uses to enter cells. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said plasma therapy plays an important role in reducing the death rate among Covid-19 patients until a vaccine is available. He said it has shown encouraging results in recovery of critically ill patients and should be looked at as an effective treatment for Covid-19. An interim analysis of the clinical outcomes of 30 Covid-19 patients at the All India Institute of Medical Science found that the number of deaths remained the same among those who received convalescent plasma and those who didn’t. A large study of 20,000 patients spearheaded by the Mayo clinic in the United States found the therapy to be safe, it did not establish efficacy of the therapy. A study from China in April showed that there was improvement in clinical parameters such as oxygen saturation in patient who received the therapy, but the scientists noted that larger studies were needed to prove the effectiveness of the therapy. “However, none of the studies so far have shown mortality benefit of this therapy, or any other therapy for that matter. However, we have seen that it reduces the severity and the recovery time for the infection,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-than-700-have-been-administered-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19-in-delhi/story-KYquCOdK1YxpzRu2C0OmPL.html

12-08-2020||Chandigarh||Entry ticket to gardens: Chandigarh MC’s solution to fund crunch||With the Chandigarh municipal corporation struggling with severe financial crunch, residents might soon end up paying to enter gardens, profession tax and registration fee on property transactions.This is as per an internal MC report comprising recommendations made by different departments for improving its financial position.The MC has been struggling with its finances for several years, and the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the situation.For instance, while the budget receipt target for the medical officer of health (MOH)’s office for the 2020-2021 fiscal was ₹21 crore, in the wake of the pandemic, it has been revised to ₹7 crore. Similarly, for the booking branch, earnings from booking of community centres was estimated to be ₹10 crore, which have been revised to ₹6.43 crore. OUTSOURCING GARDEN MAINTENANCEIn its recommendation, the MC horticulture department, states: “Putting an entry ticket to garden/green belts ranging from ₹10 to ₹20 will increase the revenue. The MC can also issue paid passes to morning/evening walkers.”It has suggested imposing user charges on Rose Garden, Sector 16; Fragrance Garden, Sector 36; Shivalik Garden, Manimajra; Japanese Garden, Sector 31; and Valley of Animals, Sector 49.There is also a proposal for imposing a fee of ₹25 per 100 sq ft on erecting hedges on road berms adjoining residential areas.The department has also recommended outsourcing maintenance of gardens and green belts. “In lieu, interested agencies can display their advertisement board at entry of gardens,” states its report.Meanwhile, the MC estate department has recommended tax on professions, trades, calling and employments, fee for property registration at the UT estate office in addition to the stamp duty and hike in fees for its various services.The booking branch has suggested increasing water tanker charges from ₹350 to ₹500. The MOH has suggested NOC fees and monthly charges from hotels, businesses and markets as per Swachh Bharat Mission.ADVERTISEMENT ON ROTARIESThe advertisement department has recommended an increase in unipoles for outdoor advertisements. It has suggested: “Identification of some prime locations for digital and static screens in Sector 17 and connected passages and e-auction them for display advertisements.” Rotaries should be transferred to the advertisement department so that it can raise revenue from these through display advertisements, it has been suggested.The transport department, which spends around ₹13 crore annually on fuel and maintenance of around 500 vehicles, has recommended maintenance of vehicles from open market rather than agencies; reducing monthly fuel quotas by 20% and withdrawing cars from certain officials. It also suggests that instead of buying new cars, vehicles should be hired as and when needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/entry-ticket-to-gardens-chandigarh-mc-s-solution-to-fund-crunch/story-vxWdSBFGi4Q01xhj8u2bBJ.html
12-08-2020||City||Family vandalise Vashi hospital after man’s death||Family members of a 48-year-old vegetable trader in Ghansoli vandalised Fortis- Hiranandani Hospital in Vashi after he died at the hospital. The family claims that the hospital staff had denied him admission due to non-availability of beds, early on Tuesday morning.Dr Trupti Rathod, medical superintendent of Fortis-Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi said, “The patient was brought in to the emergency room at 2.40am. The medical team immediately attended to him. While the assessment was underway, his family members enquired about hospitalisation and it was communicated to them that all critical care beds were full. Before we could assist the family with the next steps, the patient collapsed. This occurred within three minutes of the patient’s arrival in the emergency room.” Rathod further said, “Lifesaving procedures were initiated immediately, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was administered, but the patient could not be revived. The patient’s family reacted aggressively to the news of the loss of their family member. They even vandalised the hospital and physically assaulted the hospital staff, causing grave injury.” Vashi police are in the process of registering a case against the family for rioting and vandalising property. At 2.30am, Suresh Chavan was rushed to Hiranandani Hospital by family members and a neighbour after he complained of chest pain.“The doctor said there are no beds available and asked us to take him to a different hospital. After an hour-long wait, the staff agreed to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG). However, soon another doctor said that he cannot be admitted as there were no beds and even stopped the ECG process. We left from the hospital around 4.30am, but the patient collapsed at the gate,” said Akshay Karad, 24, Chavan’s neighbour.The doctors finally attended to him, Karad said. “Almost an hour went by and the doctors did not give us any health updates. When my father went in forcefully, he saw that Chavan had passed away,” he said. Chavan’s family members then vandalised the hospital and broke its glass panes. No one was injured during the incident, said a police officer. Shubham Chavan, the deceased’s son, said, “My father was not Covid positive. We brought him here as this is a reputed hospital, but he was denied treatment. Everything that unfolded is on the CCTV cameras.”Mahesh Srirao, an assistant inspector at Vashi police said, “We are in the process of registering a case against the family members for damaging hospital property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-vandalise-vashi-hospital-after-man-s-death/story-OK8lxBEdmxhkSYBuJne3KM.html
12-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s revised power tariffs likely to be announced by month-end||The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) is going to revise power tariffs in the city by the end of this month, officials in the power regulator said on Tuesday. However, for the first time no public hearing would be conducted for the process, prompting criticism from resident’s welfare associations who said they would appellate authority. The power regulator, which is an independent and quasi-judicial body, will also not hold a press conference to announce the revised tariffs, officials said. “This year’s tariff announcement is expected any time now. At present, the two other members of the commission are going through the document. The new tariff structure will be uploaded on our website derc.gov.in “Due to Covid-19, no press conference, as has been the tradition for more than a decade, will be held this year. The tariff document will be sent to all media houses via email,” said SS Chauhan, chairperson DERC. Various RWAs criticised the DERC for completely doing away with the practice of conducting a public hearing, with some even saying that they would file a petition in the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity against the move. “Instead of not holding the hearing at all, the commission could have held a video conference over a couple of days. The DERC is holding a public hearing for other cases through video conference, but it did not do so in this case. Once the tariffs are announced, we will register a complaint because after seeking comments through post or email, holding a public hearing is mandatory under the Electricity Act,” said Saurabh Gandhi, secretary of United Residents of Delhi, an umbrella body of RWAs which is active in matters related to power in Delhi. Responding to the criticism, the DERC said to compensate for the public hearing, the commission this time extended the deadline for seeking comments, suggestions and objections from all stakeholders by over three months. “This is an exceptional time. Due to the pandemic, no large gathering of more than 50 people is allowed. We extended the last date of seeking written suggestions and objections from March 20 to June 30,” said a senior DERC official. As keeping power tariffs low has been a key poll promise of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, electricity charges have not been hiked in the capital in the past four years. Senior government officials said an increase in tariff is highly unlikely. Throughout the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, RWAs have demanded a waiver in the fixed charges that are levied on every electricity bill based on the sanctioned load of a household. “We have written to the commission as well requesting the same. RTI replies have shown that fixed charges are being collected by various discoms, on a total sanctioned load of 22,876 MW in Delhi. At the same time, the highest ever peak load till date in the Capital has been only 7,409 MW which is not even one-third of the total sanctioned load and that peak occurs for a few minutes only in the entire season,” said BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWAs joint front. Owing to the pandemic and the lockdown that followed, the three private power distribution companies this year have demanded over Rs 2,277 crore more than last year’s aggregate revenue requirement (ARR). Aggregate Revenue Requirement means the revenue required to meet the cost pertaining to the licensed business for a financial year, which would be permitted to be recovered through tariff and charges by the commission. According to the petitions of discoms shared by the power regulator, all three utilities – BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL), BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) – together have stated an aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) of Rs 23,857.37 crore. They had sought Rs 21,580 crore last year. The BRPL has given an ARR of Rs 10,353 crore against last year’s Rs 9424 crore, TPDDL has demanded Rs 8510.37 crore (last year Rs 7,126 crore) and BYPL Rs 4994 crore (Rs 5,030 crore last year).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-revised-power-tariffs-likely-to-be-announced-by-month-end/story-o7TFPJ4J3clNmOUpITD63J.html
12-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: De-sealing charges hiked to three times the licence fee||Commercial establishments such as restaurants, coffee shops, banquet halls and health clubs in south Delhi, sealed for being in violation of civic norms, will soon have to shell three times the amount of the health licence fee in order to get the establishment de-sealing. A proposal regarding the same was approved by the standing committee of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday. The proposal prepared by the public health department will now be presented before the SDMC House for a final approval. Currently, the de-sealing fee was Rs 15,000 for all kinds of health trade licence holders. Standing committee chairman Rajdutt Gahlot said the proposal to revise and increase the de-sealing charges from the present charge of Rs 15,000 to three times the licence fee was approved in order to curb violations of building by-laws, licence renewal norms, structural and operational guidelines. “The fee has been hiked to discourage illegal trades and violations of norms by businessmen. The licence fee starts from as low as ₹2,500 for minor trades such as fruit juice shops, barber shops (up to five chairs) etc and goes up to ₹50,000 for bigger establishments such as restaurants, banquet halls, coffee shops, cinema halls and health clubs, among others. The violators will be charged three times the amount of the licence fee in order to get their properties de-sealed,” Gahlot said. If approved by the SDMC House, the hiked charges will apply to shops that were sealed by the corporation. The shops that were sealed by the Supreme Court-monitoring committee for being in violation of norms can be de-sealed only on the court orders. Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders Association Lajpat Nagar, said that though the move may pinch traders, it is important to create a deterrent for violations. “The hike in fee may create a fear and prevent violation of civic norms. Adhering to norms will only be in favour of traders.” However, many other traders felt that the move will only impact businessmen who have already been hit by sealing and low sales because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-de-sealing-charges-hiked-to-three-times-the-licence-fee/story-U9je1rG6FbO743NZcx2txK.html
12-08-2020||Education||With WhatsApp and video texts, learning takes a new form in Delhi govt schools||A month after the Delhi government announced a semi-online model of education for its students amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with an increased focus on student-teacher interaction, teachers and principals across the capital are going the extra mile to ensure that they cover as many students as possible.On July 2, the government had announced that in the wake of the digital divide, students of 1,030 government schools in the capital will engage in “learning with a human feel” and have an increased interaction with their teachers over phone.CS Verma, principal of Kautilya Government Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Chirag Enclave, said the school has been trying to maximise their reach and approach as many students as they can. “We have roped in school management committee members to send hard copies of worksheets to those parents who can’t collect it from school. We have also reached out to parents and tried to coordinate online classes when they are at home so that children can access their phones,” he said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has also been interacting with parents and reviewing the semi-online model. The education minister has visited eight districts so far. On Tuesday, the education minister visited Kautilya SBV and analysed the data from 32 schools in the south-east zone. Around 17% of students from these schools could not be traced in the wake of the lockdown. The education minister had told HT in an interview that the overall figure for schools across Delhi lies in the range of 10-15%.“These numbers keep fluctuating because we have been assessing weekly numbers of different zones. Trends indicate that class 6 students constitute a large segment of students who cannot be traced. This is mostly because they have transferred to Delhi government schools from municipal corporation schools and the data is not updated. We have asked schools to get in touch with MCD schools and track these students. A study of socio-economic backgrounds and other factors can help us come up with a system to help these students as well,” he said. “While academic losses cannot be completely covered up, it can be mitigated through the efforts of teachers and stakeholders,”Sisodia said.Aparna Pandita, who teaches biology to class 12 students at Veer Savarkar Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Kalkaji, said in addition to videos and worksheets, teachers often use the voice notes feature on WhatsApp. “Students can send us their queries and then we explain the concept in a voice note. It’s more instantaneous and convenient. The feature allows us to check who has seen the audio and who has played it. Teachers can now reach out to students who didn’t play the audio to find out the issues and then address them,” Pandita said. The interim class teacher also said several students across classes had moved out of Delhi to other states, leaving teachers with a different sets of problems to deal with.For instance, class 12 student Jyoti Yadav, a resident of south Delhi’s Govindpuri, moved to her village near Patna in Bihar following the lockdown. “We could not pay rent in Delhi and our family decided to relocate temporarily,” Yadav, who left Delhi last month, said. “The internet connection in our village is very poor. My brothers use the phone for nearly four hours, and by the time I get it, there is no battery charge left. The electricity supply is also intermittent and so I cannot charge the phone, This means I can’t attend my classes regularly. I have to resort to self-study whenever I get the chance,” Yadav, an engineering aspirant who studies at Veer Savarkar SKV, said.Pandita said she has spoken to Yadav’s father multiple times asking him to prioritise her education over their younger children. “This is her final year and hence most crucial. We have told them that if she doesn’t attend her classes, there is a chance that her name may be struck off the rolls. Her parents have assured us that they will let er use the phone more,” she said.Class 9 student Risha, who is currently in Bangarmau near Kanpur, began this academic year at her new school in Kalkaji through the online mode. “Our class teacher tried to arrange video conferencing sessions so that we would get acquainted with one another. But many of us could not connect because of internet issues,” she said. “Teachers are recording their own videos and sending them to us on WhatsApp. We enjoy the lessons when we understand it, write question and answers and send it back. But it gets frustrating when we can’t follow the lessons,” Risha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-whatsapp-and-video-texts-learning-takes-a-new-form-in-delhi-govt-schools/story-WAnE43OiwRSb8ULpHXoZAP.html
12-08-2020||Pune||Pune civic body has more people under home isolation than in hospitals||More number of Covid-19 patients is under home quarantine in Pune city compared to those at hospitals. While PMC has been pushing for home isolation over isolation at Covid care centres (CCC), PCMC, zilla parishad and cantonment boards have more number of people isolated at hospitals than homes. Out of the 15,043 active cases, almost 7,754 are in home isolation and 7,289 are in hospital isolation. In the entire district, there are over 27,000 active cases, out of which more than 12,000 people are in home isolation and close to 15,000 are in hospitals, according to a district official.As of August 10, out of the total active patients in the city, over 51.54% are at homes undergoing isolation for about ten days. Currently, there are about 19 CCCs in PMC limits where asymptomatic patients are isolated. As of Tuesday [August 11], there are 19 centres that have 4,543 allocated beds for Covid-19 cases, which includes 4,532 isolation beds without oxygen out of which 2,271 are vacant and 11 isolation beds with oxygen out of which only three are vacant. While in the district, as of Monday, there were 27,114 out of which 14,995 active patients isolated in the hospital and 12,119 are isolated at their homes. In the district, apart from PMC; PCMC, city councils, rural parts and cantonment boards have isolated more patients at hospitals than at homes. Sugar commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad has stated that the civic body will be pushing for home isolation as a policy decision after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) gave guidelines for home isolation. He said that CCCs incur a lot of cost especially toiletries and bed materials and also diverts the staff from attending to more critical patients. However, the current commissioner states that it is the patients who are preferring to stay at homes. Vikram Kumar, PMC commissioner said, “It is not about costs, we have CCCs with 12,000 available beds. It is natural that any person would feel comfortable at home and not just Pune, but all major cities are pushing for home isolation including private hospitals too. Patients prefer to stay at homes rather than hospitals and those who have the luxury of isolating themselves at home. If any patient is asymptomatic or has mild symptoms, then they can isolate themselves at home. We do keep a follow up about their health till the isolation period is over by calling them regularly and also if they feel that the symptoms are escalating then we send an ambulance immediately. Also, we have a telemedicine app wherein any patient can get free consultation.” A few of the ICMR guidelines include, the person should be clinically assigned as a very mild/pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic case by the treating medical officer, such cases should have the requisite facility at their residence for self-isolation and also for quarantining the family contacts, Patients suffering from immune compromised status (HIV, Transplant recipients, Cancer therapy) are not eligible for home isolation, Elderly patients aged more than 60 years and those with co-morbid conditions such as Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart disease, Chronic lung/liver/ kidney disease, Cerebro-vascular disease shall only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation by the treating medical officer, a caregiver should be available to provide care on 24 x7 basis and a communication link between the caregiver and hospital is a prerequisite for the entire duration of home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-has-more-people-under-home-isolation-than-in-hospitals/story-qAKMSzM4h3Zy6xFOOx35CM.html
12-08-2020||Pune||In over 4,000 samples in Pune, Covid antibodies found in close to 17%: private lab||Based on over 4,000 random samples at a private lab in the city, it was found that close to 17 per cent of the people tested had developed antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19. A total of 4,116 samples were tested for antibodies of persons who were either Covid positives or suspected to have contracted the virus. Of these 4,116, 698 persons or 16.95% were found to have developed antibodies, as per the tests carried out by Thyrocare Labs. The samples were collected from residents of Pune and adjoining areas under Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), including Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and other areas. Besides tests carried out by the lab between July 3 and August 10, a separate serological survey is underway in the city being carried out by Indian Institute of Science and Research (IISER). Vikram Kumar, Pune municipal commissioner said, “I will be unable to comment on the sero survey by a private lab, but PMC along with Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) and IISER along with SPPU will be running parallel sero surveys which would be more definitive. Such surveys will help us understand about opening up more activities in areas where more people are found to have antibodies in their body.” In areas which have been hotspots since the past two months have shown a higher presence of antibodies compared to other parts of the city for the samples which were tested. Antibodies help understand how much per cent of the population has developed immunity against the virus as more people develop antibodies, the spread of the virus also slows down. In addition, such a study also helps the government understand what restrictions need to be implemented in places and what relaxations can be allowed. PMC in collaboration with IISER and SPPU is also conducting such a study, a sero survey, to understand the presence of antibodies. The results for this will be out by mid-August. Dr Prachi Sinkar, head, Thyrocare Labs said, “Usually for any infectious diseases, antibodies stay in the body for years, but for Covid-19 particularly, it has to be studied. Our study has found that the antibodies last for at least 60 days. Usually the people who come to us for tests want to know about past infection if any and if the antibodies have developed. If they were asymptomatic, for donation of plasma once recovered and do they test Covid-19 negative.” She said that the city with a good recovery rate of 68%-70% and a better doubling time, things are positive and may improve in September. The tests shows a 16% positivity rate with Kasarwadi, Karvenagar, Hadapsar and Dapodi showing an antibody positivity rate of above 30%. Antibodies found in 17% of recovered patients in sample testIn over 4,000 samples tested in PMR, antibodies found in close to 17% Research says IgG antibody lasts for years for any infectious disease, but for Covid particularly this has to be studied as yet.Based on the study at the lab, it has been found that antibodies stay for at least 60 days for Covid-19What is an antibody?An antibody, also known as the immunoglobulin, is mainly produced by plasma cells which are used by the immune system to neutralise pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. While RT-PCR or rapid antigen detection kits detect antigen which indicate the presence of the virus, antibodies prove that the body is fighting the antigens and the virus or has fought in the past.Thyrocare Technologies Limited has tested about 4,116 reports in Pune metropolitan region (PMR). Out of the 4,123 samples collected, antibodies were found in 16.95%People who opt for the test want to know if they were asymptomatic and were ever exposed to the virus or also for plasma donation. Anyone can test and no prescription is needed to test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-over-4-000-samples-covid-antibodies-found-in-close-to-17-private-lab/story-cheAYVV0WESsTc1rxHN6PP.html
12-08-2020||Pune||Two more sero surveys to cover Pune||The city administration will have two more serological surveillance studies conducted by DY Patil medical college and National Institute of Virology (NIV) to assess the presence of antibodies in people, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said. The findings of first sero survey, conducted by Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) along with Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), will be out by this week. Besides IISER, BJ Medical college, which is attached with government-run Sassoon General Hospital, has sought approval from Rao for another sero survey in the city. While the DY Patil study will cover Pimpri-Chinchwad area, the area of focus for sero survey to be conducted by NIV is yet to be finalised, said Rao. “Four surveys will cover Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. First survey by IISER is almost over. The remaining three, one each by DY Patil college, NIV and Sassoon hospital will be done in the coming days,” told Rao to reporters in Pune through video conferencing on Tuesday. As part of sero survey, ISSER has joined hands with SPPU and has collected random blood samples from 1,550 persons from slum and non-slum pockets from five wards. The community-based sero survey helps identify presence of antibodies among vulnerable population. The presence of antibodies indicates that the infected person has developed resistance to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-more-sero-surveys-to-cover-pune/story-6KtnH9Bz3FLUhMXY7k0g4L.html

12-08-2020||World||‘We have arrived,’ say Indian American after Kamala Harris selection||“We have arrived,” said Ramesh Kapur, an Indian American Democratic operative, about Kamala Harris joining Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for vice-president.The Tuesday announcement sent a wave of excitement coursing through the small Indian American community of about 4 million people. There was a sense, cutting across party lines, that Harris’s name on the presidential ticket was a badge of recognition for the entire community.Kapur, a veteran Democratic fundraiser, insists that the Biden-Harris ticket, as the team will be called now and until the November 3 elections and beyond, should be called, instead, the “Biden-Kamala” ticket.“The ‘Biden-Kamala’ name,” said Kapur, who had hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his home in Boston in 2016 during her senate race, had a better Indian ring to it.No American of India descent has ever made it on to a presidential ticket. Bobby Jindal, a former governor of Louisiana, was the first of Indian-descent to run for president. But he lost in the Republican primaries to Donald Trump, who went on to win the White House in 2016.Harris became the second Indian American to try, in 2019. But her run for the Democratic ticket did not last long either, to the disappointment of the community, many of whom were girding up for a long run. including Kapur, who had held some fund-raisers.Her return to the fray Tuesday, rekindled that optimism and re-energized the community.“Moment of great pride for the Indian American community,” said Shekar Narasimhan, chairman of Victory Fund, a Democratic party-affiliate focussed on Asian Americans. “It’s a first in so many ways and will help Joe Biden win the presidency which is the first priority. A seismic shift occurred today and its ramifications will be felt for many decades.”Frank Islam, a major Indian American fundraiser for Democrats, said, “This is a historical day for America, especially for the African American and Indian American communities.”“Since Dalip Singh Saund entered the US Congress in 1957 against all odds, the community has made tremendous strides in politics,” he added, referring to the first Indian American elected to US congress. “This unquestionably trumps every milestone. Vice presidency is generally referred to as a position that is a heartbeat away from presidency.”Most vice-presidents go on to run for the top job, with the rare exception in recent years of Dick Cheney, vice-president to President George W Bush. And most of them win, against with the rare exception in recent years of Al Gore, vice-president to President Bill Clinton. And former Vice-President Biden is himself in the fray, continuing the tradition.The nomination sets up Harris for another presidential run, according to experts. It could be in 2024, if Biden, should he win this time in 2020, doesn’t want to continue, which is a widely considered possibility given his age (he is 77 now); or in 2028 at the end of the full two-term Biden presidency.“It’s the beginning of her becoming the first Indian American president,” Kapur said of the Tuesday announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-arrived-say-indian-american-after-kamala-harris-selection/story-Y5EgdHICsmLMwK7m0xBp9O.html
12-08-2020||World||China’s days as world’s factory are over, says iPhone maker||A key supplier to Apple Inc. and a dozen other tech giants plans to split its supply chain between the Chinese market and the U.S., declaring that China’s time as factory to the world is finished because of the trade war.Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Chairman Young Liu said it’s gradually adding more capacity outside of China, the main base of production for gadgets from iPhones to Dell desktops and Nintendo Switches. The proportion outside the country is now at 30%, up from 25% last June.That ratio will rise as the company -- known also as Foxconn -- moves more manufacturing to Southeast Asia and other regions to avoid escalating tariffs on Chinese-made goods headed to U.S. markets, Liu told reporters after his company reported financial results.Also read: Apple must pay $500 million over patent violations, US court rules“No matter if it’s India, Southeast Asia or the Americas, there will be a manufacturing ecosystem in each,” Liu said, adding that while China will still play a key role in Foxconn’s manufacturing empire, the country’s “days as the world’s factory are done.”Intensifying trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have pushed device manufacturers to diversify their production bases away from China, and Liu last year said that Apple’s most prized product, the iPhone, can be made outside China if needed. The two nations remain in trade talks, but Liu’s comments affirm a growing expectation that the China-centric electronics supply chain will fragment over the longer term.The Taiwanese company reported better-than-expected net income of NT$22.9 billion ($778 million) for the quarter ended in June, boosted by increased demand for iPads and MacBooks. Revenue was NT$1.13 trillion, but Hon Hai warned it expects its third-quarter sales will be down by double digits relative to 2019 as Apple delays its iPhone launch this year.Hon Hai is bouncing back from a record profit slump in the first quarter as production at its factories recovered and shelter-in-place orders spurred demand for home computing equipment. The pandemic likely boosted iPad and Mac sales, even as Apple store closures weighed on iPhone sales, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on July 31 after reporting quarterly revenue that crushed estimates. Apple accounts for half of Hon Hai’s sales.Even as Apple outperformed, Hon Hai’s other customers have fared less well. Hong Kong-listed subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd. said in its Aug. 7 earnings release that while Huawei Technologies Co.’s new phones have been popular in China, they missed expectations elsewhere following U.S. sanctions. Another key customer Xiaomi Corp. suffered a backlash in the Indian market amid growing tensions between China and the South Asian country. FIH lost $100 million in the first half.Foxconn has been shaking up its traditionally China-focused operations. Hon Hai is among Apple assembly partners that plan to expand operations in India, potentially helping the iPhone maker grow its presence in the country of 1.3 billion and shift some of the U.S. company’s supply chain outside of China as ties between Washington and Beijing fray.Chinese rivals are also posing a growing challenge. Local electronics titan Luxshare Precision Industry Co. is poised to become the first Chinese homegrown iPhone assembler after sealing a deal in July to buy an Apple handset production plant from Wistron Corp. While Hon Hai will keep assembly orders for premium iPhones, Luxshare will eat into the business for mid-to-entry-level Apple handsets, Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao wrote in a July 23 note.Foxconn will work on its component business to maintain tech leadership and it also benefits from its long-term relationship with Apple, Liu said in response to several analysts’ questions about Foxconn’s competitive strategy against the rising Chinese supplier.Orders could be further affected after President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring U.S. residents from doing business with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat. Annual iPhone shipments could plunge 25%-30% if Apple is forced to remove the app from its app stores worldwide, TF International Securities analyst Kuo Ming-chi warned in an August 9 note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-days-as-world-s-factory-are-over-says-iphone-maker/story-clPVEE4DKQX4Muwe4kNRJL.html
12-08-2020||World||‘Fight on’: Arrested Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai tells staff||Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai on Wednesday told his reporters to “fight on” after his dramatic arrest, as China widens its crackdown against critics in the semi-autonomous city.The clampdown has gathered pace since Beijing imposed a sweeping security law on the international business hub in June, with opposition politicians disqualified and activists arrested for social media posts.Lai was among 10 people detained under the new law on Monday as around 200 police officers searched the newsroom of his Apple Daily tabloid, which is unapologetically critical of Beijing.The 71-year-old was cheered by staff and handed a bouquet on Wednesday as he returned to the newsroom following a late-night release on bail after 40 hours in custody.“Fight on! Let’s fight on,” Lai said. “We have the support of the Hong Kong people. We can’t let them down.”In images broadcast live on Facebook by his own reporters, he told staff to continue filing the kind of unvarnished dispatches that have infuriated China and pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong.But Lai told staff it was becoming “increasingly difficult” to run a media business in the city.“Luckily, I was not sent back to the mainland,” he quipped in a characteristic display of dark humour.The crackdown has provoked outrage in the West and deepened fears for millions who last year took to the streets to protest China’s tightening grip on the city.China has declared it will have jurisdiction over especially serious national security crimes, toppling the legal firewall between the mainland’s Communist Party-controlled courts and Hong Kong’s independent judiciary.Sweeping new law Beijing imposed the new national security law in response to huge and often violent pro-democracy protests last year.It has described the law -- its contents kept secret until it was enacted on 30 June -- as a “sword” hanging over the heads of opponents in Hong Kong.It officially criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.Also read: Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested under national security law: ReportBut the broadly worded provisions outlawed certain political speech overnight, such as advocating sanctions, and greater autonomy or independence for Hong Kong.Similar laws are used on the authoritarian mainland to snuff out opposition.The most serious crimes under the Hong Kong law -- which is not supposed to be retroactive -- carry up to life in jail.Police have given limited details of their alleged case against Lai and those arrested on Monday.They say the group were involved in lobbying for foreign sanctions before the security law was passed and that they continued to operate in some form once the legislation came in.Among those arrested were two of Lai’s sons, senior Apple Daily executives and three members of now-disbanded pro-democracy party Demosisto -- including prominent activist Agnes Chow.Regional media hub Critics believe the security law has ended the key liberties and autonomy that Beijing promised Hong Kong could keep after its 1997 handover by Britain.The US has declared Hong Kong no longer autonomous from the mainland and has deployed sanctions in response.A growing roster of western powers has suspended extradition agreements with Hong Kong in protest at the crackdown including Britain, Canada, Australia, France and Germany.China has responded in kind. On Wednesday, Hong Kong’s government announced it was suspending its extradition agreements with France and Germany.Hong Kong is a major media hub with a vibrant local press and multiple international news outlets operating regional headquarters in the city. Both China and Hong Kong’s government vowed the security law would keep press freedoms intact.

The revised draft, which eliminated some provisions from the earlier version that diplomats said went beyond the extension of the arms embargo, may be put to a vote as early as Friday.Still, with Russia and China sharply critical of the US effort to indefinitely extend the arms embargo, the two will likely use their veto powers even if the draft got the minimum nine “yes” votes in the council, which appears unlikely.The US push to make the arms embargo permanent follows President Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal between major world powers and Tehran, aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran has repeatedly insisted it does not seek to produce a nuclear bomb.The nuclear deal, endorsed by the Security Council, includes a provision lifting the arms embargo on Iran on October 18.Rouhani lambasted the revised draft, saying its “initiators will be responsible for the consequences” if the Security Council adopts the new resolution. He did not elaborate on what steps Iran could take.Zarif said the US draft was a “very illegal resolution, and in fact it uses the Security Council mechanisms to destroy the Security Council. “ “I’m confident that this resolution will be rejected too,” Zarif said.The United Nations banned Iran from buying major foreign weapon systems in 2010 amid tensions over its nuclear program. That blocked Iran from replacing its aging military equipment, much of which had been purchased by the shah before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. An earlier embargo targeted Iranian arms exports.In a separate development Wednesday, Iranian hard-liners in parliament voted against Rouhani’s nominee for trade minister in the first showdown between the rival camps since the house resumed work in May despite the struggles to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Lawmakers rejected Hossein Modares Khiabani’s nomination for minister of trade and industries.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said the vote was 140-104 against the nominee. There were 254 lawmakers at the session and 10 abstained. The parliament has 290 seats.The vote marked the first serious confrontation between the newly elected house, dominated by conservatives and the bloc of supporters of the relatively moderate Rouhani. Under the law, Rouhani must introduce new nominees to his Cabinet in the next three months.Rouhani in May dismissed the trade and industry minister at the time, Reza Rahmani, as Iran faced an unprecedented economic downturn amid intense pressure from the United States after Trump pulled America out of the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country. Khiabani, 52, had since been the acting trade minister.Iran is also grappling with the largest and deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus in the Middle East, with more than 333,000 confirmed cases and at least 18,988 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-president-fm-lash-out-at-new-us-push-on-arms-embargo/story-NiB0VUBU13bI3y9Yoj5QaI.html

Best Wishes from Changsha! True unity inspires people to work as one to overcome adversity,” The Capital Gazette reported.Another note from Yani Xia, a representative in the Chinese city’s Foreign Affairs Office, accompanied the shipments. “We sincerely wish you and everyone in Annapolis continued good health, and the fortitude to persevere during this challenging period,” Xia’s note read.Annapolis’ relationship with Changsha began under a former city administrator, according to the release. The two municipalities are now sister cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-city-donates-40-000-masks-to-annapolis/story-TFLNlRwBbHONrhQwL8eZyJ.html
12-08-2020||World||Chinese woman, 68, tests Covid-19 positive after recovering in February||A 68-year-old Chinese woman has tested positive for Covid-19 six months after she recovered from the disease, health authorities said here Wednesday. The second – and rare late -- resurgence of the virulent virus in a cured and discharged patient in China raises questions about the time it could take to eliminate the pathogen from the body.The woman’s case was reported from the Jingzhou area of central China’s Hubei province.The virus first emerged late last year in the provincial capital, Wuhan, before spreading across China and then globally.The patient, who was not identified, had been infected early during the outbreak in China but recovered and was discharged from the hospital in February.But she tested positive again on August 9 following tests after she showed symptoms.The elderly patient was quarantined, and her close contacts have tested negative for the virus, the health authorities said.A virologist told Chinese state media that the rare case shows it probably takes a long time to eliminate the coronavirus from the human body, but asserted that people who tested positive again after recovering from Covid-19 are not infectious.The virologist cited scientific studies to say that “re-positive” Covid-19 patients are not infectious.The density of the virus inside this specific patient’s body was low, which may explain why she had tested negative in the first place, Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the state-controlled tabloid Global Times. A survey conducted by Wuhan’s Zhongnan hospital last week said 90 percent of a sample group of recovered patients reported lung damage and five percent of them had to be again quarantined after testing positive for the virus.A team at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University led by Peng Zhiyong, director of the hospital’s ICU has been conducting follow-up visits with ‘100 recovered patients’ ..The results also showed that antibodies against the novel coronavirus in 10 per cent of the 100 patients have disappeared.Five per cent of them received negative results in Covid-19 nucleic acid tests but positive results in Immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests, and thus have to be quarantined again, the report said.The patients also suffered depression and a sense of stigma. Most of the recovered patients told the team that their families were not willing to have dinner with them at the same table, the report said.China has brought the spread of the pandemic under control but is still tackling new smaller cluster infections in different cities and imported cases of Covid-19.The coronavirus was found on the outer packaging of frozen shrimps bought by a restaurant in Wuhu city in Anhui province during a routine inspection by local authorities, CCTV, China’s state television, reported.The news broke a day after a port city in eastern China’s Shandong province said it found the virus on the packaging of imported frozen seafood although it did not say where the seafood consignment originated.The Hubei province has reported a total of 68138 Covid-19 cases, the most in China and the disease has claimed 4512 lives in the province.China’s national health commission (NHC) on Wednesday said that it received reports of 25 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Tuesday, including 16 imported cases and nine domestically transmitted ones.China has so far reported 84737 cases and 4634 deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-woman-68-tests-covid-19-positive-after-recovering-in-february/story-vlkL6YBtLFK3BBAmVDrYDK.html
12-08-2020||World||Covid-19 plunges UK into recession, Sunak warns of ‘hard times’||Chancellor Rishi Sunak declared on Wednesday that ‘hard times are here’ after new official figures showed that the United Kingdom had fallen into deep recession – the GDP is down by 20.4% – as the coronavirus pandemic takes a heavy toll of lives, lifestyles and jobs.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the GDP fell in the second quarter of 2020 by 20.4% compared with the previous three months – the biggest quarterly decline since comparable records began in 1955. It is the worst figure for any G7 nation in the three months to June.Sunak, who has been borrowing heavily to pay most of the wage bill of the private sector and the self-employed since March, said: ““I’ve said before that hard times were ahead and today’s figures confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs and, sadly, in the coming months many more will. But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”The government-backed furlough scheme is to end in October, with more warnings that it would further plunge employment figures as companies either shut shop or cut staff drastically to remain in business.The ONS said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease: it grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May, but Jonathan Athow of ONS said: “Despite this, gross domestic product in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.”The opposition Labour criticised the Boris Johnson government’s handling of the economy during the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: “We’ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we’re on course for the worst recession too”.“That’s a tragedy for the British people and it’s happened on Boris Johnson’s watch,” she added.Alpesh Paleja of the Confederation of British Industry said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time: “A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-plunges-uk-into-recession-sunak-warns-of-hard-times/story-FYkpGymyVbLJiUeS9ZPy1H.html
12-08-2020||World||China to bring up WeChat, TikTok in next US trade talks||US and Chinese negotiators plan to discuss progress of their trade deal in the coming days, with Beijing pushing to widen the agenda to include Washington’s recent crackdown on businesses including TikTok and WeChat.A virtual meeting will likely take place as soon as this week though a date hasn’t been finalized, according to people familiar with preparations for the talks who asked not to be named. President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser on Tuesday downplayed concerns the phase-one agreement will fall apart.Also read | Twitter, TikTok have had preliminary talks about merger: ReportAlong with agricultural purchases and the dollar-yuan exchange rate, Chinese officials intend to bring up Trump’s prospective bans on transactions with the two apps on national security grounds, the people said without elaborating about what China hopes to achieve by doing so.Almost seven months after a White House signing ceremony paused a tariff war that had roiled the global economy, Beijing’s pledged purchases of US goods are far behind schedule. The coronavirus crisis and the deterioration in US-China relations on everything from tech security to Hong Kong has left trade a rare area of cooperation.The “one area we are engaging is trade,” Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said at a White House press conference Tuesday. “It’s fine right now.”At a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China’s position on phase one remains consistent. TikTok, he said, “is just a platform for providing entertainment, leisure, the show of talents and sharing for American people and people around the world. It has nothing to do with national security.”In the US, Trump’s treatment of China is emerging as a political weapon for Democrats trying to unseat him in November. It was three years ago this month that the Trump administration initiated an investigation into China’s treatment of US intellectual property that would help form the foundation of a trade war that would lead to tariffs on some $500 billion in products shipped between the world’s largest economies.Now, less than three months before Trump’s re-election bid, the pandemic that originated in China has his administration struggling to find the balance between showing toughness and clinging to an agreement that isn’t delivering on Beijing’s promises.‘It’s About Farmers’Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Bloomberg Television this week that “it’s amazing that despite the storm that is now the US-China relationship, neither Trump or Xi Jinping really want to junk the phase-one deal.”“For Trump, in a word, it’s about farmers -- the sales that they can make for red states in this election,” Kennedy said, referring to rural strongholds for Republicans. For Chinese President Xi, “it’s about stability and keeping the relationship from entirely collapsing,” he said.China is seeking to defuse an unpredictable confrontation with the US that’s seen several of its tech champions targeted, with the latest actions spurring a potential sale of the US operations of ByteDance Ltd’s wildly popular short video app to Microsoft Corp. Trump is also banning US transactions with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat app, which has more than 1 billion users.Trump’s executive orders, set to take effect in September, have potentially an even wider impact than the multi-pronged assault on telecommunications hardware provider Huawei Technologies Co., as they threaten to sever communication links among the people of the world’s biggest economies. The US argues that Chinese apps which collect information on US citizens pose a grave national security risk as the data is prone to being acquired by the Chinese government.Given the collapse in the global economy this year tied to the pandemic, which Trump has repeatedly blamed on China, Beijing was only a quarter of the way through its effort to buy more than $170 billion in US goods this year by the end of June.On Tuesday Kudlow downplayed the shortfall, saying China had “substantially” increased purchases of US goods.China would need to buy about $130 billion in the second half of this year to comply with the original terms of the agreement signed in January, which laid out purchasing an additional $200 billion of US goods and services over the 2017 level by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-bring-up-wechat-tiktok-in-next-us-trade-talks/story-8hZRpWmt8JrMExFyGyERWJ.html

As Islamabad returns loan, questions riseThis development came after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had given a blunt warning to Saudi Arabia-led Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for not taking a stance against India over the Kashmir issue.Qureshi was quoted as saying by the ARY channel, “If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris.”“I am once again respectfully telling OIC that a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers is our expectation,” he further stated.As Pakistan pulled out of the Kuala Lumpur summit after Saudi Arabia’s “request”, it now expects Riyadh to “show leadership on this issue,” he added.Islamabad has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) since India abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.After Pakistan failed to gather support from the OIC members on Kashmir on May 22, Prime Minister Imran Khan said, “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We cannot even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”Though Pakistan reportedly made attempts to push its narrative of raising the issue of rising Islamophobia in India in its agenda, Maldives, an ally of India, thwarted the move and said, “Isolated statements by motivated people and disinformation campaigns on social media should not be construed as representative of the feelings of 1.3 billion.”Maldives Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Thilmeeza Hussain, said that alleging Islamophobia in the context of India would be factually incorrect.“It would be detrimental to the religious harmony in the South Asian region. Islam has existed in India for centuries and it is the second-largest religion in India, with 14.2 per cent of the country’s population,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-loan-oil-supply-for-pakistan-says-saudi-arabia/story-834l4VX4OLmNZOlyQ8doAL.html
12-08-2020||World||Biden has surrendered to radical mob by naming Kamala Harris as running mate: Trump Campaign||By naming Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris as his Vice President running mate, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has surrendered to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding and appease socialist dictators, President Donald Trump campaign has alleged. Launching a scathing attack on Harris, the Trump campaign said the Americans will resoundingly reject the absymal failures of Biden and Harris.“Joe Biden is no moderate, and with Harris as his ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators,” Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 campaign’s senior advisor, said in a statement.“At the ballot box, Americans will resoundingly reject the abysmal failures of Biden-Harris in favor of the America First strength of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence,” Pierson said. The comments came as Biden on Tuesday named Harris as his Vice-Presidential running mate, making history by selecting the first black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.Harris, has been one of those Democratic Senators who has been leading the party’s charge against President Donald Trump, who is seeking his re-election from the Republican party.“Not long ago, Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received. Clearly, Phony Kamala will abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat Party,” Pierson said.“In her failed attempt at running for president, Harris gleefully embraced the left’s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders’ government takeover of healthcare. She is proof that Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left,” Pierson said.Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel alleged that Harris’ extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials, show that the left-wing mob is controlling Biden’s candidacy, just like they would control him as president. “These radical policies might be popular among liberals, but they are well outside the mainstream for most Americans,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/biden-has-surrendered-to-radical-mob-by-naming-kamala-harris-as-running-mate-trump-campaign/story-G0hkDu7VNCuxRoYuH5mg5K.html

One of the biggest concerns is that the approval comes before the completion of human trials. Russia was yet to start a larger trial involving thousands of participants, commonly known as a Phase III trial, which is normally considered an essential precursor to a regulatory approval.Russian President Vladimir Putin claims the vaccine offers “sustainable immunity” against Covid-19. He said one of his daughters had received the inoculation and felt better.Also read: ‘Need to assess if Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective’ - AIIMS DirectorExperts say the lack of published data on Russia’s vaccine have left scientists, health authorities and the public in the dark.

According to Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tally, over 7.3 lakh people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 globally, whereas more than 13 million people have beaten the deadly virus across the globe. With this, the active number of Covid-19 patients, those suffering from the disease at present, stands at nearly 6 million people across the globe. The United States leads the Covid-19 tally with the highest total, as well as, active Covid-19 cases in the world. Brazil and India follow as countries with the second and third highest cumulative Covid-19 cases globally.Here’s taking a look at countries with highest Covid-19 caseload and fatalities in the world:United StatesLeading the global Covid-19 tally is the United States with over 5 million total and 2 million active cases of coronavirus. The Covid-19 death toll in the US has jumped over 1.6 lakh which is the highest in the world.

12-08-2020||World||Who is Kamala Harris? A few facts about Joe Biden’s running mate||Kamala Harris made history when she was picked by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as his running mate on Tuesday. She is the first Asian-American on a major presidential ticket.She is the daughter of Indian mother from Chennai, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher who passed away in 2009, and Jamaican father, Donald Harris, who teaches at Stanford University. The parents separated when Harris and her younger sister Maya Harris were still very young.From Kamala’s name (Shyamala gave her and her sisters Sanskrit names to connect their heritage with their identities) to her focus on immigration and equal rights, Shyamala has had a profound influence and lasting legacy on her high-flying daughter. Her selection came as little surprise. With the United States in the midst of a reckoning over its history of racial injustice, Biden had increasingly been pressed to select a woman of colour. Harris, who became the Senate’s second Black woman in its history, was always at the top of the list. .@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals.I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.But Harris did anything but keep a low profile while Biden was making up his mind. Instead, she emerged as a fierce advocate for police reform and social justice - in the Senate, in the streets, and on the airwaves, sparring with Republicans on the Senate floor and offering fiery critiques of Republican President Donald Trump.Harris is now the first American of Indian and Asian descent to run for vice-president. She is also the first African American of a major party and only the third woman yet to run for that office, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and Republican Sarah Palin.Harris became the first Indian American woman to run for US president ever - from either party - in 2019. She is also the first Indian-American Democrat to try for the job.Harris has also served as district attorney in San Francisco.Harris was sworn in as a United States Senator from California in 2017, only the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history. She served on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee on the Budget.She grew up in Oakland. And after earning an undergraduate degree from Howard University and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings, she a career in law in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. She became the district attorney of San Francisco in 2003.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-kamala-harris-a-few-facts-about-joe-biden-s-running-mate/story-uQoxCnERjPya5nZg4nbxFK.html

Argentina has been under quarantine since March 20, although officials previously relaxed restrictions in many parts of the nation, a move blamed for the recent spike in cases. The country recorded 7,043 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, pushing the total confirmed infections to 260,911, surpassing the total caseload in Italy. The latest government data shows 5,004 people have died from the disease.The capital Buenos Aires and the surrounding province have been bound by the strictest quarantine measures but have nonetheless emerged as the focal point of the country´s outbreak.The World Health Organization earlier on Tuesday expressed special concern for the spike in cases in Argentina after months in which the country appeared to have the outbreak under control.

Presumptive Democratic party presidential nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday named 55-year-old Harris as his vice presidential running mate, making history by selecting the first black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.Harris, whose father is an African from Jamaica and mother an Indian, is currently the US Senator from California.“This is a great choice for our country,” tweeted Nooyi, who is seen as a role model by millions of women across the world.Harris herself was a presidential aspirant until last year before she dropped out of the race because of lack of popular support.“What an electric moment for the Indian-American community! Indian-Americans are now truly a mainstream community in the national fabric,” M R Rangaswami, an eminent Indian-American and the founder of Indiaspora, told PTI.Welcoming the decision, IMPACT, a leading Indian-American advocacy group and a Political Action Committee, said it will raise USD 10 million for the campaign.“Kamala Harris’ story is the story of a changing, inclusive America...Her candidacy is historic and inspiring, not only for Black Americans, but for millions of Asian American voters, the fastest growing voting bloc in the country,” IMPACT’s executive director Neil Makhija said.Harris’ supporters on Tuesday announced to launch a nationwide campaign ‘America mein Khila Kamal (Lotus blooms in the US). California-based Indian-American entrepreneur Ajay Bhutoria told PTI that he is planning to release graphic and social media posts around this slogan in the run up to the November 3 presidential elections.Bhutoria is also the creator of a multi-language campaign, including in Hindi, which says, “America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho, Jo Biden Jaisa Ho!! (How America’s leader should be, like Biden)”, as part of the efforts to reach to the Indian-American community.According to Neha Dewan, National Director of South Asians for Biden, Harris has fought for justice throughout her time in public service, which makes her an “uniquely inspired choice” to take on Trump and the Republicans. Harris’ selection to serve in the second-highest office in the US is a signal that the community is an important part of the American fabric, said Deepa Sharma, national communications co-chair for South Asians for Biden.The Indo-American Democratic Organisation, one of the oldest South Asian American political advocacy bodies in the US, noted that a “Biden-Harris administration will prioritise the needs and challenges faced by immigrants”. Harris will build stronger US-India relations, said Rajendra Dichpally from US India Security Council. However, not all Indian-Americans were happy with Harris’ nomination.“Yes, there will be initial excitement and confusion for a few weeks amongst the Indian Americans -- debating whether to vote for Biden due to Kamala Harris being of Indian Heritage or voting for Trump, who has been great for India-US relations. There is and there will be a lot of hustling by the Biden-Harris combo for the Indian-American votes in the battleground states,” Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, told PTI.However, after initial few weeks of excitement, Indian-Americans would continue to support Trump because of his “impeccable track record” when it comes to Indo-US ties and promises fulfilled to the community, he asserted. Mason questioned what Biden and Harris have done for India? And went on to add, “Zero. Future promises by them -- after being elected -- mean nothing.” According to a recent survey conducted by Mason 50 per cent of the Indian-Americans in key battleground states like Texas, Michigan, Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania who traditionally vote for Democrats, are now switching over to the Trump camp. Prominent physician Dr Deepak Nandi said Harris’ selection as vice presidential candidate will have minimal effects on the Indian-American electoral votes as Trump has done so much for the community by supporting their entrepreneurial efforts and ease of doing business in the US. According to Sridhar Chillara, founder and chairman of the Asian American Republican Alliance, Indian-Americans will vote “with eyes wide open” in the presidential election and “reject the game of hypocrisy and identity politics played by the Democrats”. Acknowledging that Harris’ nomination will excite many community members, as this is the closest the community has come to the Oval Office, Indian-Americans for Trump in a statement said, however, there is a lot of opposition to her. “Until she was contesting for the President, during the Democratic primary season, she had not associated herself with the Indian-American population. That is why, at a debate podium, questions were raised to her about her being of Indian heritage and hiding it. That opened this issue for her,” it said in a statement.Indian-American physician Dr Raj Bhayani said historically, selection of vice president candidates has had no effect on the outcome of the presidential race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-groups-laud-historic-selection-of-kamala-harris-as-biden-s-vice-presidential-candidate/story-IZLUV0zRFGw3gv6X9zxMGP.html

Known as an aggressive campaigner, she has won statewide elections three times in California. She built her early career as district attorney of San Francisco and was elected as the state’s attorney general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-kamala-harris-meanest-and-most-horrible-us-senator/story-s5zyJp9ql0RpXgSKcbcY6L.html

The city’s Beijing-backed government and Chinese authorities say the law is necessary to restore order after months of at times violent anti-government protests last year, sparked by fears China was slowly eroding those freedoms. Police detained Lai for suspected collusion with foreign forces after about 200 officers searched the newspaper’s offices, collecting 25 boxes of evidence.Handcuffed and apparently wearing the same clothes after spending the night in jail, he was driven by police on Tuesday to his yacht which police searched, according to media footage.On his release, Lai left in a black car without speaking.Beijing has labelled Lai a “traitor” in the past and issued a statement supporting his arrest.The Beijing-backed China Daily newspaper said in an editorial Lai’s arrest showed “the cost of dancing with the enemy”. Shares in Next Digital, which publishes Apple Daily, surged for a second day, gaining more than 2,078% from Friday’s close, after online pro-democracy forums called on investors to show support. Its market value rose as high as HK$5.17 billion ($666.7 million) from some HK$200 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kongers-rush-to-buy-lai-s-paper-stocks-in-his-company/story-O0WfoNUWjTPQpfCxGvoLdJ.html

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa continued with the same panel appointed by Sirisena after assuming office. The police unit of the panel appointed by then president Sirisena has asked Wickremesinghe to appear before them on August 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-easter-attack-probe-panel-summons-ex-pm-ranil-wickremesinghe/story-Yds3HtmjtyfVr6HIiOgYwK.html

The state security report, which confirmed the correspondence to the president and the prime minister, has not previously been reported. “There was a danger that this material, if stolen, could be used in a terrorist attack,” the official told Reuters.“I warned them that this could destroy Beirut if it exploded,” said the official, who was involved in writing the letter and declined to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/govt-was-warned-on-explosives-at-port/story-CmG3bL0iu7dTaJarDMJ7QM.html
12-08-2020||World||Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has named Kamala Harris, who is of mixed Black and Indian heritage, as his pick for vice-president in a much anticipated announcement Tuesday that was described as “historic” and “seismic” by Democrats, including many ecstatic Indian Americas, and non-partisan observers.Biden announced his pick in a tweet late afternoon as speculation reached a feverish pitch on all leading TV channels and social media. “I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate,” the former vice-president wrote on twitter.His campaign followed up with a more expansive explanation of the pick. “Joe knows more about the importance of the Vice Presidency than just about anyone, and he is confident that Kamala Harris will be the best partner for him to finally get the country back on track,” it said in a statement, and added, “Kamala will be ready to tackle the work that is needed to heal our country on Day One of the Biden-Harris Administration.”In her first public response to the announcement, Harris wrote on twitter:, shortly: “@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he’s spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he’ll build an America that lives up to our ideals. I’m honored to join him as our party’s nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.”A win in November will make Harris the first female vice-president of the United States and set her up the presidency in 2024, at the end of Biden’s first term, or 2028. Most vice-presidents have gone on to run for the top job themselves and win, with some exceptions such as Al Gore.President Donald Trump, who had earlier called Harris a “fine choice” if picked by Biden, felt differently and accorded the announcement the full Trump treatment. He slammed her as “nasty” and “the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful” for her grilling of Brett Kavanaugh at his senate confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. His campaign called her “phony”.Harris was not a surprise pick as she had been on everyone’s shortlist of Biden’s choices, which at some stage had 11 names. In recent days the former vice-president had been focussed on three — Harris, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Congresswoman Karen Baas. Some days ago, Biden may have tipped his hand inadvertently when notes he held during a press interaction showed several check-marks against her name.The 55-year-old first time senator from California is now the first American of Indian and Asian descent to run for vice-president. She is also the first African American of a major party and only the third woman yet to run for that office, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and Republican Sarah Palin. The US hasn’t had a female vice-president, or president, yet.Harris’s mother Shyamala Gopalan (Harris by marriage) came from Chennai. She was a cancer researcher, who raised Harris and the younger daughter Maya Harris, as a single-mother mostly after early separation from Donald Harris, who had come to the US from Jamaica. Gopalan passed away in 2009.Indian Americans were ecstatic. Ramesh Kapur, a veteran Democrat who hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his home in Boston in 2016 during her senate run, said he believed the Tuesday announcement was the start of a journey. “It’s the beginning of her becoming the first Indian American president — this is a journey.”“Moment of great pride for the Indian American community,” said Shekar Narasimhan, a top Democratic strategist and fundraiser. “It’s a first in so many ways and will help Joe Biden win the presidency which is the first priority. A seismic shift occurred today and its ramifications will be felt for many decades”.Harris was friends with Biden’s elder son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer. But her links to the family were said to have suffered a major blow after she attacked the former vice-president’s record on racism at one of the Democratic primaries. Biden is reported to have been hurt by Harris’s attacks. But Biden made clear in recent days that he does not hold grudges as he considered Harris along with a long list of 10 other women for his vice-president pick.The Trump re-election campaign picked on that debate exchange to attack Harris. “Not long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received,” Katrina Pierson, a Trump 2020 senior advisor, said in a statement, adding, “Clearly, Phony Kamala will abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat Party.”Harris became the first Indian American woman to run for US president ever — from either party in 2019. The first from the tiny minority community of 4 million was Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, who didn’t last the primaries that were eventually won by President Trump in 2016. Harris is also the first Indian American Democrat — ale or female — to try for the job; she failed also..Harris was only the second African American woman of a major political party to run for the presidency. Shirley Chisholm, also a Democrat, was the first, making an unsuccessful bid in 1972. The list thus far, however, has been dominated by men, which includes, most famously, Barack Obama who went on to win two terms. Also, Jesse Jackson, who ran twice, unsuccessfully.Harris addressed her mixed heritage in her autobiography released 2010, “The Truth We hold: An American journey”. Growing up, her mother and her relatives “instilled pride in our South Asian roots. Our classical Indian names harked back to our Indian heritage and we were raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for India culture. All my mother’s words of affection or frustration came out in her mother tongue — which seems fitting to me, since the purity of those emotions is what I associated with my mother most of all.”She also wrote, “My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls. and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”Harris was sworn in as a United States Senator from California in 2017, only the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history. She served on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee on the Budget. And quickly earned a reputation for her hard-nosed prosecutorial manner of questioning of witnesses at hearings.Her website says she has spent her entire life fighting for justice, as a “passion that was first inspired by her mother, Shyamala, an Indian-American immigrant, activist, and breast cancer researcher”. Harris grew up in Oakland. And after earning an undergraduate degree from Howard University in Washington DC, and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings, she began a career in law in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. She became the district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. And after two terms as district attorney, she was elected California’s attorney general. (that’s how she met Beau Biden, who was attorney general of Delaware). Harris is married to Doug Emhoff and is stepmother to Ella and Cole Emhoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-picks-kamala-harris-as-his-running-mate/story-eQ8HvusuyfqQFMhXFuqqUP.html

Harris, a senator from California, has remained on the list as some others dropped out. So have Congresswoman Karen Baas and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Senator Tammy Duckworth and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms are also there.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced Tuesday a list of speakers for the four nights of the convention starting August 17, during which Biden will be officially crowned as the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbentSpeakers include former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and former first ladies Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. Also on the list were Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most senior woman politician in the US, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two leaders of the progressive wing of the party, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the rock-star progressive congresswoman from New York.Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican, is also on the list of speakers in recognition perhaps of — and in a tactical move to tap into — Republicans opposed to President Trump. The Lincoln Project — a group of former Republican strategists and operatives that include John McCain campaign head Steve Schmidt, Mitt Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens and several leading NeverTrumpers — has run some of the most hard-hitting campaign ads against Trump.The Republican convention starts on August 24 and will also be all done virtually, though some ground-activity in Charlottesville, North Carolina are still being considered.President Trump on Monday confirmed reports that he is looking at Gettysburg, the site of the iconic 1863 address by President Abraham Lincoln, as one of the venues for his convention speech accepting the party’s nomination to seek a second term. The other venue up for consideration is White House. The Republican National Committee has yet to announce other details about the convention, including speakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-remains-in-race-for-biden-s-vice-president-pick-clintons-obamas-to-address-convention/story-JQJ8lauYai0qZROhQe9K5M.html

He is understood to have called the press conference to explain his remarks in a bid to placate the kingdom. The postponement suggests Pakistan would have to do more to rectify the situation.One observer has said his job is now on the line.Last week, Qureshi asked OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” on convening a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers on Kashmir. “I am once again respectfully telling OIC that a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers is our expectation. If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” he had told a TV channel.He said if OIC fails to summon the council of foreign ministers meeting, Pakistan would be ready to go for a session outside OIC. Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the 57-member bloc of Muslim countries, the second largest intergovernmental body after the United Nations.Pakistan’s Foreign Office, asked about Qureshi’s remarks, had later insisted that it was not against diplomatic norms.Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the 57-member bloc of Muslim countries, the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, since India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status last August.Qureshi said Pakistan skipped the Kuala Lumpur Summit last December on a Saudi request and now Pakistani Muslims are demanding Riyadh “show leadership on the issue”.“We have our own sensitivities. You have to realise this. Gulf countries should understand this,” the foreign minister said, adding that he could no more indulge in diplomatic niceties.Qureshi made it clear that he was not being emotional and fully understood the implications of his statement. “It’s right, I’m taking a position despite our good ties with Saudi Arabia,” he said.Opposition PML-N had attacked the government for the minister’s remarks, describing it as an irresponsible statement about a friendly country and the worst kind of diplomacy. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had historic and strategic relations and Saudi Arabia had always stood by Pakistan in testing times, the party’s secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said, accusing the government of “playing with” vital interests of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-minister-s-cancelled-briefing-on-saudi-ties-hints-the-tiff-just-got-wider/story-n7LS1F23YavfV0CN7j4ejM.html

However, the PMO statement said, “The Prime Minister knows that Minister Morneau and the entire team of Cabinet ministers will keep doing the work that Canadians rely on to get them through this pandemic.”Like Trudeau, Morneau has also been embroiled in the scandal over a nearly billion dollar contract given to a charity with close links to them. Both are also facing investigations by Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner in this context, while also being probed by Parliamentary panels.Rumours of Morneau’s ouster gained ground after the return to the country of former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney as an informal advisor to the Prime Minister on the economic aspect of the coronavirus crisis and recovery from the adversity caused by precautionary restrictions. Carney, who was till recently Governor of the Bank of England, was cited as a potential replacement for Morneau.However, the statement from the PMO was lavish in its praise for Morneau as it said the Finance Minister had “worked relentlessly” and “closely with the Prime Minister” to build a “strong and resilient” Canadian economy. “That work has continued throughout the global pandemic,” the statement said, listing out measures including wage subsidies and doles announced during the crisis. It went on to say that Morneau “is continuing this important work.” The Finance Minister has also denied that he is planning to resign. Morneau has been in that post since Trudeau first came to power in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-canadian-pm-trudeau-backs-up-finance-minister-morneau-despite-controversy/story-wX2hO62M7oOybbC4guxNPL.html
12-08-2020||India||IAF objects to its portrayal in Netflix film on Kargil war||The Indian Air Force (IAF) has objected to an incorrect portrayal of gender bias and its work culture in the Dharma Productions’ movie ‘Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl’, which was released on streaming platform Netflix on Wednesday.In a letter to the Dharma Productions, Netflix, and the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), IAF said certain scenes and dialogues in the movie were found to portray the force in “an undue negative light”. “In the aim to glorify the screen character of ‘Ex-Fit Lt Gunjan Saxena’, M/s Dharma Productions presented some situations that are misleading and portray an inappropriate work culture especially against women in the IAF,” the letter, the contents of which were seen by HT, said. It added IAF has always ensured the organisation is gender neutral and has always provided equal opportunities to both women and men personnel.IAF has also provided a summary of the scenes and dialogues, which it considers objectionable and an incorrect presentation of gender bias. It added the production house was informed about the objectionable portions of the movie and was advised to delete or modify them. “However, the production house has not deleted the scenes, but had proposed a media plan in the run-up to the release and inserting a disclaimer in the movie,” the letter said. It called the measures inadequate.CBFC does not regulate platforms like Netflix even as the Union information and broadcasting ministry is working to prepare a regulatory framework. The Centre has been looking at self-regulatory mechanisms for such platforms.As per the initial understanding, Dharma Productions had agreed to represent IAF with authenticity and make efforts to ensure the film helps to inspire the next generation of officers, according to a person familiar with the developments.Attempts to reach Dharma Productions and Netflix were unsuccessful at the time of the report. When contacted, an I&B ministry official said OTT platforms do not come under the purview of the ministry.The movie is based on Gunjan Saxena, who became the first woman IAF pilot to take part in the 1999 Kargil war.The headcount of women in the armed forces is upwards of 3,300. They include 1,300 in the IAF. But combat roles were off-limits for women until the IAF took the lead in overcoming internal resistance to grant them equal opportunities in 2015 when they became eligible for the fighter stream.Warships, tanks, and combat positions in the infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.The army is currently in the process of granting permanent commission to short service commissioned women following a Supreme Court verdict. In February, the court ruled that women should be considered for command roles and that all women officers are entitled to permanent commission. It asked the army to give them a permanent commission in a major boost to gender parity.Last month, the defence ministry wrote a letter to CBFC drawing attention to movies and web series producers distorting the army’s image and advised they obtain no-objection certificates before airing their movies or shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-objects-to-its-portrayal-in-netflix-film-on-kargil-war/story-81rXcXOj3qZ6O2Q8YcR3vM.html
12-08-2020||India||Chinese envoy says onus ‘not on China’ to resolve border standoff||The onus for resolving the border standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control is “not on China”, the Chinese envoy has said, even as he accused Indian troops of crossing the disputed border and triggering a violent clash on June 15. Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong made the assertions in a signed article in the latest issue of his embassy’s magazine, China-India Review, which was posted online late on Wednesday night. Referring to the June 15 clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties and the issue of resolving the dispute and managing differences, Sun wrote: “If one analyses this incident carefully, it’s quite clear that the onus is not on China. The Indian side crossed the LAC for provocation and attacked the Chinese border troops. “The Indian forces seriously violated agreements on border issues between the two countries and severely violated basic norms governing international relations.” Sun contended the clash was “completely instigated by the Indian side and the responsibility does not lie with the Chinese side”. He reiterated China’s position that the June 15 incident “happened on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and the Indian side crossed the LAC first”, and the “Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the LAC”. Sun’s remarks – which came on the eve of the standoff completing 100 days, as the first clash between the border troops occurred on May 5 – are unlikely to go down well with the Indian government. The external affairs ministry had in June rejected the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s claim of sovereignty over Galwan Valley as “exaggerated and untenable”. And while the Chinese side has sought to convey a picture of progress in the disengagement and de-escalation process along the LAC and even said disengagement has been completed at most points, the Indian side has asserted the procedure is far from complete. India has also called on the Chinese side to deliver on its commitments made during meetings of corps commanders and a conversation between the Special Representatives on the border issue on the issue of disengagement. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the Chinese envoy’s article. Despite India’s assertions in recent weeks that its troops didn’t cross the LAC and that their patrolling had been hampered by Chinese forces since April, the Chinese envoy sought to blame the entire standoff on the Indian side. “The two sides basically have kept the peace for decades. However, since the beginning of this year, the Indian side has continuously built facilities at or crossing the LAC in the Galwan Valley, constantly changing the status quo of ground control,” he wrote. “On May 6, the Indian border troops crossed the LAC in the Galwan Valley by night and trespassed into China’s territory. They resorted to violent means to create a standoff between the two sides and built infrastructures in an attempt to maintain a permanent presence. Second, the Indian side violated the consensus and started provocation, which led to the escalation of the situation,” he added. Sun wrote that at a meeting of the corps commander on June 6, the Indian side “promised that they would not cross the estuary of the Galwan river to patrol and build facilities, and the two sides agreed to build observation posts on either side of the Galwan river mouth”. He alleged that “Indian border troops copped out on the consensus reached in the commander-level meeting” and “again crossed the line for provocations, which triggered the conflict”. “At present, the overall situation in the China-India border areas is stable and controllable. We hope the Indian side meet the Chinese side halfway, avoid taking actions that may complicate the border situation and take concrete actions to maintain stability in the border areas,” Sun wrote. The magazine has several articles giving the Chinese side of the standoff and one that criticises the Indian government’s ban on nearly 60 Chinese-origin mobile phone applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-envoy-says-onus-not-on-china-to-resolve-border-standoff/story-cHgr3Ekgn5er5xH2Q6XfmN.html

The reopening of the temples, which were shut because of the Covid-19 pandemic in March, will coincide with the Malayalam New Year.Officials said Sabarimala’s reopening could lead to a steady stream of devotees from the neighbouring states and affect the ongoing Covid-19 control measures. TDB had earlier planned to allow devotees, who have made online bookings after furnishing Covid-free certificates, to visit the hill shrine. But a large number of inquiries regarding the temple’s reopening forced the TDB to defer the reopening, for now, the officials added.“We are planning to open all temples with Ganapati Homam [special offering for Lord Ganapati] on August 17 [Monday]. The special offering will mark the auspicious occasion. There will be a strict tab on devotees and entry will be restricted under the Covid-19 protocol,” said TDB president N Vasu. He requested the elderly and children under 10 to avoid visiting temples.Vasu said they have suffered an estimated loss of Rs 400 crore due to closure of temples over the last five months.Religious places reopened in June across the country for the first time in over 70 days as the Centre eased the curbs that were imposed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Many temples, churches, and mosques in Kerala deferred reopening in view of a spurt in Covid-19 cases in June. Some churches and mosques were opened on special occasions but temples remained closed. Many temple bodies made provisions for virtual offerings to deal with losses they suffered but failed to attract devotees. TDB was forced to utilise revenue from the Sabarimala temple to fund smaller temples in south Kerala and to pay salaries of its 3,500-odd employees. With Sabarimala’s closure, many temple employees were forced to take salary cuts.At another major shrine, Sree Krishna temple in Guruvayur, the monthly donations collection were anywhere between Rs four to five crore. Besides money, it would often get gold, silver, diamond offerings. Daily pujas also contributed to enough money. Though the temple publicised its online offering, it failed to attract devotees. “With the devotees’ return, we hope the financial position will improve,” said a temple official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dewasom-board-to-reopen-over-1-000-shrines-in-kerala/story-aa6XrrGhn8yWSfG7dS78EO.html

Similarly, Block Development Officers and officials of panchayati raj institutions have been asked to motivate people to voluntarily come forward for testing.Director of Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar, Dr Ajay Parida said the state would now start testing about one lakh samples a day. In the last 24 hours, Odisha tested 32,053 samples of which 23,000 samples were tested through rapid antigen method and 8,000 through RT-PCR method. Currently, the state has the capacity to conduct 8,000-10,000 RT-PCR tests per day.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“Now more emphasis is being laid on rapid antigen tests because you can know the result at the point of care whether one is positive or negative within 4-5 hours. Antigen kits are now available with district hospitals and municipalities. The advantage with rapid antigen kits is that a large number of people can be screened and positive cases can be identified and segregated,” he said.The chief minister said Odisha is one of the few states in the country which is providing universal care for Covid-19 patients completely free of cost. “From testing to treatment to food, transport, accommodation, everything is provided free of cost, and the objective is that because of financial problems nobody should suffer without getting treatment in Odisha,” Patnaik said.The chief minister said those Covid positive patients who will be staying in home isolation, would be provided a kit containing dos and don’ts, few basic medicines and a list of telephone numbers of doctors, counsellors/ tele-medicine professionals and government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-plans-one-lakh-tests-per-day-as-covid-19-cases-cross-50k-mark/story-SUyC1ywqpo8tScwvDwNuHP.html

12-08-2020||India||Kamala Harris’ political views shaped by her Indian mother: Uncle||Kamala Harris’ ability to stick to her principles and her commitment to human rights are two qualities that will stand her in good stead if she and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the US elections, her uncle Gopalan Balachandran said on Wednesday. Balachandran said much of Harris’ views on politics and civil rights were shaped by her strong-willed mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who went against convention by travelling to the US for studies in 1958, and her grandfather, PV Gopalan, who rose from a humble beginning as a stenographer to become a government official who was deputed to Zambia in the 1960s to help with a refugee crisis because of his experience in rehabilitating refugees from Pakistan. In an interview at his home in New Delhi, which was virtually taken over by media crews on Wednesday following the news that Biden had picked Harris as his running mate, the 80-year-old academic who specialises in civil nuclear issues and economics said his strongest impression of his niece was her ability to stand her ground. Referring to Harris’ decision in 2004, when she was serving as district attorney in San Francisco, not to seek the death penalty for the killer of a policeman despite opposition from the police union, Balachandran said: “The ability to stick to her principles and to convince those who opposed her logic to come to her side, that was my strongest impression of her.” Also Read: ‘We have arrived,’ say Indian American after Kamala Harris selectionHarris’ commitment to human rights and justice is largely due to her mother Shyamala, who married Jamaican national Donald Harris after meeting him during the black civil rights movement of the 1960s. Balachandran, who has a PhD in economics and computer science from the University of Wisconsin, said his sister Shyamala was politically active in the US when it was unheard of for Indian-Americans to do so. This commitment to rights issues has been reflected in Harris’ position against India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the situation in Kashmir, Balachandran said, acknowledging that she is unlikely to change her stance even if it upsets those in the corridors of power in New Delhi. “She likes India, obviously her family is Indian but that doesn’t mean she gives a free pass to everything that India does. She will not accept somebody saying, ‘It’s done in India, so why are you stopping it?’ She’ll say, ‘Look it may be India but is something which should not be done, which is against my feelings’,” he added. Also Read: Kamala Harris and her rise | HT EditorialBut Balachandran, who was earlier part of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) and served as a consultant to the Americas division of the external affairs ministry, said he believes India-US relations are too strong to be affected by the views of an individual. “Today there’s nothing in India-US relations that requires presidential or vice presidential intervention at the highest level. These are small things – whether one export control licence should be given to India or not...Both the US administration and Congress are already working on [these issues], all that she has to make sure is the administration follows what they are told to do,” he said. Harris, the first American of Indian and African origin and only the third woman to run for vice president, also has a strong connection to her roots. “Her roots are a combination of things – her mother’s roots are her roots, and her mother’s roots were strongly Indian in one sense and strongly independent in the other sense. [Harris’] roots are strongly influenced by her mother, and through her mother, when she used to come to India, her grandfather and others,” Balachandran said. Asked if Harris had benefited from the progressive and liberal views of her grandfather, PV Gopalan, and grandmother Rajam, Balachandran said: “They just said people are equal, people should do what they want, they should study, you should not force them to do something. So what’s so liberal about it? That’s how you treat human beings.”“[They] didn’t mind the Jamaican son-in-law, a Mexican daughter-in-law, a 19-year-old daughter going abroad to study by herself and taking part in demonstrations in another country.” Balachandran said he had no plans to speak to Harris before the US elections are over, mainly because of concerns that someone in the US could use such a conversation to target her during the campaign. “If I tell her something, [they will say her] uncle is an expert on India-US relations and is advising her. The Indians are interfering in the US,” he said. But he did send a message to Harris after learning that Biden had chosen her as running mate. “I sent her a congratulatory message this morning. I said, ‘Kamala, congratulations. Shyamala would have been very proud.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamala-harris-political-views-shaped-by-her-indian-mother-uncle/story-DHkN8tPAtxTU3npbA2ptyI.html
12-08-2020||India||Minor girl allegedly raped in orphanage five months ago dies in Hyderabad||A 14-year old orphan girl, who was allegedly raped by a man repeatedly at an orphanage in March, died on Wednesday at a government hospital in Hyderabad where she was being treated, police said. Patancheru deputy superintendent of police R Rajeshwar Rao said the ghastly incident happened at an orphanage in Ameenpur on the outskirts of Hyderabad sometime before the enforcement of lockdown in the country in the last week of March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are yet to ascertain the exact period when the sexual assault on the girl had happened,” he said. The prime accused – Venugopal, a donor of the orphanage and two others including, orphanage warder Vijaya and her brother Jayadeep – had already been arrested last month and sent to judicial remand, the DSP said. A case was booked against Venugopal under Sections 376(3), 342, 323, 328, 506 and 109 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 5(l) read with Section 6 of the POCSO Act on July 31. “Now that the girl has died, we are examining the possibility of altering the sections to make it as a rape and murder case,” Rao said. Investigations revealed that the girl was admitted in the orphanage by her uncle in 2015 after both her parents had died in an accident. Venugopal, who used to come to the orphanage frequently, had allegedly assaulted her sexually several times, as a result of which she had developed health complications. After the lockdown, the girl came to her uncle’s place in Bowenpally. When her relatives noticed that she was not keeping well, they took her to a local hospital where the doctors confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted. They lodged a complaint with the local police who later transferred the case to Ameenpur police station. The relatives first admitted her in a juvenile home for girls from where she was taken to Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad in the last week of July. With her condition deteriorating, she was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit and had been kept on a ventilator. She succumbed in the early hours of Wednesday. The police said the girl’s body was handed over to her relatives after autopsy for last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minor-girl-allegedly-raped-in-orphanage-five-months-ago-dies-in-hyderabad/story-oVrl3sqV4axlHnyeKbe2YP.html
12-08-2020||India||Committed to implement Clause 6 of Assam Accord, says Assam govt||The Assam government on Wednesday assured that it is committed to implement the Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord which pertains to safeguards for the preservation and promotion of Assamese identity and heritage. The assurance by the state’s finance, education, health and PWD minister Himanta Biswa Sarma came a day after All Assam Students Union (AASU) made public a high-level committee’s confidential report on the implementation of Clause 6 of the accord. Among other things, the report seeks reservation for Assamese in Parliament, state assembly, local bodies, and regulation of entry of people from other states into Assam. “We are resolved to implement the Clause 6 and are on track. By releasing the report, AASU has created complications. The committee’s report would be tabled in assembly at a future date and it will define and ratify definition of Assamese people,” Sarma said while addressing a press conference. “It is only after the assembly passes a resolution, the matter will go to Centre and implementation process of Clause 6 will begin,” he added. The tripartite accord involving AASU, whose members were a part of the committee, the state government and the Centre was signed in 1985. It was signed after a six-year agitation against illegal immigrants. A 13-member committee headed by justice (Retd) Biplab Kumar Sarma submitted the report to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on February this year. Clarity on who can be called an Assamese was one of the committee’s main tasks as the accord did not clearly define it. The report proposes January 1951 as the cut-off date for any Indian citizen residing in Assam to be defined as an Assamese for the purpose of implementing Clause 6. The report also seeks quotas in government jobs. It also talks about issues related to land and land rights, linguistic, cultural and social rights and protection of the state’s resources and biodiversity Upset at ‘inaction’ by the government on the report even after five months of its submission, AASU made it public on Tuesday. “AASU may be upset at ‘inaction’ of few months, but the committee report itself says that the recommendations are to be implemented within two years after careful scrutiny by a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge as it involves constitutional provisions,” said Sarma. “Since our government is at the end of our tenure and the assembly elections are due in few months, it might be better if the newly elected assembly takes up the issue of ratifying definition of Assamese people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-to-implement-clause-6-of-assam-accord-says-assam-govt/story-2iaX79SCqrRDDIzwWUY4QI.html

12-08-2020||India||Several Naga bodies oppose removal of Nagaland Governor as interlocutor for peace talks||Several prominent Naga groups on Wednesday opposed the removal of Nagaland Governor RN Ravi as the interlocutor for the ongoing peace talks as sought by the Isak-Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM). On Tuesday, the NSCN-IM accused Ravi of creating hurdles in the final agreement of the Naga political issue and sought his removal as interlocutor. “We find no logic to remove Ravi as the interlocutor at this point of time. The formal talks concluded on October 31 last year and we are all waiting for the signing of the final agreement. But NSCN-IM is indulging in delaying tactics now,” said Alezo Venuh, coordinator of the working committee of Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs). The NNPGs are a group of seven Naga outfits and organizations who along with NSCN-IM are also involved in talks with the Centre to sign a final agreement to the Naga issue. “There is no ground to remove Ravi. There is no point going back to square one. Whoever is asking for the interlocutor’s removal doesn’t want a solution, but wants to continue the issue. The talks have been going on for 23 years, the Naga people now want a solution without delay,” said Venuh. In a statement issued on Tuesday NSCN-IM had said the peace process is in a state of “simmering tension” and reaching “tipping point” because of Ravi’s “vitriolic attack” on Naga issue. “The issue is now in the court of Government of India that should come out with an undertaking that Framework Agreement (signed in August 2015) is still alive in its original form and to be handled by somebody other than RN Ravi,” the statement read. The biggest and oldest of the Naga rebel outfits, NSCN-IM had been in peace talks with the central government since 1997 and signed a Framework Agreement (FA) in 2015, which was to be the basis for a final deal on the long pending Naga issue. Though peace talks with NSCN-IM and other pro-talks rebel outfits (Naga National Political Groups-NNPGs) concluded In October, 2019 a formal deal to end the decades old Naga political problem is still awaited. The NSCN-IM’s accusations against Ravi comes at a time when another round of meetings to thrash out a final agreement is set to begin in New Delhi from next week in which senior NSCN-IM and NNPGs leaders are expected to take part. However, the Apex Naga Tribal Hohos of Nagaland (ANTHN), an organization of the 14 major Naga tribes in the state, in a statement issued on Tuesday backed Ravi’s continuance as interlocutor. “The peace process is in the last leg, therefore demanding change of interlocutor at this stage is uncalled for. It is the Centre’s prerogative on who they want to represent it at the talks. We shouldn’t have any problem with that and focus on putting our views across,” said Theja Therieh, executive member of Naga Tribes Council (NTC). Earlier several organizations like Lotha Hoho, Nagaland Gaon Bura Federation and Zeliangrong Baudi had also come out in support of Ravi and opposed demands for his removal as interlocutor. “We have no connection with NSCN-IM’s statement and there is no question of favouring or not favouring removal of Ravi as interlocutor from our side,” said HK Zhimomi, president of Naga Hoho, the apex tribal body of Nagas in Nagaland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/several-naga-bodies-oppose-removal-of-nagaland-governor-as-interlocutor-for-peace-talks/story-Hdw8TJBNAV1jV8mci9RfKP.html
12-08-2020||India||Customs seek details of diplomatic consignments from Kerala protocol officer as gold probe widens||The Customs department on Wednesday asked the Kerala protocol officer to furnish details of diplomatic consignments that arrived at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport in the last few months as part of the probe into the gold smuggling case.Speculation is also rife that state higher education minister K T Jaleel may be grilled to clear the air on the “import of holy books”.As a local arrangement in Kerala, exemption certificates for diplomatic bags are issued by the state protocol officer after obtaining details like weight and country of origin, people aware of the ongoing probe into the gold smuggling case said.After the gold smuggling racket was busted with the seizure of 30 kg of the yellow metal on July 5 from a bag that came in the name of an employee of the United Arab Emirates consulate, Jaleel claimed that the consulate had donated copies of Quran and he took them to his constituency for distribution. But former diplomats and others said no country exports religious books and special permission was needed for such imports also. “Religious books are not imported. If at all it happens, special permission is needed for this,” said former diplomat T P Sreenivasan. Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan also said no such permission was sought. A senior officer of the Customs said a heavy consignment came on March 4 in 30 bags weighing more than 4,000 kg and they were taken to Malappuram in a government vehicle. “We have got some definite information. We are really intrigued about the contents. Investigation is going on the right track,” he said. Jaleel’s number figured prominently in the call lists of the main accused in the smuggling case Swapna Suresh. The minister then addressed a press conference in Malappuram saying he had interacted with her for distribution of Ramzan kits offered by the UAE consulate. He also said he was in touch with her as a “diplomatic staff” but he did not mention the consignment he took to Malappuram.It came to light a week after when Customs and NIA officials questioned employees and a driver of the C-Apt (Kerala Centre for Advanced Printing and Training), a government body under Jaleel’s ministry. After this, the minister admitted he took holy books to his constituency and he was ready for any punishment for this. He also took a swipe at journalists saying “these holy books were not made in gold”. But BJP state president K Surendran said the minister dragged religion into the issue after his alleged role came to light. “His lies are falling one by one. We have information these consignments were unloaded in three places including Bengaluru,” he said. When contacted the minister refused any comments saying he stands by what he had said earlier. Meanwhile Kerala police chief Loknath Behra has directed the state cyber wing to probe bullying of senior Malayalam electronic media journalists including women scribes and submit a report in 24 hours.The Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) had petitioned chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan saying these journalists were targeted and attacked on social media citing their personal life and other details “for taking proactive stand on several issues including the sensational gold smuggling case.” Shockingly, the CM’s Press secretary also posted some comments against electronic media journalists, which many senior journalists alleged triggered such an intense cyber bullying against scribes. When asked about this, the CM evaded a direct reply saying the law was applicable to all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-seek-details-of-diplomatic-consignments-from-kerala-protocol-officer-as-gold-probe-widens/story-TpbQTtLDiMYgUVrGokT64I.html
12-08-2020||India||Jagan Reddy’s scheme for women allows cash transfer, promotes self-reliance||The Jagan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday launched yet another populist scheme – YSR Cheyutha – aimed at promoting entrepreneurship opportunities for women belonging to weaker sections and minorities. Launching the scheme over a video link from his camp office in Tadepalli in Amaravati, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said YSR Cheyutha scheme would ensure self-reliance among women by promoting entrepreneurship. Under this scheme, about 23 lakh women belonging to SC, ST, OBC and Minority communities in the age group of 45-60 years will get a direct cash transfer of Rs 18,750 per year aggregating to Rs 75,000 in four years. The scheme would cost the state government around Rs 17,000 crore. This year, the government had earmarked Rs 4,687 crore. “The amount would be directly transferred into the bank account of mothers and sisters, who are free to spend the same on the activity of their choice,” Jagan said. He pointed out that among 23 lakh beneficiaries, about eight lakh widows and single women in the age group of 45-60 years were already receiving monthly social pensions and they would get additional benefit under YSR Cheyutha. “At present, each such woman is getting Rs 27,000 per year in the form of pensions, at the rate of Rs 2,250 per month. In addition to this, they would receive Rs 18,750 per year under YSR Cheyutha. The total amount comes to Rs 45,750 per annum,” he said. The chief minister said under the YSR Cheyutha scheme, the government would extend marketing and technical assistance to all the beneficiaries. Besides, the government would also facilitate securing loans from banks for their business activities. “The state government has signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with major FMCG giants like Proctor and Gamble, Anand Milk Union Limited (AMUL), Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and India Tobacco Limited (ITC) to strengthen rural economy and the beneficiaries of Cheyutha can be stakeholders in their business,” Jagan said. Beneficiaries from across the state thanked the chief minister through a video conference. They appreciated the government for taking up such initiative, which will help them invest the amount in setting up their own business. The opposition Telugu Desam Party, however, described the YSR Cheyutha scheme as a big fraud played on the women by the Jagan government. Senior TDP lawmaker Nimmala Ramanaidu reminded that in his election manifesto, Jagan had promised to give pensions to the extent of Rs 3,000 per month to women below 45 years of age. “As such, each woman should get Rs 36,000 per year and Rs 1.80 lakh in his five-year tenure. What he is giving now for women between 45 and 60 years is just Rs 18,750 per year. Is it not cheating the innocent women after garnering their votes in the elections?” Ramanaidu asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-s-scheme-for-women-allows-cash-transfer-promotes-self-reliance/story-l42AFN62bOvqhUWUK3gKdO.html

The letter was written by the minister on Tuesday in which he cited that removing some areas from Inner Line restrictions would also help in preventing migration of locals from those areas. The move follows reports of China increasing troop deployment at the border adjoining Uttarakhand amid the tensions between the two sides after the Galwan Valley episode. Maharaj said, “I have written to the Ministry of Home Affairs to remove some areas from the Inner Line including Gartang Gali in Uttarkashi district, Timmersain Mahadev in Chamoli and Om Parvat in Pithoragarh district. These areas presently fall under the Inner Line due to which there are certain restrictions on tourism activities there.” Also Read: India can play a crucial role in easing global strategic reliance on China: British lawmaker“Presently, foreigners are not allowed to visit these areas apart from the limited number of Indian tourists permitted per day. If these areas are removed from the Inner Line, then not only foreign tourists will be allowed there but the number of Indians visiting them will also increase,” said Maharaj. The minister said that a boost in tourism in those border areas will help in their development. “If there is development there, then the locals will stay there and not opt for migration. This in turn will also help in security purposes as the locals could keep an eye on the Chinese activities near the border and inform the security forces,” said Maharaj. He added that the state government was ready to develop various facilities to boost tourism activities in these bordering areas provided Centre grants the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-wants-permit-regime-near-china-border-to-end-for-strategic-reasons/story-9wWbctDzmRYGydK4JpGKSN.html

12-08-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot loyalists return to Jaipur hotel ahead of Rajasthan trust vote||The ruling Congress party in Rajasthan will stick to its plan of holding a floor test in the forthcoming session of the state assembly despite Sachin Pilot and his band of 18 MLAs returning to its fold, party leaders said on Wednesday.The day of the floor test will be decided by the business advisory committee which is expected to meet ThursdayEarlier in the day, the Congress MLAs loyal to chief minister Ashok Gehlot returned to Jaipur’s Fairmont hotel from Jaisalmer. Pilot’s flock of MLAs were, however, not invited to Fairmont Hotel, where the Gehlot loyalists will stay till the assembly session starts on August 14, leaders said.Until two days ago, the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government was facing a majority crisis in the assembly, but the situation now seems to be under control with the return of rebels. A senior Congress leader on condition of anonymity said the fact that although the party earlier had the numbers in its favour, it wasn’t enough to be in a comfortable zone. “The entire political crisis is being witnessed by the public. A message is needed to be sent that the government is safe and promises made will be fulfilled – a floor test would be held for the same,” he said. The leader also said that the BJP’s alleged Operation Lotus that sought to topple the government might be on hold for now but it would return. “A floor test by the government will leave no space for such threats for at least next six months. The BJP used all means such as misuse of ED, IT and CBI and horse trading to destabilize the government. Our objective is to save the democracy and the elected government,” he said.AICC general secretary Avinash Pande said, “I am happy that the Congress members stood united like a family to serve the people. The Opposition was challenging the majority of the government. We want that they only should ask for a floor trust, rest it is for the business advisory committee to decide.” Political analyst Narayan Bareth said Congress wants to take no risk. “The ruling party is still keeping an eye on rebels because they may still not have faith in them. They would also want to convey to the rebels that they aren’t dependent on them. In addition, the floor test will give them a breather for six months.”BJP MLA and spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma said Congress’ agenda for convening the assembly session was to remove the rebel MLAs.“No one is aware of the conditions under which they have returned, but it seems that the government was under pressure from the high command and has accepted them,” Sharma said. He said the fight between Gehlot and Pilot is still on and they are working to show each other down. “The BJP neither asked nor will ask for a floor test. Let them do whatever they want to do – this is their internal issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-loyalists-return-to-jaipur-hotel-ahead-of-rajasthan-trust-vote/story-FKvO8EnuwznJMMlgACfKAL.html

The CM made the announcement while interacting with media persons after a Cabinet meeting. He said Percept Live had sought permission from the Goa government to raise money to combat against the viral scourge and would donate proceeds of its online music festival to the CM’s Relief Fund. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Percept Live is doing a live event and the proceeds of the event will be contributed to the CM’s Relief Fund to combat the Covid-19 pandemic,” the CM said. “It’s an online musical festival for free that is being held in Berlin. The donation is voluntary. The money will come to the CM’s Relief Fund. We don’t need to spend any money. The organisers are doing it to promote Goa and Goa Tourism. The music has been recorded. They only sought our permission for the online fundraiser,” the CM added. Earlier, the Goa government had responded positively to Percept Live’s proposal to organise an online fundraiser event for the CM’s Relief Fund to tackle the Covid-19 menace. The CM also lamented that the state government has received only Rs 6 crore to date from the Central government in its fight against Covid-19, even though it has drawn New Delhi’s attention for more funds. “So far, the Central government has given us only Rs 6 crore. However, we have written to the authorities in New Delhi that we need more money, as our Covid-19 caseload has gone up significantly,” the CM said. Sunburn, an electronic dance music festival, had started in Goa in 2007 and has since grown in both its reach and popularity.The festival has led to the launch of several offshoot festivals at campuses of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other college campuses, including online events, on a global scale. Usually, the annual festival is held in Goa between December 27 and 29. Past events had hosted some of the marquee names from the music industry, including Chainsmokers, Martin Garrix, Jason Derulo, David Guetta, etc, and drew celebrities from across the country to Goa. However, the organisers have had several run-ins with the successive state government over payments and dues, while efforts were on to shift the event to Pune. Several legal cases between the state government and the organisers are still unresolved. Sunburn was also in the news for occasional deaths due to drug overdose. Besides, local residents had frequently complained about inordinate traffic snarls and the litter that were strewn all around the place in the wake of the annual music festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-sunburn-organisers-collaborate-to-raise-money-for-covid-19/story-DhtnSrCib48aS38jzGU3sO.html

The youth also accused Prasad of “clicking his naked photos on his mobile phone and burning him with a cigarette butt inside the police checkpost.” “While beating me up, he clicked my photos while I was naked and threatened to make them viral. He then also forcibly put a cigarette in my mouth against my religious beliefs and lit it up before forcing me to take a drag. Later he took it out of my mouth and burnt my right wrist by stubbing it there,” said the youth. “He then threatened me not to ever call her daughter and not to reveal the incident to anyone while threatening me of dire consequences before letting me go. After reaching home, I however informed my parents and went to hospital for treatment,” he said. Meanwhile IPS Prasad refuted all the allegations of beating the youth and accused him of harassing his daughter over a period of time in his complaint against the youth submitted to deputy inspector general Dehradun. Speaking on the allegations he levelled against the youth, Prasad said, “He is an 18-year-old adult and my daughter is a minor. What is the reason that he befriended her? He has been harassing her since the last few months after which when he called on her number I decided to dig in more about him after smelling a rat.” “To inquire more about him I called him to the police check post where I questioned him on messaging my daughter on social media platforms to which he didn’t give any satisfactory answer. When I questioned him further in a strict manner, he then confessed to have harassed and blackmailed at least seven more minor girls. I also got to know that he is involved in selling drugs and trapping minor girls through it,” said Prasad. He also claimed that the boy was rusticated from his previous school for “beating some classmates and involvement in drugs.” “I had called him to the check-post to question him on these illegal activities after which I let him go on August 10 at 3pm but he reached home at around 7pm. In between that he got the injuries on his body from somebody else to frame allegations that I beat him up,” he said. The youth’s father, however, refuted the allegations made by Prasad and said, “He had already threatened my son and us that he will frame us in wrong case of rape or drug smuggling. His complaint is on that line only which is no surprise to us as all are concocted.” He added, “As far as the claims that my son had been rusticated from his previous school are concerned, we had shifted him from there to another school as the education was not good there. He is at present in class 11 after passing class 10 with distinction marks.” He also informed that on Wednesday, he submitted a complaint against Prasad in the state human rights commission also. “We have urged the commission to take cognisance of the brutality and direct appropriate action. We are afraid that he will harm my son and us because of which we lodged a complaint against him asking the police leadership to save us from him.” Confirming the incident, DG (law & order) Ashok Kumar said, “Police have received both the complaints which have been forwarded to Dehradun district police concerned for a probe.” Also Read: Patients protest lack of facilities, substandard food at Uttarakhand Covid care centreThe deputy inspector general Dehradun, Arun Mohan Joshi said, “We have received the complaints from both the sides and are inquiring about the allegations leveled by both against each other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-youth-says-senior-ips-officer-tortured-and-stripped-him-probe-ordered/story-2YpVD4ecGxDXnKNoMb0TzJ.html
12-08-2020||India||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot may seek trust vote, will allow time to reset ties||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot is likely to seek a trust vote despite the rebel legislators returning to the Congress as the move will give a breather of six months to the party to set its house in order, people familiar with the development said.While the chief minister told HT that the decision on the floor test will be taken once the assembly session starts on August 14, a Congress leader said the move is unavoidable as the party cannot keep its legislators lodged in hotels forever.The party’s two central observers – Randeep Singh Surjewala and Ajay Maken – have also been camping in the state for the past one month since July 12.With 19 rebel legislators returning to the party fold, the Congress has a comfortable majority in the 200-member assembly. Congress leaders claim that the party enjoys the backing of 125 legislators, including independents, and other supporting parties.“No doubt, floor test is the only solution and we can go for it at any opportune time. We will prove our majority on the floor of the House,” said the leader on condition of anonymity.“We will get a breather of six months to address all the issues raised by party leaders and legislators from both sides,” he further said, referring to both the Gehlot and Sachin Pilot camps.Also, the three-member All India Congress Committee (AICC) panel formed to look into grievances of rebel legislators will submit its report by then, the leader quoted above added.Another Congress functionary monitoring the party developments in Rajasthan said the government can move the trust vote anytime in the assembly. He said the strategy for the session will be finalised on Thursday. The legislators, who were shifted to Jaisalmer on July 31, were back in Jaipur on Wednesday.But the legislators backing Gehlot displayed their anger and resentment at the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting at Jaisalmer on Tuesday over the “amicable resolution” of the crisis and return of Pilot and his supporters to the party fold.As many as 70 of the 100 legislators were vocal against Pilot, questioning how could the Congress take the rebels back after they tried to topple the government, a party leader present in the meeting said.“Who paid the fee of senior lawyers Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi? Who paid the bills of the hotel where rebel Congress legislators stayed? Why did the BJP government in Haryana and the 1,100 state police personnel protect the Congress legislators?” were some of the questions raised at the CLP meeting, according to this leader.Gehlot told reporters on Wednesday that it was natural for these legislators to be upset and that they have to bear in the interest of the people of the state.“It is natural for them to be upset. The way this episode happened, they had to stay in hotels. But I told them that in the interest of the country, state, its people and for saving democracy, sometimes we have to bear,” he said.“We will work together and our colleagues who had gone have also returned and I hope that all will work together after settling the complaints and grievances,” the chief minister said, referring to the rebel legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-may-seek-trust-vote-will-allow-time-to-reset-ties/story-3t6h8QUmEh4jZSQFstVeFI.html

Therefore any qualification obtained from medical colleges located within these illegally occupied areas of India shall not entitle a person for grant of registration under Indian Medical Council Act 1956 to practice Modern Medicine in India,” the IMA notification dated August 10 states.The act stipulates that the medical qualifications granted by any university or medical institution in India which are included in the First Schedule shall be recognised medical qualifications for the purposes of the act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-professionals-from-pakistan-occupied-territory-can-t-practice-in-india-mci/story-AFXcQAOxdaVNPFNnfaAyjO.html
12-08-2020||India||Parth is immature, don’t give any importance to what he says: Sharad Pawar||Sharad Pawar, the president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), appears to be miffed with his grand-nephew Parth Pawar, the son of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, as he described him “immature”. The veteran politician was reacting to Parth’s demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the death of actor Sushant Singh, who had died by suicide at his Bandra apartment on June 14. His statement also sparked off speculations about differences within the Pawar clan, which had seen open revolt by Ajit and a few other NCP lawmakers last November. They had got together with the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and had hurriedly cobbled together a Maharashtra government that barely lasted for 80 hours, as most NCP legislators, who were loyal to the party chief, refused to side with the rebel faction. “I give no importance to what my grand-nephew says. He is immature. I have 100% trust in Maharashtra and Mumbai Police,” Pawar told media persons at the YB Chavan Centre on Wednesday. He, however, added that there is no reason to oppose the CBI investigation. “But, if someone still wants a CBI probe, then there is no reason to oppose it,” he said. On July 27, Parth had met the state home minister, Anil Deshmukh, who is also from the NCP, and demanded a CBI investigation in the Rajput death case. Parth’s demand was contrary to the stand taken by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition government, in which NCP is one of the partners along with the Shiv Sena and the Congress. Earlier, the state government had handed over the probe to the Mumbai Police. “With the whole country, especially youth, seeking a proper investigation into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, I urged Anil Deshmukh to take national emotions into consideration and initiate a CBI investigation,” Parth had tweeted in which he had also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amir Shah. Parth had contested last year’s Lok Sabha election from Maval constituency in Maharashtra against the wishes of the NCP chief. However, he had lost the parliamentary election to a Shiv Sena-BJP candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parth-is-immature-don-t-give-any-importance-to-what-he-says-sharad-pawar/story-JMpXglI5kelu70nJvJnCxI.html

12-08-2020||India||Goa cuts red tape for telecom towers to address poor connectivity concerns||The permission of local bodies -- be it panchayats or municipal bodies -- will no longer be mandatory for telecom infrastructure companies to set up towers in Goa, according to a new Goa Telecom Infrastructure Policy, 2020 that was approved by the state cabinet on Wednesday. The decision to streamline the processes for setting up towers in the state was made in a bid to improve connectivity, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said. “The major change is that the permissions from local bodies will no longer be needed. But a one-time payment of Rs 50,000 will be given to the local body as a licence fee. In urban and semi urban areas it is Rs 50,000 monthly rent for the operators and in rural areas it is half of that,” Sawant said. “If it is in a private property, they will need the permission from the land owner and can then approach the government for permissions,” Sawant said. The need for a permission from the local body was holding up the installation of towers, Sawant said adding that the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the state’s poor connectivity and has sent children scurrying up hills, treetops, roofs of houses, etc in the search of connectivity. However, owing to opposition from residents, panchayats and municipal bodies have been slow in processing permissions for setting up the towers with around 300 tower permissions pending for permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cuts-red-tape-for-telecom-towers-to-address-poor-connectivity-concerns/story-R2Ckthi3uXfvIljXrMlriN.html

12-08-2020||India||Monsoon strengthens over northwest India but Delhi remains largely dry||There is a moderate risk of flash floods in many parts of Uttarakhand, including Bageshwar, Rudraprayag and Chamoli districts, as monsoon strengthens over northwest India, according to Central Water Commission’s (CWC) flood warning. Eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP) has recorded extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), on Tuesday along with very heavy rains reported over Uttarakhand, Haryana, eastern Madhya Pradesh (MP), eastern Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat, but only very light rain over Delhi. Delhi has a 35% of rain deficiency to date. “Most parts of north-west India have started recorded very heavy rains, except for Delhi, since Sunday (August 9). But the region is getting moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. The monsoon trough (line of low pressure) is to the north of its normal position (from Ganganagar to the Bay of Bengal). So, rains are expected during the next two-three days. A low-pressure area is also developing over the north-west Bay of Bengal, which will bring good rains to central India and extremely heavy rains to Gujarat,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC). When a low-pressure area had developed over the Bay of Bengal, the Konkan region had recorded severe rains, but this time Gujarat will record the impact of the low-pressure area, which is likely to develop on Thursday, Sathi Devi said. A north-south trough runs from Bihar to the west-central Bay of Bengal in lower tropospheric levels. A cyclonic circulation lies over the north-west and adjoining the west-central Bay of Bengal off the Odisha-north Andhra Pradesh coasts, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its bulletin on Wednesday. Under the influence of the two systems, a low-pressure area is likely to form over the north-west Bay of Bengal by Thursday. It is likely to persist over the region and become more organised over the north Bay of Bengal during the next two-three days. The western part of the monsoon trough has shifted to the north of its normal position and it is likely to remain there during the next 48 hours. The eastern part of it is in its near-normal position. Due to these favourable conditions widespread and very heavy rain is likely over major parts of northwest India (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, UP) during the next two-three days. Extremely heavy rain is also likely over Gujarat and eastern Rajasthan and heavy to very heavy rain over northern parts of Konkan and Goa between Thursday and Saturday (August 13 to 15). As on Tuesday, 20 Stations (13 in Bihar, three in Uttar Pradesh, two in Assam and one each in Jharkhand and West Bengal) are flowing in a severe flood situation and 36 stations (13 in Bihar, 10 in Assam, five in Uttar Pradesh, three in Kerala, two in Uttarakhand and one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal) are flowing above normal flood situation. Severe flood is declared, when the water level is touching or exceeding the danger level but below the highest flood level (HFL). Monsoon rain until Wednesday over the country had 0% deficiency. But there is 22% and 2% rain deficiency over northwest India and central India, respectively; and 23% and 8% excess rainfall over the southern peninsula and eastern and north-east India, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-strengthens-over-northwest-india-but-delhi-remains-largely-dry/story-ZopycxLn5EpVZFS9MUArCM.html

The foreign office rejected suggestions that the minister’s statement was against diplomatic norms.Foreign minister Qureshi has since then twice called a press conference to offer a clarification but later cancelled the invites. In Islamabad, the cancelled news conferences were seen to reflect the government’s assessment that a mere clarification wasn’t going to be enough to put relations between the two countries back on track.There has been no official announcement about Gen Bajwa’s visit yet.Gen Bajwa did, however, meet Saudi Ambassador Admiral Nawaf Bin Said Al-Maliki on Monday to discuss what the army had then described as “matters of mutual interest, regional security situation and bilateral defence relations”.The newspaper, quoting diplomatic sources, suggested the visit had raised hopes in Islamabad that the recent “misunderstanding” would be resolved soon.It is a tough task, given how Saudi Arabia had called in a $ 1 billion loan extended at Imran Khan’s request to bail out the economy in 2018. The Saudi package entailed $3 billion in loans and a $3.2 billion oil credit facility, according to Asian Nikkei Review. The oil credit facility was suspended in May and the Saudis later asked Pakistan to repay the loan in full. Pakistan repaid the $ 1 billion loan, borrowing from its “iron brother” China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imran-khan-govt-s-warning-backfires-sends-army-chief-to-firefight-in-saudi-report/story-VMCt4Da56OLJmH8qL4RdeL.html

The incident occurred at a healthcare centre, located at Sonaimuri village in Tripura’s Unakoti district, where the baby, who is now out of danger, was taken for polio vaccination on Tuesday. The village is located around 133 kilometres (km) away from the state capital, Agartala. A complaint was registered at Kumarghat police station, under whose jurisdiction the Sonaimuri village falls, against the ASHA worker Pushpa Das, who had given water to the baby. The police said a woman took her baby to the health centre on Tuesday for polio vaccination. After the vaccination, the woman asked Das for water to quench her baby’s thirst. Das handed over a bottle of water to the woman to make him drink water. The baby started feeling unwell after drinking the water and had to be taken to a hospital. Later, it was revealed that the bottle contained water mixed with hand sanitiser. “We took a general diary on the basis of the woman’s complaint on Tuesday evening.

The raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has led the park to be closed to visitors since the viral outbreak was initially reported in end-March. Royal Bengal tigers’ population in the park has grown to seven following the birth of the three cubs. “The cubs were born between 4.45 am and 7.20 am. The cubs’ gender is yet to be ascertained, as we cannot go close to Sheela right now,” said Dharamdeo Rai, director, Bengal Safari. In May 2018, Sheela had given birth to three cubs and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had named them Rika, Kika, and Ika. Unfortunately, Ika did not survive. Sheela and her mate Viban were brought to the park from Nandankanan Zoological Park in Bhubaneswar. Bengal Safari authorities are yet to take a call whether they will name the cubs or wait for CM Banerjee’s next visit to north Bengal. The park, which was inaugurated by CM Banerjee in January 2016, is located on the outskirts of Siliguri and is close to Mahananda Wild Life Sanctuary in Jalpaiguri district. Spread over 297 hectares, Bengal Safari is home to leopards, one-horned rhino, Himalayan black bear, elephants, gharials, deer, among other animals; and has proved to be a crowd-puller. The CM’s dream project has an aviary, a nature interpretation centre and a watchtower has also been recently set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-tigress-gives-birth-to-three-cubs-at-bengal-safari-in-siliguri/story-tcMnxoJjkyrGBa0X3X69KL.html

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, S K Singh said that circle officer Deeksha would lead the SIT which includes two inspectors and a station house officer (SHO). “The SIT has been directed to probe the case from all angles,” he said. Sudeeksha, who was from Dadri town in Gautam Buddha Nagar district, was a meritorious student who topped the district in Class 12 in 2018 and received scholarship to pursue further studies in the US. She had returned from the US in June due to the coronavirus pandemic and was due to depart on August 20 to rejoin her college. She had gone to meet her maternal uncle in Bulandshahr with her brother Nigam Bhati when their motorbike rammed into another motorcycle moving ahead of them. Sudeeksha died on the spot and later her family members blamed the youths on the other motorcycle for harassing her on the road which led to the accident. SSP Singh said that an extensive exercise was being carried out to identify the other bikes and the riders at the time of the accident. “We don’t have the complete number of the motorcycle and we are trying to locate all Bullet motorcycles in the area with the help of the regional transport office”, he said. He, however, held the media responsible for giving undue hype to a “simple accident case”. He said an eyewitness of the accident Hemant Sharma had told the police that the rider of a Bullet motorcycle braked to protect himself and his pillion rider from colliding with a milk tanker coming from the opposite side. Sudeeksha’s brother lost control over his bike and it rammed into the Bullet motorcycle.Singh said that Sudheeksha’s brother used Hemant’s phone to inform his family in Noida about the accident and it was Hemant who informed the police. “But nobody seems interested in knowing the facts,” said Singh, adding that the SIT would bring out the truth by investigating the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-to-probe-bulandshahr-topper-s-death-in-accident/story-E1mevAPtUH04uLzrwmW2WO.html
12-08-2020||India||India can play a crucial role in easing global strategic reliance on China: British lawmaker||India could play a crucial role in reversing the alarming strategic dependence of the world’s democracies on China, which has made no secret of its ambition to emerge as an unrivalled global power by the middle of the century, says Iain Duncan Smith, an influential British lawmaker with the ruling Conservative party.Sir Iain, a former leader of the Conservative party, pointed out that authoritarian China, under its leader Xi Jinping, has made no secret about its ambition to dominate the globe.“The Chinese government has become even more dictatorial and intolerant in the last few years under President Xi and as far as I can make out by what he has said and by their behaviour, that his government’s plan is that by 2040 or thereabouts, China wishes to be the world’s biggest economy possessing the world’s largest and most powerful military. Those things are what they said they wish to be, and everything else feeds into that,” he said.During his keynote speech at the 19th party congress in October 2017, Xi had declared what is called the “twin centenary” goals. By 2020, he announced, China would eliminate poverty and become a “moderately prosperous society”. By the middle of the century, in tune with the centenary celebrations of the formation of People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China would emerge as the most advanced nation in the world, exercising leadership in all spheres.Sir Iain highlighted that China has been quite open about airing its lofty global aspirations as its historic mission. “China’s ambition is to restore itself, as I believe, to its natural place, which is the most dominant nation in the world. This a consistent idea about China’s rightful place and all these countries around it end up offering China suzerainty. They are formally independent nations that are dependent on China. And I think this whole exercise in the South China Sea, where they have occupied territory to which they have no right to, and where they are now building military stations on these man-made islands are part of this grand project.”On several occasions, Xi has flagged the “great rejuvenation” of his country as his strategic goal, which has been widely attributed as an aspiration to establish a 21st century the Middle Kingdom. “The fact that the Chinese regard themselves as superior to the rest of the human race, and that this belief has a racial component, will confront the rest of the world with a serious problem,” predicted Martin Jacques, the author of the 2009 bestseller, “When China Rules the World: The Rise of the Middle Kingdom and the End of the Western World.” China has established linkages in “strategic areas” which have made the “free world” structurally dependent on Beijing, Sir Iain observed.“Let us take the case of telecommunications. Telecommunications has to be secured from the top to bottom. You can’t be half-secure. You can’t tolerate what is deemed as an untrusted vendor in your system. For example, the government has now agreed that they will remove Huawei, but they are going to take their time to do that. We need to speed that up.”The British politician also cited nuclear energy as an area where the dependence of China was likely to be harmful.“China is already heavily involved in one nuclear plant (in the United Kingdom), about to be involved in another and they are bidding for a third. My answer is -we should review this because this is nuclear technology and it is possible that during a moment of dispute, China is able to shut down these plants and we are unable to start it.”Sir Iain also pointed to “new growth areas” such as electric cars where dependence on China was likely to limit freedom of choice of the “free world”.“Then you got the other area where the new growth area as in electric vehicles, and these are battery-powered vehicles. But who is the biggest producer of batteries in the world--it is China.”“The other area is rare earth materials that have to be mined. China controls 95 per cent of these mines, many of them in Congo, with several of them employing young children, which is a disgrace. But anyway they own it. So if you see strategically, the Chinese government controls all the key areas that the free world would need anyway.”In a recent article that he wrote in the Telegraph newspaper, Sir Iain explained that rare earth metals are critical to a range of devices including smartphones, computers, LEDs, catalytic converters, electricity generation and storage, and the batteries required by electric vehicles. They are also essential in several defence applications, including radar, the guidance systems of missiles and laser rangefinders. Apart from controlling the world supply of rare-earth metals, China also controls the majority of the global processing capacity.“So all this gives you an indication of how they are playing the game, and we are blind; we are simply not prepared or haven’t been prepared to look upon this in strategic terms, and now we have to change, strategically review this if necessary.”India can play a major role in mounting a riposte to eliminate critical dependence on China, Sir Iain observed. For instance, New Delhi can join the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC)--co-chaired by Sir Iain with partner democracies, including the US, Japan, Australia and Canada.“We now I think have 17 countries on board. We are hoping that in the next few days, we will have India join, which is very important. IPAC is made up of people on the Left and the Right. All of them are parliamentarians like myself. And we agree that we need to look at China in a strategic way. So we as a unit all agree to call upon our governments to have a strategic review of our dependency on China.”Besides, focusing on human rights, IPAC has been compiling documents “that prove that Chinese officials have been involved directly in the sterilisation of Uyghur women in Xinjiang, and the full incarceration of these people, literally to obliterate the concept of Uyghurs within China”.Sir Iain stressed that China under Xi “breaks every rule in the book..whether it is the terrible treatment of Christians, of Falun Gong or whether it is the takeover of the South China Sea, even though the UN has told him, that he has no right to that, engages in border disputes with India, threatens Taiwan, and then through the Belt and the Road Initiative (BRI) brings much of the developing world to his orbit and under his control.”.The British lawmaker highlighted that the solution to countering Chinese aggressive behaviour and dependency partly lies with India.“One of my observations to British universities, for example, is, look, you have become addicted to Chinese students. But there is another country that would love to have the same kind of linkage when it comes to opening your doors, and that is India. Let us open our doors, and then you would not need this kind of money that comes from China.”On the geopolitical plain, India offers a “wonderful counterbalance” to China in the region, Sir Iain observed.“India can show some leadership in the area, and in the south china sea as well as part of that process, having a good relationship with democracies such as Australia, the US and the UK. All this could be the way that you could counter this aggressive behaviour of China. We need to urgently establish a comprehensive strategic dialogue with India to think this through.”Asked if Britain would like to join the security-oriented Indo-Pacific quad--the four-nation group of India, US, Japan and Australia, Sir Iain said: “I would love us to join that. That would be the perfect outcome.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-play-a-crucial-role-in-easing-global-strategic-reliance-on-china-says-british-lawmaker/story-IplNb1yK8CTGBFLbcVZnWN.html

An FIR has been registered against seven residents of Gochoni village of the district under MP Cow Progeny Slaughter Prevention Act and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The accused include Asharam Lodhi, Brijesh Lodhi, Nathuram Lodhi and four others who are absconding, said police. Shivpuri collector Anugraha P ordered an inquiry in the matter. Also read: Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 recovery rate touches 75%, says CM ChouhanShivpuri superintendent of police (SP), Rajesh Chandel said, “On Tuesday late evening, a watchman (chowkidar) of Gochoni village informed the police at Himmatpur outpost about a foul smell coming from a room in an abandoned building in the village. When the police personnel reached the place and broke open the room, as many as 12 cows were found in an unconscious state.” “The police team called a team of veterinary doctors and they informed that six cows had died. The remaining six were moved to a veterinary hospital,” he added. “In the investigation, it was found that Asharam Lodhi, Brijesh Lodhi and Nathuram Lodhi with four others locked the cows in the room which had no ventilation. They locked the cows animals on Sunday to protect their crops from the animals. They didn’t even provide any food or water to the cows which resulted in the death of the six of them,” he added. “Police are investigating the matter and trying to nab the accused,” said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locked-in-a-room-six-cows-starve-to-death-in-madhya-pradesh/story-C6XvuVQD7nYLM6Bnrkru8L.html
12-08-2020||India||Sushant was not as famous during his lifetime as after death: Majeed Memon||Majeed Memon, a former Rajya Sabha (RS) member of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), triggered a row on Wednesday, when he said that the later actor Sushant Singh Rajput found more fame after his death by suicide than while he was alive. He said Rajput is grabbing the headlines more than, perhaps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi or US President Donald Trump. The NCP quickly distanced itself from Memon’s statement and said it was his personal opinion. The party did not support the statement. Memon also clarified that his statement should not be misinterpreted, as he, too, sought justice for the late and popular actor. “Rajput was not as famous during his lifetime as he is after his death. The space in the media he is occupying nowadays is, perhaps, more than our PM or President of US!” Memon said in a series of tweets on Wednesday afternoon. “When a crime is at an investigation stage, secrecy has to be maintained. Publicising every development in the process of collecting vital evidence adversely affects the interest of truth and justice,” he further tweeted, while criticising a section of media for their disproportionate coverage of Rajput’s death. “The statement made by Majeed Memon on Twitter is his personal opinion and not of the NCP. Our party does not endorse or support his statement in any form or manner. He is not a spokesperson of the NCP, which must be noted by all,” said Nawab Malik, spokesperson, NCP, and the minister for minority affairs minister, Maharashtra. “There is so much noise on my tweet on Rajput. Does it mean that Rajput was not popular during his lifetime or that he should not get justice? Certainly not. Misinterpretation should be avoided. The tweet does not in any way insults or belittle him,” the ex-RS member clarified through another tweet. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing the death of Rajput, who was found dead at his Bandra apartment on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-was-not-as-famous-during-his-lifetime-as-after-death-majeed-memon/story-fbDNtRlfXhtxIuvGuWhEOM.html

Horse-trading politics of BJP has been defeated,” PTI quoted Chowdhury as saying.For over a month, Gehlot had consistently accused the opposition BJP of horse-trading in an attempt to bring down his government. The Congress has put up a united front after Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra ensured that differences between Pilot and Gehlot did not worsen.On Wednesday, Gehlot extended an olive branch to Pilot saying that those who had gone away from the party are finally back and that he hoped to work together for the benefit of the state although it was natural for MLAs to be upset at the chain of events over the past month. Pilot, who returned to Jaipur on Tuesday, said he has not demanded any post from the party but underlined that there should be no vendetta against MLAs who supported him on a range of issues.The patch up has boosted the ruling Congress party ahead of an Assembly session on August 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-horse-trading-politics-defeated-in-rajasthan-says-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury/story-AVNHSoeUcWOYCDxuBtS8ZN.html
12-08-2020||India||Kerala shrines under Devaswom Board to open next week; Sabarimala stays shut||The empty coffers and clamour from devotees and employees has forced major shrine boards in Kerala to open doors of temples shut since the lockdown in March. The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which runs 1000-odd temples in south Kerala, has decided to open all shrines under its control from August 17, Malayalam New Year Day, except Sabarimala hill temple.The TDB feels that if Sabarimala temple is opened there will be a steady stream of devotees from neighbouring states and it will affect the ongoing Covid-19 control measures so it deferred its decision on the hill temple. Earlier it planned ‘darshan’ for devotees who made online booking after furnishing Covid-free certificates, but excess enquiries forced the TDB to defer it for now. “We are planning to open all temples with ‘Ganapati Homam’ (special offering for Lord Ganapati) on August 17. The special offering will mark the auspicious occasion. There will be a strict tab on devotees and entry will be restricted under Covid protocol,” said TDB president N Vasu, requesting elders and children below 10 years to wait for some more time. He said there is an estimated loss of Rs 400 crore due to closure of temples in the last five months.Though the Union Government had eased restrictions on religious places in May, many temples, churches and mosques deferred opening in view of big spurt in virus cases in June first week. Some churches and mosques were opened on special occasions but temples remained closed.After lockdown drained its coffers badly, many temple bodies took the e-route to bolster their financial health but virtual offerings failed to catch up with devotees, statistics show. Revenue of Sabarimala was used to fund smaller temples in south Kerala and for salaries of 3,500-odd employees of the TDB. But after Sabarimala’s closure, many temple employees were forced to suffer salary cuts. In another major shrine, Sree Krishna temple in Guruvayur, the hundi (donation box) collection every month was anywhere between Rs 4 crore and five crore. Besides currency, it often used to get gold, silver and at times diamond and daily poojas also contributed enough money to coffers. Despite big publicity to online offerings, it failed to attract devotees. “With devotees’ return, we hope our financial position will improve,” said a senior temple official. The church, which runs many educational institutions, hospitals, and other establishments, also suffered. Most of the institutions are directly linked to chapels and are finding it difficult to maintain upkeep costs and salaries of the people engaged. After the lockdown, the government had halted admissions and interviews in educational institutions. They also introduced virtual offerings to tide over the crunch situation but failed to attract believers. Now some churches and mosques are functioning with restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-shrines-under-devaswom-board-to-open-next-week-sabarimala-stays-shut/story-JEVbmPBvmXEdtpGPz3u0IJ.html

Madan Kaushik, minister for urban development in the state has asked officials to make a detailed plan regarding the setting up of six plants where electricity can be generated from solid waste in the state. These plants will be set up in Roorkee, Rudrapur, Kashipur, Haldwani, Rishikesh and Kotdwar. “A biogas plant should be set up with the help of the Indian Oil Corporation in Haridwar and a waste-to-energy plant in Roorkee. An action plan should be prepared for the upcoming plants in Haldwani, Kashipur, Rishikesh, Rudrapur and Kotdwar. Along with making the action plan, monitoring should be done in all the municipal bodies for proper waste segregation, making compost, and other activities for proper solid waste management,” said the minister. Also read: Patients protest lack of facilities, substandard food at Uttarakhand Covid care centreHe further said that urban local bodies should sell waste to concerned departments after segregation. “After the segregation of waste, urban local bodies should get income by selling material to the Agriculture Department and Horticulture Department for making compost. The money received by the 14th Finance Commission will be spent in Solid Waste Management until 100% door-to-door collection and source segmentation is done,” said Kaushik. As per the records of the pollution control board, around 300 megawatts of electricity can be generated from the waste generated in the state. According to the latest State of Environment Report released by Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board, “It is estimated that about 900 metric tonnes/day solid waste is being generated from the urban local bodies in Uttarakhand. Currently, two waste management plants are working in Haridwar (Sarai) out of which about 50% of waste is being lifted and dumped at unidentified locations.” The report further states that “No urban local body has defined collection, segregation, transportation and disposal mechanisms to comply with the Municipal Solid Wastes Rules, 2000.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-starts-process-of-setting-up-six-plants-for-generating-electricity-from-solid-waste/story-m2QRWvVSdD9Sui7p3xXITP.html

Hospitals can levy charge on the 20% beds as per their own policy. As far as 80% of beds are concerned, they are to be charged as per the government policy,” Mundhe was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Complaints of private hospitals overcharging patients for Covid-19 treatment have been reported from several states including Maharashtra. The Central government was the first to appoint a committee to fix costs at government and private hospitals for Covid-19 testing and treatment. Several states including Maharashtra followed suit and set up price bands to prevent profiteering in times of crisis. Also Read: Navi Mumbai chief warns hospitals not to overcharge Covid patientsNagpur commissioner said strict action will be taken if hospitals violated rules.Earlier in May, the state government’s health department had issued directives restricting private hospitals from charging more than up to Rs 4,000 per day for a general bed; Rs 7,500 per day in the intensive care unit (ICU); and Rs 9,000 per day for treatment with a ventilator facility. The charges also include meals for patients. The regulations make it mandatory for all private hospitals to follow the rules laid down by the state government during a pandemic, according to the Epidemic Diseases Act.Restrictions also apply on the billing of medicines at these facilities apart from consultancy fees of doctors along with other expenses.Also Read: Patients protest lack of facilities, substandard food at Uttarakhand Covid care centreThe price capping was done after several incidents of exorbitant billing by private hospitals was reported from across the state including a case when a Covid-positive patient had to pay Rs 16 lakh for a 15-day stay in a private hospital and cases when people had to take loans to pay private hospitals bills.Private hospitals like Nanavati Hospital were found to be charging Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,800 per personal protective equipment (PPE) even though the cost of PPEs were much less.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagpur-private-hospitals-ordered-to-refund-excess-fee-charged-for-covid-19-treatment/story-M7BzBDx67sj7haSZDTWknO.html
12-08-2020||India||IAF objects to ‘negative portrayal’ of work culture in Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl||The Indian Air Force (IAF) has objected to the portrayal of its work culture in Dharma Production’s soon to be released movie Gunjan Saxena…The Kargil Girl. In its letter to Dharma Production, Netflix and the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), IAF said certain scenes and dialogues in the movie and trailer, which were forwarded to it for viewing, were found to “portray the IAF in an undue negative light”. According to an initial understanding, Dharma Production had agreed to represent IAF with authenticity and make all efforts to ensure the film helps to inspire the next generation of IAF officers. The movie’s trailer was released recently on the over the top (OTT) platform, IAF said in its letter. IAF said according to its information, the movie is being released on Wednesday. “In the aim to glorify the screen character of ‘Ex-Flt Lt Gunjan Saxena’, M/s Dharma Productions presented some situations that are misleading and portray an inappropriate work culture, especially against women in the IAF,” the letter said. It added IAF as a service has always ensured the organisation is gender neutral and provided equal opportunities to male and women personnel. IAF has also provided a summary of scenes and dialogues that it considers objectionable and an incorrect presentation of the gender bias. The letter said the production house was informed about the objectionable portions of the movie and advised to delete or modify these. Also read | Gunjan Saxena The Kargil Girl movie review: Janhvi Kapoor busts boys locker room in new Netflix film“However, the production house has not deleted the scenes but had proposed a media plan in the run up to the release and inserting a disclaimer in the movie,” the letter said, adding IAF considers these measures inadequate. CBFC does not regulate OTT platforms such as Netflix even though the information and broadcasting ministry is working to prepare a regulatory framework for them. The Centre has been looking at self-regulatory mechanisms for these platforms. Last month, the defence ministry wrote a letter to CBFC, Mumbai, drawing attention to producers of movies and web series distorting the image of the Indian Army and said they should obtain a no-objection certificate from the ministry before airing their movies or shows. The headcount of women in the armed forces is upwards of 3,300, including 1,300 in IAF, but combat roles were off limits to them until IAF took the lead in crushing internal resistance to grant them equal opportunities in 2015, when they became eligible for the fighter stream. Warships, tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992. The army is currently in the process of granting permanent commission to short service commissioned women following a Supreme Court verdict. In February, the Supreme Court ruled women should be considered for command roles and all women officers are entitled to permanent commission. It asked the army to give them permanent commission within three months in a major boost to gender parity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-objects-to-undue-negative-portrayal-of-work-culture-in-movie-gunjan-saxena-the-kargil-girl/story-fB2XQQj5lDWma0b7VU9ZtJ.html

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, against whom Pilot had rebelled, is also making conciliatory gestures promising to listen to the grievances that the Pilot camp had.The breakthrough came after Pilot met with the Congress top brass, including former party president Rahul Gandhi and his sister and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.It was Priyanka who finally found a middle ground between Gehlot and Pilot. But the latter’s return is not without a political gameplan.According to Hindustan Times’ sister publication Hindustan, Congress felt Pilot’s need not just for elections in Rajasthan but Lok Sabha polls too. Also, Priyanka is preparing the ground for 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. At least 55 seats in the state are dominated by the Gujjar community, where Pilot holds considerable sway. If Pilot had quit the Congress, the party would have suffered in these pockets.Apart from this, the community can also decide the fortunes of the elections in 14 seats in Madhya Pradesh. And if their numbers are included in Haryana, Delhi and other parts of northern India, Gujjars are in a strong position in many constituencies.One of the reasons for Congress’ win in Rajasthan in the 2018 Assembly elections was the support it got from Gujjars who constitute seven per cent of the votebank. When Priyanka realised Pilot’s hold on the community - not just in Rajasthan but the entire country - she immediately got down to ironing out the differences between him and Gehlot reported Hindustan.Another important thing which worked in Pilot’s favour was the pressure being built from the young brigade of the Congress. According to Hindustan, young leaders like Deepender Hooda and Jitendra Singh told the top leaders of the party that Pilot’s ouster could lead to exodus of young leaders from Congress.The Abdullah family from Jammu and Kashmir also played a crucial role in dousing the fire, Hindustan reported. Farooq Abdullah and son Omar, who have good relations with the Gandhi family, started lobbying for Pilot through Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ahmed Patel and the efforts soon bore fruit.Also, a section within the Congress is not happy with Gehlot. When he was a general secretary and based in Delhi, many of his ‘victims’ from that time conveyed to the Gandhis that too much reliance on Gehlot could cost Congress a lot in Rajasthan, according to Hindustan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-peace-deal-done-4-big-reasons-why-congress-brought-sachin-pilot-back-into-the-fold/story-Sqy0MW4RESTY9wbYKXOVOL.html
12-08-2020||India||Chhattisgarh court refuses to hand over Jheeram attack conspiracy case to NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Jagdalpur has declined to hand over the FIR lodged by a Congress leader in Bastar seeking a probe in the alleged conspiracy behind the Jheeram Valley attack to the NIA, for which the agency had moved an application in June. The court ruled that the case will be investigated by the state police. However, NIA’s counsel said that the agency will move the state high court challenging the order of Jagdalpur sessions court. Twenty-seven people, including senior Congress leaders Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and VC Shukla were killed allegedly in an attack by a group of 150 Maoists in 2013. On May 26, 2013, the NIA registered a case on this attack and started investigations. Recently, on May 25, 2020, Jitendra Mudaliyar, son of Congress leader Uday Mudaliyar, who was also killed in Darbha Valley attack (also referred to as the Jheeram Valley attack), registered an FIR in Bastar district with regard to the attack on the Congress convoy. The NIA moved an application on June 16 in Jagdalpur NIA court seeking handing over of the case registered by Mudaliyar to NIA for further investigation. “Bastar police presented its view point before the NIA court mentioning that this case is different from the 2013 case, because the new case would mainly investigate the conspiracy angle of the incident. On 10th of August 2020, Jagdalpur NIA court rejected agency’s application for transferring the Jheeram case (FIR registered in May 2020) to NIA for further investigation,” Inspector General of Police, Bastar Range, Sunderaj P told HT. On the other hand, NIA’s counsel said the agency will challenge the order in the state high court. “We have argued that as per the NIA Act and also the CrPC, there cannot be two FIRs for a single offence and it falls within NIA’s jurisdiction because the agency is already investigating the matter pertaining to the same offence,” said Kishore Bhaduri, NIA’s counsel talking to HT. Bhaduri also alleged that the NIA court had incorrectly relied solely on section 10 of the NIA act.“The order was made relying on section 10 of NIA act to decline handing over of the file of FIR to NIA. The sessions court has omitted to consider the implications of section 6 and partially read the provision under section 10 of the NIA act, which is always subject to section 6. We will move to high court,” said Bhaduri. State unit of the Congress party has welcomed the court order. “We welcome the order of Jagdalpur court and secondly we want to know why the conspiracy angle should not be investigated? Why NIA doesn’t want the state police to investigate, which will unfold the conspiracy behind the Darbha Valley killing,” said Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi. The BJP, too, said it welcomes the decision of the court and added that the Congress leadership should now come forward to submit the evidence to back up their claims of conspiracy behind the attack. “We also welcome the decision of the court. The Congress leaders always claim that they have evidence about the conspiracy and now they can come forward and submit the evidence to Chhattisgarh police. The matter should be resolved,” said BJP spokesperson Sachidanand Upasane||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-court-refuses-to-hand-over-jheeram-attack-conspiracy-case-to-nia/story-ATIXV921pYLm8ZeCWqzDCO.html

Dr Anil Kumar Patel, deputy director of the Dudhwa buffer zone, said the carcass of the big cat was recovered from a forest area under Jatpura beat of Mailani range on Tuesday morning. Patel said the tigress was around four to five years old.“No injury marks were detected on the body while all the organs of the big cat were found intact,” he said and added that “the conditions indicated the tigress seemed to have died a few days back”.“However, a nylon rope piece was found tied around the tigress’ neck causing abrasion marks round the neck, which raised doubts of some foul play,” he added. Patel said a thorough probe into the tigress’ death would be conducted and an autopsy will be carried out according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines to ascertain the exact cause of death, Patel said. He added “a report in this connection would be lodged under wildlife protection act.”Reports said a farmer from the neighbouring Hardua village had gone to the fields to collect grass when a big cat hiding in the bushes charged upon him. He raised an alarm following which fellow villagers rushed to the spot and the big cat ran back into the neighbouring forests.The villagers later found the dead body of the tigress lying in the bushes and called the forest authorities.Patel along with his team rushed the spot and carried out preliminary investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tigress-found-dead-in-dudhwa-buffer-zone-in-up-s-lakhimpur/story-m41fukHu2vApqNGYCsXntI.html
12-08-2020||India||Two HAL light combat choppers deployed in Ladakh||Two light combat helicopters, produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, have been deployed in the Ladakh sector to support the Indian Air Force at short notice amid the border row with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), HAL said in a statement on Wednesday. “It is the lightest attack helicopter in the world designed and developed by HAL to meet the specific and unique requirements of Indian armed forces reflecting the crucial role of HAL in Atma Nirbhar Bharat.” said HAL chairman R Madhavan. The LCH figures on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. The state-run aircraft maker is expecting an order for 15 LCHs by the year-end --- 10 for the IAF and five for the army. The IAF and the army together need 160 LCHs. The deployment of the twin-engine LCH in the Ladakh sector is symbolic in nature and an acknowledgement of the potential that the platform holds but it is yet to be fully weaponised to meet the IAF’s requirements, people familiar with the LCH programme said. “The LCH holds a lot of promise but is not really capable of carrying out missions in its current configuration. It lacks anti-armour and air-to-air weapons. That’s work in progress,” the officials said. The LCH is equipped with 70mm rockets and a chin-mounted cannon. Also read: For Ladakh stand-off, how India readied its fleet of Apache attack choppers“The LCH may not be carrying its full weapons load as of today but when the weapon integration is complete, it will prove its worth,” said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. During a visit to the Ladakh sector last week, IAF vice chief Air Marshal Harjit Singh Arora flew in one of the two LCHs from the Daulat Beg Oldie airbase, near the contested LAC. Air Marshal Arora took off from a high-altitude location to a forward area for a simulated attack on a target, the HAL statement said. “This was followed by a landing at one of the most treacherous helipads in the region. The LCH successfully demonstrated its quick deployment prowess to forward locations in extreme temperatures,” the statement said. LCH is a potent platform because of its state-of-the-art systems and highly accurate weapons (it will eventually carry) that are capable of hitting any type of target by day or night, it added. The two LCHs deployed in Ladakh are prototypes and the ones that will be supplied to the IAF will come with the desired weapons capability, said an HAL official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. On the upcoming order for 15 LCH, the HAL said, “Technical evaluation and the price negotiations have been concluded and the order is expected shortly. However, as a proactive measure HAL has launched limited series production in anticipation of orders at its Bengaluru facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-hal-light-combat-choppers-deployed-in-ladakh/story-mQ3MtbvOn9KoNQprZtZw6O.html
12-08-2020||India||‘Modi hai toh Mumkin hai’, tweets Rahul Gandhi. It is a jibe||With a pithy one liner, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took yet another swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy’s warning that the country’s GDP growth may touch its lowest since independence in the backdrop of a raging coronavirus pandemic. Gandhi employed PM Modi’s widely popular 2019 election campaign slogan to hit out at him, tweeting: “Modi hai toh mumkin hai (If Modi is there, everything is possible)”. He also attached a screenshot of the report carrying the IT software icon’s remark.On Monday, Murthy had flagged fears of the country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) touching its lowest since 1947 and as a way out suggested developing a system that allows every player in every sector of the country’s economy to operate at full steam, with precautions of course.“India’s GDP is expected to shrink by at least five per cent. There is a fear that we may even reach the lowest GDP since Independence, since 1947,” said Murthy at an online event.Rahul Gandhi - through a tweet a day, video messages - has been attacking the government over a host of issues. On Tuesday, the Congress leader urged the Centre to implement the government’s rural employment guarantee scheme and his party’s ‘Nyuntam Aay Yojana’ (NYAY) as an economic measure for the poor in urban and rural areas of the country amid the ongoing crisis triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.In an earlier tweet, Gandhi had said he warned the government about Covid19 and the economy, but they rubbished it. Businesses have pinned hopes on more demand-boosting measures from the government, including ramping up the execution of infrastructure projects, more economic reforms and a goods and services tax (GST) rate cut if the other steps fail to revive consumption. Business leaders have said they are worried about movement curbs imposed by authorities, an issue that was also cited by RBI last week as a reason for several high-frequency economic indicators levelling off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-hai-toh-mumkin-hai-tweets-rahul-gandhi-it-is-a-jibe/story-7jMfzB9xlp6vjtjivQ33nM.html

Neeraj Singh Babloo, who is also Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Bihar, had demanded a public apology from Raut on Monday within 48 hours, failing which he said he will take legal action against him.“If there has been any kind of miss on our part, we will think about it. But I will have to look into it. What I have said so far is based on the information I have, Sushant’s family is speaking on the basis of information they have,” Sanjay Raut said, according to ANI.Raut had claimed in his weekly column in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ that the actor didn’t share good relations with his father KK Singh. “I have received such information. How many times did Rajput visit his father in Patna in the last few years?” Raut, who is Saamana’s executive editor, asked.Raut also said Bihar’s director general of police (DGP) Gupteshwar Pandey was working for a political party and alleged he tried to contest an election on a BJP ticket. “What can you expect from such a police force?” he asked.Rajput’s maternal uncle, RC Singh, said an attempt is being made to divert the direction of the probe being conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Singh also said Rajput had a very good relationship with his father and his father had not remarried as alleged by Raut.The 34-year-old was found dead in his home on June 14. The case was being investigated by the Mumbai Police but the Bihar Police launched a separate probe after the actor’s father filed a First Information Report (FIR) against his son’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and others in Patna, alleging abetment to suicide. After a turf war between the two police forces, the probe has now been taken over by the central agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-look-into-it-sanjay-raut-says-over-apology-demanded-by-sushant-s-family/story-wnRo6VDzbETEaOH4QqY65N.html

12-08-2020||India||HC upholds life sentence of a widow who killed her new born daughter to hide illicit relationship||Mumbai. The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday upheld the conviction and life sentence of a widow, who had killed her new-born daughter 27 years ago, purportedly to hide her illicit relationship and the unwanted pregnancy caused eight years after her husband’s death. The two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices RD Dhanuka and Surendra Tavade, upheld the conviction of Kamlabai Gharat, as the prosecution had proved the chain of circumstances against her beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt. There was nobody else, except the appellant-accused to commit the murder of her new-born daughter, the court said. The bench has directed Alibag district and sessions court to secure Gharat’s presence and remand her to prison for serving the remainder of the jail term. According to the prosecution, on November 10, 1993, residents of Nhava Sheva in Uran found a new-born girl abandoned near Sheva bus stand.One of the residents took the infant to his house, where she was provided with the necessary care and food. He reported the matter to local police authorities, who arrested Gharat after finding out that she was pregnant, and suspected her of abandoning the new-born.Initially, the police took Gharat and the infant to the Rural Hospital at Uran and later to Alibag Civil Hospital, where she strangulated her child. In 1995, the sessions court convicted Gharat for murder and sentenced her to life. However, she was acquitted of abandoning the child. Later, Gharat moved HC in an appeal challenging her conviction on various grounds. The bench on Tuesday dismissed the appeal. It concluded that the prosecution had proved all the circumstances against Gharat such as the abandonment of the child, the good physical condition of the neonate before her murder, and the fact that the new-born girl was with her ever since they were taken to the Rural Hospital at Uran and later to Alibag Civil Hospital. The bench held that the prosecution had proved homicidal death of the child and that there was no one around when the infant was killed, except for Gharat. The judges found that there was a motive for Gharat to commit the crime --- to hide the entire episode of her illicit affair -- the pregnancy caused eight years after the death of her husband and birth of the unwanted child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-upholds-life-sentence-of-a-widow-who-killed-her-new-born-daughter-to-hide-illicit-relationship/story-d4oScCqIeowzebYKT8ml2K.html
12-08-2020||India||PM Modi to launch platform to honour honest taxpayers on Thursday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the platform “Transparent Taxation--Honoring the Honest” on Thursday as part of the government’s ongoing direct tax reforms, an official statement said. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has been implementing a series of reforms since last year, when it reduced corporate tax from 30% to 22%. For new manufacturing units, the tax rate was further cut to 15%, and the dividend distribution tax was abolished. “The focus of the tax reforms has been on reduction in tax rates and on simplification of direct tax laws,” the finance ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.The ministry has also launched a drive to increasingly make the taxation system faceless and transparent to stop overreach by taxmen and check corruption. “This includes bringing more transparency in official communications through the newly introduced Document Identification Number (DIN) wherein every communication of the department would carry a computer generated unique document identification number,” it said. Similarly, to increase the ease of compliance for taxpayers, the income-tax (IT) department has moved forward with pre-filing of income tax returns to make compliance more convenient for individual taxpayers. Compliance norms for startups have been simplified, it said. “With a view to provide for resolution of pending tax disputes the IT department also brought out the Direct Tax ‘Vivad se Vishwas Act, 2020’ under which declarations for settling disputes are being filed currently,” it said.The statement listed recent reforms such as raising the monetary thresholds for filing of departmental appeals in various appellate courts to reduce taxpayer grievances and litigation, and promoting digital transactions. “The IT department is committed to take the initiatives forward and has also made efforts to ease compliances for taxpayers during the Covid times by extending statutory timeliness for filing returns as also releasing refunds expeditiously to increase liquidity in the hands of taxpayers,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-launch-platform-to-honour-honest-taxpayers-on-thursday/story-dAI6xUF9CK94b1QCfAMNsM.html

Though the rising bills have been a major drain on the state exchequer, these welfare measures coupled with subsidies have kept starvation deaths at bay.However, the state Social Security & Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities department decided to disburse the monthly pension to people with Aadhaar verified accounts from this month. This left around 11 lakh people in the lurch. “Aadhaar, as a proof of identity, has been made mandatory for availing benefit under both the pension schemes from August 2020,” the department said in a letter to all district collectors.As per the updated National Dashboard of National Social Assistance Programme, only 83% of the NSAP accounts in Odisha have been “verified” by Aadhaar, while only 74% have been verified for the MBPY scheme leaving out 11 lakh persons.Joint secretary of SSEPD department, Dipak Routray, said that Aadhar verification was being done to weed out ghost beneficiaries. “During the Aadhar verification, we found out about ghost beneficiaries. Only those with Aadhar verified accounts will get the pension. We are trying to finish the verification process as soon as possible, but can’t say how long will the entire process take,” said Routray.Sameet Panda, a right to food activist, condemned the move. “People who depend on the allowances can die of starvation when the pandemic is raging. Mandatory linkages with Aadhaar have caused mass exclusions, both at the point of disbursal of welfare entitlements (because of biometric or technical failures) and during the process of seeding and verification. The Aadhar seeding and verification processes are also shrouded in opacity,” he said.Activists also raised question on how the state government after opposing the Aadhar linking with pensioner’s account in 2017 on the grounds that it would cause hardship to the beneficiaries has now done a volte face. “Aadhar seeding or verification can fail for a range of reasons, often without any of the responsible officials understanding the reason, or how it should be remedied. The Aadhar-enabled Payments System (AePS) comes with its own share of failures due to poor design, missing safeguards, and a confusing array of failure codes,” said a member of Odisha Khadya Adhikar Abhijan, a group that works for Right to Food.Activists said if eligible beneficiaries are left out due to Aadhar verification process then there is a possibility of starvation deaths happening like Dukhi Jani, a 46-year-old tribal woman in Nayagarh district who died after going without food for three days in June.Opposition leaders also said that the government should not stop the monthly pension on the pretext of Aadhar verification. “For a large number of tribals and Dalits in the remote districts, the pension is the only source of sustenance. The govt can continue giving the pension while doing the verification process,” said Pradipta Naik, Leader of Opposition in Odisha Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhs-left-in-lurch-after-aadhar-made-mandatory-for-pension-in-odisha-activists-slam-move/story-47HresjdXjJB48r8KU2QqJ.html
12-08-2020||India||Andhra Pradesh sanitiser deaths: Main accused arrested, learned from YouTube videos||The investigation into the death of 10 people due to consuming hand sanitiser led the police to a school drop-out who started manufacturing hand sanitiser by watching YouTube videos.Sale Srinivas, the prime accused in the case, had worked in a petrol pump for some time before taking to manufacturing of sanitiser. Ten people have so far been arrested in the case, Prakasam district police chief Siddharth Kaushal said.Though the police had initially claimed that only 10 people had died of consuming hand sanitiser, the Superintendent of Police (SP) later said that there were 16 people who had succumbed in a span of three days between July 29 and 31. “Most of them were beggars, hamalis and rickshaw pullers who got addicted to liquor. They had consumed hand sanitiser due to non-availability of alcohol,” Kaushal said.A five-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the district police, with the support of special enforcement bureau and drug inspectors, was entrusted with the investigation into the supply of sanitiser to the dealers in Kurichedu village in the district.“The SIT collected 69 bottles from the different scenes of crime and identified that the deceased consumed eight brands of sanitisers. The team started locating their addresses and manufacturing units. One of these brands - Perfect Gold - had no batch number and was found to have been supplied by Vandana Pharma from Bengaluru. But during investigation, the SIT found that there was no such company,” the SP said. After intensive search, the SIT traced the dealer of Perfect Gold brand of sanitiser at Prashasan Nagar in Hyderabad and seized heavy stocks of sanitiser boxes in the premises of distributor. On interrogation, the dealer confessed that one Sale Srinivas from Subhashnagar, Jedimetla was supplying this sanitiser to him on cheapest rates.The SIT officials took Srinivas into custody. During interrogation, it was revealed that Srinivas, a school drop-out from Siddapuram village of Vikarabad district, had worked in a petrol bunk and as solid paint remover for some time and had little knowledge of chemicals.On noticing the increasing demand for sanitiser during the Covid-19 period, Srinivas got into sanitiser manufacturing with the help of his elder brother two chemical sellers. They suggested to him that methanol which is cheaper than ethanol can be used for using sanitiser to get bigger profits.“So, he started making sanitiser using methanol by watching the process in YouTube videos under the brand name of Perfect Gold. He did not get any license from drug administration authority or did not get any permission from the government to install the manufacturing unit,” the SP said. Initially, Srinivas used to distribute sanitiser bottles in an auto and later, he got in touch with one distributor Kesav Agaraval who agreed to distribution of large quantities of sanitiser. Thus, he had supplied the sanitiser to various shops. The SIT officials found the supply chain and distribution track of Perfect Gold hand sanitiser from Hyderabad to Kurichedu and busted the entire racket. “We have arrested Srinivas and four others who were involved in the manufacture and distribution of methanol-based hand sanitiser and five medical shop owners in Darsi and Kurichedu who sold this brand of sanitiser to the victims,” Kaushal said. All the 10 accused were produced before a local court in Darsi, which remanded them to two-week judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-sanitiser-deaths-main-accused-arrested-learned-from-youtube-videos/story-k9ZD34lsu545L6i8jvXcWN.html

Experts have been startled since the announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin.All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria on Tuesday said that there was a need to assess the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia if it is successful.“If Russia’s vaccine is successful, then we will have to see critically whether it is safe and effective. There should not be any side effects of the vaccine and it should provide good immunity and protection. India has the capacity for mass production of vaccine,” Dr Guleria said.Putin said yesterday that the vaccine offers “sustainable immunity” against Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. He also said that one of his own daughters had received the inoculation and felt good afterwards.The vaccine, which will be called “Sputnik V” in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, has however not yet completed its final trials.Some scientists fear Moscow may be putting national prestige before safety.“Normally you need a large number of people to be tested before you approve a vaccine,” said Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany, currently testing CureVac’s Covid-19 vaccine in clinical trials.“In that respect, I think it’s reckless to do that (approve it) if lots of people haven’t already been tested.”Top US infectious disease official Dr Anthony Fauci said he had not heard any evidence that the vaccine was ready for widespread use.“I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they’ve done that,” Fauci said.The Russian business conglomerate Sistema has said it expects to put the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, into mass production by the end of the year.Government officials have said it will be administered to medical personnel, and then to teachers, on a voluntary basis at the end of this month or in early September. Mass roll-out in Russia is expected to start in October. The vaccine is administered in two doses and consists of two serotypes of a human adenovirus, each carrying an S-antigen of the new coronavirus, which enter human cells and produce an immune response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-assess-if-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective-aiims-director/story-emtGbLHgYl2YvZnnrQwXRM.html

A case was filed by Narayanan (79) in the sessions court in Thiruvananthapuram after the Supreme Court in 2018 ordered that his arrest in the case was “unnecessary and he was implicated” and granted him an interim relief of Rs 50 lakh. The court had also observed that Narayanan deserved more and he could approach a lower court for proper compensation. Earlier, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had also ordered a relief Rs 10 lakh to him. After the Supreme Court’s order, the Kerala government had asked former chief secretary K Jayakumar to look into the matter and fix an exact compensation amount and arrive at a settlement. Later, his suggestions were submitted before the court and a settlement was clinched. “I am happy. It is not for money alone I fought. My fight was against injustice,” Narayanan said after accepting the cheque. The Isro spy case relates to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents and secrets of the county’s cryogenic engine technology to enemy countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The case had generated enough heat. Many books were written over the sensational case and a Bollywood director had even made a biopic on Narayanan who had to pay a heavy price along with former chief minister K Karunakaran. Its release was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Narayanan was conferred the Padma Bhushan last year. The case surfaced in 1994 and Karunakaran was forced to quit after a section of his party led by A K Antony and Oommen Chandy revolted against him after the then police chief’s name (Ramon Srivastav) also cropped up in the case. It was alleged that two senior scientists of Isro - Nambi Narayanan and D Sasikumaran - had sold space secrets for money and sexual favours. Two Maldivian women were also arrested in connection with the case. Srivastav was then Inspector General of Police. However, in 1998, the Supreme Court had quashed the case after accepting the CBI inquiry report that it was cooked up. When the espionage case was unearthed, Narayanan was in-charge of the cryogenic division. He was the first to introduce liquid fuel rocket technology. The country’s space technology had to suffer badly due to the espionage case, he said in one of the interviews pointing to a larger conspiracy in the case. “Hated by all I thought of committing suicide on several occasions. But I never wanted to die as a traitor. I lived all these years only to tell this,” Naryanana had told the Hindustan Times in one of the earlier interviews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curtains-down-on-26-year-old-isro-spy-case-scientist-nambi-narayanan-gets-additional-compensation-from-kerala-govt/story-Itklhcse1VgPLPyCWbIalM.html
12-08-2020||India||Is economy recovering with easing of lockdown or sinking?||We will (hopefully) have GDP statistics for the April-June quarter by the end of this month. There is complete unanimity that the June quarter will see an economic contraction vis-a-vis last year. India was under a strict lockdown for most of this period (two of the three months, with lockdowns continuing for longer in some parts of the country). The real question is what has happened to economic activity from July onwards. Is it recovering with the easing of lockdown restrictions? Has it plateaued with cases still rising and the imposition of intermittent lockdowns? Or has it become worse? There is also the question of whether the recovery is merely sequential – current month over previous month – or strong enough to prevent an annual contraction from the second quarter onwards. Most high frequency indicators suggest a sequential recovery until June, with a flattening in July. The latest Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) of the Reserve Bank of India —it was conducted in the first half of July — paints a poor picture. It shows that people believe that the economic situation was much worse in July than in May when compared to year-ago levels. This suggests that India’s GDP might remain in contraction mode in the September quarter, something RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee has hinted at and which, a recent Reuters poll of economists seconded. The CCS also suggests that some key high frequency indictors might not be capturing the actual magnitude of distress. The net current perception — difference between share of respondents who believe the situation has improved and deteriorated -- on general economic situation, compared to a year ago, reached its lowest level in the July CCS. To give an idea about the extent of fall, these numbers were -60 and -65.9 in the May and July rounds of the CCS. The previous low was -36.9 in September 2013. A comparison of current perception on general economic situation in the CCS along with quarterly GDP figures shows that they have pretty much moved in tandem. This suggests that there is a high probability that the unprecedented collapse in May and July CCS might reflect in GDP numbers as well. The CCS also records response on the employment situation. Here also, the current perception compared to a year ago has collapsed. Interestingly, the CCS response on employment does not seem to be in sync with the only monthly indicator of unemployment rates available in India, which are collected by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).While CMIE’s unemployment rate data showed a spike in May 2020, when the country was under an almost complete lockdown, it has come back to pre-lockdown levels in July. Because the CCS is conducted in 13 cities in India, we have compared urban unemployment from the CMIE. To be sure, CMIE’s employment indicators are far from sacrosanct and show divergence with the figures published by the Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS), which are India’s official source of employment data. The differences between CMIE and PLFS employment indicators were discussed in detail in a Mint story by Sriharsha Devulapalli and Pramit Bhattacharya. Also, the divergence between CMIE unemployment rates and CCS perception on employment existed even before the pandemic. Does the CCS not capture the reality of the labour market? A research note published on 10 July, for the same period when the latest round of CCS was conducted, by Pranjul Bhandari, chief economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets Private Limited, offers a clue. It says that while unemployment rates might come back to normal, “wage outlook could be dimmer than in the pre-pandemic world”. Bhandari lists three reasons for this: more jobs being generated in the rural areas where wages are lower, a second-round-pandemic-led global weakness in labour markets due to job losses in the first round; and expectations of lower economic growth, an important driver of wages.A squeeze in wages, even if it comes with an unchanged unemployment rate, will have a contractionary effect on purchasing power, aggregate demand and, therefore, growth. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a large number of workers might have suffered a fall in incomes even though they have not lost their jobs. A Mint story on 11 August pointed out that equity mutual funds have seen a fall in contribution from systematic investment plans, which suggests a corresponding decline in disposable incomes. While it is important to track sequential recovery in the economy, it is crucial to not lose sight of the challenge of coming out of the annual contraction zone as soon as possible. Restoring consumer confidence, which is key to demand, is a prerequisite to achieving this. The latest CCS findings suggest that it will take more than a sequential recovery to boost consumer confidence -- and growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-economy-recovering-with-easing-of-lockdown-or-sinking/story-Ga5sxkcRZyyVpbsYRI5nwI.html
12-08-2020||India||Coronavirus: Has 3rd curve flattening begun?||A much-needed third flattening of the global case curve of Covid-19 appears to have begun, largely due to a recent plateau in daily cases in the US and Brazil – two nations worst hit by the virus. In the last two weeks, with new cases in the US and Brazil hitting a plateau, the third (and most severe) wave of infections has started exhibiting signs that it may be relenting, shows data. India, which is currently reporting the highest number of daily infections in the world, is one of two countries among the world’s 10 worst hit where cases are still continuously rising.  The three nations with the highest number of cases – US (5,251,446 cases as on Tuesday morning), Brazil (3,057,470) and India (2,263,864) – together account for 52.2% of all cases in the world. In the first 10 days of August, 60.3% of all cases have come from these three nations, which also explains why a plateau in two of these has influenced the global trajectory.Among the 10 countries that have reported the highest number of case in the world, daily cases are still continuously rising in only two – India and Colombia. Other than the US and Brazil, daily cases also appear hitting a plateau in Mexico (7th spot, 480,278 cases). Russia (4th, 892,654 cases), South Africa (5th, 563,598 cases) and Chile (9th, 375,044 cases) . The remaining two – Spain (10th, 370,060 cases) and Peru (7th, 483,133 cases) – managed to control outbreaks once, but are now seeing a resurgence of cases. All caseloads are from the worldometers.info dashboard. To be sure, the global Covid-19 curve has flattened twice before — first, when the Chinese outbreak peaked and the contagion was yet to reach the West; the second, when cases dropped in Europe — however, it has risen again with more ferocity both times as the virus has spread to new regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-3rd-curve-flattening-begun/story-WSTrirfCGSQ5eCmKIqK5XO.html

The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was hearing a plea filed by Khan’s mother Nuzhat Perween seeking time-bound hearing by Allahabad high court (HC) of a petition seeking Khan’s release. “Liberty is something which we have prioritised even during hard times,” CJI Bobde remarked.Khan was detained under the National Security Act for speeches made in December 2019 at Aligarh Muslim University during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).Perween initially approached the SC seeking his release but the top court, on March 18, asked her to move the high court first. The hearing before the HC was delayed, prompting Perween to move the apex court. “We request the HC to dispose of the matter peremptorily as early as possible, having regard to the fact that it involves the liberty of the applicant, within a period of fifteen days from the date the parties appear before it,” the SC ordered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-disposal-of-kafeel-khan-plea-in-15-days/story-CeY4GTKHW5eiup5E5oe1zI.html
12-08-2020||India||Venkaiah Naidu completes 3 years as Vice President||Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah completed three years in office amid Covid-related uncertainties but also amid signals of an improved performance in the Upper House of Parliament, which he dubbed as “winds of change”. Naidu cited in-House research and data analysis to show that the productivity of the Rajya Sabha has been declining over the last 25 years and the House could use 100% of its allotted time only once in 1999 during the last 20 years. But in 2019, the average productivity climbed at 78.42% during 2019, the highest usage of time since 2010. Naidu said that after he began his innings, the productivity in the three sessions before the 2019 general election stood at 28.90%, 27.3% and just 6.8%. After the polls, the last three sessions saw 104%, 99% and 76% productivity. Of the 93 bills passed by Rajya Sabha during his tenure, 60 were passed during the last three sessions. He said, “Despite the given composition of the House and stated positions of different parties, Rajya Sabha has passed some major bills like the Triple Talaq Bill, the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and the J&K Reorganisation Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/venkaiah-naidu-completes-3-years-as-vice-president/story-yEjSadlZCDzguWXthiYeZM.html

12-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India needs a new testing protocol. Actually, any country that is continuing to see a rise in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections needs one. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, and one of the clearest thinkers when it comes to issues related to health, recognises this. In recent interviews, he has been harshly critical of the testing process in the US, going so far as to term it worthless. Gates’s issues are with access and delays. Some people in the US are waiting a week up to 10 days for their results. That doesn’t help. Not everyone who gets tested is in quarantine or self-isolation, which means an early result can sequester them and prevent them from infecting more people (that’s how the chain of infection is broken).The problem is that the best tests for Covid-19, the molecular ones such as the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, take at least 48 hours to show results. Add delays caused by logistics and backlogs, and the average time in which results for such tests come out is between three and four days. That’s the number cited by public health officials across most states in India (and at least in states where complete or partial lockdowns are still on, there is some amount of enforced quarantining and social distancing), although there have been reports of delays from some states. The fact is, India has increased its testing game and can conduct at least 500,000 RT-PCR tests a day now, up from a few thousands.But more are needed, and, sometimes, time is of the essence – which brings us to rapid antigen tests, which now account for around a fourth (and on some days a bit more) of tests being conducted in India.This column has previously focused on antigen tests, and when they are best used. Simply put (and there is no change in this writer’s position), antigen tests are best used when time, not capacity, is a constraint. The only way to deal with a capacity constraint is to acquire more capacity. So, if Covid-19 cases in a hot spot or containment zone are peaking, and there is an urgent need to test a large number of people in a short period of time, and isolate or treat the infected so as to prevent further infections, an antigen test may be the best fit. Or, if, as in the US, tests are taking a week to 10 days, then an antigen test may serve the purpose. The results of these tests are usually available onsite, and within the hour. This could explain why there is a sudden clamour for antigen tests in the US (and it is clear that its use wouldn’t be out of place in some states or some counties where cases are soaring; parts of California, for instance, seem ideal candidates for such tests). That applies to India too – antigen tests would definitely help in parts of the hinterland and the peninsula that are seeing a surge in cases.But (and it’s a big one), there is a problem with antigen tests, one that, again, has been mentioned in earlier instalments of this column – the high false negative rate. This means that an infected person is identified as uninfected. According to multiple research studies, the proportion of false negatives ranges between 20% and 50%. Which means that at least one in five people, and as many as one in two, is erroneously identified as uninfected despite carrying the virus. The main reason (it isn’t the only one) for this error would appear to be the inability of antigen tests to amplify the viral protein (in contrast, RT-PCR ones have the ability to identify even traces of the virus on the basis of their genetic material, which is what makes them accurate). So, what’s the solution?Interestingly, one part of the solution is already part of the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, or ICMR, as part of its antigen testing protocol – that those with symptoms of Covid-19 or SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) who are shown to be negative in an antigen test, be administered the RT-PCR test.Another would be to take multiple samples (two should suffice) from anyone appearing for an antigen test, and testing them, ideally using two different antigen tests (each one is different), or, if unavoidable, even the same one but separately. If there is a discrepancy between the two test results, then the person should be asked to undergo the RT-PCR test.With more Indian states using antigen tests (in addition to RT-PCR ones, and not always when they should be using them), ICMR should issue a new testing protocol that mandates: when antigen tests can be used; how antigen tests should be conducted (two simultaneous ones as described above); and the follow-up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-8Rb4gp04nDQBkvhOKTvnhO.html
12-08-2020||India||4G to return in J&K after Aug 15 on trial basis: Centre to SC||Restrictions on 4G mobile internet will be relaxed in one district each of Jammu and Kashmir divisions of India’s youngest Union Territory (UT) after August 15 on a trial basis, the central government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday, stopping short of a blanket removal of restrictions across the region because of security concerns.The decision was arrived at on the recommendations made by a special committee constituted on the top court’s May 11 directive to the Centre to review restrictions on high-speed mobile internet in J&K, the government’s senior-most law officer, attorney general KK Venugopal, informed a three-judge bench headed by justice NV Ramana.“Access to high speed internet could be provided on a trial basis in a calibrated manner in specified limited areas to assess the impact on the security scenario; the area should have low intensity of terrorist activities. The relaxation from 2G to 4G should be limited for the present to one district each in the Jammu division and Kashmir division,” Venugopal said, reading out the committee’s recommendations.The relaxation will be reviewed by state authorities every seven days and by central authorities after two months, Venugopal added, maintaining that total relaxation of such restrictions in the entire UT will not be possible due to continuing security concerns.“Any opening on a trial basis should not be in any area adjoining the International Border/Line of Control. Keeping in view the heightened threat perception, these relaxations would come into effect after August 15, 2020.” The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed in June by the Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-government organisation, seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre and J&K administration for failure to comply with the top court’s May 11 directions to review restrictions on mobile internet speeds in the Union Territory, where people are only able to access 2G services.The top court appreciated the stand taken by the Centre and closed the contempt case on Tuesday based on Venugopal’s submission.“This is a good stand by the respondent,” justice R Subhash Reddy, who was on the bench, remarked.“This is a step forward,” the petitioner’s counsel, Huzefa Ahmadi, acknowledged.However, the court asked the Centre to respond to an interim application by the petitioner which pointed out that the government was not publishing in the public domain copies of the orders reviewing internet restrictions. Under a Supreme Court ruling on January 10, orders by government authorities imposing restrictions on the internet have to be put out in the public domain.The Centre has to file its response within two weeks after which the court will pronounce its order.“While it is a welcome step that the restrictions are sought to be eased soon, the continuing lack of clarity on the material before the review committee constituted under Telecom Services Suspension Rules and the special review committee set up by the Supreme Court on May 11, particularly on whether such material is fresh or stale, is troubling. Subjecting fundamental rights of the people of an entire region to a process of trial and error is, for want of a better expression – interesting,” said Supreme Court advocate Prasanna S.When the contempt case was last heard on August 7, the apex court asked the Centre to explore the possibility of restoring 4G mobile internet services in the Valley in view of statements made by former lieutenant governor (L-G) of J&K GC Murmu advocating such a move.“L-G Murmu has said that there is no difficulty in restoring 4G. You have to give an explanation to that,” justice R Subhash Reddy told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Jammu & Kashmir administration, last Friday.Murmu, who was succeeded by Manoj Sinha as the lieutenant governor on August 7, said on July 24 that the restoration of 4G services would not be a problem and Pakistan will continue with its propaganda even if the mobile internet speed is restricted to 2G. The centre submitted, on Tuesday, that the special committee took inputs from security forces and local agencies before concluding on August 10 that threat perception due to terrorist activities in the Union Territory continues to be high.“The committee was of the considered view that given the current security scenario, both in Jammu and Kashmir and in surrounding areas, the overall situation is still not conducive to lifting the limited restrictions on high speed internet through mobile devices whilst allowing broadband and 2G across the board,” Venugopal said.The committee, comprising the secretary of ministry of home affairs, secretary of ministry of communications and the chief secretary of J&K, was constituted based on Supreme Court’s May 11 order. That order was passed in an earlier plea filed in April by the same NGO, pointing out that lack of 4G services in the UT was causing difficulties to medical and health professionals and the general population in accessing the latest government advisories and other information during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Restrictions on internet services were first introduced in August 2019 when J&K was placed under lockdown after the scrapping of the contentious Article 370 that conferred special status on it, and its bifurcation into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4g-to-return-in-j-k-after-aug-15-on-trial-basis-centre-to-sc/story-vPnEJFQzKoScbmScCdymKP.html
12-08-2020||India||Hindu daughter has equal right in property, says SC||The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, gave Hindu daughters their rightful due of their father’s property by extending the scope of a beneficial legislation introduced in 2005 to cases where the father was not alive on the date when the law was introduced. A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra ruled that the 2005 law, which amended the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, to say a daughter would have the same rights as the son, would also apply irrespective of whether she was born before or after the amendment. Further, it ruled that she could not be denied her share on the ground that her father died before the law came into effect.Tuesday’s ruling makes the 2005 amendment retrospective. “The provisions contained in substituted section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act confer status of coparcener (equal shareholders while inheriting properties) on the daughter born before or after amendment in the same manner as son with same rights and liabilities. Since the right in coparcenary is by birth, it is not necessary that father coparcener should be living as on September 9, 2005 (the date when the law came into force),” the bench, which also comprised justices S Abdul Nazeer and MR Shah, ruled.To ensure that this decision does not lead to reopening of earlier family settlements or partition suits already decided on, the three-judge bench held that a registered settlement or partition suit decreed prior to December 20, 2004 (the date when the amendment Bill was tabled in Rajya Sabha), will not be reopened.The bench said: “Daughters cannot be deprived of their right of equality conferred upon them by Section 6 of the Amendment Act.” The court fixed six months as an outer limit for courts where related suits are pending to pronounce the final decree. The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act of 2005 made daughters coparceners in Hindu undivided family by birth, giving them the same right as sons. Section 6(1)(a) in the Act said that coparcenary benefit will apply “on and from the commencement of the Amendment Act of 2005 with effect from September 9, 2005.” Many daughters approached high courts claiming benefit under this law but were denied on the ground that their fathers were not alive as on September 9, 2005. This interpretation became the law of the land in 2016 when the Supreme Court held in the Prakash v Phulwati case that father must be alive for daughters to claim succession rights. Overruling this decision, a three-judge bench of the apex court on Tuesday said, “Since the right in coparcenary is by birth, it is not necessary that father coparcener should be living as on September 9, 2005.” It further made the law applicable to even daughters born prior to the commencement of the Act. By stating so, the Court upheld a 2018 ruling of the apex court in Danamma v Amar which extended benefit to a daughter whose father expired prior to 2005. Speaking to HT, senior advocate R Venkatramani, who assisted the court as amicus curiae in this matter, said, “This judgment has put the law on a proper footing . But what happens in those cases where the son of the coparcener father has alienated or sold or transferred the rights in the property long time ago. He cannot be asked to pay to his sister the share in that property. To avoid chaos, there cannot be reopening of an old partition deed or settlement.” The central government opposed the idea of giving retrospective operation to the 2005 law since a coparcener in Hindu family law has a right to seek partition. For this reason, the law fixed a cut-off date of December 20, 2004, to avoid reopening of any settlement or partition decree prior to this date. The court accepted the December 20, 2004, date as cut-off but emphasised that if a daughter seeks partition or a share, the same cannot be denied on the basis of an oral family settlement but on a final decree of a court or a registered family settlement. If oral settlement is to be presented, the bench held, it has to be supported “ by public documents.” Advocate Sridhar Potaraju, one of the lawyers who argued in this case said: “The judgment is a reassertion of the constitutional value of equality to women in personal law without any preconditions. The judgment factors all aspects.” But there is a flip side too, he added. “Daughters as coparceners include married daughters. Coparcenary right is an undefined liability and any liability of father including family debt will be extended to daughters as well. It remains to be seen if the husband of the married daughter will be open to bear this burden.” Prior to the 2005 Act, several states, including Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, introduced state amendments in the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 extending equal rights to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindu-daughter-has-equal-right-in-property-says-sc/story-bn6Ho4gMpXD9O6kN30M4PI.html
12-08-2020||India||PM Modi pitches NCR model for 10 hardest hit states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited on Tuesday the Covid-19 response in the National Capital Region (NCR), including Delhi, to urge the chief ministers of the 10 hardest-hit states to focus on three particular areas that he said would help track, contain and mitigate the outbreak – strategies that he said are crucial to defeat the virus across the country. The meeting was attended by chief ministers of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu – some of the most populous states of the country – and four others that together account for 80% of the active Covid cases and 82% of fatalities due to the viral disease.“If we defeat the coronavirus in these states, India will win the battle against the virus,” Modi said, according to a transcript of his remarks at the meeting, where he also praised the efforts by authorities and health workers across the country. According to health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, the PM said the states must focus on containment and surveillance, tracking and testing of close contacts of any infected person within 72 hours, and ramping up testing further to bring down the test positivity rate. “We have seen that increasing testing helps us identify and contain the spread... And once we increase testing even further, we will see that the goal of bringing the fatality rate below 1% will be achievable,” Modi said, according to the government release, after noting that daily tests have now risen above the 700,000 level.Bhushan, who held a press briefing separately, said the PM particularly urged Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Telangana to ramp up testing. Bihar, at 9,180 tests per million, has the lowest testing rate in the country, HT’s dashboard of Covid-19 statistics showed. The per million testing in Gujarat was 14,973, UP 14,266, West Bengal 11,683 and Telangana 16,788 -- all under the national average of 18,968 tests per million.“The health ministry believes that even if a state is carrying out tests above the recommended per million population threshold but the positivity rate is high, they must increase tests even further to bring the proportion down to under 5% or 10%,” Bhushan said. As on Tuesday, India has at least 2.32 million confirmed coronavirus infections, the third highest number of cases after the United States and Brazil. On an average over the past week, there have been at least 58,000 cases every day in India -- the highest in the world -- and emerging hot spots in the five aforementioned states are turning into a particular worry.The health ministry official, however, said new recovery and mortality figures suggest that the situation has largely improved in the country. “We have in recent days carried out a record number of tests and our case fatality rate has come down below 2% for the first time,” Bhushan said. Delhi, which is among the few regions to have crossed its peak of the outbreak, reported a test positivity rate of 6.5% on Tuesday. At its peak, the figure was 35% on June 11 in the national capital.According to the government release, the Prime Minister recounted the experience of the Union home minister in preparing a response roadmap along with the governments of Delhi and other NCR region states, which showed that containment strategies such as segregation of containment zones and improved screening of people in high risk category were the best way to combat the disease. “The results of these steps are there for all to see... steps like better management in hospitals and increasing ICU beds also proved very helpful,” the release cited the PM as saying.“We understand the disease better and what works and what doesn’t work in terms of Covid-19 treatment. Earlier we were losing patients because there were not many options. Like today we know steroids work very well in saving lives. Better knowledge has led to more lives being saved in hospitals,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, medicine department, Moolchand Hospital.Some of the chief ministers who attended the meeting also raised concerns that they said were hampering the response against the virus. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said her state was yet to receive over ₹57,000 crore in financial dues from the Union government. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray urged the Union government to rethink an issue connected with education, reiterating the state’s demand to declare students in final year of college to be deemed as automatically graduated on the basis of their past performance. The higher education regulator University Grants Commission is against any such move, which has also been announced by states such as Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Delhi. The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-pitches-ncr-model-for-10-hardest-hit-states/story-7LmsWM7kN8Wp365mhoiguL.html
12-08-2020||India||Centre focusses on tracking, testing asymptomatic cases||The Centre has asked states to use real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) method to test asymptomatic people who develop Covid-19 symptoms after testing negative following rapid antigen testing. The moderate-to-low sensitivity of antigen tests has raised concerns of large number false negatives cases being detected. “We are fully seized of the problem [of the higher number of negatives] and which is why we have directed states to mandatorily repeat rRT-PCR testing for confirmation. It was not the states complaining rather a health ministry proactively directing the states to focus on this issue,” said Union health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan.“We have directed states to not just mandatorily conduct rRT-PCR tests of all symptomatic negatives of rapid antigen tests to confirm Covid-19 but also monitor asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people for a few days and test them also using rRT-PCR if they turn symptomatic. If both these categories are covered, then we will be able to capture most of the Covid-19 cases who would have otherwise been missed.”Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved antigen-based testing for Covid-19 diagnosis in India on June 14. The move has helped in ramping up testing as part of the government’s test, track, and treat strategy to control the spread of the infection. An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response in the body in the form of the production of antibodies against the disease. Detecting its presence through an antigen-based test determines infection.According to ICMR, antigen-based testing accounts for about 25-30% of all tests being performed in the country.Dr Ekta Gupta, a senior virologist at Delhi government-run Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said a testing kit’s performance is purely dependent on its ability to accurately detect true positives and true negatives, which is called the sensitivity and specificity, wherein higher sensitivity means more accurate results.“Antigen tests, because of their moderate sensitivity, are good at detecting positives accurately and for negative results one should repeat the test using rRT-PCR testing method that is considered to be the gold standard in diagnosing a current infection.”An ICMR official, who did not wish to be identified, said their guidelines clearly mention that all symptomatic cases, whose rapid antigen test results are negative, should undergo a confirmatory rRT-PCR test. “ICMR has drafted comprehensive testing guidelines and to get accurate results, it is important to comply with the guidelines... The guidelines need to be uniformly followed.”Dr CS Bedi, medical advisor, SD Biosensor, the first company whose antigen-based test kit was approved, said: “The results also depend on where the swab is collected; it should be nasopharyngeal swab and not just nasal swab. Many technicians have had been taking nasal swabs as they are used to RT-PCR way of sample collection that affected the result. If there is no virus in the sample, it will test negative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-focusses-on-tracking-testing-asymptomatic-cases/story-MJ4L34OcJ6rhZsIYVIXqsO.html
12-08-2020||India||‘Krishna was born in jail today, you want bail?’: CJI to convict||The hearing of a bail plea before the Supreme Court on Tuesday witnessed some lighter moments with the Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, citing that the petitioner was seeking permission to leave jail on the day of Sri Krishna Janmashtami, the day Lord Krishna was believed to have been born inside a jail.The court was hearing a plea by one Dharmendra Valvi, who was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.“You want bail or jail? Today Lord Krishna was born in jail. Do you want to leave jail?” CJI Bobde asked the petitioner’s counsel in jest. The counsel replied in the affirmative. “Good. Religion is not something you are extremely attached to,” the CJI remarked before granting bail.Sri Krishna Janmashtami is an annual Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord Krishna, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Krishna is believed to have been born in a prison cell in Mathura where his parents, Devaki and Vasudeva, were imprisoned by his uncle Kansa.Dharmendra Valvi, a Congress I party member, and five other party workers, were accused of murdering a political opponent from the BJP in 1994. They were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial court and the same was upheld by the Bombay high court in September 2017.The appeal against the high court verdict is pending before the Supreme Court.“During the pendency of the main appeal, the appellant, Dharmendra Valvi is directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs 25,000 with two sureties of the like amount,” the top court ordered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/krishna-was-born-in-jail-today-you-want-bail-cji-to-convict/story-ReY1DcqD74B3PipyEhIsxL.html
12-08-2020||India||Northwest India warned of intense rainfall from August 12 to 15||Northwest India’s monsoon deficiency, as of Tuesday, was 22% and Delhi’s, 34% , but that could change with the India Meteorological Department issued an intense rain warning for the region between August 12 and 15. “The monsoon trough is likely to be active and meander around its normal position during the next 4-5 days. Convergence of strong southerly-south-westerly winds from Arabian Sea over northwest and adjoining central India is very likely during next 3-4 days,” IMD said in a statement.A monsoon trough is a region of low pressure, passing from northwest India (Rajasthan) to the Bay of Bengal. When the trough is in its normal position, it passes from Ganganagar in Rajasthan , through parts of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal to the Bay of Bengal. “The monsoon trough is at its normal position. A low-pressure area is also forming over Bay of Bengal. The combination of two can bring intense rains. Rains have been variable in the last two to three days but now we are expecting more widespread rains,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.A fresh low-pressure area is also likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal around August 13. Due to these favourable conditions, heavy to very heavy rain is likely over major parts of northwest India (Western Himalayan region, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh) during next 2-3 days, according to IMD’s Tuesday bulletin.Very heavy rain is also very likely over Gujarat, East Rajasthan and parts of central India during August 11 to 15. Extremely heavy rain is also likely in some parts of Gujarat and east Rajasthan, over northern parts of Konkan and Goa, during August 14 to 15. Moderate to severe thunderstorm accompanied with lightning is likely over Bihar, east Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh during next 24 hours.IMD has issued an orange category warning for Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, east and west Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, east and west Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh for August 12. An orange category warning implies that disaster management authorities should prepare for any rain or flooding related disasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nw-india-warned-of-intense-rainfall-from-aug-12-to-15/story-7JNiPW4kZUxlJG4xHnQjPP.html
12-08-2020||India||I-T dept raids Chinese firms for money laundering, hawala||The Income Tax department on Tuesday raided certain Chinese individuals and Indian professionals allegedly involved in money laundering and hawala transactions, officials said. The I-T department said it found that more than 40 bank accounts were created in India, which were linked to several shell companies, in which transactions worth Rs 1,000 crore were done over a period of time. Officials familiar with the probe said the main suspect was identified as an individual identified as Charlie Peng, a Chinese national living on a fake Indian passport in Manipur for the past six years. Around half a dozen more of his associates, who were helping him in money laundering and hawala transactions, were also identified. People in the IT department and finance ministry, familiar with the raids, said Peng was taking the help of some Indian chartered accountants and bank officials for alleged illegal financial transactions through shell companies and was also using the hawala route. A subsidiary of a Chinese company was identified and its role is being investigated, the officials added. Peng’s Chinese name was identified as Luo Sang. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to be roped in for money laundering investigations and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) may be asked to probe if a larger nexus is suspected. “Based on credible information that few Chinese individuals and their Indian associates were involved in money laundering and hawala transactions through series of shell entities, a search action was mounted at various premises of these Chinese entities, their close confederates and couple of bank employees,” a Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) statement said.  “A subsidiary of Chinese company and its related concerns have taken over ~100 crore bogus advances from shell entities for opening businesses of retail showrooms in India,”the statement said. “Incriminating documents in respect of hawala transactions and laundering of money with active involvement of bank employees and Chartered Accountants has been found as a result of search action,” it added. The department refused to divulge the name of other Chinese individuals or companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-t-dept-raids-chinese-firms-for-money-laundering-hawala/story-HpWeCM9F3jus0jrVhAwJhP.html
12-08-2020||India||Suspension of net services on House IT panel’s radar||The parliamentary panel on information technology (IT) on Tuesday asked the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to develop a framework for reviewing suspension of internet services in a region, including the time within which this will be done. The panel’s observations came in the backdrop of a high-speed internet shutdown that has been in place in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir for over a year now, and on the day the Centre said that it would lift restrictions on high-speed 4G mobile internet services in one district each of Jammu and Kashmir divisions after August 15 on a trial basis.The comments also come against the background of an increase in the number of Internet shutdowns in the country -- usually for law and order, or security considerations. According to the Software Freedom Law Centre, 385 Internet shutdowns were recorded between January 2012 and March 15, 2020; 237 were observed to be preventive -- restrictions were imposed in anticipation of law and order problems and 148 were reactive and imposed to contain ongoing breakdowns. Of these, nearly 100 incidents were recorded in 2019. Most shutdowns were localised, extending to a district or a few districts, and, in the rare case, a state or union territory.  The decision to restrict access to Internet in J&K came in August last year after the Centre decided to strip the erstwhile state of its special status and divide it into two Union territories.The central government has cited national security grounds for blocking high-speed 4G Internet services in the region. The Centre filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on July 21, saying a special panel constituted as per the latter’s May 11 order has decided against any relaxations for now. It added the panel constituted for the review on June 10 considered all aspects of the matter, including terror strikes, before deciding to continue the restrictions on 4G services.According to members of Parliament who participated in the meeting, the issue was discussed at length, including Supreme Court proceedings wherein the Centre said Internet services would be “gradually restored “in J&K after August 15 . Congress leader and chairperson of the IT panel, Shashi Tharoor, tweeted that the meeting lasted for over an hour. “The internet shutdown in Jammu and Kashmir was on the agenda,” said a member of Parliament (MP) present at the meeting. “It wasn’t a topic that was raised separately.” A second MP present at the meeting asked: “How can one pick and choose which areas one can provide internet to?”According to a third MP, the issue of whether DoT has the powers to do this was also discussed. Law and order, it was pointed out, was a state subject. All three MPs spoke on condition of anonymityThe Centre has also set up a committee under the home secretary to constantly review the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir as it mulls restoring 4G telecom services on a “trial basis.” Those present at the meeting said that Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra and Congress MP Shaktisinh Gohil both stressed the need for the government to follow the Supreme Court’s directives and implement the changes. “Even the SC has said that provisions imply that the ban can only be ‘temporary’, then how can it last this long,” said the second MP. Gohil declined to comment because the proceedings of the Parliamentary panel are supposed to be confidential. Hindustan Times reached out to Moitra, but she hadn’t responded before press time.The first MP said that a BJP MP also raised the point that Jammu and Kashmir did not get access to mobile services till 2003, despite the services being launched in 1995 in the rest of the country. “But we are talking about the present situation, the situation is different, the debates are different, our understanding of human rights has changed.” The panel also discussed the setting up of 5G networks across the country, the latest technology project to be taken up by DoT. The MPs also discussed India’s capability to produce the equipment locally. “Atmanirbhar Bharat {Self-Reliant India} does not mean just assembling products in India,” said the first MP. “We have to move towards producing all the components in India as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspension-of-net-services-on-house-it-panel-s-radar/story-HNAYj5NkZ9aXP35atTbkWM.html
12-08-2020||India||SC reserves verdict in Rhea Chakraborty’s transfer plea||Mumbai Police is not investigating the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and no FIR has been registered by them, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Bihar government told the Supreme Court on Friday, even as Maharashtra government and actor Rhea Chakraborty maintained that Bihar has “absolutely no jurisdiction” to interfere with the case which, they said, was being used by Bihar government to garner political mileage. The arguments and counter arguments were made before a single-judge bench of justice Hrishikesh Roy, who is hearing the transfer petition filed by Chakraborty seeking transfer from Patna to Mumbai of the case registered against her in connection with Rajput’s death.“FIR was registered by Bihar Police based on an incident which has no connection with Patna. I have apprehension of bias and fear that state interference led to Bihar police registering case. Patna police has absolutely no jurisdiction to register a case. This case is being used for political gains,” senior counsel Shyam Divan submitted on behalf of Chakraborty.Divan also took exception to the media sensationalising the case, stating: “Parallel media trial is happening which is highly undesirable. Having regard to the political impact, case should be transferred to Maharashtra.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBI, submitted that the exercise being undertaken by the Mumbai Police cannot be termed as “investigation” under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).“Mumbai police has registered an accidental death report under Section 174 of CrPC. Investigation as per CrPC was going on in Bihar and there is no such Investigation in Mumbai,” he said.Section 174 of CrPC confers powers on police to enquire into suicide deaths and submit a report of the same to the District Magistrate. Mehta contended that it will not amount to an “investigation”, which can happen only under Section 156 of CrPC, which empowers police to probe into offences.“Investigation cannot be done under Section 174 CrPC. It can happen under Section 156 of CrPC, an FIR has to be registered under section 154 of CrPC,” Mehta said, advocating a CBI probe into the death.The Bihar government, through senior counsel Maninder Singh, echoed the same view, stating that only Bihar has registered an FIR in the case. “There is a complete lapse of investigation on part of Mumbai police. Bihar’s FIR is the only FIR in the matter. Allegation is against political class in Maharashtra which has stopped even registering of FIR,” Singh submitted.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Maharashtra government, opposed this. Allowing Bihar Police to probe an incident which happened in Mumbai will be against the principles of federalism since law-and-order falls within the domain of a state where the cause of action arose, he said.“Murder of the CrPc is being attempted in this case where jurisdiction is a casualty. If this is allowed, it will be a fundamental assault on federalism. I have not seen so much sensationalism attached to a transfer petition. And in that, truth and law have become casualties,” Singhvi argued.The court reserved its verdict after a hearing which lasted for nearly two-and-a-half hours.Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14. The Mumbai Police found the cause of death as “asphyxia due to hanging”, and filed an accidental death report (ADR) but is yet to register an FIR in relation to the incident.Chakraborty, who lived with Rajput for a year till she shifted to her house on June 8, was also questioned by Mumbai Police.The investigation by Mumbai Police was ongoing when Rajput’s father, KK Singh, filed a police complaint at Rajeev Nagar police station in Patna on July 25 against Chakraborty, accusing her of abetting his son’s alleged suicide. His father also alleged that Chakraborty illegally transferred Rs 15 crore from Rajput’s bank account and mentally harassed him. Patna police registered an FIR on July 25 based on Singh’s complaint for offences relating to abetment of suicide, cheating and criminal intimidation.Chakraborty moved the top court on July 29, challenging the jurisdiction of the Bihar Police in the matter, saying that the alleged crime took place in Mumbai.Meanwhile, CBI took over the probe on August 5 based on a request by Bihar Police.Senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing Rajput’s father, raised suspicions about the manner in which Rajput was found dead.“No one has seen my son hanging. When my daughter reached Rajput was lying on the bed. The mark on his neck it is a belt mark not a rope! If he was murdered it needs to be investigated,” Vikas Singh argued on Tuesday.He maintained that Bihar Police has jurisdiction to probe the matter alleging that Mumbai Police was not investigating the case.“I am from Patna and without my son I have no one to light my funeral pyre. This itself shows that Patna has jurisdiction,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reserves-verdict-in-rhea-chakraborty-s-transfer-plea/story-HJKISG5qGxHmPOUMesErcN.html

12-08-2020||India||Centre gets 1.7 million suggestions on draft EIA||The Union environment ministry received around 1.7 million letters and emails with suggestions, comments, and objections to the controversial draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2020, till the Tuesday deadline for feedback, officials aware of the matter said. The EIA division of the ministry will study the issues raised and come out with a final notification, they added on condition of anonymity.The draft was released on March 23 as part of the process to overhaul environmental regulations for infrastructure projects. Environmental groups have opposed it citing its contentious clauses including one that allows regularisation of projects set up in violation of EIA Notification, 2006, by starting construction before receiving environmental clearance . The draft also proposes a shortening of the time for public hearings, which offer people affected by projects the opportunity to understand and approve them. People were provided 60 days on March 23 to send their comments to the draft. The ministry later extended the deadline from May 22 to June 30 because of the lockdown imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 . The Delhi high court on June 30 extended the deadline further until August 11 (Tuesday), saying the ministry did not address the court’s query regarding “ambiguity” in its decision in May to extend the deadline. It said the first order inviting suggestions and objections to the draft was issued on March 23 and uploaded on the ministry’s website on April 11. The court added it was hence erroneous on the Centre’s part to issue another notification on May 8 amid the Covid-19 pandemic to extend the deadline till June 30 even when the statutory 60 days had not lapsed.Vikrant Tongad, an environment conservationist, moved the court saying the deadline be extended either till September 30 or until the restrictions remained in place in view of the pandemic.Environment secretary R P Gupta on Tuesday said it will take the ministry some time to consider the issues raised in the comments and suggestions. “Letters have gone to the [Union environment] minister [Prakash Javadekar], many have come to me and to other officials. Many are repetitive.”The ministry has also held meetings with several consultants, industry bodies, and companies whose comments are also being considered separately.Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher with New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said the ministry on March 18 amended the Environment Protection Rules Clause 5 (3), which gives it 725 days to finalise the draft notification from the date it was first issued. “In 2006, this was 365 days and was amended to 545 in 2017. Given the number of reactions the ministry has received and the demand for a more democratic process, it will be important for the ministry to reconsider the issuance of a final notification based on this draft. The comments can be used to set up a revised process that can be built on the comments received and reach out to places where the news of the current amendments are yet to reach.”A group of 100 environmental groups and individuals said they have over the last week sent emails to 785 members of Parliament over the matter, calling upon them to take a stand against “the anti-environment and anti-people “draft and demand its immediate withdrawal. In a statement on Tuesday, the group said that as elected political representatives, the MPs are duty-bound to protect the interests of the people and the nation and its resources, which “this draft legislation is bound to adversely impact”. “We have called upon the ministers to write to the [Union environment ministry]...to demand withdrawal of the Draft EIA Notification 2020 and demand instead that strong environmental governance is put in place in consultation with the people, for protecting the ecology and natural resources...”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the draft is “not only disgraceful” but “ also dangerous”. “Not only does it have the potential to reverse many of the hard-fought gains that have been won over the years in the battle to protect our environment, it could potentially unleash widespread environmental destruction and mayhem across India.”#IndiaNotForSale and #LootoftheNation have trended on Twitter as people took to the social media platform to draw attention to concerns with the draft and to demand its withdrawal.Environment minister Javadekar has called the campaign against the draft premature. “Campaigning against a draft, which is not a final notification yet, is unnecessary and premature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gets-1-7mn-suggestions-on-draft-eia/story-sh7Mpbg6B5HwTynW8w5kDO.html
12-08-2020||India||Harassed in public, teen scholar dies in road accident||: A 19-year-old woman, who scored 98% in Class 12 board examinations in 2018 and was pursuing a graduate degree in the United States, died in a road accident in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr after being harassed by two men on a motorcycle, her family alleged on Tuesday.Sudeeksha Bhati, a resident of Greater Noida’s Dadri, was on a motorcycle with her uncle on Monday when the two men on another bike began following them and performed stunts on the road, the family said. At one point, the men overtook them and applied the brakes suddenly, causing the young woman and her uncle to fall over, they said. Bhati suffered head injuries in the incident that took place around 9:30am. She died in a hospital later that day.The incident sparked outrage with former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati and Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra condemning the incident and criticising the law and order situation in the state.“Two persons on a Royal Enfield bike tried to overtake us multiple times. I applied brakes and slowed down my bike. But they continued doing stunts on the road. They suddenly came in front of us and applied brakes immediately. Our bike collided against the Enfield...I fell on one side. Sudeeksha fell on her back, received critical injuries on her head and died,” Satyendra Bhati, her uncle, said.“I could not identify the suspects as I was so disturbed. I just noticed ‘Jaat’ written on the Enfield bike,” he said. The uncle added that he was the one driving the vehicle with Bhati on pillion.The Bulandshahr police were yet to register a case in the matter till Tuesday night though a three-member SIT, led by circle officer (city) Diksha Singh and also comprising two crime branch officials, was formed to probe the incident. The police and district administration contradicted the family’s version. Officials said Bhati’s minor brother was driving the motorcycle and that allegations of harassment did not come to light at the time of the incident. They said Bhati and her brother were not wearing helmets.Later, a video clip surfaced, purportedly showing the police recording the minor’s statement from the accident spot. Bulandshahr superintendent of police Atul Kumar Shrivastava said Bhati’s body was sent for a post-mortem examination and an investigation was underway. “The matter of harassment had not come to light at the time of accident. We are probing the matter from all angles,” he said.Bhati, a tea seller’s daughter who topped Bulandshahr district in humanities stream two years ago and won a Rs 3.8-crore scholarship, returned from the US in June in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, her family said. On August 20, she was set to return to Massachusetts, where she was pursuing a graduation course in entrepreneurship at Babson College.Jitendra Bhati, the victim’s father, termed the incident a murder. “The incident took place as they harassed our daughter. She had dreams to work for the society and empower girls. From August 5, she also started online classes for local children. My daughter was scheduled to return to USA on August 20, and hence she wanted to meet her close relatives,” he said.Subhash Singh, station house officer, Aurangabad, said a team visited Greater Noida to meet the woman’s family. “We will register a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code once the team returns with the complaint,” he said. The police were scanning CCTV footage from the area.The bike was driven by Bhati’s brother and the vehicle collided with another motorcycle due to traffic, said Ravindra Kumar, Bulandshar district magistrate. “Local police rushed the victim to CHC Aurangabad where she died. At the time of accident, her brother or any eyewitness had not shared information about harassment. We have launched a probe,” he said.Bhati was the eldest of six siblings and lived in Deri Skaner village in Dadri. Her father runs a tea stall while mother is a homemaker. In 2011, she got admission in a residential school for meritorious and economically underprivileged students in Bulandshahr, from where she completed her Class 12 exams with 98%. She scored well in both SAT and TOEFL — competitive exams used by foreign universities in English-speaking countries to admit students — and subsequently secured a berth in Babson College.“Sudiksha lost her life due to harassment which is shameful and condemnable. How will the daughters prosper? We demand the UP government to act against the criminals,” former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati tweeted.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said: “The incident in Bulandshahr displays the absence of fear of law in UP, and an atmosphere of insecurity among women in the state. It seems the administration does not take incidents like harassment of women seriously. There is need for sweeping changes. There should be zero tolerance towards crime against women.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harassed-in-public-teen-scholar-dies-in-road-accident/story-3NOve0vFO1s9rneCUCT5DK.html
12-08-2020||India||Govt okays Rs 8.7k crore military buys||The defence ministry on Tuesday gave its go-ahead for the purchase of military equipment worth Rs 8,722 crore, including 106 locally-made basic trainer aircraft for the Indian Air Force (IAF), to provide a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign), a defence ministry spokesperson said.Basic trainers figure on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years.The ministry’s defence acquisition council (DAC) accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for buying 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft from state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh. Under India’s defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware. “With HAL having successfully developed HTT-40 prototypes and certification process underway, the DAC approved procurement of 106 basic trainers to address the training requirements of the IAF,” the ministry said in a statement. IAF is expected to order 70 trainers initially, with the remaining 36 to be bought after the operationalisation of the HTT-40 fleet in the force.This is the first step in a long journey ahead, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“While it’s a thumbs-up for the design and development of the HTT-40, HAL has to rise to the occasion now and produce them to a time schedule that the IAF wants. Work ethics would require a change to do that,” Bahadur said.The HTT-40 aircraft has undergone a string of elaborate tests at HAL to demonstrate it is safe for rookie pilots and meets the IAF’s standards for trainer planes. HAL could begin the production of the trainers by early next year.Rookie pilots in IAF go through a three-stage training involving the Pilatus PC-7 MkII planes, Kiran trainers and finally the Hawk advanced jet trainers before they can fly fighter jets. As the Kirans are approaching the end of their service life, some Stage 2 training is being done on the PC-7.The defence ministry in July 2019 suspended business dealings with Swiss plane maker Pilatus Aircraft Limited for one year for violation of a pre-contract integrity pact in a Rs 2,900-crore contract for 75 basic trainers and also factoring in Indian investigations against the planemaker for alleged corruption and irregularities.The contract with Pilatus included a clause for follow-on purchase of 38 more planes.The DAC --- India’s apex procurement body --- also cleared the purchase of an upgraded version of the super-rapid gun mount (SRGM) which is fitted as the main gun on board warships, to improve the navy’s firepower, the statement said. This weapon will be supplied by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited. “The upgraded version of SRGM has enhanced capability to perform against fast manoeuvring targets like missiles,” the statement said.Other defence items cleared for purchase include tank ammunition – the 125 mm APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot). It will have 70% indigenous content. The statement said some of the other approvals given by the DAC will accelerate the purchase of AK-203 assault rifles and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) upgrades.India on Sunday announced that it will ban the import of 101 defence items over the next five years, a significant step towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector.These include artillery guns, light military transport aircraft, conventional submarines, long-range land-attack cruise missiles, assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-okays-8-7k-cr-military-buys/story-NqV0lYA7yv1yWQXYKlubvN.html
12-08-2020||India||India, Nepal to discuss projects amid tensions||An India-Nepal body overseeing the implementation of development projects funded by New Delhi is set to meet in Kathmandu next week, the first high-level contact between the two sides since ties were hit by a border row that erupted last year.The joint oversight mechanism, which was launched in 2016 and reviews progress in bilateral projects, is scheduled to hold a meeting on August 17, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The meeting between Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra and Nepal’s foreign secretary, Shanker Das Bairagi, who jointly chair the mechanism, is being seen by some quarters in Kathmandu as a positive development after the border row took relations to a new low.“The mechanism will only focus on the implementation of India-funded projects in Nepal. However, it could help break the logjam in relations,” said a person.A second person described the scheduled meeting of the mechanism as “part of regular interaction between India and Nepal”. He added, “This oversight mechanism was set up in 2016 to review ongoing bilateral economic and development projects and meets on a periodic basis.”During its seventh meeting in July last year, the mechanism reviewed the implementation of projects such as cross-border rail links, petroleum pipelines, roads, bridges, integrated border check posts, energy, irrigation, and post-earthquake reconstruction.The border row erupted late last year after Nepal objected to the inclusion of the Kalapani region, which is claimed by Kathmandu, in a new map showing the union territory of Ladakh that was issued by India. The row was exacerbated in May, when India opened a new road to the Lipulekh region on the border with Tibet, as this area, too, is claimed by Nepal.Nepal responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, which are all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory. Kathmandu also said New Delhi has not responded to several requests for talks on the border issue, though India said a meeting couldn’t be arranged because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali told The Kathmandu Post on Tuesday: “We don’t have alternatives to talks...We can’t hold our entire ties hostage to the differences over the boundary issue.”Gyawali said Nepal is confident its partnership with India will move in a positive direction. “For the time being, the boundary issues can be isolated...Differences over one issue should not overshadow our entire bilateral relations...We believe in constructive engagement, and the upcoming meeting is just one positive step towards that end,” he added.In recent weeks, the two countries have also engaged in a war of words over the origins of historic figures such as Lord Ram and Gautam Buddha.Nepal on Sunday responded to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s remarks that Gautam Buddha was one of the two greatest Indians for people around the world by saying historical and archaeological evidence shows the founder of Buddhism was born in Nepalese territory. India clarified that Jaishankar had referred to the shared heritage of the two countries.Last month, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli sparked a controversy with his remarks that the “real” Ayodhya is in Nepal and that Lord Ram was Nepalese. He also said Nepal had “become a victim of cultural encroachment” and its history was manipulated.Following protests in India, the Nepal government clarified Oli’s remarks were “not linked to any political subject” and there was “no intention...to hurt the feeling and sentiment of anyone”.Nischal Pandey, director of the Kathmandu-based Centre for South Asian Studies, was quoted by the Nepalese media as saying: “A weekly war of words between Indian and Nepali officials and subsequent issuance of clarifications does not bode well for bilateral ties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-nepal-to-discuss-projects-amid-tensions/story-LD4PtuiU4eZevcCXDxGbJK.html
12-08-2020||India||DGCA bans use of wide-body aircraft at Kozhikode airport for monsoon season||The aviation regulator has banned the use of wide-body body aircraft during the monsoon at Kerala’s Calicut airport, days after an Air India Express flight with 190 people crashed in heavy rain and broke into two after overshooting the table-top runway, killing both pilots and 16 passengers.As a matter of abundant caution we have decided to divert them to neighbouring airports during the monsoon season,” said Arun Kumar, the director general of civil aviation.The aviation regulator is also planning to conduct safety audits across airports in regions that receive high rainfall, he added.Wide-body aircraft like the Boeing 747 and Airbus A350 have a bigger fuel tank and can therefore travel longer distances in comparison with narrow-body planes like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.The Boeing 737 jet on a flight from Dubai, overshot and fell 50 metres off the end of the runway at the Calicut airport in treacherous conditions last Friday, killing 18, making it one of the deadliest commercial aviation disasters in the country in nearly 10 years.The crash occurred around 7.40pm and bore striking similarity to the 2010 Mangalore airport crash when a plane, also an Air India Express Boeing 737, overshot a table-top runway and crashed nose-first.So-called table-top airports have limited space at the ends of the runway, and several international airlines have stopped flying bigger aircraft into Kozhikode because of safety issues. Wide-body aircraft were permitted at this airport from 2019.Concerns were raised following the 2010 Air India Express crash in Mangalore that killed 158 people on board. That year, a court of enquiry report by former Indian Air Force chief Air Marshal BN Gokhale noted that table-top runways require extra skills and caution to navigate. The hazard of “undershooting” and “overshooting”, in particular, can lead to grave situations, the report said.Calicut airport is equipped with Runway End Safety Area (RESA) in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s guidelines on safety, aviation minister Hardeep Puri said on Monday.“ Engineered Material Arrestor System (EMAS) provides safety benefit if less than standard RESA length is available or at airports where RESA cannot be provided due to constraints. Provision of EMAS is not mandatory in a civil aerodrome as per ICAO guidelines,” Puri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-bans-use-of-wide-body-aircraft-at-kozhikode-airport-for-monsoon-season/story-p6WcBONZt0xVHqCLoJzkMJ.html
12-08-2020||India||Rajasthan crisis: Relieved, Congress leaders credit Rahul Gandhi||Congress leaders on Tuesday rushed to give credit to Rahul Gandhi for ending the rebellion in the party in Rajasthan that threatened the survival of its government, and urged him to once again assume the reins of the organisation. The renewed bid to persuade Rahul Gandhi to accept the responsibility came a day after Sonia Gandhi completed one year as an interim Congress president on Monday. “The entire country witnessed as to how after 30 days now the political events in Rajasthan have come to a close. This was made possible on account of the vision and the belief of Rahul Gandhi in carrying all Congress leaders together,” the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, addressing a virtual news conference. “It was due to his farsightedness and nature of carrying along everybody that we were able to resolve the differences. He was also helped by the cooperation and assistance given by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra,” he said and went on to praise both Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot. The crisis ended soon after Pilot met Rahul Gandhi on Monday afternoon. As a way out and to assuage the sentiments of all sides, the party then decided to form a three-member committee to address the grievances of the rebel legislators, including Pilot. In the evening, Pilot and 17 other legislators supporting him met Ahmed Patel, Priyanka Gandhi and KC Venugopal to seek an assurance that the issues raised by them would be resolved amicably. Asked if Rahul Gandhi will take up the Congress president’s post now, Surjewala said not 99% but 100% of Congress leaders and workers want him to assume the responsibility once again. Referring to claims that Rahul Gandhi has refused to return as the party chief, Surjewala said, “I don’t think that anyone of us has recently spoken to him on the issue. When he resigned, he resigned on moral grounds and took moral responsibility (for the 2019 Lok Sabha election loss). What will happen in the future is not for me to comment upon. I am certain that good things will happen in future.” He added the decision will be taken by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and the party at the appropriate time. Senior Congress leader from Kerala, Ramesh Chennithala, also appealed to Rahul Gandhi to once again assume the party chief’s role. “We are passing through an unprecedented crisis and Madam Sonia Gandhi has been struggling despite her health issues to rudder these tempestuous times,” Chennithala said in a letter to Rahul Gandhi. He alleged that the combine of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had “subverted” the basic principles of democracy, resulting in the fall of Congress governments in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. A similar attempt made in Rajasthan was, however, thwarted by Rahul Gandhi’s swift action, Chennithala said. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi also lauded Rahul Gandhi and his team for ending the stalemate in Rajasthan. “Today because of the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and the efforts of Priyanka Gandhi we have managed to keep one of our own, Sachin Pilot with us. This is the democratic spirit of our party where there is room for dissent and debate,” tweeted former union minister Jitin Prasada. In a related development, the party has informed the Election Commission (EC) that Sonia Gandhi will continue to hold the post of president till a new president is elected. In its letter, the party told the EC the process of electing a new president could not be initiated due to the coronavirus disease pandemic and the nationwide lockdown enforced for 68 days till May 31 to slow the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-crisis-relieved-congress-leaders-credit-rahul/story-3z9NGC83zgVNKZLPpPqg9L.html
12-08-2020||India||6 Cong legislators resign in Manipur||IMPHAL Six Congress members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) in Manipur submitted their resignations to the speaker on Tuesday, a day after skipping the session in which chief minister N Biren Singh of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government won a motion of confidence by voice vote. The resignations reduce the Congress’s strength in the House to 18 seats from the 28 it won in the 2017 assembly elections. Manipur has been the only state in northeast where the Congress had a sizeable number of legislators, its presence having diminished in the region because of rapid strides made by the BJP in recent years . Okram Henry Singh, one of the MLAs, confirmed the development. Other party legislators who submitted their resignations to speaker Yumnam Khemchand were Mohammed Abdul Nasir, O Lukhoi, P Brojen, Ngamthang Haqokip and Ginsuanhau, who uses only one name. The resignations cited the legislators’ lack of trust in the Congress and were submitted while the House was in session, Henry Singh said.Later on Tuesday, Speaker accepted five resignations except of P Brojen, against whom disqualification proceedings are pending under 10th schedule of the Constitution with the speaker. In the house with an effective strength of 53, only 16 of the 24 Congress MLAs were present on Monday, enabling the BJP-led government to sail through the trust motion 28-16, with the speaker not voting. Besides the six who resigned, the two others wrote to the assembly secretariat that they would not be attending as they had just returned from outside the state and were being tested for Covid-19. Their test results are yet to come in. These MLAs, Mohammed Fazur Rahim and Yamthong Haokip, could not be contacted because their mobile phones were switched off. CM Singh moved the confidence motion on Friday after the opposition Congress moved a no-confidence motion against the government over alleged failure of the government to institute a CBI inquiry into a drug peddling case involving a BJP leader. On his resignation, Henry Singh said: “Even though I’m born and brought up with the Congress, I’m compelled to resign as per the wishes of the people in my constituency.”Henry Singh, who was elected for the first time on a Congress ticket in the 2017 assembly elections, said the six legislators who quit the assembly will also be giving up their primary membership of the Congress by submitting their resignation letters to the state party president.Abdul Nasir said the MLAs resigned because of a lack of trust in the leadership of the Congress legislature party, which is headed by former chief minister O Ibobi Singh.“This is murder of democracy in and outside the house,” Ibobi Singh said. The inability of the Congress to form the government despite winning 28 seats in the house of 60 in the 2017 assembly elections and the party’s loss in the recent Rajya Sabha elections are also reasons for the resignations, Nasir said. The BJP won 21 seats and got support of smaller parties --- the National People’s Party (4), Nagaland People Front (4), Trinamool Congress (1), Lok Janshakti Party(1) and the lone independent MLA -- to form a government. The 60-member Manipur assembly was reduced to a strength of 53 after four members were disqualified under the anti-defection law and three BJP members resigned. With the latest resignations, the effective strength of the house has been reduced to 47.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-cong-legislators-resign-in-manipur/story-8lDbEmG1YXY0cc6NsDnVNI.html
12-08-2020||India||Have no animosity, no ill will towards the CM: Sachin Pilot||Rajasthan’s former deputy CM Sachin Pilot spoke to HT about his revolt, why he went incommunicado along with 18 MLAs, his response to personal remarks by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, what he gained from the dissent, and the road ahead. Edited excerpts: What have the last 30 days been like for you?About three-four weeks ago, I was served a notice under sedition charges and as deputy chief minister and party president, I felt it was unwarranted. A lot of us were deeply hurt by that, and a few of our colleagues wanted to come to Delhi to tell the party organisation not just about the one issue, but also about many things we had been contemplating for long. Once that started, a lot of other developments happened, but I think ultimately the objective was to bring the grassroots feedback to the leadership. We were well within our rights to raise the issue within the party forum, and we said that we were raising the issue as Congressmen, as legislators. I don’t think anything we did was at all anti-party.You say it wasn’t anti-party, but a lot of Congress leaders who were supporting you later said that you could have done it without going incommunicado along with 18 MLAs.The minute we came to Delhi to air our views, the next day itself a lot of acrimonious action started in Jaipur -- FIRs, police cases. A lot of our colleagues felt they would there would be coercive action by the police and administration. I want to place on record that we were here in Delhi, wanting to place our views and wanting to be heard. I think the reactions that came out from Jaipur and the actions that followed, it didn’t give any confidence to the legislators that we are moving in the right direction. As far as the opposition party (Bharatiya Janata Party) is concerned, trying to take advantage of what is going on, they have done some politics. We had made very clear from the beginning that there was no question of leaving the party or joining any other party.Let’s go back to the sequence of events on July 10, when the crisis in the Congress’s Rajasthan unit started. Couldn’t you have spoken to the Gandhis then like you did yesterday?There are people in different hierarchies responsible for the communication within the party leadership in Delhi and Rajasthan. Those channels didn’t work out very well, as we know in hindsight. Because the actions were being taken very quickly in Jaipur, between the notices and court cases and suspensions, it came to pass that we had to do what we had to do. Because if we didn’t fight and stand up for what we believed in, we wouldn’t be here today. I’m very happy that the Congress president has now assured all of us that a timebound road map is being evolved to redress issues that were raised.When you were incommunicado, what was the objective in your mind?First of all, all of us were here in Delhi and were never incommunicado; we were talking to people, we were moving around. I met a lot of colleagues, and it was not as if anyone was bound anywhere. But yes, some of my colleagues felt apprehensive of the police. The kinds of things that were said while we were here making our grievances heard, it wasn’t charitable, to say the least.Let’s talk about that -- your former boss said that you are nothing but a good-looking face,that your qualifications were just that you spoke English, and otherwise you were a nikamma and nakaara (good for nothing). At that time, did you think that maybe you needed to look at another party?No, no, not for a moment. But I have to admit when I heard some of the language used against me, it did deeply hurt me. I felt I was wronged and aggrieved, and then to hear the things that I heard. To say the least, it wasn’t charitable and was unparliamentary. But two wrongs don’t make a right -- I’m not going to retort in the same tone and tenor. I chose not to respond. I swallowed that bitter pill and it was the best thing to do at the time.The Congress said that throughout that their door was open .What made you talk to them on Monday and not before?I know what everyone was saying, but the actions were totally opposite. A lot of our colleagues who were ministers were now police suspects. Those actions were also a major aspect of what went on in the past few weeks.Would you care to share the role Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi played in the entire episode? Was Priyanka in touch with you throughout?Priyanka did come last night when the MLAs were there, and had a detailed discussion with every single one of them. We appreciated her taking time out and, as a general secretary of the party, she’s played a role. I met Rahulji and Priyanka Gandhi yesterday in Mr Gandhi’s house and, as then party president, it was Rahul Gandhi who said to me that I should work as deputy CM. He chose Mr Gehlot as chief minister and he did lean on me to become deputy and continue as state unit president. But in the last 18 months, what has transpired... I had to share because it was important for the party to know.The CM said in the 18 months since the Rajasthan government was formed, he’s never spoken with you. Is that true?(Laughs) I didn’t say that, the CM has said that. But it gives you an insight of what the happenings were there. When I was party president for five years, I didn’t seem to have those disqualifications and negativities attached to me. Just in 18 months, they have come to the fore? Bringing a party back to power when we were down to 21 MLAs after elections were lost when Ashokji was CM. At that time, Rahul Gandhiji asked me to be state chief and showed faith in me. Even though I was younger than other leaders, it was my responsibility to take everyone along. There were differences even then but, as head of the family, I left no stone unturned to carry everyone under one umbrella. I think the same course applies for the head of the government. In the end, it is the CM who held on to the support and you couldn’t get the numbers together...It’s never a competition about who’s got more. Whoever the party makes CM will have the majority. The number of MLAs and leaders who had things to say were depending on me to be their voice. I did that. Thirty days later, you are no longer the deputy CM or Rajasthan Congress chief. Do you regret it?If you are taking a position just to have a house and a car, I don’t think it’s worth anyone’s time. As a political person, you are there to do a job, to do governance, to deliver development; and if you don’t have the space and the resources and the authority to do that, then mere positions don’t matter. I have said that whatever the party wants me to do, I am happy to do it, I have done it for more than 20 years and leadership can decide what my role can or cannot be.What will you tell the CM when you meet him on the 14th?I have nothing but kind words and warmth to offer him at a personal level. Professionally, our objectives should remain the same - to deliver to the expectations of the people of Rajasthan. I have no animosity, no ill will, no negative sentiment towards him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-no-animosity-no-ill-will-towards-the-cm-pilot/story-SCAN0iZp34RYL3PHYg1R4K.html
12-08-2020||India||Real battle is to save democracy in country: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot spoke to HT about the resolution of the political crisis in the state, how his 100 supporters did not break rank, the return of his former deputy Sachin Pilot to the party fold, and what lies ahead for his government. Edited excerpts: Now that the crisis in the state is over, are you relieved? The current situation in the country and also in states clearly indicates that democracy is under threat. See what happened in Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Manipur, Karnataka, and recently in Madhya Pradesh – democratically elected governments were ousted through money power. Everyone knows what is happening. We have won the first round, but there is a long battle ahead. Our battle is to save democracy and we will continue to fight this battle till we emerge victorious. There are reports that legislators supporting you are not happy with the way the party resolved the issue and welcomed Sachin Pilot back. Is that correct? The decision of the high command is final, and we all respect that. We thank the determination and grit of all our 100 legislators. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and others tried everything to woo them, but they stood firm like a rock and not a single legislator broke ranks. I spoke to each one of them and pacified them. Their sentiments are attached with the Congress. I should also thank the people of Rajasthan for their support. They used to call our legislators and tell them that even if you have to stay together for months, do that, but ensure that the BJP does not succeed in its nefarious designs. It is unprecedented in the Indian history that so many legislators stayed together for such a long period. Their only aim and motive was to save the government. Will you still go ahead with the floor test now that you are comfortably placed? We will decide that once the assembly session starts. That is a call we will have to take. Are you ready to forgive the rebel Congress legislators who are back in the party fold now? We have to show large-heartedness when democracy is in danger. I believe in the concept of forgive and forget. The high command has taken a conscious and well thought out decision and all of us are with the high command. Some of your party leaders claim that it is not all over yet. They say there will be other attempts to destabilise your government. Are you prepared to counter any such move? I know it is a long battle but we are ready to face any challenge and defeat the BJP in carrying out its anti-democratic steps. The BJP had also shifted some of its legislators to Gujarat. Were your party colleagues in touch with some of them? The BJP was trying to break us and indulged in horse-trading, but it is also facing massive internal factional fights. They were scared that some of their legislators might break away due to factionalism. There were some in the BJP who did not want the party to topple the government because it has never been a tradition in Rajasthan. A few days ago, I wrote a two-page letter to BJP legislators stating that once some BJP members were trying to topple the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat government. I told them that I, as state Congress president at the time, wrote to Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and Rajasthan governor Bali Ram Bhagat, saying that we are not part of the bid to topple Shekhawat’s government. I have always been against any move to oust a democratically elected government. So, I wrote to them to take that into consideration. The BJP also cancelled its meeting today as it is clearly on a back foot. Your party leaders are giving credit to Rahul Gandhi for resolving the crisis. What do you have to say? Both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi played an active role. It is laudable and shows their leadership qualities. The party has also formed a three-member committee to address the issue. I welcome that decision also. Sachin Pilot is saying that derogatory remarks were used against him by you -- you said he was good for nothing -- but he did not reciprocate? As I said earlier, it is time for everyone to move on and strengthen the party and the government in Rajasthan. Will you welcome Pilot back into your government, should the situation arise?A three-member committee is being formed by the Congress president. It will decide on this, along with the party high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/real-battle-is-to-save-democracy-in-country-gehlot/story-v5UcxWE2AbFqVRBy72JvrO.html
12-08-2020||India||Govt’s power boost for Andaman to make islands key hub of Indo Pacific||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who launched India’s first undersea optical fibre project this week, has stepped up his government’s efforts to give Andaman and Nicobar Islands its first big power project as part of a continuing massive effort to upgrade infrastructure in the archipelago of over 572 Islands in the Bay of Bengal.PM Modi had laid the foundation stone for the 50 megawatt gas-based power plant at Hope Town in South Andaman during his visit to the island in December 2018. One tender to establish the plant has been issued and the bids will be opened on 28 August; bids to set up the gas infrastructure and supply of gas will be opened on 18 August.Senior officials said the different projects are part of the government’s overarching vision for the islands and use them as a springboard to open up new opportunities for India in South-East Asia. It was in this context, one official said, that PM Modi on Monday unveiled plans to build a transshipment port at Great Nicobar Island.PM Modi said this would give ships an alternative to similar ports in the region.Officials said New Delhi wants to pitch the proposed Rs 10,000 crore port to be built at Great Nicobar Island as an alternative to other ports in the neighbourhood including those in Sri Lanka and Indonesia’s Banda Aceh.“The idea is to turn Andaman into a major transportation hub that is at the heart of India’s Look East policy,” a second government official said. Already, plans are afoot to expand the runway at the Campbell bay airport.The proposed port lies at the mouth of the Strait of Malacca, the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. This is one of the most important sea routes. More than 90 percent of crude oil volumes flowing through the South China Sea transits the Malacca Strait.The port is also located strategically near the proposed Kra Isthmus Canal, also known as the Thai Canal, that would connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea and shorten transit for oil shipments to Japan and China by 1,200 km.Against this background, officials said the need for a steady and clean power source is crucial for expansion of infrastructure. So far, diesel is the predominant source of the electricity mix of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The 50 MW plant will supplement the 20 MW solar power project commissioned by the Neyveli Lignite Corporation. This plant has been integrated with an 8 MWh battery energy storage system. A 5 MW solar plant set up by NTPC is already in operation.A power ministry official said the power distribution in the islands is already being privatized under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative. The transaction advisor has already completed discussions with the union territory’s power department and the ministry of power in Delhi and are expected to complete the transaction documents by September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andaman-nicobar-to-get-the-power-boost-as-part-of-islands-infra-upgrade/story-yMtBOkBjGgCv7XyTtky6IJ.html
12-08-2020||Editorials||Kamala Harris and her rise | HT Editorial||The tale of the incredible Indian living the American dream continues with Kamala Harris’ selection as the Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate. If Joe Biden wins the November elections, as the polls currently predict, Ms Harris, half-Indian, half-Jamaican, and all-American, will be a heartbeat away from being the world’s most powerful person. Her prospects are even better in the future: Mr Biden has repeatedly hinted he will be a single-term president making Ms Harris a shoo-in for the Democratic candidacy in 2024. Ms Harris represents the political pinnacle of the Indian-American community’s meteoric rise in the United States (US). Numbering barely 4.5 million and mostly first-generation, Indian-Americans have emerged as the US’ most highly educated and most wealthy ethnic group. However, what has been even more remarkable is the speed with which they have entered domestic politics. Winning elected office is the most difficult barrier of acceptance for an immigrant community to cross. Despite the relatively young provenance of the Indian-American community, it can already boast of two state governors, 10 national legislators, and, now, a vice-presidential candidate.Mr Biden’s choice of Ms Harris fulfils his public promise to choose a female running mate. Since she is identified as a black American politician with the larger US public, he also paid off a debt to the community which saved his campaign. Through her identity, she is a symbol of racial, ethnic and gender equality at a moment when social justice movements have rocked the country. Among these, the fact that she is an Indian-American was arguably the least important element of her profile when it came to the reasons Mr Biden chose her. That should not be a concern. Being an Indian-American means you are from a community that is too small, too liberal and too well-off to be a political consideration. Nonetheless, it is striking that Latinos, a community that can claim to have been part of US history for over four centuries, have yet to have one of their number chosen to share a presidential ticket.The success of the Indian-American community in becoming part of the US mainstream also means that no one should expect Ms Harris to see India in any special light. She will be more familiar with India than the average American. She will not be necessarily more sympathetic. Her voting record shows her to be more liberal than Mr Biden and, therefore, less than aligned with the Narendra Modi government. Ms Harris has been chosen as a flag bearer of inclusivity, a living antidote to four years of President Donald Trump. She will, unless given reasons otherwise, tend to have a sceptical view of India’s rightward political turn, whatever her sentiments about her mother’s homeland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/kamala-harris-and-her-rise/story-sdjtJGJL80O3SDBWKfjGII.html
12-08-2020||Editorials||A push for gender equality | HT Editorial||In a move that upholds gender equality under the law, the Supreme Court (SC) has expanded the rights of Hindu women to their father’s property under the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, even if they were born before the change, or the father was not alive at the time of the amendment. If the woman died before the amendment came into force, her share can be passed on to her children. There have been several amendments to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, but none gave unconditional rights to women with regard to property.The latest interpretation by SC removes male primacy over Hindu ancestral property. But it has taken the precaution of adding the caveat that registered settlements prior to December 2004, when the amendment was tabled in the Rajya Sabha, cannot be opened to avoid a deluge of litigation. It is a major push for women who lack economic resources and are often marginalised by male members of the family. The fact that a law — not just a will — decides women’s property rights is significant.However, the challenge of ensuring that women are actually empowered by this legal provision remains; many progressive legal rights fall by the wayside as women do not know that they exist. This must be rectified. The SC’s provision gives women a level-playing field in legal rights over property, and is a game-changer in the larger canvas of gender rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-push-for-gender-equality/story-gDrK5thDCi0JfrlYXltl9I.html
