23-08-2020||News||In real contempt of the Constitution||The Supreme Court (SC) of India seeks to protect its dignity by proceeding in contempt against Prashant Bhushan whose tweets, the court believes, have shaken the confidence of the people in the institution. On this, opinions may differ. Some would say that, in the recent past, both the court’s judgments and actions have contributed more significantly in shaking public confidence in the institution. Punishing Prashant Bhushan is not likely to restore it.But there is a more blatant contempt being witnessed that the SC has failed to address. It is the contempt that the State and its institutions have for the Constitution and the laws, which has shaken the foundations of our democratic values, even as the institution that is obliged to protect those values looks helplessly on.Recently, the High Court (HC) of Rajasthan dealt with the merger of six members of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) legislative party into the Congress. The merger happened on September 18, 2019. While the politics of disruption was being played out in the open, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), opportunistically, moved a petition in the HC seeking to disqualify the six BSP Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The speed with which this matter was taken up by the HC was evidence, perhaps, of the touching concern of the court for upholding constitutional values, which the BJP allegedly espouses. A single-judge bench of the HC was to dispose of the matter of the disqualification immediately. The SC has kept the matter pending awaiting the judgment of the HC. At the same time, the court was aware of the constitutional values being thrown to the winds when the governor chose not to call the assembly session, contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers. Let us shift to the events that happened in Goa on July 10, 2019 when 10 Congress MLAs, representing two-thirds of the Congress presence in the assembly merged with the BJP legislative party — the opposite of what happened in Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, the BJP considers the merger of BSP MLAs to be illegal but in Goa, the merger is alleged to be perfectly legal. In Rajasthan, the matter is fast-tracked in court but in Goa, the Speaker has not shown any urgency to decide the disqualification and the matter is now pending in SC, where it is being adjourned whenever taken up. No urgency, though a year has gone by. In Goa, the BJP is the beneficiary of the merger but in Rajasthan, it chooses to challenge it to bring down the government.In Manipur, the situation is even more bizarre. Between April and July 2017, eight MLAs of the Congress, by their acts, showed open allegiance to the BJP. Petitions to disqualify them were filed in November 2018. The Speaker chose to keep the petitions pending. It was only on January 21, 2020, that the proceedings gained some momentum when SC directed that all pending disqualification petitions before Speakers across India be decided in three months. In Manipur, the Speaker’s orders are under challenge. Hopefully, the court will show the same urgency in deciding these matters as the court did in Rajasthan.No other Speaker has honoured the SC judgment by deciding on such disqualification petitions within the time-frame prescribed by it.In Tamil Nadu, disqualification petitions have been pending before the Speaker since March 2017. The term of the Assembly ends in 2022.In Madhya Pradesh, disqualification petitions against 19 Congress MLAs who joined the BJP were filed in March 2020. But only a pro-tem Speaker adorns the chair. A duly-elected Speaker alone can deal with them.Speakers of legislative assemblies seek to protect the members of the party to which they belong and choose to delay, for one reason or another, resolution of disqualification petitions. Courts, time and again, have chosen not to interfere. This gives constitutional protection for openly unconstitutional acts. The Speaker does not decide on these matters for years, and if courts cannot direct the Speaker to decide them, then those who have openly defied the constitution continue to be members of legislative assemblies without any judicial resolution. The courts’ inaction allows for the perpetuation of an illegality.There is yet another dimension of the manner in which elected governments are toppled. With new platforms of information, the goings-on in destabilising governments are matters of public knowledge. Willing legislators are flown out in chartered flights, cloistered in five-star facilities with the sole intent of usurping power by blandishments offered to willing takers. This display of arrogance of power and disregard for constitutional values have now become the cornerstone of political activism.It is the contempt for India’s constitutional values and laws that is a wake-up call for those who, under our constitutional scheme, have the duty to protect them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-real-contempt-of-the-constitution/story-DFGPvHbvtFMoBsywNv4huO.html
23-08-2020||News||To send a message, it is time to ban Chinese firms from India’s 5G trials||It is now obvious that the moves by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh this summer were premeditated, planned and smoothly executed. This comes through when you consider the strength of the troops involved as well as the multiple locations where action has been seen. There were certain military objectives set out for PLA and at least some, if not all, of those have been achieved. In the process, China has violated many of the agreements with India on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity on the border. Having done so, China has indicated that it is neither going to vacate its military aggression nor restore the status quo ante. Several rounds of diplomatic as well as military negotiations aimed at de-escalating the situation in the western sector of the India-China border have proved this. From the statements of Chinese diplomatic envoys as well as other interlocutors, with whom this writer has had the opportunity to interact virtually, China’s diplomatic game plan is also becoming apparent. Having accomplished much that it had planned militarily on the ground, China intends to make these positions permanent and amass the gains. Simultaneously, it will do all it can to ensure that the rest of the India-China relationship continues its normal course and that it is business-as-usual in economic relations, in people-to-people exchanges and in multilateral engagements. That is its game plan. Chinese diplomacy fully intends and hopes to reach this goal. If it is allowed to do so, it will truly be a win-win for China.If China accomplishes this diplomatic objective vis-à-vis India, it will be able to show the world that India has accepted the new military realities on the ground in Ladakh. By extension, other countries should not worry about the implications of China’s moves on its border with India and about aggressive Chinese behaviour. It will also cement China’s pre-eminent position in the Asian pecking order.Incidentally, this has also been China’s playbook in the South China Sea and has been pursued with finesse and success there. It is only now that the United States (US) is beginning to challenge such obviously unacceptable actions, even as countries in the region continue to be diplomatically bogged down with negotiating a code of conduct while China merrily continues with its armed military aggression. A further implication for India if it were to quietly acquiesce in this Chinese game plan is that there will be nothing to stop PLA from repeating its actions later this year, or next year or the next. This will merely be in line with Chinese activities elsewhere. We must be clear-headed and practical to see through Beijing’s military-diplomatic manoeuvres.Former Chinese ambassadors, retired PLA officers as well as international relations experts that I have had occasion to interact with, repeatedly stated that China does not view India as a strategic enemy. Hence, the argument goes, the rest of the India-China relationship should be normalised as soon as possible, particularly as this is the 70th anniversary year of the establishment of diplomatic ties. In response, when they were told that if this was indeed the case, then China should find it easy to restore the status quo ante in Ladakh, there was stony silence from them. For all these reasons, it is of utmost importance for India to send a clear message to China, that we view PLA’s actions in Ladakh as a serious test for the relationship. The tactical inference that India has drawn is that China desires to unilaterally decide where the Line of Actual Control (LAC) lies. The strategic implication is that China is clearly exhibiting that it is the regional hegemon in Asia, that it can do as it pleases in its neighbourhood, and that the 21st century is not an Asian century but solely a Chinese century. Through the military action in Ladakh, where the Indian Army fought bravely and heroically, New Delhi has conveyed that it does not accept any of these propositions and that it shall stand up to Chinese bullying. Now, New Delhi needs to ensure that China’s diplomatic playbook does not succeed. India-China relations cannot be business-as-usual. The ban on Chinese mobile phone apps, changes in public procurement policies aimed at weeding out Chinese companies, and an added level of scrutiny in India’s investment apparatus are all good first steps. While China is worried, especially because India’s actions have had a snowballing effect, for example, in the ban on TikTok, it still appears that our message has not been heard loud and clear in Beijing. If peace cannot prevail in the India-China border areas, then the rest of the relationship cannot continue as before. India-China relations will be negatively impacted. Therefore, New Delhi needs to reinforce this clear-cut position by taking some more steps and measures to amply clarify the revised Indian policy toward China. One of the loudest signals that we can send is to ban Chinese firms from India’s 5G trials and roll-out. New Delhi needs to announce this decision soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-send-a-message-it-is-time-to-ban-chinese-firms-from-india-s-5g-trials/story-WItzCk3Yt40Uuoumg5sPSI.html
23-08-2020||News||When India defeated China at the United Nations||As a member of the UN Security Council in 2011-2012, India beat China. Here is how. UN member-states are divided into five geographical groups, and every effort is made to avoid contests in elections to various UN bodies by ensuring clean slates, i.e. the number of candidates and seats allotted to the group match. Contested elections, therefore, tend to be high prestige diplomatic battles. China, at least pre-Covid-19, was a heavyweight player, with its aid bounties spread across the developing world and the heft of its veto-bearing permanent membership of the SC. The Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) is the UN’s independent oversight and evaluation arrangement. It is based in Geneva with 11 members (known as inspectors) serving in their personal capacity. The tradition is for an inspector to serve two five-year terms at a stretch. The inspectors are elected (technically “appointed”) by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and not chosen by the Secretary-General.Till 2011, India had an inspector only once at the JIU from 1968-1977. After informal conversations within the Asian group, India put up its Permanent Representative in Geneva, who was retiring soon, as a candidate for the JIU for the five-year term (2013-2017). China was completing a ten-year stint in 2012 and should have taken a break from the JIU. But it also announced a candidate for the one seat at the JIU from Asia for the same term. This set up a straight contest between India and China. In October 2010, India had been elected to the Security Council (SC) following a huge campaign, and after securing a record 187 votes from 192 UN member-states. While service on the SC, rather than elections, was our priority, China had left us little option but to contest. We obviously left no stone unturned in New York, with the Permanent Representative himself in the lead, as we vigorously pursued our outreach and made deals with all UN member-states.The election was on November 22, and the process began a little after 10 am. Since voting in the UN is in person, I was immediately struck by the thin attendance as I entered the UN General Assembly hall. My immediate instinct was to ask all my colleagues in the Permanent Mission to get on to their cellphones and gently but persuasively push delegates, especially from favourably disposed countries, to rush to the UNGA. Anticipating such a situation, we had prepared an extensive directory of mobile numbers of election officers in other Permanent Missions. The next shock was a young diplomat from a neighbouring country, generally thought to be friendly to us, being wary of giving a thumbs-up response. Without realising that it would be late in the night in his capital, I dialled our ambassador there and received confirmation that the country was going the other way. But it had to be chin-up and confidence as the ballot papers were circulated, collected, and then counted.Finally, just after noon, the result was announced: India had received 106 out of 183 votes cast. China 77. What a victory!Nothing could have pleased us more than conveying the result to New Delhi. This was, perhaps, the only time that India and China had faced off at the UN in an election and we had prevailed and that too decisively. Incidentally, the Chinese candidate was their ambassador in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/when-india-defeated-china-at-the-united-nations/story-EpSng4cfrdy01jIHlfd3mL.html
23-08-2020||Mumbai||Education department extends deadline for part 2 of FYJC application||The state education department has extended the deadline for students to complete the second part of the application for admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJC) to August 25. The earlier deadline for filling up the form, which consists college preferences, was August 22. “This extension is only for students who have already filled their forms but are yet to finalise and lock them due to some or the other reasons,” said an official from the department. In a circular issued on Saturday, the department also stated that students, who have registered on the portal and applied for admissions under various quotas but have failed to validate the one time password (OTP) to confirm their seats, will be given time until August 25 to update their status. As per the schedule, the entire process for quota admissions was supposed to be complete by August 22. “If a student does not get an OTP due to a technical reason, he/she should not be denied admission solely for this. Time will be given until August 25 to update it,” states the circular. This year, the admission process for FYJC has been made zero contact. While admissions under various quotas like minority, management and in-house generally have to be done at the college level, the education department has been facilitating them to make the process zero contact. As part of this, students get an OTP on their registered mobile numbers. The colleges then call the students on the number and feed in the OTP in the online database to confirm a seat. As OTPs are time-bound, several colleges and students struggled to complete the process. In view of this, the department has now removed the time limit on entering OTPs. The office of the deputy director will release the first general merit list on August 25 consisting details of all students so that they can verify and rectify in case of any error. Until Sunday, 2.26 lakh students had filled their college preferences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/education-department-extends-deadline-for-part-2-of-fyjc-application/story-9YlBNaAQoXNHvgv8lF661K.html

Against the orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Saturday and yellow alert (heavy rain in isolated areas) for Sunday, the city and suburbs received only sporadic light showers over the weekend. Between 8.30am Saturday and 8.30am Sunday, 14.2mm rain was recorded in the suburbs while 3mm rain was recorded in south Mumbai.

However, more rain was recorded over parts of south Konkan and central Maharashtra districts,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. Owing to the drop in rain activity and cloud cover, the minimum temperature was a degree Celsius above normal at 26 degrees Celsius on Sunday while the maximum temperature was close to the normal mark.Hosalikar added that some areas towards the northwestern suburbs of Mumbai received moderate showers ranging between 40-70mm. “Satellite images are now showing dense cloud cover over the Gujarat region, which may lead to extremely heavy showers but only a few passing showers are expected for Mumbai and surrounding areas,” he said. Between June 1 and August 21, the suburbs and south Mumbai have recorded 66% and 67% excess rain than the normal for this period. Maharashtra overall has recorded 19% excess rain for the season so far. Lakes supplying drinking water to Mumbai stand at 92.3%.

The CBI has till now not arrested the mastermind behind Dabholkar’s murder, and till date, no charge sheet has been filed in all the four cases, he said. Nikole also claimed that the CBI was taken up with the actor’s death probe only because the Bihar elections are due in a few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/masterminds-behind-dabholkar-lankesh-murder-still-not-arrested/story-RMQ4tRcI7sh4kZ1wCrznHM.html

The order was made available on June 20.The decision was made as a part of an order issued in an application made by a resident of Karishma Society in Kothrud. The application was regarding the noise pollution caused by a construction site near the applicant’s society.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), MPCB, senior police inspector of Alankar police station, and the developer whose site was the subject of the application were the named in the application.“We are currently monitoring noise levels during the Ganapati festival. We collect and upload the data on our website, after the ten-day festival. These are special drives for occasions like Ganpati festival, Diwali among others. A daily monitoring station, I remember, are set up in areas like Kandivali, Goregaon and others in Mumbai. Those could be set up in Pune too but I’m not the right person to comment on it,” said Pratap Jagtap, sub-regional officer, Pune-1, MPCB, Pune.The onus of noise pollution data collection and analysis is on the state PCB as per Rule 4 of Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.“The respective state pollution control boards or pollution control committees in consultation with the Central Pollution Control Board shall collect, compile and publish technical and statistical data relating to noise pollution and measures devised for its effective prevention, control and abatement,” read rule 4 of Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.The NGT order states, “The data so collected must be published and daily at a certain time to be fixed by the State PCB and should be put on the public domain.”After the application was filed, the NGT had asked for a committee to monitor the noise levels near the construction site. A committee visited the spot in June and submitted a report to NGT.“The committee found that the construction equipment was causing noise pollution. NGT has taken cognizance that for the citizens of Pune city, state, as well as the country, this is an issue. They have now asked for effective implementation of noise pollution rules. Therefore, the order directs MPCB to collect noise pollution data and put it in the public domain,” said advocate Saurabh Kulkarni who was representing the applicant.“What mechanism is to be used is the decretion of MPCB. If you see the Maharashtra government notification of the Noise Pollution Rules, you will see that the responsibility of reducing noise pollution is that of PMC,” he said.Moreover, the committee readings find that the noise levels were high in the area even when the construction was shut.A 2009 government resolution also points out that the noise pollution complains regarding construction site should be handled by municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngt-asks-mpcb-to-monitor-noise-levels-in-pune-publish-data-on-daily-basis/story-EFK4GOhgF3Xf70cBAFFXvM.html

At present, over 40,643 persons have tested positive for coronavirus disease in the state, while more than 8.85 lakh samples have been tested so far.Kapurthala civil surgeon Dr Jasmit Kaur said when people come for their Covid-19 tests, they give incomplete addresses and wrong phone numbers due to which the district administration and police have to put additional efforts to reach them. She revealed that this was detected in 20 percent cases. Bawa said the reason behind patients not disclosing their correct details is the fear of taboo and potential impact on their work.In Jalandhar district, which has the second highest number of coronavirus cases in the state, the health officials said such a problem was faced among 4 percent of the patients. The issue has came down to just four or less percent since August, earlier it was a bit higher, they said. To overcome the problem, Jalandhar nodal officer Navneet Kaur Bal said we have asked the civil surgeon’s office to issue a direction to sample collection teams to take two contact numbers along with their complete address.A senior official of the health department admitted that the ratio of such patients could be less as of now but the problem should be addressed soon to curb the spread as even a single infected person could spread the disease to many.In Amritsar, one of the major hotpots of Covid-19 cases, civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said they have been facing difficulty due to wrong phone numbers and inadequate addresses for the past month, which creates hurdle in contact tracing. “The main reason behind the problem is that people are still not willing to come forward due to social issues,” added Kishore.Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu too acknowledged the problem saying that some people didn’t tell their full address, and when they tested positive for the infection, we had to face an uphill task of tracing them. Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said there were just one or two percent of such cases.Ludhiana, where over 9,000 Covid-19 cases have been reported so far, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said they were not facing the problem anymore, though in some cases, patients who tested positive had switched off their cellphones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/officials-on-toes-as-covid-patients-give-wrong-numbers-incomplete-addresses/story-eAvrsOM5YkMoohF7cU0orO.html

Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said the police have seized a Range Rover sedan, Honda City sedan, Honda BR-V sedan, Maruti Suzuki WagonR car, Maruti Swift Dzire car, Tata Tiago car, two Mahindra Scorpio SUVs, a motorcycle and a scooter in the exercise. The seized vehicles would be worth Rs 2 crore, he added.“The seizure of vehicles was carried against four developers who have developed buildings in Shahberi against the violation of building by-laws. the Bisrakh police have registered cases against them under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. The exercise was conducted on the orders of Noida Police Commissioner Alok Singh,” Chander. In the first case, police seized the Range Rover, Maruti Swift Dzire and a scooter of a developer. In the second case, a Tata Tiago was seized. In the third case, four four-wheelers and one motorcycle were seized. In the last case, a Honda City was seized from the developer’s house. In the commissionerate system, the city police are empowered to conduct seizure exercises. Earlier, this power was vested upon the district magistrate. Police have so far registered 81 cases against over 100 developers and also charged 19 of them under Gangster Act and four of them under National Security Act. The Bisrakh police are also conducting search operations to arrest people involved in the unauthorised construction in the area. Frequently, local people claim that despite crackdowns, some developers continue to construct their projects at night. Nine persons had died when two six-storey buildings collapsed in Shahberi in July 2018.

Right now, I cannot disclose the report findings,” he added.Last week, Charanjit Singh, a resident of Dehadka village in Ludhiana district, had submitted a written complaint to the DC alleging that he paid a bribe of ₹3,500 for each test of nine of his NRI family members to get the reports early.“Our flight to Hong Kong was scheduled on August 4. We had only 72 hours to get the test reports. When I reached the Moga civil hospital along with my parents and my sister-in-law’s family on August 2, the doctors informed they cannot conduct our tests that day due to long waiting. In the meantime, one Om Parkash of Moga came to me and said if we paid ₹3,500 per person, the tests would be done that day. We had no option but to pay ₹31,500 for the nine tests,” he stated.Later, Om Parkash also submitted an affidavit to the DC, claiming he had given ₹1.7 lakh to district epidemiologist Dr Naresh Amla to get the reports of 48 NRIs early. He said Dr Amla assured him that if any of them is tested positive, they will be given a fake negative test report.SP Jagatpreet Singh said an inquiry report has been given to the DC, but they have asked the complainant to come again for further investigation. “All the persons who had given bribe to get the test reports are in other countries, so we need to talk to them to clear some facts, after which an additional inquiry report will be submitted. Money was taken for the tests, but right now, I cannot comment on who is guilty,” he added.As per sources, the police have named the doctor guilty in its initial report.FARIDKOT HEALTH DEPT HAD FLAGGED ISSUESuspecting that some patients from Moga had paid bribe to get Covid reports early, the Faridkot district health department had also informed the state authorities about it.Faridkot civil surgeon Dr Rajinder Kumar said some patients who came for the tests had demanded reports at the earliest stating they had paid ₹3,500 for each test in Moga. “So, we informed regarding this to the higher authorities,” he added.A health official said the Moga doctor had requested them to conduct tests of some patients claiming their machine was not working. “During the tests, one of the patients got angry due to the delay and said he had paid ₹3,500 for the same at Moga. We were shocked to hear this, so we informed the civil surgeon,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-report-racket-police-submit-initial-probe-report-to-moga-dc/story-eoZeWDjgjtcfGZudaJFInM.html

23-08-2020||City||As Ghaziabad nears one lakh rapid tests, positivity rate records a dip||As Ghaziabad inches closer to conducting one lakh Covid-19 tests through the rapid antigen tests, the test positivity rate here has come down by 2.67 percentage points since the on-site testing methodology was introduced in the district.The positivity rate in Ghaziabad on August 22 stood at 4.28% down from 6.95 on June 25. Antigen testing kits were deployed in the district on June 26 and within a span of less than 58 days, their share in total testing is at nearly 57.14%.According to records of the district health department, the district, till August 22, had completed around 168,896 Covid-9 tests which included 96,522 administered with rapid antigen kits whose share in total testing is about 57.14%. As many as 7.241 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have been detected in Ghaziabad so far.The test positivity rate through rapid antigen kits, till August 22, is around 2.5%, while with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests—considered the gold-standard for Covid-19 testing—it is about 6.78%, according to the data. Given the lower test positivity rate of antigen tests which constitute more than half of the testing done with other contributing factors, the overall test positivity of the district has declined.Antigen tests are inherently unreliable with poor sensitivity, which means that its ability to detect true positives is low and could result in many negative tests turning positive under an RT-PCR test.“The deployment of rapid kits is definitely a big factor behind the reduced test positivity rate. However, in the month of August, unlike June and July, no major spike in the number of cases has been reported. The viral load is also low and not many people with the infection are developing severe conditions. So, people are less scared of the virus now and lesser number of people are getting themselves tested. However, they must continue to observe precautions,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.Ghaziabad officials said the decline in the positivity rate it because of various other reasons and not just reliance on antigen tests. They added the district is conducting about 3000-3500 samples per day which includes those taken through rapid antigen kits and RT-PCR. “The rapid kits are helpful in getting faster results and determining the positive status of the patients. But it is not the only contributing factor which has reduced the test positivity rate. We have focussed on increasing intensive surveillance activities, conducting household surveys and given special attention to early treatment of patients among others. All these factors have considerably helped us in curbing spread of infection. A reduction in test positivity also means that our steps have yielded results in bringing down the rate,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Currently, the state government has assigned the administration a daily target of 2,000 antigen tests and 540 RT-PCR tests.“We are constantly focussing on more number of tests so that every suspected case is detected and provided treatment. This will further reduce spread of infection. With aggressive and focussed testing, we have been able to reduce fatalities in the past two months and plan to bring down the fatality rate further,” he added. With 67 deaths, Ghaziabad’s mortality rate is 0.93%.Health officials also said they are also conducting RT-PCR tests in some cases where rapid kits produce negative results. The subsequent RT-PCR testing is also done for samples of symptomatic patients who turn negative through antigen tests. Follow-up RT-PCR testing is also done for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases with co-morbid conditions.“We have about 20 teams deployed for testing across the district and also have a stock of about one lakh antigen kits at present. There has been a decline in the number of residents coming in for testing in August which could be a contributing factor in the declining positivity rate apart from the increased surveillance, treatment the administration has been focusing on,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.According to official records, it has been a little over eight weeks since June 26 when the rapid kits were deployed. Every subsequent week since June 26 the testing figures increased gradually and peaked to 16,451 rapid tests for July 24- July 30. Thereafter, every subsequent week starting July 31, the use of rapid antigen kits is on the decline. at 10,068, the least number of antigen tests were conducted between August 14 to August 20. The officials also attribute the low testing due to disruptions by incessant rain earlier this week.“The present situation of the severity of the infections and the stabilisation of the number of daily cases can be termed as a plateau situation. The proposed sero-surveillance study will bring more insight in the near future as to where we stand in terms of the spread of infection,” Dr Jindal said.Sero-surveillance which tests for antibodies for the Sars-CoV-2—the pathogen that causes Covid-19—is conducted to check the exposure of a population to the infection. Sero surveys will start in Ghaziabad, including 10 other districts, from August 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-ghaziabad-nears-one-lakh-rapid-tests-positivity-rate-records-a-dip/story-cDx3aOhaee8HEtTbQwWNJJ.html

However the air quality deteriorated again on Sunday.According to data from CPCB, Noida’s AQI has been at its best in August this year.On Saturday, Noida saw an AQI of 50 on a scale of 0 to 500, which is considered ‘good’, against 84 or ‘satisfactory’ a day earlier. However, the AQI of the city deteriorated again to 65 or ‘satisfactory’.“In Uttar Pradesh cities like Noida, there is a lot of residential construction. There are also a good number of vehicles. Construction and vehicular emissions are the main sources of pollution. Rains do settle down pollutants, but when emissions from other sources are continuous, it affects the overall air quality. Also it has been seen that the region sees patchy rains, which could be a possibility that the average AQI is affected and it hardly reaches a good category,” says Shambahavi Shukla, program officer, air quality, centre for science and environment (CSE). According to the India Meteorological Department’s data, Noida so far saw an average rainfall of 65.3mm till Sunday, up from 32.2mm on Friday August 21.According to the records from CPCB and Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the AQI for Noida in April oscillated from 73 to 184 on a scale of 0 to 500, the AQI for May oscillated between 97 to 160, for June it was between 63 and 272, in July it was between 62 to 160, while in August it has been ranged from 53 to 119 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-one-day-of-good-air-quality-in-noida-so-far/story-XdPQ5OsZubeH2B8FV9H1eK.html

They said that they had no bank account and hence they were not being able to deposit their cash,” he said. “They told me to deposit their money in my bank account and promised commission. They exchanged their money with my Rs 1.05 lakh. When I opened the bundle, I found they were merely paper pieces, with just two notes on the back and front. I searched for them but they had fled the spot,” he said. A case was registered against the suspects under Section 420 (cheating) of IPC. Noida Sector 24 police also filed a case against the two suspects under theGangster Act in July this year. The police said the duo had been exchanging fake notes and making easy money. The DCP Noida said that a police team on Sunday conducted a search at Akhtar’s residence in Delhi and arrested him. “The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody. We have launched a search to arrest his accomplice,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-arrested-for-exchanging-fake-notes/story-9Ej70uxlnim1viLcSv1KbJ.html

23-08-2020||Noida||Birders concerned after Dhanauri camera snatching incident||Saturday’s robbery at Dhanauri wetlands has triggered fear among the city’s birder community, with many expressing apprehension that the incident may project the wetlands in a bad light.Birders said that the incident may incite fear and compromise their liberty of freely birding. On Saturday, three armed men on a motorcycle looted a professional camera, which was worth ₹5 lakh, from 42-year-old Noida-based photographer Narinder Kohli and his uncle Shyam Bhagra, while they were in their car. “We are regular visitors to the area and were shooting a documentary on Sarus cranes. As wildlife enthusiasts, we understand that such incidents are bound to happen but things could be better if patrolling or security is provided to that area,” said Narinder Kohli, who lives in Sector 137, Noida. While the birders stated that they are shocked by this incident, they say a little deterrence like police patrolling in the area could build some confidence among the birders.“It’s shocking and sad as Dhanauri doesn’t deserve bad publicity. Earlier too, there had been an incidence of violence and robbery with birders at Okhla and Surajpur wetland. But never imagined it would ever happen at Dhanauri. Locals are very friendly and helpful there. I just hope that the criminals are nabbed and that they are not locals. Birders will be scared at least for some time to go there,” said Jaswinder Singh Waraich, a city-based birder. “It’s a worrying incident and is bound to instil fear among birders. I have been going to Dhanauri since four years and locals have been very friendly and helpful; they often interact with us and children are curious about the cameras and the lenses, so it’s doubly shocking that it happened there. This (incident) might change some things such as avoid interactions with strangers. A police post in the area or regular patrolling, so that it builds some confidence among the birders, is needed,” said Col (retired) Shyam Sundar Sharma, a Greater Noida-based birder. Narendra Singh Khaira, another birder in Noida, stated that while he would continue solo birding in the region, he believes people would be worried and prefer going in groups. “People will get cautious and go in large groups after this incident. I hope that the culprits are nabbed by the police, which might instil confidence among the birders,” said Khaira.When contacted, Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. said: “We are not aware of the incident as yet. Also, the wetland is not under our jurisdiction yet, it’s a Gram Sabha land, of which some portion is privately owned as well.”According to Noida-based eminent birder Anand Arya, legal protection to the wetland will mount pressure on the authorities to provide security to the area. “I have been going to the area since over six years and never heard about such an incident, which makes it shocking. I urge the authorities to speed up the process of notifying the area as a wetland and a Sarus crane sanctuary. Once notified, the administration will be bound to maintain law and order in that area,” said Arya. “We are working on the case and will solve it soon. It seems the criminals could be local, as they were deep inside the village and were interacting with the victims. We are investigating and ensure that soon we work it out,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida.Spread over an area of 101.21 hectares and divided in two water bodies, the Dhanauri wetlands in Greater Noida are home to over 211 species of resident and migratory birds. The area is also believed to be one of the largest roosting and breeding grounds of Sarus cranes in the region. In 2018, the district forest department had sent a proposal to declare the waterbody as a wetland under Wetland Rules 2017, after which the government in 2019 initiated the process of declaring it a Ramsar site and appointed a nodal officer to the task. As of now, the survey is under process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/birders-concerned-after-dhanauri-camera-snatching-incident/story-9ARJtNB9djSDNOJUClFlML.html
23-08-2020||City||Greater Noida: Wildlife photographer’s camera snatched at gunpoint in Dhanauri Wetlands||Greater Noida: A 42-year-old wildlife photographer’s professional camera worth ₹5 lakh was looted by three armed men in the Dhanauri wetlands on Saturday afternoon. The incident took place when photographer Narinder Kohli and his uncle, Shyam Bhagra, were shooting a documentary on Sarus cranes from their stationary car when three motorcycle-borne men came, and fled with the camera. The Dankaur police have registered an FIR and launched a search for the suspects.Kohli lives in Paras Tierea Society in Noida’s Sector 137 while Bhagra, 52, is a resident of Eldeco Utopia in Sector 93A.“We had parked our Maruti Ciaz on the side of the road and were shooting photos and videos from the car. My uncle was on the driving seat while I was sitting next to him, when three men, presumed to be in their early twenties, approached us on a black motorcycle at around 3pm. They were wearing masks,” he said. Two suspects got down from the motorcycle, approached Bhagra and struck a conversation, Kohli said, adding that the suspects asked them about the camera, about photography, and they wanted Kohli and Bhagra to take their photos. “We informed them that this was a zoom camera which takes photos of distant objects. We told them that next time, we would return with another camera and shoot their photos,” he said. Suddenly, the two youths took out a countrymade gun and pointed it at Bhagra, he alleged. “They tried to snatch his professional camera which weighs about 8-10 kg with lenses. The camera got stuck in the car’s steering and they failed to snatch it. The suspects punched Bhagra in the face, then jumped to my side and pointed a gun at me. One of them shouted, ‘goli maar…goli maar.’ We got scared for our safety. They snatched my camera and fled,” Kohli said. Kohli has fixed a camera on the car’s dashboard in which the incident was captured. “We scanned the footage and found that the suspects had been chasing us for some time,” Kohli said. The victims informed the police and some birders who reached the spot. Dankaur police registered a case against the three suspects under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code. Vishal Pandey, Additional Deputy Commissioner (Zone 3) said it appears the suspects are locals. “We have formed three teams and are conducting search operations to arrest them. The suspects would be arrested soon,” he said. The Dhanauri wetlands, about 11 kilometres from the Buddh International Circuit, is one of the few wetlands supporting a fairly large sarus crane population. However, birders say there is no police check post in the neighbourhood, which makes birding unsafe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-wildlife-photographer-s-camera-snatched-at-gunpoint-in-dhanauri-wetlands/story-ZKHFxlvHdtyRH3xjI2odOL.html
23-08-2020||Gurugram||Biker dies as car driven by minor hits him in DLF Cyber City||A 49-year-old man, who worked as the chief financial officer (CFO) of an electrical manufacturing company, was killed on Sunday morning when the Harley Davidson motorcycle he was riding collided with a Ford Figo car in DLF Cyber City. The police said the car was driven being by a minor boy, who is yet to be apprehended. He was accompanied by his friend in the same car.The accident took place near DLF Rapid Metro station in Phase 2 (see map), around 6.10 am,said the police.The minor seems to have lost control of his car and collided with the motorbike after his vehicle hit a divider and jumped to the other side of the road.The deceased, Alok Gupta, lived in BPTP Park Life in Sector 57. The police said Gupta was riding his black Harley Davidson motorcycle and was accompanied by a friend on another bike. The two were on their way to Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh.Rajesh Khangwal, a government contractor who was on his way from Sector 27 to Karnal on Sunday morning, said that a biker crossed his CRV. But just 50 metres ahead, he saw a speeding car hitting a divider and then colliding with the biker. “I saw the car in the air. It fell on the ground and hit the motorcyclist, before turning turtle thrice. The car was being driven at least 120 km/hour. The driver lost control while racing with two other cars and hit the median of the DLF Cyber City Road. It broke the iron fencing, jumped and landed on the other side, and rammed into the biker,” he said.Gupta was travelling from Golf Course Road to Greater Noida, while the car driven by the minor was travelling on the other side of the road. Khangwal said Gupta was thrown off into the air because of the strong impact of the hit. “I got down from my vehicle. I called the police control room and a private hospital for ambulance. Meanwhile the victim’s friend who was riding behind him reached the spot. There were two minor boys in the car who were also injured,” he said.The airbags of Ford car opened due to the impact. However, both sustained injuries.Rahul Malik, the friend of deceased who is complainant in the case, said in the police statement, that two boys were also taken to the hospital in the same ambulance. The doctors declared Gupta dead after a few minutes.Gupta was wearing protective gears, including helmet, said the police.Adil Nargolwala, a runner, who had crossed the stretch a few minutes before the accident said that the design of the road needs to be looked as the lack of speed breakers has led to accidents in the past. “The quality and design of crash barriers are so poor that cars often flip over to the other side of the road after hitting the barrier. Major changes are required on the stretch for the safety of commuters,” he said.Nargolwala said even the police need to monitor the stretch as people take advantage of vacant roads and drive at high speeds.One of the residents of the nearby Belvedere Towers took to Twitter to write about the incident. “Woke up due to the loud sound. Many people in and around came to help but I don’t think anyone survived. I’m not sure if the people in the car did too. I can’t comment on them being minors as that was not visible.(sic).”The police have registered a case under Section 279 (rash driving) and 304 A (causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at DLF Phase 2 police station.The body of the victim was handed over to the family members after the post-mortem examination and cremated on Sunday evening.Dr Deepak Mathur, forensic expert, Civil Hospital, Gurugram who conducted the autopsy said he died due to multiple fractures and excessive bleeding. His ribs were severely ruptured and he had internal injuries, which led to bleeding. He died within a few minutes of the accident.The police said that the two boys, who were taken out of the car with great difficulty, are residents of Rail Vihar in Sector 57 and South Close Nirvana Country in Sector 50. They are undergoing treatment at the hospital, said the police. KK Rao, commissioner of police said that they have registered the case and are investigating. “We are also checking the CCTV footage from the cameras installed to check the reason behind the accident. DLF Phase-2 station house officer has recorded statements of the eye witnesses which will help build the case stronger and we have deployed two more PCR vans on the stretch which will take rounds of the road and will keep a check on over-speeding,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/biker-dies-as-car-driven-by-minor-hits-him-in-dlf-cyber-city/story-W4ngKN1zkKDJEIcAgnTmXK.html
23-08-2020||Bangalore||Entire Congress Party in Karnataka stands by Gandhi family: state leaders||Amid talks of having a “full time” leadership in Congress that is active in the field and “visible”, leaders of the party’s Karnataka unit on Sunday threw their weight behind the Gandhi family.Ahead of the Congress Working Committee meeting on Monday, state leaders also pitched for Rahul Gandhi to take over the mantle of the party if its current chief Sonia Gandhi wants to step down.The Party’s state unit Chief D K Shivakumar said the entire Congress party in Karnataka stands by the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi family.“Mrs. Gandhi has led the Congress during times of crisis and saved our party.Anything that has to be discussed must be done so in the party forum and not in the media,” he tweeted.Leader of the Opposition in the assembly and Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah termed the development as “unfortunate”.“It is unfortunate that the leadership of Gandhi family is being questioned by a few. In these difficult times of undeclared emergency & attack on democracy by @BJP4India, we should collectively strive to strengthen @INCIndia & not weaken it,” the former Chief Minister tweeted. The tweets by Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar came amid reports that 23 Congress leaders have written to party chief Sonia Gandhi on the leadership issue. Having a “full time” leadership that is active in the field and “visible” in party offices, dissolution of powers to state units and revamping the CWC in line with the party constitution are some of the far-reaching suggestions made by 23 senior Congress leaders in a letter to Sonia Gandhi to revive the organisation, sources said on Sunday. They were also critical of the way the Congress Working Committee, the party’s apex decision-making body, was being constituted and was functioning.Shivakumar has also written to Sonia Gandhi, requesting her not get perturbed by any developments in the party and continue to lead it, or persuade Rahul Gandhi to take up the leadership.“We all stand by you and we go by your decisions and directions.If you feel that it is time to pass on the mantle of leadership, you may do so by kindly persuading Shri Rahul Ji to take up the leadership.We, as loyal and committed Congress workers,will continue to be loyal to you and will wait to be led by you,” he said.Siddaramaiah too later in a series of tweets said Rahul Gandhi should take charge as AICC President “in the interest of our country.” “His leadership will rejuvenate Congress, energise party workers and reassure the people of our country,” he said.“I am confident that Shri.@RahulGandhi, under the guidance of Smt.Sonia Gandhi & other senior leaders, will successfully lead Indian National Congress party.Even our party workers feel the same,” Siddaramaiah said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/entire-congress-party-in-karnataka-stands-by-gandhi-family-state-leaders/story-Kq15YQB0ccw7QdlLpmYFFJ.html

The agency may also review its design, as suggested by experts who inspected the site.Three girders of the 5-km project fell on Thursday at around 9.50pm near Vipul Greens condominium injuring two labourers. Light traffic and the weekend restrictions in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease helped keep casualties down.Senior NHAI officials and consultants to the projected had visited the site on Thursday night along with technical experts. The damaged 40-metre section, NHAI officials said, will be removed within 15 days and fresh girders will be installed.“A team of experts has inspected the site and it will look into the issues which led to crashing of the span. All steps would be taken to ensure such incidents don’t happen,” said RK Pandey, member, NHAI, (Project), who along with a large team inspected the site.The NHAI also directed the contractor to barricade the accident area effectively to ensure no further threat to motorists and workers, and to ensure any further failings of the structure do not result in loss of life. “It has also been decided to increase the frequency of quality control tests, especially after concreting, and test the quality of segments and wings,” said a senior NHAI official who spoke on condition anonymity.Manoj Kumar, member, project, NHAI, who also inspected the site said that all aspects of the collapse would be investigated but it would be difficult to ascribe any reason for the incident without testing. As per the details shared by an official of the contractor, the collapse of the span happened on pier 10 but another end of span was still hanging. The launching and gluing of this segment happened on August 5 and stressing work was completed on August 7. The launcher, which is used to place these spans was shifted from pier 11 to 12 on August 22 evening, the day the span collapsed.“This is a rare incident as we follow all norms and quality control measures. We will probe the incident and take corrective measures,” said JP Gupta, senior official of Oriental Engineering, the contractor.Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI, meanwhile, said that the incident happened within the barricaded area of the site and no work was going on under or above the collapsed span. “The affected areas has been barricaded and more measures are being taken to ensure safety and security of commuters and workers. A private laboratory in Delhi will test the materials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nhai-to-test-concrete-used-in-sohna-elevated-stretch/story-ZMeqwcOorGguacqIbsJUmO.html
23-08-2020||Gurugram||Sohna Road residents fear for safety after flyover collapse||The collapse of a section of the elevated Sohna Road on late Saturday night has left the residents of the neighbouring Sispal Vihar and Vipul Greens, residential societies located opposite the site of the mishap, shaken.Sohna Road divides both these residential societies that are located opposite each other.Few residents of Sispal Vihar in Sector 49 say that they will avoid travelling via Sohna Road for the time being and instead take a slightly longer route via Bakhtawar Chowk. They said that the incident has brought in question the structural stability of the elevated road, with many fearing that it might collapse again.“Even though I realise that this may be a one-off incident, there is still a sense of paranoia in me. I fear the flyover may collapse again. As such, for the time being, I am opting to not drive via Sohna Road and use the arterial routes via Bakhtawar Chowk. It will take me a couple of weeks to travel via Sohna Road again,” said Sanjeev Kumar, a resident of Sispal Vihar.Residents said that they are reminded of similar incidents that have taken place in other parts of India in recent times. For instance, in Kolkata in March 2016, an under-construction flyover had come crashing down, causing more than 50 fatalities. Similarly, an under-construction Delhi Metro bridge near East of Kailash collapsed in July 2009, claiming the lives of five people. Hariharan Seetharaman, a resident of Vipul Greens in Sector 48, said that when the flyover collapsed last night, he felt like his building had been hit by a concrete boulder. “The jolt was worse than any earthquakes I have ever experienced. The entire neighbourhood had come out onto the main road. It immediately reminded me of the incident that took place 11 years ago in East of Kailash and the one which occurred in Kolkata a few years back. We live less than 100 metres away from where the incident occurred. We could have easily met with a similar fate,” he said.Seetharaman said that when he saw over 50-60 government officials standing below one of the slabs of the under-construction flyover on Sunday. It left him worried.“I wanted to go out there and tell them to stand elsewhere as there is no certainty that the slab above may not come crashing down. The whole time they were there, I felt uneasy and uncomfortable,” said Seethraman.Monika Sachdev, a resident of Sispal Vihar, said that the incident reminded her similar mishaps that have occurred in the National Capital Region (NCR) in the past.“I am just grateful that this happened during this period when there were fewer people were out on the roads because of the weekend curfew. Sohna Road is a popular stretch that tends to see a lot of pedestrian activity and traffic movement. Had things been normal, the damage could have been far worse,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sohna-road-residents-fear-for-safety-after-flyover-collapse/story-T5KeHHstvKW9p6y7v4TCOP.html
23-08-2020||Gurugram||Two held for shooting at former ward councillor in Sohna over money dispute||A fortnight after unidentified suspects had fired at a former ward councillor in Sohna, the police on Sunday arrested two men in the case. The police said prima facie, a dispute over money was the reason for the shooting. The police have also recovered two cars and a rifle, which were allegedly used during the crime, from the possession of the arrested men. The two suspects, identified as Krishan from Rohtak and Sachin, a resident of Basai village in Sector 9, were arrested from Sohna. According to the police, on August 10, victim Harish Nanda, former councillor from ward 16 in Sohna, was at his office when at least seven people, including the arrested men, had barged into his office. The police said the main suspect, Sachin, had loaned ‘several lakhs of rupees’ to Nanda’s brother Hemant. Sachin had been demanding his money back for one year. On the day of the incident, Sachin and his several aides went to Nanda’s office to discuss the matter, the police said. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “When Nanda told him that he had nothing to do with the dispute involving his brother, one of the suspects pulled out a gun and fired at him. The bullet missed him and hit a wall in his office. The suspects then escaped in two cars.” The police said the suspects had threatened to kill him and his brother if the money was not paid soon. An FIR was registered against the suspects under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act at City Sohna police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-shooting-at-former-ward-councillor-in-sohna-over-money-dispute/story-VWOb0f8oUXJ7n5a5vCA77L.html
23-08-2020||Gurugram||MCG starts renovation work on Gurugram’s only public swimming pool||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Sunday started renovating city’s only public swimming pool at Kamala Nehru Park, more than 45 years after its construction. As per MCG officials the “state-of-the-art” and the “world-class” swimming pool will be renovated at a cost of ₹3.5 crore. It will be a six-lane swimming pool, equipped with changing rooms, toilets, hot and cold water facilities, and will have a seating capacity of over 50 people.In addition, medical personnel, coaches and lifeguards will also be present at the facility, said the civic body officials, while adding that yoga, gym, cafeteria and restaurants will also be developed near the pool.“We are aiming to build the facility as per world-class standards. Our target is to not only provide residents with a swimming pool for recreational purposes but also a platform for young swimmers to hone their skills and subsequently take part in national and international competitions and make the city proud,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.To mark the commencement, a foundation stone was laid by Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla for the project.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, anti-skid and water-resistant flooring and tiles made out of ceramic, mosaic, polycrete, along with other similar material, will be laid all around the facility. Further, float glass sheet panels will be installed to give viewers a clear view of the pool while also ensuring that water from the pool does not splash on them.Constructed in 1975, the 25-metre long and 12-metre-wide pool has largely been unused since 2016. Over the years, lack of maintenance has left the pool in a decrepit condition. The floor of the pool is often filled with leaves and dirt. Facilities such as benches and toilets are broken, water taps and showerheads missing. Paint on the walls is coming off. Since 2015, various proposals for renovating or demolishing the swimming pool and making way for a new one was floated by various public bodies. However, due to its location near the heavily-congested Sadar Bazaar, lack of available space and land acquisition issues, such plans never came to fruition.In its 2019-2020 fiscal budget, the MCG had reserved ₹70 crore funds for sports and health facilities, of which some money was also set aside for the renovation of the swimming pool.In January, this year, tenders were floated for this project, and a concessionaire was finalised in March. However, due to the imposition of national lockdown in March this year, renovation work had to be pushed back for a few months, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-starts-renovation-work-on-gurugram-s-only-public-swimming-pool/story-F2smHzoZ0HTOLJoFQqRLVK.html
23-08-2020||Gurugram||Two criminals, who escaped Maharashtra Police custody, arrested||Two suspected criminals, who had escaped from the custody of Maharashtra Police last week in Delhi, were arrested by the Faridabad police late Friday night. The two suspects were wanted in over two dozen robberies and ATM loot cases in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Maharashtra, said the police.The two suspects, Nisar, and Irfan, (both identified by single names in police records) were arrested by the Faridabad police on July 22 and were taken into a 10-day production remand (when suspects already in the custody of one state police are taken into custody by police from another state) by the Maharashtra police from Neemka jail in Faridabad.Faridabad police commissioner OP Singh said the suspects, who are in their early thirties, were being brought back to the Neemka prison by the Maharashtra police on the intervening night of August 18 and 19 when they managed to escape. “The police teams had stopped at a hotel in Badarpur for dinner and the two suspects took advantage of the dark and fled from custody misleading the police personnel,” he said.A case under sections 223 (escape from confinement or custody negligently suffered by public servant), 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) and 120b (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against suspects at the Badarpur police station on the night on August 19. The two suspects are brothers and are from Palwal district.Delhi police, Maharashtra police, and Faridabad police were conducting raids to arrest the duo and were tracking movements of their family members to get information about their whereabouts, police officers said.Dharna Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, Faridabad, said a crime team from Sector 56 had received a tip on Friday that both the suspects had taken shelter in Sector 58’s industrial area where they were hiding from the police’s radar. “A raid was conducted and they were arrested from the spot. They possessed a countrymade pistol and two live cartridges,” she said. The police said they were sent to judicial custody on Saturday.Commissioner Singh said both the brothers were taken on production remand by Maharashtra police on August 7 from Neemka jail where the latter were lodged. “ On July 22, we had arrested three criminals—Nisar, Irfan, and their close aide Mukesh Kumar—for their involvement in ATM loots using gas cutters. After a two-day police remand, the three were sent to judicial custody,” he said. The three had looted cash on various occasions early this year after cutting ATM s in areas in Ballabhgarh and Bhupani, and were arrested after an investigation into the cases was launched, said the police. The police then found out about their alleged involvement in various cases of loot and robbery in different states.ACP Yadav said the police had recovered ₹ 3.3 lakh , two cars, two gas cylinders, cutters, and an iron rod from their possession when the arrests were made in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-criminals-who-escaped-maharashtra-police-custody-arrested/story-zZ4n4m4LWcEiuBKJaFrfcI.html
23-08-2020||City||New rights regulator should eliminate unfair consumer contracts||Now that the government has set up the consumer rights regulator — the Central Consumer Protection Authority — one of its first tasks should be to redraw the terms and conditions governing consumer purchases in the country, thereby eliminating all unfair terms in consumer contracts.Take for example, absolutely unjust terms such as “No guarantee for quality of goods sold”, “No refunds, no exchange”, “No guarantee for colour fastness”, “Goods once sold will not be taken back or exchanged” on cash receipts. Retailers have used these unilateral terms for decades to treat consumers shabbily and deny them their rights In fact complaints brought before consumer courts bear testimony to the problems consumers face as a result of such terms and conditions.. In one particular case, where the consumer got caught in the rain and found that the colour of her expensive silk saree was not stable, the retailer blamed her for getting caught in the rain while wearing the saree and said he gave no guarantee for colour. First and foremost, most shopkeepers do not entertain a complaint at any time of the day, particularly if you happen to be the first customer. Some even force you to buy something before they even listen to your complaint. Many receipts specify the days and the time at which any complaint would be entertained- never mind whether that is convenient to the consumer.When confronted with a defective product, I would expect the retailer to apologize and offer a refund , along with compensation for the inconvenience caused. After all, the consumer has to spend the time and money to go back to the dealer with the defective product!But forget compensation, even getting a refund is impossible. If you point to the defect in the product and ask for a refund, you are shown the condition on the cash receipt that says “No refund”. So your only option is to accept a replacement and if you do not want that, take a credit slip from the shop for a future buy. .One can in fact see such highly exploitative contractual terms on many receipts- of drycleaners, couriers, parking contractors, coaching classes, amusement parks, gymnasiums, travel agents, goods carriers, builders, well the list is long. Some of them are couched in such complicated legalese, that even if consumers read them, they may not understand that they are taking away their right to a fair deal and redress. Courier companies, for example, restrict their liability to a miniscule amount for loss or destruction of goods entrusted to their care for delivery , through such terms and conditions printed on the receipt. Amusement parks and even gymnasiums say they will not take responsibility for any injury or death caused on their premises , even if it happened on account of their negligence. Parking contractors, who are supposed to take care of your vehicle, say that they are not liable for damage or loss caused to your car or two wheeler left in their care! Receipts of travel agencies tell you that you will lose the entire amount paid if you cancel the trip. Given the fact that these are standard contracts that are drafted clearly to favour the stronger party-the business- to the detriment of the other, weaker party -the consumer, there is need for legislation to create fairness in all consumer contracts. In fact in recognition of this, many countries have specific regulations that strike down such unfair terms. The consumer protection regulator has to now take the initiative and bring about a comprehensive regulation prohibiting unfair terms and conditions in all consumer contracts, particularly those that are not regulated by sector regulators. After all, the Central consumer Protection Authority’s mandate is to protect, promote and enforce the rights of consumers and the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 gives the consumer the right to be protected from unfair contracts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-rights-regulator-should-eliminate-unfair-consumer-contracts/story-daKPL9Ukbym0qadZuh1MOI.html
23-08-2020||Gurugram||Active cases, positivity rate trending upward again in Gurugram||The number of daily active cases in Gurugram has been going up over the past week breaking the trend seen in late July and early August. The number of patients requiring hospitalisation too showed an increase.Along with it, last week also saw the district testing only 12,162 new samples -- the lowest seven-day aggregate in six weeks.The total positivity rate (TPR, which is the number of tests turning positive per 100 tests) at 5.4%, while within expectations, grew from 3.7%, bucking another trend.Health department officials said the trend may indicate that the virus transmission may have gained pace after decelerating through July and August. Last week, the Haryana government had imposed a weekend restriction in the state pointing that the people had been lax in following social distancing norms.The health department clarified that it is in a better position to deal with a surge in infections, which is expected over the next two weeks, given improvements in testing capabilities and treatment protocols for patients.“To maintain the desired positivity rate of under five percent, we should have tested about 14,000 samples over the past week, which is well within our capacity. The shortfall will be made up. We are still tracing and testing the right people and that has kept deaths low,” said Dr. Jai Prakash Sharma, the integrated disease surveillance programme’s (IDSP’s) district surveillance officer, pointing out that there have been six new deaths in three weeks.“Seeing as the end goal is to prevent deaths, our response remains robust. Treatment protocols have helped us keep the number of critical patients low too. While there has indeed been a surge in new positives and active patients, there are no red flags to worry about,” said Dr. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, referring to instances of sudden deaths, bed shortages in hospitals, and a lack of testing equipment that plagued the district earlier.“The number of critical patients is also still low,” Yadav added, clarifying that it is still too early to tell whether Gurugram is headed toward a second epidemiological peak.As per health department data, there are presently only two patients in intensive care, one requiring oxygen and one on ventilator support. “If people observe social distancing a little more stringently, it would slow down the spread even further,” Yadav said.As per an analysis of health department data, the average daily growth rate of positive cases in the first week of August was 0.58%, which increased to 0.98% in the second week, before jumping the fence to 1.1% in the third week of this month. Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine who has been tracking the trajectory of Covid-19 in Haryana, said, “With public movement opening up, naturally cases will also rise. The outcome of another surge will depend on whether the administration is prepared enough, and whether it can apply lessons from the first peak in an efficient manner. This means fine-tuning its test, trace and isolate method, ensuring anyone who needs a ventilator can access one, making sure home isolation rules are being adhered to, encouraging tests from private labs by capping prices and so on. A lot of things will determine the way forward.”BOX:Total tests // Weekly increase in tests // Weekly percentage increase in tests // Weekly new cases // Weekly test positivity ratesAugust 16 - August 22: 145041 (+12162 // 9%) | New cases: 648 | TPR = 5.4% August 9 - August 15: 132879 (+14699 // 12.5%) | New cases: 551 | TPR = 3.7%August 2 - August 8: 118180 (+14362 // 11%) | New cases: 468 | TPR = 3.2%July 26 - August 1: 103818 (+13833 // 16%) | New cases: 675 | TPR = 4.8%July 19 - July 25: 89985 (+15265 // 20%) | New cases: 897| TPR = 6%July 12 - July 18: 74720 (+16,411 // 28%) | New cases: 846 | TPR = 5%July 5 - July 11: 58309 (+19,488 // 50%) | New cases: 919 | TPR = 5%June 27 - July 4: 38821 (+10,974 // 39%) | New cases: 759 | TPR = 7%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/active-cases-positivity-rate-trending-upward-again-in-gurugram/story-B2LtlwSrdogvTC9RfdvvoN.html

However, the number of applications being received from students wanting to study abroad is much lower than that in the previous years. There are over 200 immigration consultancies in Chandigarh. Navneet Singh, an immigration consultant and a representative of Association of Overseas Education Consultants, Chandigarh, said that they have received only around 200 applications since last month. “Countries have started providing every indicator except travel clearance. Visa processing has also started. But we have witnessed a dip of around 50% in the applications from the students.”According to immigration experts, over 90% colleges and universities in Canada will start online teaching in September. “I think students will be able to travel to the UK for September intake and they have also put proper travel protocol in place but for Canada students will be able to go for January 2021,” said Singh.Immigration experts say over one-lakh students from Punjab and Chandigarh go to foreign countries, including Australia, Canada and UK, to pursue higher education every year. At this time of the year, the applications are received in high numbers for the September intake in many foreign countries. However, this year the numbers are low.“Most students are preferring January 2021 intake as compared to September. Most do not want to study online and only those who were stuck due to lockdown are applying for September intake. Since last month, we have received around 35 applications for Canada and 15 to 20 each for Australia and the UK,” said Rakehshwar Walia, from an immigration and education consultancy based in Khanna. “As Canada has started a new visa processing programme, we have also started processing applications from students. The Canadian government in the initial approval allows students to enrol for online classes. In the second stage, they will be given a visa for travelling, once the situation is under control. We have also started processing applications for Australia as well but the number of students is less this time. We hope things will be back on track in future,” said Jatin Wadhwa, director of a Chandigarh-based international education consultancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/study-abroad-signs-of-revival-but-students-wary-of-online-teaching-say-chandigarh-immigration-consultants/story-1yiyU5Z34Wj8gl1zK9tLNK.html
23-08-2020||City||148 more Delhi govt Sarvodaya schools to have nursery classes soon||New Delhi: The Delhi government is planning to introduce nursery classes in around 148 more Sarvodaya Vidyalayas from the next academic session, with an aim to increasing learning opportunities for children below 6 years in the national capital.A document enlisting the Directorate of Education’s (DoE) “Vision 2030” plans stated, “Discussion was held on enacting legislation making it the right of every child below 6 years to get good quality early childhood care and education enabling them to grow healthy, cognitively and emotionally developed. It’s decided that in remaining schools (Sarvodaya) nursery classes will be introduced from the next academic year.”Of the 1,030 government-run schools in Delhi, 449 Sarvodaya Vidyalayas have primary sections up to class 5. Of these, 301 have nursery classes. Besides, around 1,700 schools run by the three municipal corporations in Delhi offer primary education from nursery to class 5.HT had on Friday reported that the directorate had told different departments it had approved their projects for the implementation of Vision 2030 after consulting stakeholders and had set tentative timelines. Among the other projects approved by the DoE were the creation of at least one school of excellence (SoE) in each district, teaching foreign language in government schools, connected classrooms and exchange programmes for students. For the establishment of nursery classes in the remaining sarvodaya schools, the DoE asked its school branch to come up with a plan by October. A senior official in Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia’s office said, “Keeping in mind the high demand and low availability of nursery classes in government schools in Delhi, it’s been decided to introduce nursery in the remaining sarvodaya schools. So, we are exploring where we have enough space to construct more classrooms.”Experts working in the field of education said more children from marginalised families will get opportunities to get an early education. Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working for children from economically weaker section (EWS) households in Delhi, said, “ An increase in the number of nursery seats in Delhi government schools will also help families who struggle to enrol their children in private schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/148-more-delhi-govt-sarvodaya-schools-to-have-nursery-classes-soon/story-vPyycjd3oYRJJPiSu7pEnK.html

Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh had received the inquiry report from Ishar Singh, a lawyer at the Telangana high court. The five Sikh clergymen comprising the Akal Takht jathedar, jathedars of other Sikh temporal seats and Sikh high priests will discuss the report. Sources said the Akal Takht might direct the SGPC to implement the inquiry report. Another much-awaited report of a panel tasked to go through the content of controversial religious discourses of Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale has also been submitted to the Takht. This is also on the agenda of the clergy.The Akal Takht is likely to declare Damdami Taksal media advisor Sarchand Singh and some others as ‘tankhaya’ (guilty of religious misconduct) in the case of pardoning excommunicated former Akali minister Sucha Singh Langah, in violation of its edict. It is also likely to award ‘tankhah’ (religious punishment) to a SGPC member and hold the husband of another member as ‘tankhaya’ (guilty of religious misconduct).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikh-clergy-meets-today-missing-saroops-on-agenda/story-APGVDi0w0uvWHOLF1ltC2O.html

They alleged that despite their informing the concerned authorities, no action had been taken yet.Vishal Vir Singh, a resident of Emaar, said that the authorities were supplying bore well water to its residents in Sector 108 and there was no treatment plant for treating it. “Not even a basic/ rudimentary filtration system, for supplying clean/ potable water, has been installed so far,” he said.Another resident Dhruv Sharma, in his complaint, stated that water being supplied is not clean as it is full of sediments and is often quite muddy. Often worms are seen floating in the water, he stated.The residents said that though borewell water is first stored in two big tanks before supply, the water is not chlorinated.When contacted, Manjit Singh, maintenance in-charge of Emaar, Mohali said, “There was some problem but we are in the process of cleaning the water pipes and the same will be done in a day or two.” On being questioned about the absence of a water treatment plant in the society, he said, “Earlier the population was less but now that we have more people in the society, therefore, we have proposed to install a water treatment plant,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-of-housing-society-in-mohali-complain-of-contaminated-water-supply/story-GMXDDRroXagr0D28w6g5iM.html
23-08-2020||City||GMADA starts process to build 6 km link from Airport road to Kharar||Four years after it proposed building a six km , 200-feet wide link between Airport road to Kharar –Landran road, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has begun the process of acquisition of land. The road will improve connectivity from Kharar to Airport road and also some major townships including TDI, Ansal and Gateway city. Originating from Sector 74-A (Airport road), this road will divide sectors 116-92 and sectors 117-74-A, to pass through the villages of Chapar Chri Khurd, Chapar Chiri Kalan, Chajju Majra, Balaili and Ballomajra before connecting to Kharar- Landran road near Swaraj factory. The road is part of the Mohali master plan.On starting the acquisition process, Davinder Singh, GMADA chief engineer, said: “We have written to the authorities concerned for approvals to issue notice under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act soon. We will be acquiring around 75 acres of land from five villages and are hopeful of completing the acquisition process by the end of this year.” Sanyam Dudeja, director, Jubilee Real Estate Group, Mohali, said, people in colonies close to the road had faced a number of problems in the absence of a link road and the risk of accidents was high too.Kamal Tiwana, a Kharar resident, said the existing National Highway 21 remained clogged due to construction of the Kharar flyover. This 200-feet-wide link road was, therefore, expected to be a better alternative to people travelling between Chandigarh and Kharar. Blaming GMADA for poor planning, he said it approved construction of apartments and bungalows in remote areas but did not provide basic amenities like connecting roads and parks.WORK BEGINS ON KEY ROADOne of the key road projects to connect Kharar with New Chandigarh has also kicked off after a delay of over three months owing to the Covid-19 lockdown. GMADA, which had earlier missed a deadline of April 15 to begin work, has now started it on the 8km stretch that will improve connectivity between Mullanpur and Sunny Enclave, helping commuters bypass Chandigarh or Kurali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-starts-process-to-build-6-km-link-from-airport-road-to-kharar/story-9AtFeUGBJuSXFYaEdtzlTP.html

Sukhbir also called for hiking the crop compensation rates in Punjab by raising the state quotient in the amount, as was done by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government. The former deputy CM added that water had also entered several colonies in the city leading to damage to houses and household goods. He said farmers had sat on a dharna on the Abohar-Seetogunno-Dabwali road on Saturday to draw attention to the problem of overflowing from the Abulkhurana drain.He sought compensation for all these damages and also claimed that reports suggested damage to the cotton crop as well, which also needed to be covered under the girdawari. ‘SET UP MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL IN FAZILKA’Sukhbir has also written to 15th Finance Commission to allocate Rs 100 crore for the establishment of a Medical College and Hospital in Fazilka. In a letter to the commission chairman NK Singh, the SAD president said the hospital proposed by him could serve as a focal point for not only the Malwa region, but also for neighbouring districts of Haryana and Rajasthan. He added that the district had only 0.7 to 0.9 bed per thousand population and 1 doctor for over 6,183 persons. He told the commission chairman that Fazilka also accounted for the highest prevalence of cancer in the country. “We have a district hospital which is deficient as far as infrastructure is concerned. People travelled overnight to get medical services which was a burden on them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/order-girdawari-in-abohar-sukhbir-to-capt/story-4drDdX7BioApIwIE4XffmI.html

23-08-2020||City||Covid-19 scare: Ludhiana parents get wards enrolled in local colleges||As Covid-19 cases continue to rise, parents are preferring to get their children enrolled in local colleges instead of sending them away for higher education. Till last year, students preferred to get themselves enrolled in colleges of Delhi and Chandigarh. They used to stay in paying guest accommodations in other cities to pursue their higher education but this year due to the Covid-19 outspread, parents are worried and are not allowing their children to travel outside the city. Amanpreet Singh, a commerce student who scored 96% in Class 12 board exams, had decided to take admission in a Chandigarh-based college, but due to the Covid-19 outspread, her parents asked her to take admission in a city-based college instead. Sukhwinder Kaur, her mother, said, “For the last four years, Amanpreet has been working hard to attain a good score in Class 12 and finally scored well in exams. But the lockdown has spoiled her plan and now she has now taken admission in one of the local colleges.” Harpreet Singh, principal, Gujranwala Guru Nanak Institute of Management and Technology, Ghumar Mandi, said, “This year, due to the pandemic, many parents have decided to get their wards enrolled in nearby colleges. Over 15-20 students who were earlier interested in taking admission in Delhi and Chandigarh colleges have now turned to our college for admission.” NO HOSTEL FACILITY OFFERED IN COLLEGES SCD Government College offers hostel facilities for both boys and girls and more than 250 students can be accommodated in the rooms. But this year due to the pandemic the classes are being conducted online and the authorities are not offering hostel facilities to students. Every year students from other districts apply for admission to the college but this time many of them have got themselves enrolled in colleges in their respective districts. Parminder Singh, a student from Moga, said, “I was excited to take admission in SCD Government College after Class 12 exams. But due to the rise in Covid cases, my parents asked me to stay here so I got myself enrolled in a private PU-affiliated college here.” Dharam Singh Sandhu, principal of SCD Government College, said, “In such difficult times, as per instructions from Panjab University(PU), professors are conducting the classes online. It is not feasible to offer hostel facilities right now and whenever we receive directions from higher authorities to re-open colleges, we will provide these facilities. Students from other districts have applied but we have informed them that hostel facilities are not available currently.” The situation is no different in other colleges. Guru Nanak Khalsa College for Women has two hostels comprising approximately 45 rooms. College principal Maninder Kaur said, “Teachers are conducting classes online and keeping in mind the Covid situation, we are not offering hostel facilities.” Gursimar Kaur, a resident of Model Town, said, “My daughter wanted to pursue a bachelor of commerce from Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi, but with the Covid- 19 cases going up, she finally took admission here in a PU-affiliated college. This has upset her, but at this point, we cannot risk her life and send her to Delhi. She scored 98% marks in Class 12 board exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-scare-ludhiana-parents-get-wards-enrolled-in-local-colleges/story-kDnNnMMCl42lCHl8rsaZGL.html
23-08-2020||Patna||Designed by IITians, JD(U)’s digital campaigning platform is ‘first’ of its kind||JD(U) is set to launch an exclusive digital platform, JDUlive.com, for canvassing ahead of October-November Bihar assembly elections keeping in mind the limited scope for campaigning on the ground in the view of the coronavirus pandemic outbreak and the detailed guidelines issued by the election commission mindful of the changed circumstances.The digital platform, which the party insiders claim to be one of its kind for any political outfit in the state and also the country, will be launched with chief minister Nitish Kumar’s virtual meet, expected next month. Kumar is also JD(U) national president.“We planned this with the help of a group of IITians from Bihar to utilise the lockdown period, as there was a clear indication that campaigning this time won’t be the same as before due to the pandemic. JDUlive.com will redefine the mode of communication with the masses in the digital era,” said a senior party leader, pleading anonymity.“The platform’s current integral on-boarding capacity is one lakh live viewers for a digital /virtual public rally. This can be expanded up to 10 lakh (one million) participants for any given live interaction in the future,” said the leader, adding the global lockdown necessitated out-of-the-box solutions for public campaigning.The platform can easily evolve as a dedicated communication channel to engage not just with party cadres but also the general public. In this context, a Live.tv menu on the portal is to enable any person to share any positive video or news item which, upon approval by the portal’s administrator, can get posted online. This will provide a single point source of positive news to the media, too.“Platforms like Zoom, Google meet, etc, have gained huge popularity as the preferred modes for organising public meets, but being third party service providers, there are obvious limitations on using them,” said party leaders.It is Janata Dal United’s own video conferencing platform which supports both way video communication. “Developed entirely by local talents, it qualifies both as a true Make in India and a Make in Bihar product; and a platform with no dependence on any foreign or public platforms like Zoom, Google, etc.,” said a senior party leader.Besides hosting live public rallies and /or private conferences, this party portal can be used as an interface with the public and for holding regular meetings with party cadres.Also Read: BJP’s plan for Bihar assembly polls involves careful study of the voters list“On the JDULive.com website, both party functionaries and people can put their views, such as through the ‘Virtual Survekshan’ (survey) menu designed for Digital Survey,” said those handling the digital set up.Also Read: ‘NDA to fight Bihar polls under Nitish Kumar’s leadership’: NaddaData on the portal is being updated so it serves as a database of party functionaries down to the booth levels. “It will be a storehouse of information, including development works in various spheres, speeches of the national president, yatras of Nitish Kumar, etc,” they said.The right to the platform will only be given to authorised party functionaries from the state and district levels for uploading and managing data and information relating to their respective jurisdictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/designed-by-iitians-jdu-s-digital-campaigning-platform-is-first-of-its-kind/story-LnTmPtPTreojYU4ULcDu3O.html

In all, the district has confirmed 312 Covid deaths till August 23.“83% of the dead belong to Ludhiana city, 5% to other urban areas, including Khanna and Jagraon, whereas 12% fatalities were reported from rural areas,” he added. Among the 288 patients, who died, 68% were male and 32% female. As many as 84.3% were suffering from other ailments and 63% had multiple comorbidities.The age group worst affected (82%) was those aged above 60. “Closed environments in cities facilitate transmission of coronavirus, whereas in village, people mostly socialise in open settings. The relatively more active lifestyle of rural population also puts them at lower risk of deaths as compared to urban areas,” observes Dr Bagga. “Socialising has turned out to be a major cause of spreading of virus and subsequent fatalities among the urban population. The youth catch the virus, which spreads among their contacts, including those vulnerable, such as the elderly and those suffering from comorbidities,” he added.Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state Covid-19 nodal officer, said during the lockdown period, rural areas had more Covid cases as compared to urban areas. “There were multiple reasons for it, such as returning of pilgrims from Nanded Sahib and NRIs flying back to India. But, once the unlock phase began, the infection rate picked up in urban areas,” said Dr Bhasker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-in-10-covid-fatalities-in-ludhiana-from-urban-areas-finds-health-dept-report/story-nNpD3bHDEsLAwOiBeis1NI.html

They were among the 180 Covid-19 patients cured and discharged from Jamshedpur hospitals on Friday. 216 more patients were discharged on Saturday. This apart, at least eight doctors, infected previously, were also cured and discharged on Friday.A day later on Saturday, a total of seven minors tested Corona positive, including the one-day-old baby, among the 266 new Covid-19 patients detected in Jamshedpur. However, one of the doctors cured from the disease said there’s no need to fear the infection. “Covid-19 is just a disease, there’s no need to fear it. There are many terminal diseases which never cure but Covid-19 patients are getting cured. While patients with comorbidities are considered most vulnerable if infected with Coronavirus, many of them have been cured. The need of the hour is to consult the doctors and start the treatment immediately after seeing any symptom,” said Dr Harprit Singh, who claims to be the first doctor in the city to have been infected by the Coronavirus.Also Read: Jharkhand reports 872 new Covid-19 cases, 13 deathsDr Singh said people displaying symptoms should stay in self-isolation till they receive the result of their coronavirus test and strictly follow the Covid-19 protocols issued by the government after getting the test report.“80% of the Covid-19 patients have little or no symptom, while 15% have breathing problems and only 5% require immediate treatment in the ICU. Get yourself tested even after catching mild fever, practice yoga for breathing and wear a mask,” prescribed Dr Singh.Also Read: Jharkhand agriculture minister Badal Patralekh tests Covid-19 positiveMeanwhile, 266 new Covid-19 patients have taken the total number of Corona positive patients in Jamshedpur to 5,163, of which, 2,801 have been cured, leaving 2,362 active patients.

23-08-2020||Jaipur||Congress in Rajasthan betrayed people, says BJP chief JP Nadda||BJP national president J P Nadda on Sunday accused the Congress government in Rajasthan of inaction, betraying people and failing to provide relief to them during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. Addressing the party’s Rajasthan unit leader and workers through a video conference, he said the rising crime graph was a symbol of crumbling administration. “The Ashok Gehlot government has proved inactive during the lockdown. Instead of providing relief, the government has betrayed people,” Nadda said. He also said, “Rising crime graph in the state is a symbol that the administration is crumbling and the government did nothing except nepotism.” The BJP chief claimed that there has been an increase in the crime rate in the state as atrocities against women have increased by 122 per cent compared to last year and crimes against dalits and tribals grew by 92 per cent and 101 per cent respectively. “I am putting these figures in front of you because this is a reflection of the inhumanity of the Gehlot government, the nepotism, the collapse of the government structure,” he alleged. In an apparent reference to the recent political crisis in the state in which Congress MLAs were holed up in hotels, Nadda said while the people of the state were struggling with coronavirus, Congress leaders were watching movies in hotel rooms and making Italian dishes. “The chief minister and his deputy did not meet for the last 18 months. Now, there has been an agreement (between Gehlot and Sachin Pilot)... don’t know on what grounds it has been done and how long it will last. Gehlot tried levelling allegations on the BJP. They failed to manage their house and were fighting among themselves, but blamed the BJP,” he added. He asked the state unit of the BJP to apprise the public about the work done by the Centre. “The state unit should be concerned with motivating workers. The commitment level should be high and this will happen only when we give them political content,” he said. He asked the state BJP chief to form WhatsApp groups of party representatives at all 52,000 electoral booths. In these WhatsApp groups, schemes launched by the central government and local issues should be discussed, he said. BJP state president Satish Poonia claimed that farmer organisations’ are agitated as the Rs 833 subsidy, which was given to them during the tenure of the previous government, has been stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/congress-in-rajasthan-betrayed-people-says-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/story-sPRyuxzi1Sb4BOlcJw9NSO.html

With this, the family of BJP is increasing so is our strength and we welcome all of them,” Chouhan told ANI at the ‘BJP Sadasyta Grahan Samahroh’ in Gwalior.Scindia had quit the Congress this year in March and later joined the BJP along with his supporters.Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that Congress workers taking membership of the BJP in ‘Gwalior Chambal Samvad’ is reflective of the fact that the party’s strength is increasing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kamal-nath-hijacked-congress-in-madhya-pradesh-cm-chouhan/story-aqlTIkDeDZnXirViiEFiiJ.html

23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Voice samples of former director match with audio clip linked to HP health dept scam||Trouble is brewing for former director (health) Dr Ajay Gupta as his voice samples have matched with an audio recording being investigated by the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau for links to a medical equipment scam.Reports of the sample were released by the forensic lab in Shimla on Saturday evening.The 43-second audio clip that went viral in May this year during the lockdown following the Covid-19 outbreak has been the focus of investigation in the scam.In the audio clip, a voice alleged to be Dr Gupta’s is heard demanding a bribe of ₹5 lakh for supply of medical equipment. The voice of a pharma company agent, Prithvi Singh, can also be heard discussing the amount to be paid. Dr Gupta, who has been booked under sections 7 and 8 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, was arrested on May 20. A local court granted him bail on May 30. According to vigilance sources Dr Gupta and Prithvi Singh did not agree with the amount to be paid as bribe as the latter was allegedly willing to accept ₹3 lakh whereas Dr Gupta demanded ₹5lakh.Three more similar audio recordings surfaced during the forensic examination of over half a dozen mobile phones seized by the vigilance bureau in connection with the case.POLITICAL AFTERMATH The corruption case in which employees of a Punjab-based firm were found to collude with Gupta to secure orders for supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for corona warriors had left the ruling BJP red-faced.It had political repercussions as the then state president of BJP Rajeev Bindal, appointed just a few months ago to the post, resigned on May 27 after his name was dragged into the scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/voice-samples-of-former-director-match-with-audio-clip-linked-to-hp-health-dept-scam/story-QfQszr5bqrw0Uynbauq6hI.html

He said to address this issue, the state government launched grievances redressal programme Jan Manch. “Till date about 190 Jan Manch have been held and more than 90% of the total complaints have been resolved,” he added.He said the ‘Mukhyamantri Sewa Sankalp Helpline 1100’ has also helped in redressal of public grievances.

23-08-2020||Pune||Online darshans to smaller idols make fest unique in Pune||The annual Ganpati festival is here with the entire state geared up to celebrate it. However, for the first time, the century-old festival starting Saturday till September 1, will be celebrated differently in view of Covid-19 pandemic. Here are various ways the festival is different this year: No processions: The public processions organised on the first and last day of the 10-day festival will be missed on the streets in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and other parts in Maharashtra. The police have prohibited any processions, which is one of highlights of the festival. No dhol tasha performances: The processions are accompanies by dhol-tasha troupes which have been an integral part of the celebrations. The harmonised sound of hundreds of humungous dhols mark the beginning and end of festivities in Maharashtra. However, this year, the music is missing. “Every year, my family and I come to witness grand celebrations through processions by various mandals. We are missing it this year,” said Sai Ambekar, a banker. Idols smaller in height: After government capped the Ganpati idol height at 4-feet, most mandals in Mumbai and Pune have decided to install smaller idols. In Mumbai, tall idols have been a major attraction of the festival. Online darshan: To catch a glimpse of the well-known Ganpati idols like Lalbaugcha Raja, Dagdusheth Ganpati and other, the devotees will have to log in online instead of in-person darshan. Families and friends throng the mandaps of various Ganpati installations in various parts of Maharashtra to witness skits, social activities, games, innovative installations and decorations. Home delivery: The idols for home installation were home delivered by the sellers to avoid crowding at stalls. The goods required for puja were also delivered directly to residents’ doorsteps. The priests, who perform aartis and pujas during these installations, have also chosen the online way of reaching out to their customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/online-darshans-to-smaller-idols-make-fest-unique-in-pune/story-kBY21nm0IpMaaX4g4JWHeN.html
23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder opposes challenge to Gandhi family leadership||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday opposed the bid by some Congress leaders to challenge the Gandhi family leadership of the party. In a statement here, Amarinder said this was not the time to raise such an issue, given the need for a strong opposition against the BJP-led NDA that was out to destroy the country’s Constitutional ethos and democratic principles. “The NDA’s success was attributable to the absence of a strong and united Opposition, and the move by these Congress leaders to demand an overhaul of the party at this critical juncture will be detrimental to its interests, and the interests of the nation. India is currently facing not just external dangers from across the border but also internal threats to its federal structure,” he said, adding that a unified Congress alone could protect the country and its people. Terming the demand for leadership change as untenable, Amarinder noted the immense contribution of the Gandhi family to the country’s progress since it achieved freedom from the British rule. What Congress needs is a leadership that is acceptable not just to a few but to the entire party, through its rank and file, and the nation at large, he said. “The Gandhis are the right fit for this role. Sonia Gandhi should continue to helm the Congress as long as she wanted,” he said, adding, “Rahul should thereafter take over as he is fully competent to lead the party”. The chief minister said there was not a single village in India which did not have a Congress member to carry forward its ideology of upholding the Constitutional principles, rights and freedoms. At a time when the very bedrock of India’s Constitutional strength was under threat, it was important for every Congress man and woman to stand firmly and unitedly behind the Gandhis, who had held the party together all these decades and could continue to do so, said Captain Amarinder Singh. He said there was currently no leader in the Congress who could give the party that kind of strong leadership, he said, urging one and all to put the interests of the party and the nation above their own. Electoral defeats could not be the yardstick for leadership change, said the chief minister, adding that just because the Congress was down at the moment did not mean the Gandhis’ contribution to its growth could or should be undermined. He said the BJP rose from two parliamentary seats to lead the country, and added that the Congress will rise again, and that too under the leadership of a Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-opposes-challenge-to-gandhi-family-leadership/story-qmxQARiw6OWWnt3rpkAnTM.html
23-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi to set up camps, help construction workers register for welfare funds||Delhi’s labour minister Gopal Rai on Sunday said that the government would set up camps in all 70 assembly segments in the national capital to help construction workers get registered for a state-run welfare fund. The facility would be available for 20 days, starting on Monday, he said. “The process of registration was initiated at a time, when the lockdown restrictions were in place. So far, around 70,000 construction workers have registered. Most of them have taken help from employers or internet café owners. We have decided to intervene in the process and help them (the workers) out. Between August 24 and September 12, the government will set up camps to help the registration of workers from the realty sector,” announced Rai at a press conference on Sunday. “At least one camp will be set up in each of the 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi. They will operate from government schools. Their lists have been sent to the MLAs (members of the Delhi legislative assembly) concerned and the offices of the municipal corporations. The camps will function five days a week – from Monday to Friday,” he added, The documents of workers, who approach such camps for registration, would be verified immediately, said Rai. Also read: BSF to undergo tech upgradation, to get 436 drones and new anti-drone systemsConstruction workers, including plumbers and electricians employed in the construction sector, painters, tile workers, security guards at sites, who are aged between 18 and 60, are eligible for registration under the scheme. They must possess a photo identity card, a bank account number, a residential proof for Delhi and other documents that would prove that they have worked in the construction sector for at least 90 days in the past 12 months prior to the registration, said an official, who is in charge of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government’s initiative. On May 21, the Delhi high court (HC) had directed the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, which comes under the labour department of the Delhi government, to take steps to renew the membership of all the workers, in a bid to cushion lockdown-induced loss of earnings. The court had observed that over 500,000 construction workers in Delhi, who fell off the safety net under the watch of the city’s welfare board, cannot be deprived of benefits just because they were unable to renew their annual registration. Every state has a welfare board, which runs an array of beneficial schemes, funded by the cess collected from projects under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996. In Delhi, the board started disbursing Rs 5,000 a month during the lockdown, which was imposed since end-March in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and triggered a mass job loss in the realty sector, to the bank accounts of the enrolled workers. Rajesh Kumar, secretary, Indian Federation of Trade Union’s Delhi chapter, said that the move would bring relief to tens of thousands of workers engaged in the construction sector, who were taking help from internet cafes that were charging between Rs 300 and Rs 500 for each registration. “The process involves filling up a 12-page form. It is a huge challenge for most workers who lack adequate education and knowledge about computers and the internet. All labour department offices in the city have help desks but they have not been very cooperative so far. The government should also work towards improving their attitude and work ethics,” said Kumar. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-set-up-camps-help-construction-workers-register-for-welfare-funds/story-zbBr6Hi1E3ySLPqbeNNRxI.html

The woman, Mamta Sharma, was found dead with her head smashed after her 17-year-old son returned home on Tuesday evening. A hammer lying near the body was believed to be the murder weapon and her 39-year-old live-in partner, Brahmpal Singh, was the prime suspect as he was allegedly absconding.On Saturday, the police’s crime branch arrested Singh after receiving a tip-off that he was loitering near Aksharadham Mandir in East Delhi. Also read: Centre raises concerns over slow pace of housing scheme for poorSharma was a private security guard who had separated from her husband three years ago. “The couple’s divorce was yet to be finalised,” said Rakesh Paweriya, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch). “About two years ago, she met Singh who is a married man with three children. He has worked odd jobs, but primarily earned his living by renting out his building in East Delhi’s Khichripur,” said the DCP. “They entered in a relationship soon after they met, and two months ago, they began living together in a two-bedroom rented flat in West Vinod Nagar,” said the officer. Sharma’s older son stayed with them while her younger, 14-year-old son, lived with a relative.“Of late, Sharma wanted to end their relationship due to the constant bickering by Singh’s wife and his family,” the officer said.While Singh wanted to continue living with Sharma, he suspected her of talking to someone else, the officer said, quoting the arrested man. “She would refuse to share her mobile phone’s password, which made him further suspicious of her,” said DCP Paweriya. On Tuesday evening, Sharma’s son was out to bring dinner from a restaurant when Singh allegedly found her speaking over the phone, said the DCP. When she refused to answer him and then refused to share her phone’s password yet again, he allegedly picked up a hammer and bludgeoned her to death before fleeing the crime spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nan-killed-partner-because-she-didn-t-share-phone-password-cops/story-v9lyXMluxjBr9mGfniGn0I.html
23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Panic at 3 am as floodwaters enter homes in Chandigarh’s Khuda Lahora, Mohali areas hit||There was panic at 3 am on Sunday as water released from check dams after heavy rainfall in the area flooded the Patiala Ki Rao seasonal rivulet or choe, inundating a 100 houses because of clogged drains in Chandigarh’s Khuda Lahora Colony near the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, reports say.Opening up of the Sukhna Lake floodgates to drain out the water too led to flooding of other areas in Mohali’s Baltana. The worst affected areas in Baltana were the police station, cremation ground and two marriage palaces. Senior officials of administration, including the sub divisional magistrate (SDM), have reached the spot. Khuda Lahora residents alleged no warning had been issued by the administration about water being released from the check dams.Rohit Thakur, a local resident, said, “Water entered the houses at around 3 am when we were sleeping. Of the 450 houses here, around a 100 were under three feet of water. There was panic. We didn’t know that the water had been intentionally discharged by the government.There was no alert from the UT administration.”MC officials visited the area more than an hour after the flooding and started working on the cleaning up the storm drains in the choe, and by 6 am water levels had started to recede, Thakur added.“Sewage was mixed with the water overflowing from the choe and flooded the houses and street. The main sewage pipe and storm water drainage of the colony opens up in the choe, the level of which at some places is elevated because of heavy siltation,” said PC Rana, a local whose home was inundated.While the sewage lines are maintained by the MC, the UT engineering department handles the desiltation work. “We have been requesting to both for the last 10 years to clean up the area but no action has been taken,” Rana added. When contacted Raj Bala Malik, Chandigarh mayor and also councillor of the ward, said, “When the flooding reports came from Khuda Lahora Colony, immediately MC teams were sent. All the 22 drainage pipes were clogged with sand and other floodwater debris. We have now cleaned up three of these, and work on cleaning up the rest of the pipes is going on.” Malik said the villagers or MC had not received any warning that water would be released upstream for the rivulet, adding that the civic body had been regularly requesting the administration to clear up the stream, but “this problem persists.” Till the filing of the report, water had receded from houses, but the streets remained waterlogged. Engineers of the UT administration also had to open the floodgates of the Sukhna Lake early on Sunday after water levels touched the danger mark of 1,163 feet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panic-at-3-am-as-floodwaters-enter-homes-in-chandigarh-s-khuda-lahora-mohali-areas-hit/story-NOIpu63vl6yv7SUPQ4Gp4O.html

Recently, when I was contacted to donate plasma, I decided to go and do the needful because I got recovered by the grace of God but there are many others who need to be saved,” says Dilip Kumar, a wood turner, who resides in Begampur Khatola village of Gurugram. It was in July-end that Gurugrammers got their first plasma bank in sector-10. Here, on the very first day, five people who had recovered from Covid-19 donated plasma. A few donors have also visited a private hospital for plasma donation, to help the residents of millennium city fight coronavirus. Many residents say that in absence of these centres, it was quite a task to get in touch with the plasma donors. A Gurugrammer, on condition of anonymity, shares how social media had earlier been the one medium for many to find a plasma donor, and says, “I just finished my 14-day period between recovery and plasma donation. And I’m already in touch with someone on social media, who has approached me saying he might need plasma for one of his family members. But, now I prefer donating at the plasma bank, since I can be sure then that what I donated has been provided it someone who genuinely needed it!” The taboos prevalent around Covid-19 have compelled many to stay anonymous while sharing how difficult it was for them to find a donor, and how they themselves don’t feel confident about donating plasma. “There are several misconceptions regarding plasma donations, which is why the number of plasma donors in the city remains low,” says Dr Vikas Deswal, who works in the infectious disease department at a private hospital in Gurugram, which is allowed to conduct plasma therapy. He adds that the doctors have been educating denizens about the need and significance of plasma donation during these times. “There is a cap of ₹8,500 on one unit of plasma, and at the plasma bank this is provided free to pregnant women and those who have BPL (ration) cards. So I have been asking my patients to arrange for plasma from the bank, and additionally we even try to convince them to donate once they have recovered,” adds Dr Deswal. Those managing the gloomy turnout of donors at the bank say that “maintaining a database” of donors has helped especially in emergency situations. Stating the reasons why donors usually avoid a trip to the plasma bank, Shubhi Kesarwani, who volunteers with an organisation that is contacting patients for plasma donation, says, “We are following up with patients who have recovered, and convince them to donate plasma, for plasma therapy of other Covid-19 patients. Most people are scared of going back to the hospital for plasma donation, after they have recovered. They have a fear of contracting infections, and the absence of any monetary compensation or incentive in return of donation is making them stay away. We set-up the bank to destigmatise the process while ensuring the safety of donors, who are chosen after checking their health history and lifestyle habits. As a measure to encourage donors to come to the bank, we have recently started a pick up and drop facility, to and from the plasma bank. This is working, but we need much more to ensure a steady flow of donors.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-plasma-donation-centres-help-many-fight-covid-19-but-face-low-donor-turnout/story-UN20TNKCQVtJlyI1gPUjxH.html

23-08-2020||Lucknow||Chetan Chauhan died due to poor treatment at Lucknow hospital, not because of Covid-19: SP leader||A Samajwadi Party (SP) leader has alleged that Uttar Pradesh minister Chetan Chauhan, who succumbed to Covid-19 in a Gurugram hospital, died not because of the disease, but due to carelessness in his treatment at the state-run SGPGI here.Chauhan (73), who was admitted to the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) after he tested positive for Covid-19, was shifted to the Medanta hospital in Haryana’s Gurugram when his condition deteriorated. The cricketer-turned-politician died last week due to Covid-related complications, after being put on life support for nearly 36 hours.Raising the issue in the Upper House of the Uttar Pradesh Legislature, SP MLC Sunil Singh Sajan alleged on Friday that Chauhan received poor treatment at the SGPGI.The SP leader also claimed that Chauhan and he were admitted to the same ward of the hospital.“Once during a round, a doctor and a nurse asked who is Chetan, to which the minister raised his hand since he was a simple person. He was asked as to when he got infected with the virus, to which he explained the entire matter to the hospital staff. At that time, another personnel asked Chauhan what do you do, to which he said he is a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government,” Sajan said.He added that he was angered by the behaviour of the hospital staff with Chauhan.“When I could not control my anger, I told the doctor that Chauhan had played cricket for India, to which the doctor said ‘oh, he is that Chetan’. After this, the doctor and the other staff left,” the SP leader said.The footage of Sajan’s speech in the Legislative Council went viral on social media platforms on Saturday.In a tweet in Hindi, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, “While comparing the so-called better preparations for Covid-19 to that of the USA, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister had forgotten the kind of behaviour his cabinet colleague Chetan Chauhan experienced at a government hospital.” When contacted, SGPGI director Dr RK Dhiman expressed surprise at Sajan’s statement.“During treatment, I had spoken to Chauhan a number of times, but he never brought up the incident. And he went to the Medanta hospital in Gurugram citing family reasons. If there were any complaints, it should have been conveyed. The incident will be probed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/chetan-chauhan-died-due-to-poor-treatment-at-lucknow-hospital-not-because-of-covid-19-sp-leader/story-ENArfqkwpD1QSpRnfh9AvK.html

23-08-2020||Delhi||Cong opposes South Delhi civic body’s tax move||The Delhi unit of the Congress has moved a private members’ proposal that has opposed the introduction of professional tax and an 1% increase in the transfer of property tax by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) authorities ahead of the civic body’s meeting slated for August 28.Abhishek Dutt, Delhi Congress vice-president and leader of the party in SDMC, has written to the civic body’s mayor Anamika Mithilesh and the commissioner to roll back these “anti-people” decisions. He has also written to the councillors of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to support the cause and roll back the tax hike in a bid to ensure that the public “do not have to pay extra” amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.On July 27, SDMC had introduced the professional tax, which is also applicable to those who are self-employed, and had also increased the duty on transfer of properties by 1%.Also read: ‘Change in leadership, complete rehaul’: Top Cong leaders write to SoniaDutt pointed out to the SDMC secretary that imposing another tax would cause financial difficulty for the residents of Delhi at a time the country is fighting the pandemic.“Parents are not being able to pay school fees of their children. People cannot pay rent and meet other monthly expenses because of the pandemic. It is not an opportune moment to either introduce or hike taxes. The corporation should bring a proposal in its next sitting on August 28 to roll back professional tax, hike in transfer duty tax and other taxes in public interest,” said Dutt, who is a Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj.The SDMC professional tax is exempted for those, whose monthly income is Rs 50,000, or Rs 6 lakh per annum.However, the civic authorities have levied a monthly professional tax of Rs 100 for those, whose earnings are between Rs 50,000 and Rs 75,000 a month.Similarly, the monthly tax will be Rs 100 and Rs 200 for those whose earnings are between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1 lakh and above Rs 1 lakh, respectively.The civic body had also moved a proposal to hike tax on the transfer of immovable properties by 1% on properties, whose valuation is more than Rs 25 lakh as per the circle rate.Earlier, the transfer duty was 3% and 2% for male and female buyers, respectively.The civic body had also approved the recommendations of its municipal valuation committee-3 (MVC-3) to double the tax on rented commercial properties.However, SDMC had deferred the proposal to increase electricity tax from 5% on the bill amount to 6%. The electricity tax is added in the power bill and collected by discoms on behalf of the corporation.Mithilesh said that such “harsh” steps were taken to improve the civic body’s financial situation.“We have refrained from imposing any tax in the past few years. But this time the situation is different. Our financial condition has worsened because of the pandemic. We had no option but to levy professional tax and also hike tax rates in certain other categories,” she said.She, however, refused to commit if these proposals would be rolled back in the next sitting of the House.The ruling AAP had also opposed the move and had staged a protest in July.

23-08-2020||Lucknow||UP assembly passed amendment bills without discussion, say Congress and BSP||The Congress and the BSP hit out at the BJP government in the state saying that several amendment bills were passed in the legislative assembly without discussion.Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu said, “UP government today unconstitutionally and undemocratically took back 60 bills in the state assembly and passed 17 amendment bills in the assembly. It is a black day for the Uttar Pradesh Legislative assembly.”“They did not discuss with the opposition or speak to the MLAs. In one day, to bring 17 amendments and to pass them without any discussion is against the Constitution. What else is it?” he asked.“There was no discussion on the issue of floods and law and order. No discussion on coronavirus and the problem of failing economy,” he added.Reacting to the same, BSP leader Lalji Verma said, “It is an undemocratic step of the government and we condemn it.”“There are four to five major problems in the state like the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. Second is the lack of Urea fertiliser for farmers. Then there is the oppression of Dalits and crimes against women. The state government has failed on these fronts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-assembly-passed-amendment-bills-sans-discussion-say-congress-and-bsp/story-w1Xih3sc8OWHhkDLKO93aN.html
23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Selection of Haryana physical training instructors: Probes, controversies and politics||Over 9,200 candidates on Sunday will get a fresh chance to be employed as physical training instructors (PTIs) in Haryana, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling. The controversial selections of 1,983 PTIs by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) in 2010 during the Congress rule were set aside by the apex court on April 8, paving the way for a fresh recruitment process. The first step is the written exam on Sunday. According to the apex court, selections will now be made from among the candidates applying for posts of PTI in 2006, including those who were hired. Stringent measures are in place for conduct of exams with chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora recently speaking to the deputy commissioners and superintendents of police of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal and Hisar to ensure everything goes smoothly. Playing politics The 2010 selections, the process for which began in 2006, remained embroiled in protracted litigation for a decade. Politics came into play once the apex court upheld the decision of the Punjab and Haryana high court to set aside the selections of 1,983 PTIs because of discrepancies in the hiring process. Politicians of various hues came out in support of the ousted PTIs, holding khap panchayat meetings flouting social distancing norms and demanding enactment of a law to protect their jobs. Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda recently said that the Congress legislature party will bring a private member’s bill during the coming assembly session to facilitate the reinstatement of PTIs. Hooda said courts had set aside the selections only on technical grounds. Independent MLAs like Balraj Kundu and Sombir Sangwan, both from the BJP stable, too have espoused the cause of the dismissed instructors. The apex court had quoted a ruling of a Constitution bench to answer the plea that it is not equitable to throw out the PTIs after they had been employed for over nine years. “It is very unfortunate that these persons should be uprooted after they had been appointed, but if equality and equal protection before the law have any meaning and if our public institutions are to inspire that confidence which is expected of them, we would be failing in our duty if we did not, even at the cost of considerable inconvenience to government and the selected candidates, do the right thing,’’ the SC said. Criminal case against former HSSC members The state government on the other hand has got a criminal case registered against former HSSC chairperson and members by the vigilance bureau in July for allegedly misusing their positions and tinkering with the selection criteria to help certain candidates get selected as PTIs. The sections invoked in the FIR pertained to punishment for false evidence in a judicial proceeding, public servant disobeying law, forgery of court record or public register, forgery for the purpose of cheating and criminal misconduct by a public servant. “The power to devise mode of selection and fix the criteria for selection was entrusted on the Commission to further the object of selection on merit to fill up posts in consonance with Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. When the alteration of criteria has been made, which has obviously affected the merit selection as we have found above, the allegations which have been made in the writ petition against the Commission in conducting the selection are allegations of malice-in-law and not malice-in-fact,’’ the apex court said. Directives of the courts A single bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court had on September 11, 2012 set aside the 2010 selections on account of changes made in the selection process. An HC division bench had upheld the decision of the single bench. The Supreme Court on April 8 upheld the HC decision. It termed as “arbitrary” the Commission’s decision of June 30, 2008, to cancel the written examination, the July 11, 2008 decision to call candidates eight times the number of vacancies on minimum percentage of marks for interviews and the decision of July 31, 2008 to call all the eligible candidates for interviews. These decisions were taken without any reason to change the selection criterion published in 2006, which “downgraded” the merit in the selection. The SC also said that since the Commission was a multi-member body, all decisions pertaining to mode of selection and criteria were to be taken by the Commission itself, there being no rules or resolution delegating the said power to Chairman or any other member. “ The decision of not holding written examination, to screen on the basis of eight times of vacancies and percentage of marks and to call all eligible candidates, were taken by the Chairman himself, and cannot be said to be decisions of the Commission,’’ the SC said. Quoting the HC findings on pattern of marks allocated to some selected and non-selected candidates, the apex court said the HC had observed that it cannot be a mere co-incidence that 90% of the meritorious candidates in academics performed so poorly in viva-voce that they could not secure even 10 marks out 30 or that the brilliance got configurated only in the average candidates possessing bare eligibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/selection-of-haryana-physical-training-instructors-probes-controversies-and-politics/story-PxroD5Xmoav6lY6MMtmN1I.html

23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Vigilance to wait for HP govt’s nod to probe minister’s land deals, oppn mounts pressure||The state anti-corruption and vigilance bureau ( SACVB) has sought permission from the Himachal government to investigate land deals pertaining to minister for social justice and empowerment Sarveen Chaudhary and her relatives . The controversy deepened after former tourism minister and senior Congress leader Vijay Singh Mankotia accused Chaudhary of striking dubious deals during her tenure as urban development minister. The vigilance bureau has reportedly sought permission to initiate preliminary enquiry. In case permission is granted, a case will be registered against the social justice minister. Mankoltia had alleged that the family and relatives of a minister had bought 1,100-kanal land in Mohal Patti, Fatehpur tehsil, Kangra, which was part of the 4,000 kanals sold in the area. He alleged that land had been bought in bulk to make money. Refusing to name the minister in question, Mankotia had asked CM Jai Ram Thakur whether he knew of his minister’s involvement. Mankotia said that it appeared that a land mafia, allegedly linked to a cabinet minister, was operating in the region.He had asked the BJP’s vanguard, including national president Jagat Parkash Nadda, former chief minister Shanta Kumar and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, to come clear on the deals otherwise it would give an impression that the minister was being shielded by the government .Sarveen Chaudhary has repeatedly defended the deals, saying there was nothing wrong in them. She said the land was purchased by her family in accordance with norms and the holding limit set by the government.Communist Party of India (Marxist) too has sought Chaudhary’s resignation. CPI (M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said there are many such cases where influential people with political reach have been accused of violating the laws to purchase land. Meanwhile, urban development minister Sarveen Chaudhary is in New Delhi to explain herself to the Central leaders.Mahender Singh Thakur, who also holds the revenue portfolio, also left for Delhi. The CM on Friday had called on governor Bandaru Dattatreya and reportedly hinted that a minister accused of striking dubious land deals may be dropped from the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vigilance-to-wait-for-hp-govt-s-nod-to-probe-minister-s-land-deals-oppn-mounts-pressure/story-IbmHjdQeaUMq5inWE2VmHN.html

23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Kangra Cong leaders bury the hatchet; draw up plan to corner govt||Burying the hatchet, senior Congress leaders in Kangra on Friday resolved to fight against the ‘discrimination being meted out to Kangra district under the BJP regime’. Prominent attendees were former minister GS Bali and his bête noir Sudhir Sharma. It is for the first time in three years that the two leaders, who mostly crossed swords in the battle to dominate Kangra, came together. Last time, they were seen before the 2017 assembly elections. Other leaders who attended the meeting included former Rajya Sabha Member Viplove Thakur, ex-MP Chander Kumar, Kangra district Congress president Ajay Mahajan, MLAs Pawan Kajal and Ashish Butail. Former MLAs Jagjeevan Pal, Sanjay Rattan, Kishori Lal, and Himachal Pradesh Congress general secretary Kewal Singh Pathania were also present. Meanwhile, former minister Sudhir Sharma said that the major agenda of the meeting was bias against Kangra district in the current BJP regime. “The current BJP regime has meted out discrimination to Kangra whether it is on development front or granting second capital status to Dharamshala town,” said Sharma. “The road to Shimla goes through Kangra. It is this district that decides which party will form the government. However, the BJP government has ignored the district,” he added. The former minister and AICC secretary said that all the development projects had come to a standstill in Kangra. Dharamshala was granted second capital second capital status by previous Congress government and that issued to has been put on backburner. “We gave the government three years time but things don’t seem to getting back on track. Now there is no option but a stir,” said Sharma. Another senior leader GS Bali said the road projects announced by the Union Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari have yet not taken off. “The Central University of Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) still awaits allotment of land for permanent campus and other projects too face a similar fate,” he said. Bali said that the many corruption cases involving BJP leaders that have come to fore but the government was trying to hush up the things. He said that the Congress will launch an agitation against this discrimination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kangra-cong-leaders-bury-the-hatchet-draw-up-plan-to-corner-govt/story-IjWBjAAD5YgAm4vQcMyVJN.html

23-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chaos reigns on Day 1 of weekend lockdown in Chandigarh||Even after UT adviser Manoj Parida took to Twitter on Saturday morning to clarify that restaurants and shops providing essential services will remain open on Day 1 of weekend lockdown, police largely remained unaware and eateries and grocery shops were asked to shut down at several places.Some eating joints in Sector 9 were allegedly closed down by the police. Rahul Tyagi, proprietor of Dumpling Hood, said, “We opened at 12 noon, the same time as Softy Corner and La Pinoz. But some UT officials asked us to shut down. Till 1:30pm, the shops remained shut. Then police officials from the beat box called us and said we could open the shop.” La Pinoz remained shut even in the evening and the owner remained unavailable for comment.There were incidents of police getting into spats with some shopkeepers in Sector 8, but the situation didn’t escalate. Local area councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said, “After I received complaints from shopkeepers in sectors 8 and 9, I asked the cops to allow eateries to open. Confusion was largely because this wasn’t clearly written in the orders.”COPS, TRADERS GET INTO SPATSIn Sector 32, too, the situation was the same. The owner of a kiryana store here, on the condition of anonymity, said a team of cops had come to his shop and asked him to close down despite his shop coming under essential services.President of the Sector-32 market welfare association Rajinder Mehendiratta said that all disputes between cops and eatery owners and shopkeepers were swiftly resolved, and shops were allowed to remain open.Residents, however, alleged that there were no police checking the markets of city villages. Kusum Ghai, a social activist of Burail, Sector 45, said a sabzi mandi was organised here on Saturday and 60-70 vendors were present without any regard for social distancing or mask-wearing.To pacify the situation, Parida also tweeted how they had no other option but to impose weekend restrictions. “Chandigarh had to close shops on weekends to prevent shopper rush. We have no plans to disrupt normal functioning of private offices, industries, hotels and banks, where social distancing can be assured,” he said.BEOPAR MANDAL PROTESTS WITH FRUITS, VEGETABLESThe Chandigarh Beopar Mandal organised a protest in Sector-23 market regarding the administration’s last minute decision to impose a weekend lockdown in the city. Mandal president Anil Vohra said, “The administration has adopted a pick-and-choose policy for shutting down shops which is unfair. Are shopkeepers working in essential services, restaurants or industry workers immune from the virus?”While protesting, the Mandal members held fruits and vegetables, saying they’ll be forced to sell these to survive in the current economic climate.ELANTE MALL PARTLY OPENWhile there was confusion regarding opening of malls, Elante Mall officials confirmed that restaurants in the courtyard of the mall had permission to remain open. “Eateries inside the mall were open for takeaway and home delivery through apps. Apollo pharmacy and Big Bazaar in the mall will also remain open even during the weekend,” officials said.SECTOR 17 DESERTED OVER WEEKENDSector 17 also bore a deserted look on Saturday with most shops falling under the non-essential category. President of Business Promotion Council, Sector 17, Neeraj Bajaj wrote to the UT adviser and said, “The weekend lockdown has proved to be a jolt for the business community. Two-day lockdown in a week means at least 40% loss.” He added that shopkeepers have to pay rent, bills and salaries of their employees and have asked the adviser to reconsider his decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chaos-reigns-on-day-1-of-weekend-lockdown-in-chandigarh/story-g5vDPONdJZNi9YVIZsTXiK.html

23-08-2020||Delhi||In Covid distress calls to police, a shift from panic to awareness||An HT analysis of distress calls data received at the Delhi Police control room since March, when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, shows how the response of residents to the disease has gone from shock and panic to that of awareness and learning to live with it while observing social distancing, hand hygiene and using face masks, said senior officers of the police control room(PCR) that keeps an eye on all calls received at 112. According to PCR (police control room) data accessed by Hindustan Times, coronavirus disease-related calls have gone from 3,062 every week in March and April to 45 between August 5 and 11.Initially, majority of Covid-related calls were from people who said they had symptoms and didn’t know what to do about it. Junior personnel who attended the calls said “it felt like working in a hospital”. Also read | Aarogya Setu’s new feature to help businesses function during Covid-19 pandemic: GovtIn the first week of the lockdown (March 22-March 31), the control room received only 44 calls from such persons. This increased to 223 in the first week of April. Such calls continued increasing until June 15 -- it had touched a high of 1,368 -- after which the numbers decreased, shows PCR data.In the third week of August, only 116 persons called the control room, claiming to have symptoms of the disease, data shows.During the initial weeks, several incidents of quarrel and fights between people on issues related to the diseases were also reported. Majority of such calls were from people who suspected their neighbours of carrying the virus. On April 8, two women doctors working at a hospital were assaulted by their neighbour, who suspected them of being infected. On May 14, in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, a woman was locked inside her house by neighbours who said she was carrying the virus.Following many such cases, police had issued a warning against any attack on the front line medical workers.Records show that to date, medical personnel made 144 distress calls. Most calls were received at the control room April and May. Between April 16 and 30, police received 42 such calls, followed by 21 in the first fortnight of May. These calls have decreased. The control room received only 10 such calls between July 16 and August 11.An officer at the police control room, “Fewer crimes were being reported in the early days of the lockdown. We knew that one of every 10 calls we received would be related to the disease. Initially, we knew little about the disease. We did not know that many people with mild symptoms recover if they isolate themselves at home. In the early weeks, if anyone called us claiming to have information about a Covid-19 patient, we would inform the local police, who called up the district magistrate’s office. It was crazy.”Also read | 29% of Delhi has antibodies for Covid-19: Second sero-surveyA second officer, who also works with the PCR unit, said during the initial weeks, they felt like working in a hospital. “People panicked on noticing symptoms in neighbours and called us. It is better now. We even counsel some callers these days and explain how people like us who have to step out and deal with the citizens have learnt to live with the disease. All that one must do is to follow the health’s ministry’s guidelines.”People also called up the police, seeking food and provisions. In the first 10 days of the lockdown, police received 5,349 calls, which decreased to 4,722 between April 1 and April 15. Such calls have almost stopped now. Between July 16 and August 16, police received only three such calls.A Delhi police spokesperson attributed the decrease in such calls to its food distribution drive. Delhi Police distributed over five million food packets to the urban poor and homeless. They distributed 145 tonnes of dry ration. Their efforts earned the appreciation by home minister Amit Shah. He had tweeted, “ Delhi Police, an organization that lives up to its Motto- Shanti Sewa Nyaya. Very proud of @DelhiPolice. Together we will win this battle.”Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine, AIIMS, said during the initial days, the word coronavirus was like a ‘death warrant’.“ People thought they would die if they catch the virus. Now, people have learnt to live with the virus. There are many reasons for this. Earlier, people had little or no information about the disease. People did not know who to approach for help. There was lockdown and cases were rising. People had never been in such a situation. Now, people know where to go, who to approach. There is an abundance of testing centres. It wasn’t so then. Even as there are more cases now, panic is less and hence fewer distress calls. People are out on the roads and in the market places wearing masks. They know that they can even recover by taking medicines and staying home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-covid-calls-to-police-a-shift-from-panic-to-awareness/story-FNr1EBojeBYxnwZ1InvgiO.html
23-08-2020||Delhi||Suspected IS operative had planned ‘lone wolf’ terror strike in a high footfall area: Police||The Delhi Police on Saturday said they have arrested a 36-year-old suspected operative of the Islamic State. Police said the man had planned a “lone wolf” terror strike in a high footfall area in the city “using a high-intensity pressure cooker-based improvised explosive device (IED)”. Police did not specify the “high-footfall area” that the man was to target, but said he hailed from a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur, and was set to carry out the IED blasts. Police said they received information that the alleged operative, Mohammed Mushtaqeem Khan, would pass by Dhaula Kuan area on Friday. Officers of the special cell said around 11pm, the man was intercepted and caught after a shoot-out in the Ridge area between Dhaula Kuan and Karol Bagh. Police said they recovered two pressure cooker IEDs weighing around 15kg, a.30 bore pistol and four cartridges that Khan was carrying in a bag. Khan was on a white TVS Apache motorcycle at the time of his arrest. Also read| Delhi: Suspected ISIS operative arrested with IEDs after encounter“Five shots were exchanged, including three fired on the raiding party by Khan. Nobody was injured,” deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Kushwah said. On Saturday morning, around a dozen National Security Guard (NSG) officers, including those from its bomb disposal squad, carried out a “controlled blast” to dispose of the IEDs, for which they created a pit inside the Buddha Jayanti Park and cordoned off the entire area as a safety and precautionary measure. The team used a remote-controlled vehicle to lift and contain the IEDs. The operation last nearly three hours. The IEDs were ready for use and only installation of timers were needed for carrying out explosions, Kushwah said. In a press statement, police said Khan’s interrogation has revealed that his original plan was to carry out the IED blasts during the Independence Day celebrations on August 15. “However, because of the heavy security arrangements, Khan could not enter the city and had to drop the terror strike plan, Kushwah said. During a press briefing, the DCP said Khan had planned the blasts on the directions of his handler, a commander of the ISKP (Islamic State of Khorasan Province) in Afghanistan, which is a banned terrorist organisation and is a part of IS. The officer did not disclose the handler’s name, saying it would hamper their probe. Khan was in touch with the commander through social media, they said. “Khan told us that he was more inclined to “fidayeen (suicide) attack”. But his handler had told him that after successfully executing the IEDs blasts, he would be getting fresh instructions to carry out a fidayeen attack. He claims that he has already prepared “an explosive belt” for the fidayeen attack. We are verifying his claims and trying to recover it,” Kushwah said, adding that the ownership of the motorcycle with UP registration that Khan was riding is being verified Khan has told the police that he learnt to make “IEDs and suicide belt” through videos on social media. “He has told us that he carried out a successful dry run of a small IED blast at a burial ground in his village. Also, he prepared the two pressure cooker IEDs himself. We are verifying his claims,” the DCP said. On Saturday, Khan was sent to eight-day police custody by a Delhi court. A Class 9 drop-out, Khan runs a cosmetic shop at his village in Balrampur, where his wife and four children also live. Uttar Pradesh police has sounded a statewide alert on Saturday after Khan’s arrest , Prashant Kumar, additional director general (ADG) of police (law and order), said. Kumar said all district police chiefs have been asked to intensify vigil and carry out extensive drives to check the movement of suspicious people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/suspected-is-operative-had-planned-a-lone-wolf-terror-strike-in-a-high-footfall-area-police/story-opXWmfHQcA1LbQr0l0oE3O.html

23-08-2020||Delhi||Publisher withdraws book on Delhi riots, author goes ahead with virtual launch||The publishers of a book on communal riots in north-east Delhi announced the withdrawal of the publication on Saturday, a day after an event proclaiming its virtual launch kicked up a controversy. In a statement, publishers Bloomsbury India said: “Bloomsbury India had planned to release Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story in September, a book purportedly giving a factual report on the riots in Delhi in February 2020, based on investigations and interviews conducted by the authors. However, in view of very recent events including a virtual pre-publication launch organised without our knowledge by the authors, with participation by parties of whom the publishers would not have approved, we have decided to withdraw publication of the book. Bloomsbury India strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society.” The announcement came even as the authors held the virtual book launch event with BJP leader Kapil Mishra – the guest of honour – saying that the “book is public now” on Twitter. Apart from Mishra, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri and OpIndia editor Nupur Sharma were also invited as guests of honour. BJP national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav launched the book.“Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story tells us the liberals are not fighting for right to freedom of expression but the freedom to speak anything they want even that which harms the country. The Delhi riots were an attempt to wage jihad against the Indian state,” Yadav wrote on Twitter. The clashes between Hindus and Muslims in different parts of north-east Delhi left at least 53 dead and around 400 injured. While Mishra has not been charged by the police, he delivered a speech ahead of the riots -- between pro- and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters that snowballed into a Hindu-Muslim communal riot -- that people would take matters into their own hands if the police did not remove anti-CAA demonstrators from near the Jafrabad Metro station. In response to the publishing house withdrawing the publication of the book, Mishra said, “I would like to congratulate the authors of this book because they have managed to bring out such an authentic account that the custodians of freedom of speech, who even considered demeaning our motherland and our gods and goddesses as freedom of speech got scared of this book and started leading a smear campaign against it. Even before reading the book this lobby was afraid.”Monica Arora, who has co-authored the book with Sonali Chitalkar and Prerna Malhotra, said they had been in touch with Bloomsbury for the past three months. “The contract with the publishers was signed after we sent them the manuscript two months ago based on our ground report. After exchange of several emails on regular basis recommending edits, over one month ago the final draft was approved. They published 100 books and gave it to us. We informed them of the launch, the guests, and the posters of the event was put in the public domain. There was no problem before Friday when leftist-fascists scuttled my freedom of speech,” she said, adding that the authors have not received any formal e-mail on withdrawal of the contract.“Bloomsbury India had no problems with the book. But after people started tagging Bloomsbury UK, they pressurized Bloomsbury India and we were told that they might be withdrawing from publication due to international pressure. This is breach of trust and contract. Is it ethical to crumble under social media pressure?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/publisher-withdraws-book-on-delhi-riots-author-goes-ahead-with-virtual-launch/story-qCDQtQoIVexVgn2VTsi9eP.html
23-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court tells police to probe allegations against lawyer||A court on Saturday directed the Delhi police’s special cell or unit branch to probe allegations against a city advocate who allegedly “tutored victims to give false statement” in the north-east Delhi riots cases. The court passed the order after police submitted a report, citing a riot victim’s statement, in which he claimed he was asked to depose falsely by advocate Mahmood Pracha. Pracha who denied the allegations and accused police of framing him is also representing many other accused persons in the cases of the Delhi riots. The riot victim also told police that he had falsely named three persons --- Navneet, Deepak and Mintu -- on Pracha’s instruction. According to police report, Ali told police that he was contacted by Pracha to identify an eyewitness named Sharif who was a witness in another case. Ali alleged that Pracha told him Sharif’s statement in his case would make his case stronger for which he would have to depose that Sharif had seen his shop burning. But Ali said that he did not know Sharif or had seen Sharif ever so there was no question of claiming that he had seen Sharif while rioters were burning his shop on February 24. The police report also mentioned that Ali’s affidavit was signed by an advocate who supposedly died in 2017. On Saturday, additional sessions judge, Vinod Yadav ordered police commissioner to issue directions to special cell or crime branch to probe the allegations against Pracha. Pracha denied all the allegations. “Since I am representing many complainants and accused persons in the Delhi riots cases, where police inaction and participation has been alleged by my clients so police are implicating me. Any investigation done by the DCP of the North East who was seen with a controversial BJP leader has to be taken with a pinch of salt. They did not take action against the BJP leader but are trying to implicate me in such false cases. First police attacked journalists and now they are attacking lawyers for speaking the truth.” At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured in the Delhi riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-court-tells-police-to-probe-allegations-against-lawyer/story-y4QeXCVBA2goFzCAptqkNI.html

23-08-2020||Delhi||2,000 electric buses in Delhi by end-2021: Govt||If all goes as planned, Delhi will have as many as 2,000 electric public transport buses by the end of 2021 and owners of electric two-wheelers and four-wheelers will be able to charge their vehicles at the existing fuel stations, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Saturday. The development comes after RK Singh, Union minister of state (independent charge) for power and non-renewable energy, held a meeting with minister Gahlot and senior officials from the Centre and state power and transport departments on Thursday (August 20). Singh’s office did not respond to calls and messages seeking his comment on the issue. But Gahlot said, “ We had a very fruitful discussion with the Union minister. He (Singh) has assured to get us subsidies from the Central government’s FAME II scheme for 700 more electric buses which will take Delhi’s total count of proposed e-buses to 2,000. The Centre’s support will act as a huge catalyst to the policy, and motivate more people and organisations to switch to EVs.” The Central government’s second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme provides cash incentives for the purchase of EVs, and was intended to push the two-wheeler market, apart from heavy passenger and goods transport vehicles, with an approved budget of ₹10,000 crore. He said the Delhi EV policy, notified on August 8 by the Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Delhi government, was also extensively discussed with the Union minister. “The first leg of the policy targets installation of 200 charging stations within the city in the next year, such that there is a charging station every 3km. Upon hearing this, the Union minister said the power ministry will explore the possibility of setting up EV charging points at all existing fuel stations in the national capital. If that happens, then there is no stopping Delhi from becoming the EV capital of India,” the transport minister said. The Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy aims at having 5 lakh (25% of all new vehicle registrations) electric vehicles in Delhi by 2024. Along with providing category based incentives, it also aims to develop an effective network of charging stations and infrastructure throughout the city. The policy also has provisions to encourage more private players to venture into being partners in the initiative by setting up private charging stations or battery charging points. As per government records, 1,000 electric buses for public transport, which were first committed by the Delhi government over two years ago, are at different phases of delivery. Apart from these, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is going to procure 300 e-buses after it managed to get an approval for subsidies under the Centre’s FAME II scheme. Senior government officials said owing to the pandemic and the lockdown, the procurement process of these buses got delayed and the delivery of all 1,000 buses is likely to be completed by March next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-000-electric-buses-in-delhi-by-end-2021-govt/story-UNUbjbowri3qPJJQbEI6JJ.html

23-08-2020||Gurugram||Part of under construction flyover at Gurugram’s Sohna road collapses, two injured||A section of the under-construction flyover in Gurugram’s Sohna Road collapsed on Saturday night. The incident occurred at 9.47 pm when three girders installed recently between two pillars came crashing down in front of Vipul Greens condominium. At least two people have been injured in the incident. The police confirmed that two labourers were injured but a serious accident was averted as it was night time and traffic volume was low since markets and offices were closed on Saturday as part of the weekend restrictions enforced by the state government to curb the spread of Covid-19. Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said they received information within few minutes of the collapse and a patrolling car and along with riders reached the spot in five minutes. No casualty was reported. “Two labourers at the site have suffered minor injuries,” he said.The 21.66 km-long Sohna road project is being constructed in two packages. The first part comprises an underpass and an elevated road from Subash Chowk towards Badshahpur covering 6 km. The section that collapsed was a part of the first package.The second part comprises the expansion of 12.72-km road from Badshahpur to Sohna and involves construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on the entire stretch. The deadline for both these projects is July, 2021. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials confirmed the collapse and said that a team reached the spot to assess the situation. The area has been sealed off. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI said, “We sent a team of officials immediately to.the spot after the incident. No work was going on today and the area was secure and barricaded. Normally such incidents don’t happen and there must be a technical reason which caused this. The technical.team will probe it. ”A senior official from Oriental Engineering, the contractor on condition of anonymity said it primarily appears that stressing wire which bears the load of the girders had some problem. “The real reason for this collapse will need a structural probe,” he added. Locals said they heard a loud bang at around 9.50 pm and rushed outside.

23-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: It’s time for tricity to clean up its act||There was good and bad news this week as Chandigarh improved its ranking in this year’s Swachh Survekshan (cleanliness survey) to 16 from 20 last year. However, the city could not make it to the top 10 cleanest cities in the country for the second year in a row. Chandigarh last made it to the top slots in 2018 when it was adjudged the third cleanest. Among the UT’s sister cities, Panchkula too improved its rank to 56, but was nowhere near the top, climbing 15 spots from last year’s rank of 71. Mohali’s performance left a lot to be desired for as it slipped to rank 157 this year after being slotted at 153 in 2019. Its best has been rank 109 in 2018.The reason for tricity’s poor show is largely due to its waste management strategies, which are yet not up to scratch despite years of planning. Chandigarh’s experiment with the waste segregation plant at Dadumajra has so far been a fiasco, with the municipal corporation this year taking over from Jaypee. Panchkula, too, though streamlining its door-to-door waste collection and imposing penalty for non segregation of waste, has not been able to clean up the garbage dump across the Ghaggar river or clear up the nullah through various sectors of the city. As far as Mohali is concerned, the municipal corporation’s ambitious solid-waste management project at Samgoli village has remained a non-starter. The city also failed to ensure an open-defecation free status by constructing adequate mobile and public toilets – crucial for attaining smart city status. MC’s plans to spend Rs 97.76 lakh on construction of public toilets in eight markets, too, have not come to fruition.The blame for not developing clean and green cities rests squarely on the administrative failure and lack of accountability. All that the powers that be seem to be doing currently is passing the buck instead of coming out with a coherent time-bound strategy to improve things. A turnaround is required now, and the only way in which it can be done is by holding officials accountable for the state of a city or town. The time has passed for blaming everything on a funds crunch and sitting around waiting for another year to pass before the next round of rankings is announced. The public should settle for nothing less. QUESTIONSwachh SurvekshanIs fixing accountability key to improving rankings? Fixing accountability is the only way to get cities to perform better in Swachh Survekshan. Do you agree?

23-08-2020||Pune||Pune reports highest single-day Covid19 deaths in a day||Pune is now a Covid-19 hotspot not just in the state, but also in the country. In addition to most active cases in the country and maximum progressive positives, the city is now reported the highest single-day Covid-19 deaths across the nation on Thursday. On August 20, Pune district reported 95 deaths in a day of the 981 deaths reported across the country which was the highest for any city or district, while Mumbai which was on the second position reported 46 deaths, which was less than half of what Pune had reported. Pune city is among the topmost cities with maximum Covid-19 cases in the country, however, the administration is of the view that the city is now riding the peak and so, the number of cases would decline over the next four-six weeks.Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner said, “It is true that there is a high prevalence in the district, but thankfully our recovery rate is also high. Since August we have added about 10% of the active cases as over 90% of the total positives were discharged after they successfully recovered.”“To reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) we are now aggressively testing senior citizens too and with new jumbo facilities, no one will have to wait for ventilators or ICUs. Also, with the help of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we are working on regulation of the essential drugs to ensure that there is no shortage,” he said.”We appeal to those who have recovered to come forward and donate blood for plasma which has proven to be a promising treatment,” he said.In addition to Pune, six more cities from Maharashtra were among the top ten cities or districts which reported the highest single-day deaths on August 20. These include Mumbai which reported 46 deaths; Thane 25 deaths; Kolhapur 22 deaths; Nagpur 21; Jalgaon 20 deaths and Ahmednagar 17. However, the city’s case fatality rate is far less than Mumbai which has a case fatality rate of about 5.5% while Pune district is 2.4% and within the city, Pune rural is now the new eyesore for the administration with the highest case fatality rate at 3.2%. Dr Sanjay Dabhade, health activist from Jan Aarogya Manch, said, “Prevalence rate is definitely high in Pune. The main concern was that the administration and at the individual level, the people of Pune were lacking in prevention measures. Due to economic compulsion, the unlock process is underway. Also, due to the demographics of the city, where about 40 per cent of the population lives in slums, the rise in cases was expected.”“We are following the curve of the virus which was seen in Delhi or Mumbai, and soon we will also see declining of the peak too. We are witnessing that there is no proper nursing care for patients and also this condition is highlighting the loophole in the health infrastructure,” he said. The district administration is now ramping up its critical care facilities. Currently, there are about 710 intensive care unit (ICU) beds with ventilators and 827 ICU beds without ventilators. By next week with the inauguration of two jumbo facilities at College of Engineering, Pune and Annasaheb Magar stadium, Pune will also see 400 more ICU beds being added which will take the total count to above 1,000 ICU beds in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-reports-highest-single-day-covid19-deaths-in-a-day/story-y2B5aJsjYQRn8kvQkmWqaO.html
23-08-2020||Pune||Ganeshotsav begins sans procession, dhol-tashas in Pune||Amid chants of Ganpati bappa moraya, thousands of devotees brought Ganesh idols home as the 10-day festival began on Saturday. While the enthusiasm was intact, what was missing this year was social celebrations as Ganesh mandals decided not to take out processions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. For over a century, the Ganpati festival has been celebrated in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra through large-scale celebrations and big processions of which the major attraction is the dhol-tasha (drums and cymbals). This year, these dhol-tasha pathaks (troupes) were missing ahead of the festival, which has entered into its 128th year since Lokmanya Tilak made the festival public in order to fight the British in the pre-Independence era. To avoid the crowding, many citizens got Ganesh idols home on Friday with the ceremonial installation of the idols carried out before 11:30am, known to be an auspicious time. “This year we decided to avoid any decoration at home and also ordered an idol and puja material online in view of the spread of virus,” said Mangesh Andhare, a resident Navi peth. In Pune, most big mandals have decided to go online to ensure that devotees are not devoid of a glimpse of the lord in view of Covid pandemic. Dagdusheth Halwai temple, Bhau Rangari mandal have offered online darshan to devotees. The five ‘manache ganpati’ (most revered Ganeshas) in Pune are also celebrating the festival in a simple manner without setting up separate big mandaps and are avoiding any decoration to prevent crowding. These five ganpati mandals, including Kasba peth, Guruji Talim, Tambdi Jogeshwari, Tulshibaug and Kesari wada attract large crowds every year as devotees from across Maharashtra come for their darshan. To avoid any VIP movement, these manache Ganpati mandals installed their idols by trustees of each other. To check the spread of coronavirus, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has also appealed to people to celebrate the Ganpati festival in a simple manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ganeshotsav-begins-sans-procession-dhol-tashas-in-pune/story-Gq6pzGZNwCiiKpNlZSsvFL.html
23-08-2020||World||Indian origin man gets life term for killing mother, step-father||Anmol Chana, who stabbed to death his mother and step-father earlier this year, has been sentenced to life in prison at the Birmingham Crown Court , with a minimum of 36 years in prison, before he can be considered for release.Chana, 26, killed Jasbir Kaur, 52, and her husband, Rupinder Singh Bassan, 51, on February 25 in their home in Oldbury in the West Midlands. The police said his motive was not clear but he was known to be fanatical about knives and his desire to kill his mother.After killing the two, Chana stole money from the house and bought a ticket to flee the country, but was nabbed by the police. A search of his home in Smethwick led to the keys to Bassan’s car that he had taken, his passport with travel details and a combat style knife, and a sheath covered in blood.He was found guilty of the murders following a nine-day trial at the Birmingham Crown Court, where Judge Mark Wall said Chana showed a “complete lack of remorse,” adding: “You claimed to the jury that you had killed them in self-defence. The truth was very different.”“I am sure that the allegations you made at trial of your mother abusing you throughout your childhood were false and designed to garner jury sympathy for you. These are allegations born of pure fantasy,” the judge added.Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse said: “Chana carried out a despicable crime against his family in their own home which should have been a place of safety. Our investigation revealed that Chana was fanatical about knives and had previously expressed a desire to kill his mother.”“Sadly we do not know what led him to carry out such a vicious and sickening attack. My thoughts remain with the couple’s wider family and friends. I can’t imagine how they are feeling; the shock and pain that his actions have caused will stay with them forever.”Chana’s sister, Kiran Chana, added her tribute: “My parents were the most loving people I’ve ever known. My mum went through hell and kept going to look after me and my brother. She’s the toughest woman I know. My dad was the perfect match for her.”“I am sad that their lives were ended so quickly without a second thought by a person whom they both loved dearly. Their lives together had just started. Not only did he take their lives, but he has tried to defame them in court to protect himself. I am angry at him for trying to use such tactics against their memory and against the person who always did her best for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-man-gets-life-term-for-killing-mother-step-father/story-CQMyyh4gCqvi5rXTOebSZP.html

23-08-2020||World||Airplane mode and prepaid SIMs: Some Israelis dodge Covid-19 tracking||Israel’s cellphone surveillance for coronavirus contact-tracing may have overcome challenges by privacy watchdogs, but the state tracking policy is hard put to deal with low-tech evasion methods seemingly lifted from TV cop shows.Some Israelis, fearing a quarantine order after unwittingly being near a coronavirus carrier, are rendering themselves untraceable while in public by switching their cellphones to “airplane mode” or using prepaid “burner” SIM cards instead.Such actions are not illegal and, although there is only anecdotal evidence for their prevalence, they drew remonstration from Communication Minister Yoaz Hendel on Sunday.“This is a problem,” he told Ynet TV. “Ultimately, we are not a police state. We will not manage to compel the citizens of the State of Israel to keep to the health regulations.”The surveillance, initially instituted without parliamentary oversight by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been anchored in legislation at the behest of Israel’s Supreme Court after it heard challenges by civil liberties groups who worry the mass-surveillance is ripe for abuse.Modeled on a counter-terrorism technology and in force since March, the system back-tracks movements of people who have tested positive for the virus to determine who came within 2 metres (yards) of them for more than 15 minutes while they were infectious.Having been identified by their own cellphone locations, these potential new carriers are then ordered over SMS to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the moment of exposure.Around 80,000 people per week have received such notifications since July 1, according to officials - an economic drag for a country of 9 million.Officials say the surveillance has detected some 30% of coronavirus cases in Israel. They also acknowledge a false-positive rate of around 16%, sometimes due to a vertical blind-spot in the technology which risks flagging people above or below a coronavirus carrier in a multi-storey building.Such instances may be overturned on appeal - a process that can take several days, during which the quarantine is in force.Israel offers a voluntary coronavirus app, HaMagen, whose latest upgrade includes Bluetooth contact-tracing for greater precision. But with users complaining about battery drainage, its market penetration has been far below the 60% required for the state surveillance technology to be dropped, officials say.Israel has recorded 102,380 coronavirus cases and 834 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airplane-mode-and-prepaid-sims-some-israelis-dodge-covid-19-tracking/story-HLOA4AP841FiLPcIFBimoJ.html

He’ll be followed to many of the same destinations later in the week by President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, diplomats said.The separate visits come as the administration seeks to capitalize on momentum from the historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to establish diplomatic relations.In addition to Israel and Sudan, the State Department said Pompeo would travel to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Officials said stops in Oman and Qatar are also possible.“The US commitment to peace, security, and stability in Israel, Sudan, and among Gulf countries has never been stronger than under President Trump’s leadership,” the State Department said in a statement announcing Pompeo’s trip.Kushner and his team are expected to visit Israel, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Morocco on their trip, which is scheduled to begin at the end of the week, according to the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the itinerary has not yet been finalized or publicly announced.In Israel, Pompeo will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “to discuss regional security issues related to Iran’s malicious influence, establishing and deepening Israel’s relationships in the region, as well as cooperation in protecting the US and Israeli economies from malign investors,” the State Department said.“Malign investors” is a reference to China, which is seeking to gain a commercial foothold in Israel.In Khartoum. Pompeo will meet Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok “to discuss continued US support for the civilian-led transitional government and express support for deepening the Sudan-Israel relationship,” the department said. Sudan is eager to be removed from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism and normalizing ties with Israel would be a step toward that goal.However, removal from the terrorism list is also dependent on completion of a compensation agreement for victims of the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A tentative deal struck several months ago is still awaiting finalization.Neither Pompeo’s nor Kushner’s trips is expected to result in announcements of immediate breakthroughs, but both are aimed at building on the success of the Israel-UAE agreement by finalizing at least one, and potentially more, normalization deals between Arab countries and Israel in the near future.The administration has forged ahead with those efforts over Palestinian objections and without any indication the Palestinians are willing to enter negotiations with Israel. The Arab world had long held that a settlement to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a prerequisite for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced on Aug. 13 they would establish full diplomatic relations, in a US-brokered deal that required Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians.The agreement was a key foreign policy victory for Trump as he seeks reelection and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Last week, the administration took the controversial step in the U.N. Security Council of triggering the restoration of all international sanctions on Iran, something that only Israel and the Gulf Arab nations have publicly supported. Thirteen of the 15 council members, including US allies Britain, France and Germany, have rejected the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-heads-to-mideast-as-part-of-donald-trump-s-arab-israeli-push/story-lQ9INby9bFu1PXVTrTUQwN.html
23-08-2020||World||Vacationers, migrants drive Italy’s surge in Covid-19 cases||Sicily’s governor has ordered all migrant residences on the Italian island to be shut down by Monday, part of a push-back by Italian regions alarmed by a surge in Covid-19 cases a few weeks before schools are to reopen.But while some new migrants have tested positive, vacationers returning from Mediterranean Sea resorts abroad as well as from the Italian island of Sardinia lately have accounted for far more of Italy’s new coronavirus infections.On Sunday, Italy registered 1,210 new cases, the highest daily number since May 12 and only weeks after the nation had seen the number of day-to-day new infections plunge to about 200.The Lazio region, which includes Rome, and the hard-hit Lombardy led the nation in regional new caseloads Sunday. Thousands of returning travelers got tested at Rome-area airports and a port north of the capital, as well as at airports that serve Lombardy’s main city, Milan.On the mainland, many of the latest cases were linked to travelers coming from abroad. Those arriving from Spain, Malta, Greece and Croatia must be tested within 48 hours of entering Italy, after those nations saw worrisome upticks in infections.And many recent coronavirus clusters have been traced to people who vacationed on Sardinia. With many people taking ferries from Sardinia to the Italian mainland, Lazio set up a testing facility at Civitavecchia’s dock, so those driving vehicles off the ferries could line up for immediate testing.Lazio Gov. Nicola Zingaretti appealed to the governor of Sardinia to test vacationers before they sailed or flew to the mainland, saying his region would do the same for travelers leaving for Sardinia.Sardinia, which had been counting barely a handful of new cases daily in recent months, registered 81 new cases since Saturday.In Sicily, Gov. Nello Musumeci’s ordinance took effect on Sunday, requiring all migrants who reach the island by sea be transferred off as part of measures to combat the spread of COVID-19.It stipulates that all centers housing migrants awaiting processing of asylum applications be shut down by the end of Monday. His order, effective through Sept. 10, also forbids any boat, including charity vessels, to bring migrants to the island.But the national government, not regional governors, are in charge of migrant policies and Musumeci acknowledged that his directive might be challenged in court. On Saturday, migrants accounted for 16 of Sicily’s 48 confirmed infections.Although in past years, nearly all migrants reaching Italy by sea were rescued by humanitarian groups, cargo ships or military vessels, this year, nearly 80% of arrivals reached Italian shores on their own, most setting sail from Tunisia.Many come ashore on the tiny island of Lampedusa, whose migrant residence is dangerously overcrowded. Italy has taken to quarantining the latest arrivals aboard chartered ferries offshore Sicily.“I can’t ask our people to keep a (safe) distance, wear masks and do other measures while the state amasses people in two rooms,’‘ Musumeci said, referring to the migrant centers.Gov. Vincenzo De Luca, who leads the Campania region including Naples, raised the possibility that if the daily infections keep surging, he will ask the federal government to reinstate restrictions on traveling between regions that were in force through much of Italy’s lockdown.Some wrote off De Luca’s warning as posturing before gubernatorial elections in several regions, including his own, in September.“What is he going to do, send in the Carabinieri (to block those outside his region from entering)?” Tuscany Gov. Enrico Rossi told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.__Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vacationers-migrants-drive-italy-s-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-lYTvaQ5Z6jdpDeTBEYHRpJ.html

23-08-2020||World||China approves emergency usage of Covid-19 vaccines: Report||China has authorised emergency usage of Covid-19 vaccines developed by some select domestic companies, a Chinese health official has said. An emergency use authorisation, which is based on Chinese vaccine management law, allows unapproved vaccine candidates to be used among people who are at high risk of getting infected on a limited period. “We’ve drawn up a series of plan packages, including medical consent forms, side-effects monitoring plans, rescuing plans, compensation plans, to make sure that the emergency use is well regulated and monitored,” Zheng Zhongwei, head of China’s coronavirus vaccine development task force, told state-run CCTV on Saturday. One month has passed since China officially launched the urgent use of Covid-19 vaccines on July 22, while the vaccines were going through clinical trials, Zheng said. Recipients who got their first dose since then revealed they had few adverse reactions and none reported a fever. According to China’s Law on Vaccine Management, when a particularly severe public health emergency occurs, vaccines in clinical trials can be used in a limited scope to protect medical and epidemic prevention personnel, border officers and other people working in stable city operations, Zheng said. State-run Global Times has previously reported that employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) preparing to go abroad and frontline medics have been offered two choices of domestic inactivated vaccine candidates developed by Sinopharm for urgent use.On Thursday and Friday, Sinopharm signed cooperation agreements on phase III clinical trials of inactivated vaccines with Peru, Morocco and Argentina. Zheng noted that for the next step of preventing a possible outbreak this autumn and winter, vaccines’ availability will be extended to people working in food markets, transport systems and services industries. The number of people being vaccinated on an urgent basis may reach hundreds of thousands across China, considering that personnel in wider sectors are being offered free injections, said Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based immunology expert, on Sunday. “But it’s difficult to give an accurate figure since the Chinese military has begun mass vaccinations but has not released details,” Tao said.. Wu, an employee of a state-owned company handling overseas construction projects along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Asian and African countries, told the Global Times on Sunday that all staff in her firm have been offered inactivated vaccine injections on a voluntary basis for free. Wu, who took the vaccine on August 7 along with many of her colleagues, said she did not experience any adverse reactions, similar to everyone else in her group. “My colleagues and I felt only a little dizzy on the afternoon of the vaccination, but we got over it pretty quickly. There was no local redness, swelling or pain, and we did not hear of anyone reporting a fever,” said Wu, who will take her second dose on day 28 after the first shot. “People seem to be relaxed over the vaccination as most of us feel confident in domestically developed vaccines,” she said..One of Sinopharm’s inactivated Covid-19 vaccines on August 13 was revealed to have had a low rate of adverse reactions for patients in phase I and II clinical trials, while also demonstrating immunogenicity results. The inactivated vaccine will be effective against all detected strains of the virus at least as of mid-July, with lower chances and degrees of adverse reactions than same-type vaccine candidates under research, Yang Xiaoming, head of Sinopharm, told the Global Times in an earlier interview. Yang said on Saturday that more than 20,000 people in the United Arab Emirates had taken inactivated Covid-19 vaccines developed by Sinopharm in phase III clinical trials, which have shown a high level of safety. The efficacy of the vaccine is under observation. “The phase III trial in the UAE has had no reported cases of side effects so far,” Yang said, adding that “volunteers joined faster than expected and the vaccine was well worth the wait”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-emergency-usage-of-covid-19-vaccines-report/story-E35RNen9piFFLt2R5EYo3H.html

The Republican party has not yet released a schedule of events and speakers, but it is expected to be a mix of virtual and in-person events, with no taped segments likely.President Trump goes to the convention 7.6 points behind Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger, in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls. His handling of the coronavirus epidemic — which has killed more than 173,000 American and infected more than 5 million — has hurt him badly, as has been demonstrated in polls.The president also continues to be hit by a steady flow of damaging revelations about him and criminal prosecution of one-time aides. His elder sister, Maryann Trump Barry, has called him “cruel”, a man with “no principles”, and said “you can’t trust him”, in secretly recorded conversations.Steve Bannon, a former key aide, and three others were arrested past week for alleged misappropriation of millions of dollars of online donations collected to help build a wall along the border with Mexico, a pet project of the president. Trump has denied any knowledge of the scheme.The president also continues to be shadowed by the Stormy Daniels affair. A California court has ordered the president to pay Stephanie Clifford — porn star Daniels’s real name — $44,000 to cover her legal fees in a dispute over a nondisclosure agreement. She has claimed to have had an affair with Trump. Starting Sunday night, the president will try to put all this behind and shift the conversation. The White House has scheduled a briefing by the president later in the day on Covid-19 therapeutics.Also Read: Trump campaign woos Indian Americans with ‘Howdy Modi’, ‘Namaste Trump’Over the next four days, Trump, his surrogates and allies will try to present a more optimistic and uplifting vision of the future to make their case for a second term for the president.“The big contrast you’ll see between the Democrats’ doom-and-gloom, Donald Trump-obsessed convention will be a convention focused on real people, their stories, how the policies of the Trump administration have lifted their lives, and then an aspirational vision toward the next four years,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told The Washington Post in an interview Saturday.Also Read: Trump struggles to use power of presidency to counter BidenTrump and Vice-President Mike Pence are expected to be nominated officially through a roll call on Monday, which is reportedly to be themed, the “Land of promise”.

It has also infuriated people who have been unable to attend funerals or cancelled holidays or weddings because of the rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-s-phil-hogan-sorry-for-possible-covid-19-breach-stops-short-of-resigning/story-S4SdulD0eaxpFUK4Gv0d1J.html

Authorities visited the Thae Chaung camp this week to talk about social distancing -- an impossibility as 10 families typically squeeze into a single house -- and gave out hand sanitiser and face masks.“But if the lockdown is for a long time, we will... need help,” Kyaw Kyaw told AFP, adding that everyone in the camps had locked themselves indoors.Sittwe’s streets were empty Sunday, with masked residents encountering barricaded roads as they tried to run errands. Street vendors hawked plastic face shields and surgical masks. An overnight curfew order has been in place since Friday, while all public transport -- including domestic flights -- into the capital was suspended.Rakhine state has long been a flashpoint for ethnic and religious conflict.The embattled Rohingya Muslim minority are widely regarded as foreign “Bengalis” despite having lived in Myanmar for generations. They lack citizenship rights and their freedom of movement is restricted across the country. A local Rakhine parliamentarian this week blamed the Rohingya for the virus spread in a Facebook post that was later taken down. Some 750,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh following a military crackdown in 2017 -- operations that Myanmar is currently facing genocide charges for at the UN’s top court.Further north in the state, the military is also battling the Arakan Army, a rebel group seeking more autonomy for the state’s ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, and violent clashes have displaced thousands of civilians from their homes.In Mrauk-U -- where three cases were found this week -- Rakhine residents feared a halt to food donations to the displacement camps, said camp leader Hla Maung Oo. “We have nowhere to run if the virus becomes widespread because we also can’t go back to our villages,” he told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/local-covid-19-outbreak-in-myanmar-sparks-fears-for-rohingya-camps/story-QNJxJLeFHrLYRuxZY3jLZK.html

Soylu said 118 villages in the region had been cut off.Heavy rain along the Black Sea coast on Saturday evening also saw apartment buildings evacuated after landslides in Rize province, 110 miles (180 kilometers) east of Giresun.Meteorologists forecast heavy storms in Giresun and the neighbouring provinces of Trabzon, Rize and Artvin for later Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-dead-11-missing-as-flooding-hits-turkey-s-black-sea-coast/story-Aj6mZ8N7XXWXirUqKgL3OO.html
23-08-2020||World||Fate of millions forces Rishi Sunak into tough choice on UK furlough||Rishi Sunak’s tenure as UK Chancellor of the Exchequer is reaching a defining moment as he decides whether millions of workers living off government aid should soon begin fending for themselves in a crippled economy.In just over two months, his furlough plan paying up to 80% of an employee’s salary will finish. Sunak has dismissed mounting pressure to extend the program, whose cost now exceeds 35 billion pounds ($46 billion), albeit rising more slowly than before.The hard line by the Conservative chancellor has raised the stakes at a time when reversing his stance would add to a list of embarrassing government U-turns. But ending furloughs could condemn millions to a sudden cash shortfall, and even a jobless future. Having helped vulnerable Britons with aid, Sunak has also put their fate in his hands.The ultimate danger is that the labor-market fallout from ending support might entrench the UK’s recession. That could invoke memories of Margaret Thatcher’s government, whose economic transformation in the 1980s set foundations for future growth at a cost of eye-watering unemployment that tarnished the Conservatives’ political brand for years.“This decision may be one of the most important decisions Sunak makes in this crisis,” said Carsten Jung, a senior economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research. It “will probably determine the shape of the labor market for the better part of the next five years. Once unemployment goes up, it’s really hard to get it back down.”In a year when Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has bounced from crisis to crisis, Sunak’s furlough plan was a rare success, raising the chancellor’s profile compared with colleagues. The program’s scale surprised economists, supporting 9.6 million jobs and preventing mass unemployment.But the Bank of England still sees joblessness reaching 7.5% this year, almost double the current level, and warns the labor market poses the biggest risk to any recovery.Sunak’s key problem is that restrictions to control the virus may persist after his aid program finishes at the end of October. Around 12% of the workforce is furloughed, and the IPPR estimates 3 million people will be relying on the plan at its conclusion, two-thirds of whose jobs would be sustainable if help were extended.Taper TimetableSunak’s options range from carrying through his plan to end furloughs, to extending them after all, even only partially, or replacing them with something else. Other countries from Germany to Canada are already preparing to swallow the debt cost of shifting support programs further into the future.As the clock ticks for Sunak, here’s a look at what U.K. think tanks are suggesting he should do.Do NothingWith public debt now above 2 trillion pounds, Sunak could simply let the plan expire and hope other measures announced this summer will support jobs. They include a 2 billion-pound program to pay wages of more than 200,000 young workers, and a 1,000-pound bonus for firms that keep on employees returning from furlough.“The government cannot continue to underwrite the wages of large portion of the economy,” said Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the Bow Group, a think tank close to the Conservative Party. “The alternative is worse: a debt crisis similar to post-2008.”Another argument against any extension is that it could prevent the economy readjusting to a new reality, delaying painful restructuring.But Luke Raikes, research director for the Fabian Society -- a group close to the opposition Labour Party -- insists the consequences of a sudden end to furloughs would still be “severe” as joblessness spirals. He says the government should then devote extra aid to the unemployed and ramp up investment in skills and training, particularly for young workers and those over 50.Extend the PlanAt the cost of a political about-face -- and yet more debt -- Sunak could keep furloughs going for longer.Such a move would be relatively inexpensive, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, an independent research group. It says keeping the plan until the middle of 2021 would cost about 10 billion pounds and pay for itself by reducing long-term unemployment.An alternative option offered by the Resolution Foundation is to maintain furloughs in sectors most damaged by the crisis.“A slower phase out for hard-hit sectors like hospitality, retail and leisure will be evidently sensible,” said Daniel Tomlinson, a senior economist there.Something NewSunak could end furloughs while keeping some aid in place by unveiling a totally new program.One idea from the IPPR is to replace the current plan with a Coronavirus Work-Sharing Scheme targeting only jobs and businesses likely to be sustainable. It would run through March and cost 7.9 billion pounds.The Resolution Foundation proposes a job-sharing initiative where two people work part-time on the same role, with the state paying for non-worked hours. It also suggests a subsidy plan for firms in hard-hit sectors.“We need a new innovation for the second part of the crisis,” said IPPR’s Jung. “If there’s a way to help hold onto workers, it would really make a huge difference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fate-of-millions-forces-rishi-sunak-into-tough-choice-on-uk-furlough/story-o9V4EMR2Pal0Jn90PCChQK.html

The cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge was among the largest in Singapore before the dormitory was declared cleared of Covid-19 by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Jul 21, the Channel News Asia reported.More than 2,200 confirmed cases had been linked to the cluster and the Health ministry closed the cluster on Jul 18. Sungei Tengah Lodge is Singapore’s biggest purpose-built dormitory, with about 16,000 workers living there, the daily said. Singapore on Sunday reported 87 new Covid-19 cases including 13 imported infections, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.The imported cases had all been placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore, it said. All of the cases were foreign workers including the sole community case on a work pass here.With 87 new cases, the national tally of the coronavirus cases has reached 56,353. With 269 more cases of Covid-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Saturday, 53,920 people have fully recovered from the infection.There are currently 81 confirmed cases who are still in hospital while 2,238 are isolated and cared for at community facilities for mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cluster-reported-at-singapore-s-biggest-dormitory/story-jx60Q5UYsAgURqPhiYRFCP.html

Follow latest updates on coronavirus coverage The US death toll surpassed 170,000 on Sunday, the highest in the world. While the number of new cases is down from a peak in July, the country is still seeing over 360,000 new cases a week.Many public schools and universities reopened classrooms to students despite positive test rates of nearly 20% in some parts of the country. Less than a week after welcoming students, some schools are switching to online-only learning due to a spike in infections. In India, the world’s second-most populous country, Covid-19 deaths topped 50,000 on Monday, five months after the country reported its first coronavirus fatality.India is only the third country, behind Brazil and the United States, to record more than 2 million infections. It has a relatively low case fatality rate of 1.9%, compared to the world average of 3.5%, but that may be due to underreporting.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Case fatality rates are about 3% in the United States and Brazil. Health experts have raised the alarm that Brazil and the United States still have no coordinated plan to fight the pandemic, as many officials focus on reopening schools and businesses, which is likely to worsen the outbreak. Brazil’s death toll from Covid-19 passed 100,000 on Aug. 8 and continues to climb as most Brazilian cities reopen shops and dining even though the pandemic has yet to peak there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-toll-exceeds-800-000/story-KE2FjtN0fC4WdY9GrUxDIP.html

23-08-2020||World||‘End of the world’: Countdown to Beirut’s devastating blast||The 10 firefighters who received the call shortly before 6 pm — about a big fire at the nearby port of — could not know what awaited them.The brigade of nine men and one woman could not know about the stockpile of ammonium nitrate warehoused since 2013 along a busy motorway, in the heart of a densely populated residential area — a danger that had only grown with every passing year.They and nearly all the population of Beirut were simply unaware. They were not privy to the warnings authorities had received, again and again, and ignored: ammonium nitrate is highly explosive, used in fertilizer and sometimes to build bombs. The stockpile was degrading; something must be done.They knew, of course, that they lived in a dysfunctional country, its government rife with corruption, factionalism and negligence that caused so much pain and heartbreak. But they could not know that it would lead to the worst single-day catastrophe in Lebanon’s tragic history.Across the city, residents who noticed the grey smoke billowing over the facility were drawn to streets, balconies and windows, watching curiously as the fire grew larger. Phones were pulled out of pockets and pointed toward the flames.The firefighters piled into a fire engine and an ambulance and raced to the scene — and to their doom.Seven years ago, a ship named the Rhosus set out from the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi carrying 2,755.5 tons of ammonium nitrate destined for an explosives company in Mozambique.It made an unscheduled detour, stopping in Beirut on Nov. 19, 2013. The ship’s Russian owner said he struggled with debts and hoped to earn extra cash by taking on pieces of heavy machinery in Lebanon. That additional cargo proved too heavy for the Rhosus and the crew refused to take it on.The Rhosus was soon impounded by Lebanese authorities for failing to pay port fees. It never left the port; it sank there in February 2018, according to Lebanese official documents.The Port of Beirut is considered one of the most corrupt institutions in a country where nearly every public institution is riddled with corruption. Port officials are notorious for taking bribes. A bribe from an importer, for example, will ensure an incoming shipment is mislabeled to get lower customs duties — or escapes duties and taxes completely. Confiscated goods are sometimes sold off on the sly for a profit.For years, Lebanon’s ruling political factions have divvied up positions at the port and handed them out to supporters — as they have ministries, public companies and other facilities nationwide.The longtime head of customs is known to be a loyalist of President Michel Aoun, for example, while the head of the port is in the camp of Saad Hariri, the Sunni leader who has repeatedly served as prime minister. The Hezbollah militant group and, even more, its Shiite ally the Amal faction headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, also have loyalists at the port, though Hezbollah doesn’t have the same influence as it does at, for example, the airport, which it controls and uses to ferry in cash from Iran.The result is a port divided into factional fiefdoms that don’t necessarily work together and are sometimes outright rivals. Individual port authorities are sometimes more concerned with their scams than with proper functioning. And government officials avoid looking too closely at goings-on at the port to protect their loyalists.The first known warning came on Feb. 21, 2014, three months after the ship docked at the port.In a letter to the customs authority’s anti-smuggling department, senior customs official Col. Joseph Skaff wrote that the material on board was “extremely dangerous and endangers public safety.”It is not known if Skaff ever received a response or if he sent other letters. He was found dead outside his house near Beirut under mysterious circumstances, shortly after he retired in March 2017. At least one medical report suggested he might have been murdered.Skaff’s son, Michel, said he was killed by a blow to the head. He said his father dealt with other sensitive matters, including drug trafficking. “Someone maybe was trying to hide what is happening at the port,” he said by telephone from his home in New York City.In the years that followed, Skaff’s letter was followed by other correspondence that went back and forth between top customs and port officials and members of the judiciary and the army.On June 27, 2014, with the ammonium nitrate still aboard the Rhosus, Jad Maalouf, a judge for urgent matters, warned the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation in correspondence that the ship was carrying dangerous material and could sink. He said the ministry should deal with the ship, remove the ammonium nitrate and “place it in a suitable place that it (the ministry) chooses, and it should be under its protection.”It is not clear if there was ever a reply. Ministry officials did not respond to requests from The Associated Press asking for comment.In October 2014, the ammonium nitrate was moved into the port’s Warehouse 12, which holds impounded materials.A chemical forensic expert, commissioned by the courts and the owners of the ammonium nitrate, got a look at the stockpile soon after. It was “in terrible shape,” she said in her February 2015 report. Most of the sacks — she estimated more than 1,900 of the 2,750 sacks— were torn open, their contents spilling out. Some of the crystals had darkened, a sign of decomposition. The sacks were piled so haphazardly that she could not count them to be sure all were still there.The inspector recommended the chemicals be disposed of according to environmental guidelines. Her report was uncovered by Riad Kobaissi, an investigative reporter with Al Jadeed TV who has followed corruption at the port and within the customs authorities since 2012.On Oct. 26, 2015, the army command asked customs to sample the material and check the level of nitrogen “and based on that we can give a suggestion regarding them.”The then-head of the customs department, Shafeeq Merhi, wrote back in February 2016, saying an expert found the nitrogen level was 34.7%, a very high and dangerous level, well above the acceptable concentration of around 11%.The army command responded the following April, saying it didn’t need the ammonium nitrate. It asked customs to contact Lebanese Explosives Co. — a maker of explosives for construction of roads and tunnels and for imploding structures — to see if that private company could use it.If not, the material should be exported at the expense of the ship owner who brought it to Lebanon, the army said in its letter.An administrator at Lebanese Explosives told the AP that it was “not interested in buying confiscated material because we did not know where they were brought from, what is the quality nor its expiry.”Merhi and his successor as customs chief, Badri Daher, sent multiple letters in the following years to the Courts of Urgent Matters, warning of the danger and seeking permission to sell the material or a ruling on another way to get rid of it.Daher told the AP and other media that he never received any reply from the court. But Kobaissi, the investigative reporter, found documents showing the court responded each time that it didn’t have jurisdiction and that the Public Works Ministry had to decide.Over the years, Lebanese built and bought luxury property opposite the port, a nearby Beirut Marina including restaurants, cafes and retail shops was built up, concerts were held, children rode their bicycles and workers went about their daily business, oblivious to the massive “bomb” waiting to explode.At some point, someone battered open a door to Warehouse 12 and knocked a hole in one of its walls.When is not known. It was reported when State Security inspected the site this summer. In a July 20 report, it warned that the warehouse’s “Door Number 9 has suffered a blow in the middle, knocking it away from the wall enough to allow anyone to enter and steal the ammonium nitrate.” It also noted the hole in the wall and pointed out that there was no guard at the warehouse, “making theft even easier.”The report to President Michel Aoun and then-Prime Minister Hassan Diab warned that thieves could steal the material to make explosives. Or, it said, the mass of material could cause an explosion “that would practically destroy the port.” Kobaissi shared the report with the AP.Aoun has been in office since 2016. After the explosion, he said the State Security report was the first time he’d heard of the dangerous stockpile. He said he immediately ordered military and security agencies to do “what was needed” — though he added he had no authority over the port.After being criticized by rival politicians and on social media for not doing more, Aoun’s office issued a further statement saying that his military adviser had immediately forwarded the State Security report to the Higher Defense Council, the top defense body in the country.But a government official said security agencies had repeatedly sent warnings directly to the government.“The same memo was sent roughly every year basically since that ship arrived, and it became clear the stuff wasn’t moving. So, it was like a tradition and it wasn’t marked as priority,” the official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media.Kobaissi, the investigative reporter, said all political factions in the country benefited from using the port for patronage, and most overlooked dubious dealings. He said many people knew about the initial warning by Skaff, including Hezbollah’s former point man at the port.Port and customs officials “are a gang, a mafia, appointed by a mafia gang that has come to office through an election process,” Kobaissi told the AP.He believes officials at the port were trying to find a legal cover to sell off the ammonium nitrate and skim off some of the money. He noted a similar scheme was run in the past when containers of confiscated asbestos were auctioned off. He said there were many instances of port officials profiting off impounded shipments, even keeping some goods — like Mini Coopers — for themselves.Both the customs chief Daher and the head of the port, Hassan Koraytem, are among those detained in the wake of the explosion.On the afternoon of Aug. 4, security officials say, three metalworkers who had been working for several days to weld the broken Door Number 9 of Warehouse 12 finished work and left the facility.The cause of the original fire has still not been determined and is at the heart of the current investigation. Some have questioned whether the welding may have sparked stocks of flammable liquids used in making detergents, as well as tons of fireworks that were also being kept in Warehouse 12. Other possibilities such as sabotage are also being investigated. The metalworkers, who were hired to fix the door by the port authorities in response to the security report, have been detained for questioning, according to security officials.Shortly after the 10 firefighters arrived at the port, they sent an urgent call back to headquarters, asking for reinforcements. Photos they sent from their mobile phones to their colleagues showed them trying to open the gate of Warehouse 12.“When they called us, they said they are hearing the sound of fireworks,” Beirut fire chief Nabil Khankarli told the AP.No one told the emergency responders that dangerous material was stored in the warehouse. No port officials were even there to help them open the gate, Khankarli said.A second team jumped into their vehicles and headed toward the port. All across the city, flames and the pillar of black smoke could be seen pouring into the sky, lit up by popping fireworks. Many residents would later report hearing a jet or a drone and presuming it was Israeli, since Israel sends reconnaissance flights over Lebanon on an almost daily basis. No evidence has yet emerged of warplanes.There was an initial explosion, sending shredded debris into the air. That first blast, survivors would recount later, sent some who had been watching the fire scurrying for cover.Twelve seconds later, at 6:08 p.m., the ammonium nitrate detonated in one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded.In an instant, a blast with the force of hundreds of tons of TNT sucked in the air — one video showed a luxury store window exploding outward from the suction, spraying a bride and groom taking their wedding video on the sidewalk outside — and then unleashed its power across the city.It blew a crater nearly 200 meters (yards) wide out of the port where Warehouse 12 once stood, and seawater poured in to fill it. The port was leveled. A grain silo right next to the warehouse was shredded and sheared in half — though its massive bulk partially shielded sections of the city from the blast. For miles around, in people’s homes and in shops and hospitals, windows were shattered, doors knocked off their hinges, ceilings or walls blown in a vicious whirlwind onto those inside.Alaa Saad and his friends were out diving, about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) off the coast of Beirut, when they started hearing noises from the direction of the port and saw the smoke. Was it fireworks? Ammunition?“There were lots of flashes going off inside the smoke,” he said. He heard some kind of eruption, like a volcano. “Something that was boiling very much,” he said.“Five seconds passed, and this is when I saw the cloud or the wave that was coming toward us at very high speed,” he said. “It was insane speed. I could not even think if I wanted to jump in the water or stay on the boat.”Saad fell on the deck. A friend tumbled into the water.“After that,” he said, “I thought it was the end of Beirut or the end of the world or the war has started.”More than 6,000 people were injured, and at least 180 were killed — among them the 10 first responders. It would take days of searching before colleagues found all their bodies in the rubble.Nearly three weeks later, theories abound. In the deeply polarized country, some have turned their suspicion to Hezbollah, which maintains a huge weapons stockpile in the country and dominates its politics. A member of the militant group was sentenced to six years in prison after he was arrested in Cyprus in 2015 in connection with the seizure of nine tons of ammonium nitrate at a house where he was staying.An investigative team that includes Kobaissi, working with The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, found that the shadow owner of the Rhosus was actually a Cypriot who owed money to a Lebanese bank linked to Hezbollah — raising speculation that he brought in the ammonium nitrate for the group. The businessman, Charalambos Manoli, denied the report, insisting to the AP that he sold the ship in May 2012.Others have peddled a theory that rivals of the group had sought to accrue the fertilizer for use as explosives in the war in neighboring Syria.The documents show clear negligence and failure; the question of whether something more triggered the blast depends on an investigation that so far has seemed predictably slow and ineffectual.The fire chief, Khankarli, is furious. So much destruction. So much bloodshed. All of it avoidable.“We are waiting for the investigation,” he said. “But what is gone cannot be recovered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-the-world-countdown-to-beirut-s-devastating-blast/story-iUkLdKBHgGl4zhiONs8CWO.html
23-08-2020||World||Pakistan’s ISI using crime syndicates in France, Thailand to further its agenda: Report||Pakistan’s intelligence agency, ISI, has been using the services of Pakistani crime syndicates operating in several countries, including France and Thailand, to further its agenda, according to a report in the Global Watch Analysis.Recently, Thailand Police arrested a Pakistan national named Baqar Shah for his involvement in multiple illegal activities in the country including money laundering for the ISI.He was first noticed by Thai authorities due to his involvement in organising an anti-American protest outside the US Consulate in Chiang Mai in September 2012. In February 2016, his name again surfaced when Thailand Police busted a major fake passport syndicate in the country and an Iranian national, Hamid Reza Jafary, and five Pakistanis were arrested.The six of them were found to be involved in the supply of fake travel documents and human trafficking. It is to be noted that Jafary was on the wanted list of security agencies in several countries including the UK, France, Australia and New Zealand.According to investigations, Jafary and his five Pakistani contacts were supplying forged passports that were being sold to people from Gulf countries for travel to Australia and Europe. During the probe, it was found that Gohar Zaman, one of the five Pakistanis in custody, had close links to Shah.As the Thai security agency put Shah under close surveillance, they discovered that he maintained regular contact with officials from Pakistan Embassy in Bangkok and his restaurant was being used as a meeting point for Pakistani officials.“Shah’s main job appeared to be spotting potential assets for Pakistanis in the local police, immigration, customs and airlines and to develop contacts within the Muslim community in Chaing Mai and Mae Sot region,” according to the report.Shah was blacklisted by the Thai immigration for five years and deported to Pakistan in 2018. However, he managed to sneak back into Thailand under the guise of ISI mentors on a fresh passport in the name of Syed Baqar Ahmed Jaffri. However, Thailand Police tracked him down again and he is currently in custody.A similar syndicate, pertaining to the supply of forged passports, is reported to be operational in France. A person with the initials B.H., who is controlling the syndicate, is believed to have connections at the Pakistani Embassy in Paris.Citing sources, Global Watch Analysis reported that a Pakistani restaurant situated near Gare du Nord, the office of a welfare association in La Courneuve area and a travel agency in the 10th arrondissement in the Paris, are used as fronts to run the illegal activities of supplying Pakistani passports and resident permits of European countries including Portugal, Belgium and France.The price for these identity cards and travel documents range between 850 to 1,500 Euros.During investigations by the Global Watch Analysis, for instance, copies of fake travel documents held by a person linked to this network were found. The individual, who is based in France, has several British and Pakistani passports, all under different names.Sources said the multiple passports would have enabled the person to hold several bank accounts and credit cards with French banks.It is well known that ISI has links with several terror groups of “jihadist tendency”. “It is not excluded that these type of criminal networks, manipulated by ISI’s branches in the Western capitals, may provide their ‘services’ to members of the terrorist groups in question infiltrated in the West,” the article concluded.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Iranian authorities had initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane.The shootdown happened the same night Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3.The head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization, Capt. Touraj Dehghani Zangeneh, said on Sunday that the Ukrainian passenger plane’s black boxes have only 19 seconds of conversation following the first explosion, though the second missile reached the plane 25 seconds later. The report quoting him did not elaborate.He said the first missile explosion sent shrapnel into the plane, likely disrupting the plane’s recorders.Representatives from the U.S., Ukraine, France, Canada, Britain and Sweden — countries whose citizens were killed in the crash — were present during the process to gather data from the recorders.Last month, an initial report from the Iranian investigation said that a misaligned missile battery, miscommunication between troops and their commanders and a decision to fire without authorization all led to the fatal downing of the jetliner.“Data recovery activity was all done with the aim of at safety and preventing similar incidents,” Zangeneh said, adding an appeal against “any political use of the process.”He added that Iran’s airspace is now “safe and ready” for international flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-retrieves-data-cockpit-talk-from-downed-ukraine-plane/story-sdmV8nqxe9O5PMxC69wGgK.html

23-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s sister calls him ‘cruel’, ‘liar’ on secret recordings: Report||Donald Trump’s sister described the US president as cruel and a liar whose lack of principles meant he could not be trusted, according to secretly made recordings published Saturday.It was the latest unflattering insider account to target the president, only instead of a jilted aide or business associate, it was from one of his closest relatives.Maryanne Trump Barry slammed her brother over his immigration policy that saw children separated from their parents at the border and sent to detention centres.“All he wants to do is appeal to his base,” she said in recordings obtained by the Washington Post. “He has no principles. None.”“His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God.”The recordings were secretly made by the president’s niece Mary Trump, who published last month a bombshell memoir of the “toxic family” that produced him.The president’s younger brother Robert, who died last week, went to court to try to block its publication, arguing that Mary was violating a non-disclosure agreement signed in 2001 after the settlement of her grandfather’s estate, but to no avail.Some 950,000 copies were sold the day of the memoir’s release, with the White House calling it a “book of falsehoods”.At one point in the recordings, Barry said to her niece: “It’s the phoniness of it all. It’s the phoniness and this cruelty. Donald is cruel.”The recordings also shed light on the source of an embarrassing claim in the memoir that the president paid someone to take a college entrance exam for him.“He got into University of Pennsylvania because he had somebody take the exams,” Barry said, adding she even remembered the man’s name.The president or the White House did not immediately comment on the recordings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-sister-calls-him-cruel-liar-on-secret-recordings-report/story-WaU6MBCZ2j4Ifk3N9tJUcJ.html
23-08-2020||World||Donald Trump ordered to pay $44,100 in Stormy Daniels legal fees||A California court ordered President Donald Trump this week to pay $ 44,100 in attorney fees to porn actress Stormy Daniels to pay for her legal battle over her effort to cancel a hush money deal brokered to keep her quiet about their sexual relationship a decade ago. The order in Superior Court in Los Angeles determined Daniels won her lawsuit against Trump over the agreement that was signed 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. As a part of that deal, the losing party would pay the lawyers fees. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decision. The president’s personal lawyer at the time, Michael Cohen, paid $ 130,000 to Daniels, who filed the suit under her legal name Stephanie Clifford. After Trump’s election, Daniels sued to void the agreement. Trump and his supporters denied the president knew about the payment for several years before Trump acknowledged it on Twitter in May 2018 and said he reimbursed Cohen for the money paid to Daniels. Daniels’ suit over the non-disclosure agreement was dismissed before going to trial or a settlement because the parties were no longer quiet. Trump’s lawyers said Daniels didn’t win the case and therefore wasn’t entitled to lawyer fees, but Judge Robert Broadbelt III disagreed in his ruling Monday, posted online by Daniels’ lawyers. Trump’s lawyers also argued Daniels didn’t prove the president was a part of the non-disclosure agreement which was made under the name “ David Dennison,” but Broadbelt wrote there was a large amount of evidence showing Cohen chose Dennison as a pseudonym for Trump. After her lawyer announced the decision, Daniels wrote on Twitter: “Yup. Another win.” But they haven’t all been wins for Daniels. She also sued Trump for defamation after the president’s comments on Twitter that a man she said threatened her to stay quiet about their alleged affair in 2011 was “nonexistent.” Trump also posted side-by-side photos of the composite sketch of the man making the threats and Daniels’ husband. The defamation lawsuit was thrown out and Daniels is appealing the decision and an order to pay Trump almost $ 300,000 in attorney fees. A judge in that case ruled Trump’s statements on Twitter were protected speech under the First Amendment. Since Trump’s election, Daniels has remained in the adult entertainment industry, using her new fame to promote strip club appearances and shows, including her latest venture called “Spooky Babes Paranormal Show” where she said she is leading a team of investigators to hunt ghosts and get answers for people here on Earth. She also still takes shots at the president on Twitter. Meanwhile, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, among other crimes, and was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ordered-to-pay-44-100-in-stormy-daniels-legal-fees/story-SKz1mkmFHbFsa4uVUSftTL.html
23-08-2020||World||Coronavirus spread largely among under 40-year-olds in France: Health minister||The new coronavirus is circulating four times more among people under 40 in France than over among 65-year-olds, France’s health minister said, though he warned that contamination was on the rise among the elderly and more vulnerable too. “We’re in a risky situation,” Olivier Veran said in an interview with France’s Journal Du Dimanche (JDD) published on Sunday, adding that the higher number of cases being detected was not solely down to more testing. Like President Emmanuel Macron, Veran ruled out the need for another total lockdown to combat the spread of the disease. But he said localised measures could be taken as cases grow in France and elsewhere. “This is not a French exception, it’s a European dynamic,” Veran said. France reported a 3,602 hike in new Covid-19 infections over the past 24 hours on Saturday, a smaller rise than the previous day. Earlier in the week, however, the number of daily cases reached a post-lockdown high. The number of people being hospitalised and needing intensive care has gone up and down. Veran said the cross-contamination between groups of the population - younger people between the ages of 2- to 40 and their elders - was already taking place. “New measures will be implemented shortly,” Veran said, without elaborating. Parties and gatherings where social distancing rules were not being respected were now the main source of contagion, Veran added, as opposed to earlier in the summer when it had been in the workplace.In many cases, younger carriers of the virus were asymptomatic or suffered fewer complications, Veran said. Police in Paris are gearing up for possible soccer celebrations on Sunday night as Paris St Germain takes on Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, and officials said they would enforce mask wearing and distribute protective gear in sites like the Champs Elysee avenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-spread-largely-among-under-40-year-olds-in-france-health-minister/story-YnGODhNFJ3mjBHX9wWKzBN.html

One hundred of those cases were reported outside the capital’s metropolitan area.The nation of 50 million people has recorded a total of 17,399 infections and 309 fatalities so far, according to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.A possible second wave of cases has spurred talk of enforcing the strongest social-distancing restrictions the government can apply, which includes the prohibition of meetings and events of 10 people or more. Rising infections have also bolstered speculation that there could be a second round of cash handouts and another extra budget.South Korea in June adopted a social-distancing system with three levels of restrictions. The government as of Sunday had expanded level 2 social-distancing rules, already in place in the Seoul Metropolitan area and Busan, to the rest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jump-in-seoul-s-covid-19-cases-sparks-fear-of-spread/story-SqpIEZjXnVbaqSLzEWrsJI.html

Her lawyers said they plan to sue over the death of Trayford Pellerin, who police said had a knife and was trying to enter a convenience store.The shooting Friday night was captured on video, and the state ACLU condemned what it described as a “horrific and deadly incident of police violence against a Black person.” Both the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center quickly called for an investigation.Also read: London police defend smashing car window of man after racism complaintPellerin’s death prompted a crowd of protesters to gather Saturday and demonstrate against the latest fatal police shooting. Officers in riot gear fired what appeared to be tear gas on Saturday night after ordering the crowd to disperse.Louisiana State Police said Lafayette officers followed Pellerin, 31, on foot as he left a convenience store where he had created a disturbance with a knife about 8 p.m. Friday. Stun guns failed to stop him, and the officers shot Pellerin as he tried to enter another convenience store, still with the knife, according to a news release.Pellerin became anxious in groups and may have been frightened by the officers, Michelle Pellerin told The Advocate. He had sought professional help earlier this year, she said.“Instead of giving him a helping hand they gave him bullets,” national civil rights attorney Ben Crump told the newspaper. He and Baton Rouge attorney Ronald Haley said they have begun their own investigation by interviewing witnesses. Some said Pellerin was not armed, Haley said.Also read: Masked mourners brave heat, Covid-19 fears to honour John LewisThe family believes Pellerin may have been having a mental health crisis, Crump said.Lafayette police asked state police to investigate — standard procedure in the state for shootings by local officers.“Lafayette police shot Mr. Pellerin several times as he walked away from them,” Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in an emailed statement. “His killing demands an analysis of the excessive use of force by law enforcement. We fully support movement leaders’ calls for a swift and transparent investigation into Mr. Pellerin’s killing.”State ACLU executive director Alanah Odoms Hebert said, “Once again, video footage has captured a horrific and deadly incident of police violence against a Black person who was brutally killed in front of our eyes.”Captured on video, the May 25 death of George Floyd under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer sparked a global reckoning over police tactics and racial injustice.“Trayford Pellerin should be alive today. Instead, a family is mourning and a community is grieving,” her statement said. “None of our communities are safe when the police can murder people with impunity or when routine encounters escalate into deadly shooting sprees.”Rikasha Montgomery, who took a video of the shooting, told The Advertiser that a man holding what looked like a knife kept walking down the highway while some officers fired stun guns at him. Officers holding guns shouted at him to get onto the ground, said Montgomery, 18.She said they fired when the man reached the door of a Shell gas station.“When I heard the gunshots, I couldn’t hold my phone like I was first filming,” she said. “I feel kind of scared about it. I’m traumatized. You’re so used to hearing about this, but I never thought I would experience it.”Crump, representing Pellerin’s family, called the shooting reckless and his death tragic.“The officers involved should be fired immediately for their abhorrent and fatal actions,” Crump said in a statement Saturday.The incident was the third shooting by Lafayette police since mid-July. State police said a man was critically wounded last month after being shot during an altercation with police. Another man was in stable condition after being shot during a burglary investigation earlier this month.Haley told The Advocate that he and Crump will be seeking reform and policy changes in the police department as well as damages.“We want policy changes as well, so that Ben and I are not in the living room with another family in Lafayette dealing with this,” Haley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shoot-kill-black-man-outside-store-in-louisiana/story-YRrSXEXLDsxYvPMsukJKWK.html
23-08-2020||World||With China tensions rising, US joins Taiwan to mark battle anniversary||The de facto US ambassador in Taipei joined for the first time on Sunday a Taiwanese leader, amid rising tensions with Beijing, to commemorate a key military clash and the last time Taiwanese forces joined battle with China on a large scale.China, which claims Taiwan as its own, has stepped up military activity around the democratic island, moves denounced by Taiwan’s government as an attempt at intimidation to force them to accept Chinese rule.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen laid a wreath and bowed her head in respect at a memorial park on Kinmen island, which sits a few kilometres (miles) off the Chinese metropolis of Xiamen, to mark the 62nd anniversary of the start of the second Taiwan Straits crisis. In August 1958, Chinese forces began more than a month of bombarding Kinmen, along with the Taiwan-controlled Matsu archipelago further up the coast, including naval and air battles, seeking to force them into submission. Brent Christensen, head of the American Institute in Taiwan and Washington’s de facto representative, offered his respects too, standing behind Tsai, in a symbolic show of US support for the island. Washington has no formal ties with Taipei but is its largest arms supplier. The administration of President Donald Trump has made bolstering relations a priority, to Beijing’s anger.Like Tsai, Christensen did not make public comments.Taiwan fought back at the time with support from the United States, which sent military equipment like advanced Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles, giving Taiwan a technological edge. The crisis ended in a stalemate.Major General Liu Qiang-hua, spokesman for the Kinmen garrison, said it was important to remember an event that was so crucial to ensuring Taiwan’s security.“Of course we hope there is no war, but it is dangerous to forget about war. This is the spirit we need to safeguard,” he told Reuters.Formerly called Quemoy in English, Kinmen today is a popular tourist destination, though remnants of past fighting like underground bunkers are scattered across the island, and Taiwan maintains a significant military presence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-china-tensions-rising-us-joins-taiwan-to-mark-battle-anniversary/story-ELr9JE8HAenkRQHYHj2THJ.html

The Trump campaign on Saturday released a video that seeks to rally Indian American voters for “4 More Years” for President Donald Trump using clips from the “Howdy Modi” and “Namaste Trump” events that he addressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“America enjoys a great relationship with India and our campaign enjoys great support from Indian Americans!” Kimberly Guilfoyle, national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, wrote in a tweet with the short video, which is headlined “4 More Years”. Donald Trump Jr, president’s eldest son and Guilfoyle’s partner, retweeted the post.“4 More Years” opens with a panoramic view of the stands of the stadium that hosted the “Howdy Modi” event in September 2019, and the cheering crowds.Also read: Donald Trump says could ‘decouple’ and not do business with ChinaThe video cuts to PM Modi as he introduces Trump who is standing with him on the stage. “Mr President, you had introduced me to your family in 2017,” Modi says in a clip from the event, and adds, gesturing towards the audience, “And today, I have the honour to introduce you to my family.”The video then jumps to the “Namaste Trump” event in Ahmedabad, the American leader’s first visit to India, in February. There are shots of Modi and Trump, hugging and then waving to the audience with First Lady Melania Trump.“America loves India,” Trump says in a clip from the event. “America respects India, and America will always be a faithful and loyal friend to the Indian people.”The video marks the campaign’s most visible pitch yet to the 1.2 million Indian American voters and comes around the start of the Republican party convention on Monday to officially nominate President Trump for a second term with Mike Pence as his vice-president.Nikki Haley, the Indian American considered a potential presidential candidate at some time, will bring more firepower as one of the speakers at the convention. The former ambassador to the UN and ex-governor of South Carolina is well regarded in the Indian American community, The Biden campaign had launched a major outreach to the Indian American community in the run-up to the Democratic party convention to nominate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president and vice-president respectively. At a virtual Indian Independence Day celebration, Biden had vowed to stand with India, as he did before. And in an expansive agenda released by the campaign, the nominee had promised to check China’s ‘impunity” along the border and not tolerate cross-border terrorism.Al Mason, who conceptualized the “4 More Year” video, said, “The video depicts great friendship and love between India- US - cemented by the emotional bond between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. Trump is much loved by the community.”Mason leads Trump campaign’s outreach to the Indian American community and is the co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian-American Finance Committee. The video, he added, “will evoke mega support in terms of fund raising at the grass root level and votes for President Trump in battleground states — a must win for Trump”.Both Trump and Biden are wooing the Indian American with an eye on the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida, which are likely to be won and lost by wafer-thin margins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-more-years-trump-campaign-woos-indian-americans-with-howdy-modi-namaste-trump/story-ExSTlHE9flOo4TdqmWGjOM.html

Trump has since shut the door on Phase 2 negotiations, saying he was unhappy with Beijing’s handling of the pandemic.In June US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a decoupling of the US and Chinese economies will result if US companies are not allowed to compete on a fair and level basis in China’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-could-decouple-and-not-do-business-with-china/story-66rSCsWyPGX7qPGkJrjlVL.html

Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives! @SteveFDA,” he wrote on Twitter tagging FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn.Trump, however, did not share any evidence of the claim he made. The comment apparently came after a Reuters report on Thursday that quoted a top FDA official saying he would resign if the Trump administration approved a vaccine before it was shown to be safe and effective.Trump’s “dangerous statement” drew a sharp response from US House speaker Nancy Pelosi who said the president’s attempt to influence the decisions of the FDA can jeopardise the health and well-being of all Americans.Pelosi said the drug regulatory body must not give in to the political pressure and approve drugs or vaccines based on their safety and effectiveness.“The FDA must approve drugs or vaccines based on their safety and effectiveness – NOT political pressure from the White House. The President’s dangerous attempt to inject himself into the scientific decisions of @US_FDA jeopardizes the health & well-being of all Americans,” she tweeted.Also read| The bully pulpit: Donald Trump pushes Washington, but coronavirus resistsScientists, public health officials and lawmakers have expressed concern over Trump’s push for early clearance of a vaccine by the FDA in a bid to get an edge in the upcoming US polls.Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said last week he would resign if the agency rubber-stamped an unproven vaccine.The US has reported 5,666,673 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease while the toll due to the infection stands at 176,345, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-accuses-fda-of-delaying-human-trials-of-potential-covid-19-vaccines/story-8tgQiCyU0s1uqtcNeAxYgK.html
23-08-2020||World||Mali’s coup leaders meet mediators seeking return to civilian rule||A key meeting on Saturday between Mali’s coup leaders and mediators from West Africa’s regional bloc seeking a return to civilian rule ended after just 20 minutes.Tuesday’s overthrow of Mali President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has been condemned abroad, but celebrated by many in a country battling an Islamist insurgency and months of political unrest.A delegation from the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) earlier arrived in the capital, Bamako, for talks aimed at reversing the overthrow of Keita.The bloc has taken a hard line on the coup, shutting borders and halting financial flows - a move diplomats said was as much about warning opponents at home as stabilising Mali.Ahead of a series of meetings with the mutineers and other groups, the head of the delegation, Nigeria’s former President Goodluck Jonathan, sounded optimistic.“I believe at the end of the day we will come up with something that is best for the people and is good for ECOWAS and the international community,” he told journalists.The most-anticipated meeting was held in the defence ministry, where ECOWAS mediators in face masks sat at a long table opposite junta leader Assimi Goita, who wore a desert camouflage uniform and was flanked by other military officers in berets and fatigues, photos on Twitter showed.The talks were set to last 90 minutes, according to a provisional ECOWAS schedule, seen by Reuters. But the meeting ended after just 20 minutes, a Reuters reporter said.It was not clear if the schedule had been changed or talks were cut short. ECOWAS and the coup leaders, who call themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), have yet to comment on the discussions.The CNSP has controlled the country since Tuesday, when the mutineers detained Keita at gunpoint and forced him to resign. They have promised to oversee a transition to elections within a “reasonable” amount of time.The ouster of Keita, known as IBK, has been welcomed by many in Mali, which was rocked by months of protests calling for his resignation over alleged corruption and worsening security in areas where affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State are active.TEAR GASThe presidents of Ivory Coast and Guinea are among those pushing for the tough ECOWAS response, one diplomat said, as both have faced violent public protests to their third-term bids and want the bloc to show it will not allow power grabs in its own backyard.“They cannot tolerate this taking place. They are taking it very personally. It is on their doorstep and they think they are next,” a second regional diplomat said.After three days of post-coup calm in the capital Bamako, police used tear gas earlier on Saturday when a scuffle broke out between a group of 50 pro-Keita protesters and local residents who threw stones, an eyewitness told Reuters.“Reinstating IBK is out of the question. The only thing they (the delegation) can achieve is the transition. Under the rules of ECOWAS, ECOWAS should midwife the transition,” one of the diplomats said, referring to the outcome of the delegation’s visit.On Friday, thousands of the coup’s supporters gathered in a central square in Bamako to celebrate the takeover. There is no outward sign ECOWAS’s suspension of financial relations is yet being felt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mali-s-coup-leaders-meet-mediators-seeking-return-to-civilian-rule/story-UjVoKsBMdSIfZ4nLkxds8L.html
23-08-2020||World||Irish PM to recall parliament as politicians flout Covid-19 guidelines||Irish premier Micheal Martin announced Sunday he would recall parliament following a scandal over politicians breaching coronavirus rules, for which he urged EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan to consider resigning.Martin and his coalition government partners, deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar and cabinet minister Eamon Ryan, “have agreed that the Dail (parliament) should be recalled”, a spokesman said.The news came after two days of political turmoil following revelations that swathes of lawmakers and senior politicians attended a parliamentary golf society dinner in breach of coronavirus guidelines.The Irish Examiner newspaper revealed 82 high profile figures -- including Hogan, a cabinet minister and a supreme court judge -- attended the Oireachtas (parliament) Golf Society dinner on Wednesday night.The event was held just 24 hours after the government announced fresh COVID-19 restrictions to curb a new surge in cases, including no “formal or informal events or parties” to be held at hotel restaurants.It was reported that attendees at the dinner sat at tables of ten in breach of coronavirus guidelines, and organisers erected a room divider in a bid to skirt legislation banning gatherings of more than 50.But police on Friday said they had opened an investigation into the event for alleged breaches of that same legislation.Martin and Varadkar -- the head of Fine Gael, the party for which Hogan previously served as a lawmaker -- said on Saturday they had “asked him to consider his position”.A spokesman for Hogan told state broadcaster RTE on Saturday he would “reflect on” the request.Irish agriculture minister Dara Calleary and deputy chair of the parliament’s upper chamber Jerry Buttimer have both already resigned for their attendance at the event.Hogan -- who was a lawmaker in Ireland’s upper and lower parliaments between 1987 and 2014 -- initially said he had been assured the dinner would comply with government guidelines.The 60 year-old, who served as Ireland’s environment minister from 2011 to 2014 before becoming EU trade commissioner last year, later issued a statement apologising for “the distress caused by his participation”, according to RTE.But a spokesman for Martin said: “The commissioner’s apology came late and... he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his actions.”Martin and Varadkar “both believe that the event should never have been held,” he added.A government spokesman said the request to recall parliament will be made to the chamber chair on Monday.The coalition partners agreed parliament should return after schools have reopened over the next two weeks, following their closure in March due to coronavirus.jts/ar/tom||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-pm-to-recall-parliament-as-politicians-flout-covid-19-guidelines/story-o5lBm3CNplB0pQYUDBTrGL.html
23-08-2020||World||TikTok plans to file suit against Donald Trump’s order to ban app||TikTok plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge its executive order banning transactions with the video app in the US, the company said Saturday.TikTok said it “strongly disagreed” with the concerns raised by President Donald Trump as he ordered on August 6 to ban the app from the US within 45 days. He subsequently gave it a 90-day deadline to divest its US operations.“What we encountered instead was a lack of due process as the Administration paid no attention to facts and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. “To ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to challenge the Executive Order through the judicial system.”Also read: How to download your videos from TikTok before you lose access to the appTikTok didn’t say which court it plans to use.

23-08-2020||World||In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in California||Firefighters in California were racing to slow the spread of wildfires that burned nearly one million acres in a week and destroyed hundreds of homes as weekend weather threatened to spark new fires and overwhelm the state’s firefighting ability. Responding to the emergency, President Donald Trump issued on Saturday a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the declaration will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counseling, housing and other social services. Two clusters of wildfires in the San Francisco Bay Area broke old records to become the second- and third-largest wildfires in recent state history by size.Also read| California wildfires among largest in state’s history: What we know so far Light winds, cooler and more humid nighttime weather helped fire crews make a bit of progress, but their efforts could be hurt by warm, dry weather, erratic wind gusts and lightning in the forecast, state fire officials said. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning of high fire danger across the Bay Area and along the Central Coast, beginning from Sunday morning to Monday afternoon. “The worst is not behind us. We are in a battle rhythm,” California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Chief Thom Porter tweeted. Since thousands of lightning strikes began on Aug. 15, the state responded to 585 wildfires that have burned nearly a million acres, or 1,562 square miles (4,046 square kilometers), according to CalFire. Many were small and remote. The bulk of damage was from three clusters of fire “complexes” that were ravaging forest and rural areas in the San Francisco Bay Area and wine country north of San Francisco. They have burned 1,045 square miles (2,700 square kilometers). The third one was burning in the Santa Cruz Mountains and along the coast of San Mateo County, south of San Francisco.The fires have killed five people, torched nearly 700 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands from their houses. “Tuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,” said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville. “By Wednesday night I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.” Earlier in the week, fire officials in charge of each of the major wildfires said they were strapped for resources. Some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours. By Friday, the approximately 13,700 firefighters on the line began to get help on the ground and in the air from 10 states, along with the National Guard and US military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-just-a-week-wildfires-burn-1-million-acres-in-california/story-kBsq6bOAaqMyxfdUCRJIPJ.html
23-08-2020||World||Kanye West eyes US Presidential dream, files to appear on ballot in Louisiana||Rapper Kanye West has filed paperwork to appear on the presidential ballot in Louisiana in November.West’s filing Friday, just ahead of the deadline, lists himself as a candidate for “The Birthday Party” along with vice presidential running mate, Michelle Tidball, The Advocate reported. Including West, at least 11 third-party or independent presidential candidates filed to appear on the Louisiana ballot by Friday’s 4:30 p.m. deadline.The rapper announced his independent bid last month in a tweet on Independence Day after publicly tossing around the idea for years. His campaign submitted papers to the Federal Election Commission to run less than two weeks later. But West’s campaign has struggled to meet deadlines to make it onto the ballot in several other states, including Wisconsin. Filing deadlines in six states had already passed by the time West announced his bid.Louisiana officials did not immediately review the filing. Unlike other states, Louisiana does not require independent candidates to obtain thousands of signatures on a nominating petition to appear on the ballot. A candidate may instead pay a $500 filing fee.The Advocate reported that a phone call to the number listed on the filing went unanswered. West’s filing listed a post office box in Cody, Wyoming, as the campaign’s address. Tidball, a self-described “biblical life coach,” is from Wyoming, and West owns a mansion and 1,400-acre ranch in the state.West’s request to appear on the ballot includes a list of eight Louisiana residents who’d serve as would-be electors at the electoral college were the rapper to win the presidential vote in the state. None appeared to have an active history in Louisiana politics. Six of them were listed as Republicans; the other two listed themselves as unaffiliated with any party, the newspaper reported.In other states, Republican operatives and vocal supporters of President Donald Trump have worked to boost West’s candidacy and secure his spot on the ballot. Critics contend West’s last-minute run — and the apparent GOP support it’s received — is a ploy to swipe votes from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, especially in key swing states. Trump carried Louisiana in the 2016 election by nearly 20 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kanye-west-eyes-us-presidential-dream-files-to-appear-on-ballot-in-louisiana/story-AjKixBwZzq2T1RHbAPk62I.html
23-08-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic: US faces back-to-school laptop shortage||Schools across the United States are facing shortages and long delays, of up to several months, in getting this year’s most crucial back-to-school supplies: the laptops and other equipment needed for online learning, an Associated Press investigation has found.The world’s three biggest computer companies, Lenovo, HP and Dell, have told school districts they have a shortage of nearly 5 million laptops, in some cases exacerbated by Trump administration sanctions on Chinese suppliers.As the school year begins virtually in many places because of the coronavirus, educators nationwide worry that computer shortfalls will compound the inequities — and the headaches for students, families and teachers.“This is going to be like asking an artist to paint a picture without paint. You can’t have a kid do distance learning without a computer,” said Tom Baumgarten, superintendent of the Morongo County School District in California’s Mojave Desert, where all 8,000 students qualify for free lunch and most need computers for distance learning.Baumgarten ordered 5,000 HP laptops in July and was told they would arrive in time for the first day of school Aug. 26. The delivery date then changed to September, then October. The district has about 4,000 old laptops that can serve roughly half of students, but what about the rest, Baumgarten asks rhetorically. “I’m very concerned that I’m not going to be able to get everyone a computer.”Chromebooks and other low-cost PCs are the computers of choice for most budget-strapped schools. The delays started in the spring and intensified because of high demand and disruptions of supply chains, the same reasons that toilet paper and other pandemic necessities flew off shelves a few months ago. Then came the Trump administration’s July 20 announcement targeting Chinese companies it says were implicated in forced labor or other human rights abuses. The Commerce Department imposed sanctions on 11 Chinese companies, including the manufacturer of multiple models of Lenovo laptops, which the company says will add several weeks to existing delays, according to a letter Lenovo sent to customers.School districts are pleading with the Trump administration to resolve the issue, saying that distance learning without laptops will amount to no learning for some of the country’s most vulnerable students.“It’s a tough one because I’m not condoning child slave labor for computers, but can we not hurt more children in the process?” said Matt Bartenhagen, IT director for Williston Public Schools in North Dakota. The district has been told its order of 2,000 Lenovo Chromebooks will “hopefully” arrive sometime in the fourth quarter.There are no nationwide tallies on the numbers of laptops and other devices that schools are waiting for but the shortages and backorders are affecting school districts in more than 15 states, according to interviews with school districts around the country, suppliers, computer companies and industry analysts.A recent poll of California’s 1,100 districts showed schools across the state are waiting on at least 300,000 backordered computers, said Mary Nicely, a senior policy advisor to the state superintendent.The Denver Public Schools district, the largest in Colorado, is waiting for 12,500 Lenovo Chromebooks ordered in April and May. The district has scrambled to find machines and settled for whatever is available. Still, when school starts Wednesday, they will be about 3,000 devices short, says Lara Hussain, an IT director for the district.Lenovo had informed Denver and other customers months ago of supply chain delays. In late July, Lenovo sent a letter to say the Commerce Department’s “trade controls” would cause another slowdown. The letter listed 23 Lenovo models made by their Chinese supplier, Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co. Ltd.“Effective immediately, we are no longer manufacturing these devices at Bitland,” the letter said, adding that Lenovo is shifting production to other sites.A Lenovo official told California’s Department of Education the company has a backlog of more than 3 million Chromebooks, said Daniel Thigpen, the department’s spokesman.Lenovo declined to respond to repeated questions from AP seeking confirmation of the backlog and details on the numbers of devices delayed.The Department of Commerce said it added Hefei Bitland to its so-called Entity List, which restricts the export and in-country transfer of items by sanctioned companies. “It does not apply to the importation of Chromebooks from China,” the department said in a statement, adding, however, “we should all agree that American school children should not be using computers from China that were produced from forced labor.”Tom Quiambao, IT director for the Tracy Unified School District in Northern California, said he and his vendor contacted HP to ask why his July order for 10,000 HP laptops would take three months. He was told, “HP is short 1.7 million units of laptops” because of production shortages in a variety of components made in China, Quiambao said.An HP spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny that number, saying only “we are continuing to leverage our global supply chain to meet the changing needs of our customer.”Dell offered a similarly opaque response to detailed questions about a backlog.“We can’t comment on demand and supply specifically,” Dell said in an emailed statement, adding the company was seeing increased orders due to virtual learning and trying “to fulfill orders as efficiently as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-us-faces-back-to-school-laptop-shortage/story-eqiGAh0vDLh8xQNvvOsDDP.html
23-08-2020||World||‘Ignore’ Trump, Pelosi says, as House debates postal funds||The House is meeting for a rare Saturday session over mail delivery disruptions, poised to approve legislation that would reverse recent changes in US Postal Service operations and send $25 billion in emergency funds to shore up the agency ahead of the November election.Speaker Nancy Pelosi recalled lawmakers to Washington for the debate over objections from Republicans. President Donald Trump often rails against mail-in ballots, including in a Saturday tweet, and has said he wants to block extra funds for the Postal Service.“Don’t pay any attention to what the president is saying, because it is all designed to suppress the vote,” Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol.The daylong Saturday session comes as an uproar over mail interference puts the Postal Service at the center of the nation’s tumultuous election year, with Americans rallying around one of the nation’s oldest and more popular institutions. Millions of people are expected to opt for mail-in ballots to avoid polling places during the coronavirus pandemic.New Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified Friday in the Senate that his “No. 1 priority” is to ensure election mail arrives on time.But the new postal leader, a Trump ally, said he would not restore the cuts to mailboxes and sorting equipment that have already been made. He could not provide senators with a plan for handling the ballot crush for the election.“We are here today because our democracy is being eroded by this administration,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., the chairman of the rules committee, opening debate.He argued that Trump is trying to halt mail-in ballots, afraid that so many Americans will vote he could lose the White House.But Republicans countered that complaints about mail delivery disruptions are overblown, and no emergency funding is needed right now.“Do we need that money? Absolutely no,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. “It’s a silly, silly bill.”Despite the postmaster general’s vow election mail will arrive on time, Democrats remain skeptical the Postal Service has the resources it needs to handle the onslaught during the pandemic crisis. They are pushing ahead with legislation to be sure.The bill would reverse the cuts and provide funds to the agency. With the majority, Democrats are expected to easily pass the legislation.But Republicans are unlikely to sign on, and the bill is certain to stall in the GOP-held Senate.In a memo to House Republicans, leaders derided the legislation as a postal “conspiracy theory” act.Nevertheless, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is eyeing a $10 billion postal rescue as part of the next COVID-19 relief package. While Trump has said he wants to block emergency funding for the agency, the White House has said it would be open to more postal funding as part of a broader bill.Hundreds of lawmakers are returning to Washington for the weekend session, but dozens will cast votes by proxy under House rules that allow them to stay away during the COVID-19 crisis.The Postal Service has been struggling financially under a decline in mail volume, COVID-19-related costs and a rare and cumbersome congressional requirement to fund in advance its retiree health care benefits.For many, the Postal Service provides a lifeline, delivering not just cards and letters but also prescription drugs, financial statements and other items that are especially needed by mail during the pandemic.The postal board of governors, appointed by Trump, selected DeJoy to take the job as postmaster general. A GOP donor, he previously owned a logistics business that was a longtime Postal Service contractor. He maintains significant financial stakes in companies that do business or compete with the agency, raising conflict of interest questions.In a statement, the Postal Service said DeJoy has made all required financial disclosures, but he might have to divest some holdings if conflicts arise.Republicans have long sought changes to have the agency run more like a private company, and Trump often complains the Postal Service should be charging Amazon and other companies higher rates for package deliveries. The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Washington Post, a publication that Trump frequently derides as “fake news” over critical stories of him.Others say the Postal Service is not expected to be solely a money-making enterprise, often delivering to far-flung places where it is not efficient to operate.___Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Charleston, W.Va., and Christina A. Cassidy in Atlanta contributed to this report.___The Associated Press produced this coverage with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ignore-trump-pelosi-says-as-house-debates-postal-funds/story-YraxygAduYantOXsMwsQ7L.html

The grand old party is currently facing a leadership issue after 23 Congress leaders wrote a letter, asking for a complete overhaul of the organisation. The 23 leaders include some Members of Parliament, former chief ministers and members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body.In the letter written earlier this month, these leaders suggested changes from top to bottom; the most controversial has been the suggestion about leadership change in Congress. The leaders said the party has been on the decline for the last six years but has not learned its lesson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-congress-workers-would-like-to-see-rahul-gandhi-s-return-as-party-chief-sachin-pilot/story-2UhUTV6wmdV2xd7kTE7pKK.html
23-08-2020||India||IIT-B holds virtual convocation event||Mumbai: In a one-of-a-kind experience, three-dimensional avatars of graduating students of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, received their degrees in a virtual convocation ceremony held on Sunday afternoon.“You are the first batch of graduates among those who are still in the pipeline, who had faced extreme hardship due to the spread of the pandemic. But despair no more, dear students, you are now proud graduates of IIT Bombay,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of the institute, urging them to stand up to their true potential. Over 2,400 graduates from undergraduate, post graduate and doctoral programmes graduated from the institute this year. Of these, around 1,255 are likely to have used the ‘IIT Bombay Convocation 2020’ mobile application to take part in the ceremony from the comfort of their homes using a mobile application that the institute specially designed for the purpose. Apart from the ceremony, graduates could use the application to take a virtual tour of the campus and hang out with friends at their favourite joints. Once downloaded, the application does not require internet connectivity to run. For those who couldn’t use the app, the ceremony was telecast live on the social media channels of the institute as well as DD Sahyadri. It took the effort of 20 experts, most from the IDC School of Design, to plan, design and create this platform and mobile application. “It took more than 5000 person hours to build the whole thing,” added Sunthar.“I will definitely miss the feel and the atmosphere of the convocation in the institute I’ve been part of for four years. At the same time, I was excited to have been able to take part in the virtual convocation,” said a graduating student on the condition of anonymity.Chaudhuri told HT that the institute has received global praise for the virtual convocation ceremony. “(I am) glad that everyone liked the ceremony. We have received a lot of kudos from abroad as nobody has ever seen such a ceremony,” he said. The virtual avatars of students walked up to the stage to receive their degrees from 3-D avatars of the director and chief guest Duncan Haldane, a 2016 Nobel Laureate for Physics.“You are probably just as surprised as me over the profound changes that have taken place in academic life during the last four months, and the changed world,” said Haldane in his message. “There is a lesson for everyone involved in research. Even if you are involved in a very goal-driven project, try to find some small share of your time to investigate unexpected curiosities that sometimes show up along the way,” he advised the graduating students.Stephen A Schwarzman, chairperson and chief executive officer of global investment firm Blackstone, who delivered the commencement speech, said, “IIT engineers are defining the global technology landscape and the newest alumni will be the next generation of future global leaders who will advance that mission. You, IIT Bombay graduates, must seize the opportunity to be leaders of impact who are a force for change - and for good - in this world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-b-holds-virtual-convocation-event/story-SCls0kc9Xgd2C9Yt4uvogO.html

I take responsibility for what I am saying. The number of Covid-19 deaths is being under-reported in a planned way with active support of the state government. I said this earlier also,” said Chowdhury who represents the Berhampore Lok Sabha constituency in Bengal’s Murshidabad district. He also alleged that people of the state are not getting proper treatment because of lack of health infrastructure and health workers are being sent to remote areas without PPE kits. “I urge the state government not to cheat the common people. The government is making tall statements and declaring lockdowns but whatever claims and statements the government is making need to be crosschecked and verified,” Chowdhury said. The TMC condemned Chowdhury’s allegation. TMC Lok Sabha member and spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “He is making baseless allegations only to malign the state government. The reports being given by the state government goes to the Centre and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). There is no way the state government can send wrong figures, be it the number of cases or deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-tmc-govt-under-reporting-covid-19-deaths-alleges-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury/story-aeJwWdbCHU5SWspnnrNR4O.html
23-08-2020||India||As leadership debate rages in Congress, Goa leadership backs Gandhi family||The Goa unit of Congress party has firmly sided with the Gandhi family in the midst of a storm raging inside the grand old party over the question of leadership and restructuring of the organization.The Goa Congress on Sunday said that the party needed to unite behind the Gandhis to defeat the BJP, echoing a sentiment expressed by several party leaders, who expressed their disagreement with another group within the party that triggered the debate by seeking sweeping changes in the organization including devolution of centralized power through collective leadership. Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat tweeted to say that it was important to unite behind the leadership. “The Nation looks at @INCIndia as peoples (sic) voice in critical times of Covid Pandemic. Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has led the Congress Party keeping everyone united during crisis. Lets (sic) us discuss how to strengthen her & @RahulGandhi ji’s hands to defeat the divisive @BJP4India,” Kamat said in a tweet.

Madkami had joined the Maoists in 2015 and was in the protection team of Chaitu, who was in-charge of the Darva division of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee. Since December 2019, he was working in the Mahupadar local squad.The Malkangiri SP said Madkami was active in Malkangiri and nearby areas and had decided to give up the path of violence as he was disillusioned by Maoist leaders. “He saw various developmental activities being undertaken by the government in this area and realized the futility of the violent path before deciding to join the mainstream of society,” the SP said.With the surrender of Madkami, the number of surrenders in Odisha increased to 20 this year. Among the Maoists who surrendered this year were Kamlyu Beti alias Kamlu, the Kanger Ghati area committee secretary of Darva division under Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee in Chhattisgarh. Last year, nearly 13 Maoists had surrendered in Odisha state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-maoist-with-rs-2-lakh-reward-on-him-surrenders-before-odisha-police/story-O8JFNl555s2CwS4cmgAENK.html

23-08-2020||India||AG KK Venugopal declines permission to prosecute Swara Bhasker for contempt of court||Attorney General of India (AG), KK Venugopal, on Sunday, declined to grant permission for initiation of criminal contempt of court proceedings against actor Swara Bhasker for her statements criticising the Supreme Court and its judgment in the Ayodhya dispute.Bhasker’s statement that the Supreme Court acknowledged the illegality of demolition of the Babri Masjid in its November 2019 judgment and yet rewarded the perpetrators who brought down the mosque “appears to be a factual statement” and reflects Bhasker’s perception of the incident, Venugopal said in his letter to petitioner, Usha Shetty declining the request. “The statement appears to be a factual one and is a perception of the speaker. The comment refers to the judgment of the Supreme Court, and is not an attack on the institution. This does not offer any comment on the Supreme Court itself or say anything that would scandalize or lower the authority of the Supreme Court. In my opinion, this statement does not constitute criminal contempt,” the AG’s letter stated.The plea against Bhasker, which was filed by Shetty on August 17, was placed before the AG for his consent to list the matter before the court.As per Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act and Rule 3 of Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court, the consent of AG or the solicitor general is required before the apex court can hear a criminal contempt petition filed by a private individual.The November 9 judgment of the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya dispute, which was delivered by a bench headed by former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, had awarded the 2.77 acre disputed site to Ram Lalla Virajman, the child deity. The bench had also ordered that 5 acres of land at an alternative site should be granted to Muslims for construction of a new mosque.The top court had, interestingly, acknowledged the existence of a valid mosque at the disputed site and had expressly stated that the acts of Hindus in placing idols inside the mosque in 1949 and destruction of the mosque in 1992 were illegal.Bhasker had, on February 1, attended a panel discussion organized by NGO Mumbai Collective on the topic ‘Artists against Communalism’. During the discussion, Bhasker, as alleged by the petitioner, made the following statement:“We are now in a situation where our courts are not sure whether they believe in the Constitution or not…We are living in a country where the Supreme Court of our country states in a judgment that the demolition of Babri Masjid was unlawful and in the same judgment rewards the same people who brought down the mosque.”Regarding Bhasker’s statement about courts not believing in the Constitution, the AG said that it is a vague and general statement not related to any particular court and cannot be taken seriously.Venugopal had on, August 20, asked the Supreme Court not to punish lawyer Prashant Bhushan for contempt of court in relation to his tweets against Supreme Court and current Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde.After AG declined permission, Shetty’ lawyers on Sunday wrote to solicitor general Tushar Mehta seeking his consent.Shetty submitted that the statement by Bhasker is derogatory and intended to scandalize the Supreme Court. It is not merely a cheap stunt for publicity but a deliberate attempt to incite masses to “resist and revolt against the apex court,” she added.“The statement intends to incite feeling of no confidence amongst public with respect to the proceedings of the Supreme Court. It amounts to criminal contempt,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-kk-venugopal-declines-permission-to-prosecute-swara-bhasker-for-contempt-of-court/story-6iplNwxHsjgP3AcDZSVh4L.html

He also added that he believed Sonia Gandhi, who is the interim party chief, should continue to lead the party at a juncture when it had hit its lowest ebb.Criticising the letter on leadership issues in the Congress, Gehlot who had been locked in a bitter power tussle with his erstwhile deputy Sachin Pilot for over a month said, that when it came to a fight to save the ethos of the Indian democracy, Gandhi had always taken challenges head on. He also emphasised that if she had indeed made up her mind then he thought Congress leader Rahul Gandhi should step forward and take up the reins of the party.ALSO READ | ‘Get together and find a new chief’: Sonia Gandhi in response to letter on leadership“News of 23 senior most Congress leaders writing a letter to Hon’ble CP is unbelievable and if it is true - it’s very unfortunate. There was no need to go to the media. I strongly believe that Hon’ble CP Smt Sonia Gandhi ji should continue to lead the party at this crucial juncture,” Gehlot said in a series of tweets on Sunday.The Rajasthan chief minister said that the Gandhi family had kept the Congress party united and the letter written by senior Congress leaders over party leadership was an unfortunate move.He also emphasised that leaders who had written the letter had worked with the party for long enough and should have known better than to question the leadership.Ahead of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday, different groups have emerged with a section of leaders comprising sitting MPs and former ministers demanding collective leadership, while another group has sought the return of Rahul Gandhi to the helm.Last year, Sonia Gandhi had accepted the post of the interim party chief after a lot of persuasion by Congress party workers and leaders on condition that the party would find her replacement soon. After receiving the letter from Congress leaders on the leadership issue, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in her response, told them that she was not interested in leading the party once again when the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on August 10 had requested her to assume the reins of the organisation once more, according to a senior party official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/news-of-23-senior-congress-leaders-writing-letter-to-sonia-gandhi-is-unbelievable-says-ashok-gehlot/story-4t5O7mIPXAp2fPH3LXfmzK.html
23-08-2020||India||Kerala gold smuggling case: Opposition steps up pressure on Pinarayi Vijayan-led govt||With assembly elections eight months away in Kerala, the opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have announced a series of protests seeking the resignation of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is on the back foot after the high-profile gold smuggling case. BJP state president K Surendran observed a one-day fast on Sunday and Congress-led UDF will bring a no-confidence motion against the government in the assembly on Monday. As the ruling front enjoys a majority (90 in the 138-member House) in the assembly it will not affect the stability of the government but the debate can embarrass the government further. “The CM’s private secretary was suspended and the key accused in the smuggling case had a good rapport with his office, all agencies say it but the CM says his office was in no way connected with the smuggling case. Nobody will believe it,” said former CM of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis inaugurating the day-long fast of Surendran online. Basking in the Covid-19 recovery rate glory, being the first state to report the virus but with the lowest mortality and high recovery rates, the gold smuggling case surfaced at a bad time for the government. A week after the seizure of 30 kg gold from a consignment in the United Arab Emirates consulate in the state capital, the CM was forced to suspend his powerful private secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer. The Enforcement Directorate has also started investigation against another minister K T Jaleel, who reportedly accepted funds and 4000 kg ‘gift’ from the consulate in March. Though the minister pleaded that these consignments were holy books the opposition alleged that some of the packets contained smuggled gold. If the minister’s version is right, he can’t get away from the foreign exchange management act, experts say. “After the gold smuggling case came to light many other corruption cases also surfaced. The CM can’t run away from these correction charges. In the Life Mission project serious irregularities came to light,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala seeking a probe into the Life Mission project. While probing the smuggling case the Life Mission project commission came to light—the main accused in the smuggling case Swapna Suresh said she accepted a hefty commission for the project. As the barrage of charges increased the ruling CPI (M) has asked party workers to inform people about what it called “a joint onslaught by Congress-BJP combine” and “highlight good works of the government.” On Sunday it organised a state wide sit-in against the Centre’s polices including privatisation of airports. The party had locked horns with the Centre over its move to lease out Thiruvananthapuram airport to Adani Enterprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-opposition-steps-up-pressure-on-pinarayi-vijayan-led-govt/story-Up4yPkzwncKYUDzKWDvNQO.html

23-08-2020||India||BJP’s plan for Bihar assembly polls involves careful study of the voters list||With elections in Bihar likely to be announced anytime in September, the BJP state executive has chalked out a month-long programme to reach out to the people and to align its poll strategy with the social realities in the state. After party’s national president J P Nadda gave the mantra of ‘door to door’ campaigning, the BJP executive committee has chalked out a five-day programme beginning August 25 for assembly-segment-wise meetings. Twenty three groups have been formed for this purpose and they have been asked to contact important persons. That the party is leaving no stone unturned is apparent from the fact that it has set aside one full day for an analysis of the voters list based on social equations and factors that may impact Bihar polls.“On August 30, the team deputed for the purpose will analyze the social composition, age and classification of voters before identifying supporters, neutral voters and those opposed to the party,” said a BJP official. BJP state in-charge Bhupendra Yadav, who coined the slogan, “BJP hai Tyar, Aatmnirbhar Bihar”, has also asked party’s state officials, MPs, MLAs and assembly in-charge to meet government officials, representatives of Panchayati Raj system, Tola Sewaks, Asha workers, Jeevika Didis, Anganwadi workers, Vikas Mitras and all those who have been doing exemplary work during the pandemic and felicitate them between September 1 and 6.Also Read: Will fight Bihar assembly polls under chief minister Nitish Kumar’s leadership, says BJP chief JP Nadda It has also planned a meeting with all those who benefited from government schemes and the poor.Yesterday, the party had indicated that it wants to fight the assembly elections on the plank of development while highlighting the state government and the Central government’s achievements and contrasting it with the past ‘misrule’ of opposition parties that have formed a coalition only to protect ‘scam-tainted families’.Also Read: BJP banks on development and Nitish Kumar to win Bihar pollsParty election in charge for Bihar, Devendra Fadnavis had made it clear that the BJP will have to take the two governments’ work to the people and reach out to each household despite the limitations imposed by the Coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-plan-for-bihar-assembly-polls-involves-careful-study-of-the-voters-list/story-OO6v0brCOpeV20o4Z9zhNK.html

Other leaders, however, say that Sonia Gandhi is the best choice for the party.A meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, is scheduled for Monday, news agency ANI reported.Senior Congress leader and former Union law minister Ashwani Kumar questioned the timing of the letter, saying “there are some who have harmed the party repeatedly even after receiving more than their just dues”.Kumar said that the Congress will function best on the basis of broad political consensus “hammered through meaningful and wide consultations amongst the leadership.” “Sonia Gandhi’s judgement in the accommodation of competing claims to recognition has generally served the party well.”Another senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said that the party should give consensus a chance instead of elections which create divisiveness.Khurshid also said Rahul Gandhi enjoys the “full support” and “endorsement” of party leaders and workers, and it does not matter whether he wears the label of a president or not.A group of Congress leaders have raised questions and suggestions about the functioning of the party in their letter to Sonia Gandhi.In her response, Gandhi told them that she was not interested in leading the party once again when the CWC on August 10 requested her to assume the reins of the organisation again, a senior functionary said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narendra-modi-is-scared-of-rahul-gandhi-only-assam-congress-leader/story-QZNEH3ZIWrpRkqe39Nbu1L.html

23-08-2020||India||Amaravati protests against 3 capitals complete 250 days, BJP remains nonchalant||Bharatiya Janata Party, which strongly resisted Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s decision to form three capitals in the initial days, has now been keeping silent, even as all the other opposition parties have stepped up the agitation demanding that Amaravati be retained as the only capital city. On Sunday, farmers of Amaravati took up “Rana Bheri” programme against the state government’s move to shift the executive capital to Visakhapatnam to mark the completion of 250 days of their agitation. Thousands of farmers, including men, women and children beat drums, blew trumpets and played cymbals and plates to register their protest. All the opposition parties including the Telugu Desam Party, the Congress, CPI and CPI (M) extended their solidarity with the farmers with protest demonstrations in various villages. But the BJP leaders have stayed away from the agitation. In fact, when the Jagan government announced the formation of three capitals in December, the BJP leaders toured Amaravati villages and took part in the agitations. Then BJP president Kanna Lakshminarayana even staged a day-long hunger strike at Uddandarayunipalem village, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the capital city of Amaravati on October 22, 2015. The BJP, in coordination with Jana Sena Party headed by popular hero Pawan Kalyan, even planned to take out a massive rally from Guntur to Vijayawada in support of Amaravati farmers on February 2. But the plan was abruptly dropped. Apparently, the Central government led by the BJP, has taken a clear stand not to interfere in the three capitals issue. During the ongoing legal battle between the Amaravati farmers’ Joint Action Committee and the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the state high court, too, the Centre maintained a neutral stand. On August 6, additional solicitor general submitted an affidavit in the court stating that the Centre had no role in selecting the location of capital as it was the prerogative of the state government. “In the past, the TDP notified Amaravati as the capital city. Now, the present government has chosen three capitals. The Centre has no role in it,” he said. A similar affidavit was filed by a Union home ministry official in the high court last Wednesday. BJP national spokesman G V L Narasimha Rao, too, endorsed the same view saying the Centre had nothing to do with the capital controversy. Newly-appointed state BJP president Somu Veerraju said as a political party, the BJP wished that Amaravati continued as the state capital. “But the Centre has already made it clear it has nothing do with the capital location,” he told Hindustan Times. “We are sympathetic towards the agitating farmers of Amaravati and are demanding that the present YSR Congress government fulfill all promises made to them, like development of the plots allotted to them,” Veerraju said. Also Read: Andhra Pradesh irrigation minister reviews flood situation in state,directs officials to be alertAsked why the BJP was not actively participating in the agitations in support of farmers as it had done in the past, the state BJP chief said his party workers were asked to extend their support to the agitation. Senior TDP leader and former minister Nakka Anand Babu accused the BJP of adopting double standards. “It has not been consistent in its stand on Amaravati,” he alleged. TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu has accused the Jagan government of going ahead with the three capitals plan without approval from the people of the state. “The chief minister has not accepted our challenge to dissolve the assembly and seek re-election on the plank of three capitals formation,” Naidu said, and called upon the people of all the 13 districts in the state to show total solidarity with the continuing agitation of Amaravati farmers. Also Read: After abandoning Amaravati for 14 months, Jagan decides to develop it againPradesh congress committee working president N Tulasi Reddy described the 250-day long agitation by Amaravati farmers as one of the longest and peaceful agitations, taken up purely on Gandhian lines. “When he was in opposition, Jagan had extended his support to Amaravati as the capital city.

Congress chief in Uttar Pradesh, Ajay Kumar Lallu ordered a probe after the videos went viral.“It is an unfortunate matter and the party high command is taking action in this regard,” Shabana Khandelwal, the state general secretary of the Congress, said Sunday. While Dixit has rejected the allegation, Torrent Power Limited distanced itself from the controversy. “Torrent Power Limited has nothing to do with this video or contents therein. No one was asked to represent us, nor any one had discussed the matter on our behalf as shown in the video,” said Bhupinder Singh, the public relations officer for Torrent Power Limited. After submitting her resignation, Dixit said it was a conspiracy. “I have already resigned from the post of district president and will face the probe,” she said. “I have no connection with the video going viral nor have I demanded any money for not protesting against the power company. I had gone to Agra city on August 15 for the Independence Day function, visited party leader Shahid Ahmed’s house and discussed party matters. No such statements were made by me as alleged in the video,” said Dixit. She said the video was manipulated to frame her. “I have never betrayed my party. Rather, I enhanced its strength in the district. I had always worked to strengthen the hands of party leaders Priyanka Gandhi and Ajay Kumar Lallu, but I was framed as I had strengthened the Congress party in Agra,” Dixit said. In the second video, Shahid Ahmed was seen purportedly acknowledging that he had colluded with another partyman to trap Dixit. He repeated the same thing when asked on the phone.“I had received Rs 20,000 and was promised Rs 80,000 by Raghvendra Meenu for getting this video recorded so that district president of Congress Manoj Dixit could be removed from her post,” Ahmed said, adding that he was ashamed of betraying Dixit. But he also said that some parts of the video were edited. He was allegedly seen in the first video too but did not speak in it. Dixit had recently staged a big protest against Torrent Power Limited. The police had arrested her and released her the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-orders-probe-after-its-top-two-leaders-in-agra-quit-over-video-row/story-Oc9lUBhRI53hJG4aBFRPtM.html
23-08-2020||India||‘Wrong to question Sonia Gandhi’s unifying leadership’: Ashwani Kumar||Senior Congress leader Ashwani Kumar has questioned the timing of a letter which has sought a complete overhaul of the organisation, saying the need of the hour is to stay united.“This is not the time for an electoral exercise which is potentially divisive. At this point of time and considering the extraordinary situation in the country, the need of the hour is to close ranks,” Kumar said.“Issues required to be addressed can be addressed under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi who has held the party together through difficult times. Only a year ago, party persons literally begged Sonia Gandhi to lead the party and she agreed as a call of duty. It is wrong to question her unifying leadership at this stage. I am of the view that under the present extraordinary circumstances political adventurism cannot be the way forward,” he further said in the statement.Kumar, who served as the Union law minister during Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime, said that the Congress will function best on the basis of broad political consensus “hammered through meaningful and wide consultations amongst the leadership.” “Sonia Gandhi’s judgement in the accommodation of competing claims to recognition has generally served the party well.”He also targeted the leaders who have signed the letter, saying “there are some who have harmed the party repeatedly even after receiving more than their just dues”.Kumar’s statement comes at a time when there is a churn in the Congress over the leadership issue. A group of party leaders had written to Sonia Gandhi seeking overhaul of the party. Responding to their letter, Gandhi said that all of them should get together and find a new chief as she does not want to carry out the responsibilities any further, people familiar with the development said.In her response, Gandhi has told them that she was not interested in leading the party once again when the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on August 10 requested her to assume the reins of the organisation again, a senior functionary said on condition of anonymity.Kumar’s remarks assume significance as they come just ahead of the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision making body, on Monday, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrong-to-question-sonia-gandhi-s-unifying-leadership-ashwani-kumar/story-4TGhOu8QKKcswi1pQkzfaK.html
23-08-2020||India||Politics picks up pace in Assam ahead of next year’s assembly polls||The political temperatures in Assam, which is ravaged by the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the annual flood fury, are gradually rising as the assembly polls are less than eight months away. New political outfits are being announced, old alliances are firming up and fresh alignments are taking shape with parties and politicians to woo the state’s 217,000 registered voters (going by the figure of last year’s parliamentary election). In April 2016, the state’s voters sprang a surprise by ousting the 15-year-old Congress regime and replacing it with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who formed the government with the support of the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF). Both the BJP are the AGP are likely to stick to the alliance in the next year’s assembly polls as well. But there’s no clarity yet from the BPF, a strong player in Bodo-populated four districts of lower Assam. The BPF is upset with BJP over the deferment of the election to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), which was under the BPF rule, due to Covid-19, and also because of the imposition of Governor’s rule in the four districts administered by it. In the 2016 polls, the BJP had won 60 of the 126 assembly seats, while AGP and BPF had wrested 14 and 12 each, respectively. The Congress had secured 26 seats and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) got 13. “For 2021, we are looking at bagging 100 plus seats along with our alliance partners, which could be the AGP, the BPF or any other party. The decision of selecting alliance partners and seat-sharing arrangements with them will be taken by the party’s central leadership,” said Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. While the BJP is aiming for another five-year term at power, the opposition Congress and the AIUDF sealed a grand alliance on Saturday for the next year’s assembly polls and hopes to bring the Left parties and others to unset the BJP-AGP-BPF coalition. “We have formally decided to form a grand alliance against the BJP for next year’s polls. The Congress will play the role of a big brother in the alliance. We welcome others to join us. Decisions on seat-sharing arrangements and other issues will be taken later,” Ripun Bora, president, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC), Assam and a Rajya Sabha (RS) member, told media persons on Sunday. In recent weeks, BJP leaders have been targeting the Congress over its bid to tie-up with the AIUDF that was formally announced on Saturday. State minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who holds multiple portfolios, stated the alliance would turn the grand old party’s office in Guwahati, Rajiv Bhawan, into Ajmal Bhawan—after AIUDF chief and perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal. “It’s an unholy alliance. AIUDF was formed with the intention of safeguarding the interests of suspected foreigners and the Congress has also been dependent on that section of voters. The coming together of these parties is a dangerous sign for all self-respecting Assamese and Indians at large,” BJP’s Dass said. AIUDF’s organising secretary Md. Aminul Islam said that contrary to BJP’s allegations, the party would not have a chief ministerial candidate of its own and would support the Congress candidate for the post. A common minimum programme (CMP) of the grand-alliance will be announced later, he said. Besides the BJP and its coalition partners and the Congress-AIUDF grand alliance, several other parties are also planning to make a debut this time to catch in on the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, sentiment that had resonated across most parts of the state last year.

Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), another outfit that spearheaded the anti-CAA stir, has announced its plan to launch a political party. The outfit’s leader Akhil Gogoi, who is lodged in Guwahati Central Jail since last December for his alleged role in the anti-CAA stir, is likely to be its CM face.

We have 4.2 million dedicated workers in Assam. If each one of them is able to bring an additional vote, we will have 8.4 million votes, which would be sufficient to bring us back to power,” claimed Dass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politics-picks-up-pace-in-assam-ahead-of-next-year-s-assembly-polls/story-hk8ImmmpqbrKxQqVSPa1ZO.html

Biman Ghosh, president of the BJP local unit, alleged that the Trinamool Congress had created circumstances that forced him to hang himself. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “Several BJP workers were killed by the TMC during the panchayat polls and their bodies were hanged to portray the crimes as suicide. Debendra Nath Roy, our legislator from Hemtabad in North Dinajpur district, was also killed and hanged in early July.” TMC leaders dismissed the allegation, saying Mukherjee committed suicide at home and the ruling party had nothing to do with it. “The youth was a relative of mine. How can the BJP politicize every death like this? They should be sympathetic towards the family at least,” said TMC legislator from Goghat, Manas Majumdar. “He went to attend a birthday dinner on Saturday evening and went to bed after returning home. I talked to his family,” said Majumdar. “Local people told us that Mukherjee had a relationship with a class nine student but the minor girl’s family was opposed to the relationship,” an officer from the local police station said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-youth-leader-dies-by-suicide-in-bengal-village-party-alleges-foul-play/story-acIyhUGMj52LnIej24jrSM.html
23-08-2020||India||Homeopathic drug given to half of Gujarat’s population since March||The Gujarat health department has said it distributed homeopathic drug Arsenicum Album-30 to more than half of the state’s population as prophylaxis since March after the outbreak of Covid-19.In its presentation made before the World Health Organisation on August 20 on Gujarat’s Covid-19 prevention strategy, the health department said it distributed Arsenicum Album-30 to 3.48 crore people, which is more than half of the state’s population of 6.6 crore.There is no scientific evidence that the drug works against Covid-19, a fact stressed not only by medical scientists but by some homeopathic practitioners themselves.The state government also claimed that 99.6 per cent of people who availed AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) remedies as prophylaxis during their quarantine period tested negative for coronavirus.In its presentation, which was shared with the media, the health department said “AYUSH interventions have proven to be immunity boosters, and the AYUSH treatment protocol was developed and a research carried out for assessing efficacy of treatment.” “As many as 33,268 people benefited from AYUSH medicines in the quarantine period, half of whom availed homoeopathic medicines,” it said.The state government claimed that 99.69 per cent of people who availed AYUSH remedies as prophylaxis during their quarantine period tested negative for coronavirus.However, a clinical trial related to the prophylaxis nature of Arsenicum Album-30 for coronavirus in the state has not yet yielded any conclusive result, an official said.Gujarat Principal Secretary, Health, Jayanti Ravi on Sunday said the government has some reason to believe about theefficacy of Arsenicum Album-30 medicine, as out of thousands of quarantined people who were given the dosage of Arsenicum Album-30, “99.69 per cent eventually tested negative for coronavirus”.“Even 0.3 per cent who tested positive had only mild symptoms. We have prima facie reason to believe in some effectiveness of Arsenicum Album-30 against coronavirus. But to actually establish this, we need more rigorous analysis,” Ravi said.The government has so far distributed 3.48 crore dosages of Arsenicum Album-30 starting March, including repeat dosages as the medicine remains effective for 1.5 to two months, she said.As per Bhavna Patel, director of state AYUSH department, the result of a clinical trial on Aresnicum Album-30 going on at a private clinic in Bhavnagar as prophylaxishas not yet shown any clear result.Patel said the homeopathic medicine has been distributed since March on the recommendation of an expert committee, including homeopathic doctors, and a repeat order has also been given by the state health department for people who used it over a month ago.“The AYUSH department used its channel of 272 dispensaries, and roped in officials of the local administration like TDOs (taluka development officers) and talatis (local revenue officers) to distribute the medicine.Health camps were organised with the help of NGOs to distribute this,” Patel said.“Arsenicum Album-30 boosts immunity, but our research is not yet complete on this. We have given approval for its private clinical trial as prophylaxisin Bhavnagar, but the result is not clear because it is not complete,” she said.Ahmedabad-based homeopathic doctor and member of national executive committee of the Homeopathic Medical Association of India, Shivang Swaminarayan, said the AYUSH Ministry recommended the use of the medicine as an immunity booster after finding that it benefited people.However, it is better to consult qualified homeopathic doctors before taking the medicine, he said.“It is always better to consult a qualified homeopathic doctor. Immunity is not everything in any disease.One should also look at one’s general health, age, profession, how much risk he/she is exposed to...this is after all a medicine, and how to take it, and when and in how much dose, one needs to know this from qualified government or private doctors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/homeopathic-drug-given-to-half-of-gujarat-s-population-since-march/story-a4Y9Q9SudZ48VPYTGgAsKJ.html
23-08-2020||India||Diesel consumption in July fell 12.7% but shouldn’t ring alarm bells, say experts||Diesel consumption, a bellwether of economic health, saw a 12.7% decline in July this year compared to the preceding month mainly because of demand constraints, heavy rains in various parts of the country and weekend lockdowns still prevailing in several areas.While the consumption of diesel in July this year dropped to 5.5 million metric tonne (MMT) compared to 6.3 MMT in June 2020, overall consumption of petroleum products also saw a 3.7% drop at 15.7 MMT in July 2020 compared to 16.3 MMT in the previous month, according to oil ministry’s data keeper petroleum planning and analysis cell (PPAC). Consumption of diesel has witnessed an encouraging year-on-year ease in contraction from -55.5% in April to -29.3% in May and -15.4% in June after the lockdown was gradually relaxed from June 1. The trend, however, saw a reversal in July with a 19.3% contraction.Experts, however, said that the demand for diesel usually decreases in the monsoon months of July and August, hence the positive trend of economic recovery that continued after ‘Unlock 1.0’ will sustain in coming months with the resumption of more and more business activities . The country had been under a 68-day lockdown since March 25. It started opening up gradually from June 1, with ‘Unlock 1.0’. The Union government on June 29 issued guidelines for ‘Unlock 2.0’ to lift more restrictions, imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, effective for a month from July 1.Ram Singh, professor at the Delhi School of Economics said a drop in diesel demand in July 2020 compared to June 2020 does not indicate any major blip in the ongoing economic recovery, which will continue to improve in the coming months. “Diesel consumption saw a jump in June because of a pent-up demand after the lockdown... Besides, the onset of monsoon in July also reduced demand for diesel [for irrigation],” he said.SC Sharma, an energy expert and former officer on special duty at the erstwhile planning commission, said, “High consumption of diesel in June occurs due to harvesting and to some extent due to DG [diesel generator] based electricity demand. However, as monsoon enters, the agriculture and power demand is largely met by monsoon water as also wind power and hydro power. Accordingly, diesel demand goes down by 15% to 20% during July, August every year.” According to the latest ‘Industry consumption Report’ published by PPAC, “certain restrictions at state and district levels coupled with a lower demand for products and services” moderated the speed of recovery of diesel consumption to the pre-Covid level. Diesel consumption in July 2019 was 6.8 MMT.The report pointed at key factors affecting diesel consumption in July. “Unlock 2.0 has carried forward the economic recovery but at a moderate pace. Most of the industries across states are operating at 70 to 80% capacity due to a subdued demand,” it said.Also Read: Weekend lockdown, odd-even restrictions will kill businesses:Shopkeepers in Ludhiana Weekend lockdowns and other restrictions imposed by state and district administrations to curtail the spread of Covid-19 have also affected the consumption of diesel, it said. While rural demand on account of agriculture related activities continues to drive consumption growth, floods in Bihar and certain north eastern states have also affected consumption, it added.Also Read: China investors brace for record defaults in risky end to 2020The report said diesel consumption in July 2020 was also affected by other factors such as slow growth in sales of commercial vehicles and a decline in port traffic. “Commercial vehicle sales as reported by individual companies are showing a slow pace to recovery. Major automobile companies have reported a fall in sale of M&HCV [medium and heavy commercial vehicle] by about -70% and of LCV [light commercial vehicle] by about -30%,” it said.According to the report, the traffic handled at major ports in India fell by 13.2% and collectively they handled 51.5 MMT of cargo during July 2020 as against 59.3 MMT handled during the corresponding period of the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diesel-consumption-in-july-fell-12-7-but-shouldn-t-ring-alarm-bells-say-experts/story-ui0RXvH3Ytlprx455tWMkI.html

He should apologise to the people. The entire state is facing the fury of coronavirus. I will file an FIR over the murder due to carelessness of late minister Chetan Chauhan at PGI,” Singh said on Twitter in Hindi. बेहद दुःख की बात है कि योगी जी ने कल उत्तर प्रदेश की जनता को "नमूना" कहा और जनता का अपमान किया। योगी जी को जनता से माफ़ी माँगनी चाहिए। आज पूरे उत्तर प्रदेश में करोना का क़हर है।PGI में सरकार के मंत्री स्व.चेतन चौहान की लापरवाहीपूर्ण हत्त्या हुई है इस मामले में FIR करूँगा। pic.twitter.com/BVlZ1KjWB3Chauhan (73), who was admitted to the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) after he tested positive for Covid-19, was shifted to the Medanta hospital in Haryana’s Gurugram when his condition deteriorated. The cricketer-turned-politician died last week due to Covid-related complications, after being put on life support for nearly 36 hours.Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Sunil Singh Sajan had raised the issue in the Upper House of the Uttar Pradesh Legislature, alleging that Chauhan received poor treatment at SGPGI.

And he went to the Medanta hospital in Gurugram citing family reasons. If there were any complaints, it should have been conveyed. The incident will be probed,” he said.The AAP leader’s tweet came a day after Adityanath launched a scathing attack at him in his address in state Assembly. Without naming Singh, the chief minister said, “Some ‘namoonas’ come here and ask us what we have done for the people of the state? They want to talk about the situation in UP, but steer clear of talking about the condition of Delhi.”Adityanath also presented data to and compared the Covid-19 situation in Uttar Pradesh with that of Delhi.

23-08-2020||India||Receding glaciers in Nanda Devi region affecting lifestyle, agriculture||The changes in glaciers in the Nanda Devi region of Central Himalayas in Uttarakhand in the last three decades have majorly affected the lifestyle, culture and agricultural practices of people living in nearby villages, says a study carried out by experts from major institutes including IIT Kanpur, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) and HNB Garhwal Central University in Uttarakhand. The research conducted on the ‘changes in glaciers and associated drivers for the last three decades, Nanda Devi region, Central Himalayas’ was done by studying the state of glaciers from 1980 till 2017 through extensive ground surveys and satellite imagery. During the study, which started in 2002 and was completed in 2018 before getting published in a science journal last month, it was found that about 26 sq km of the glaciated area of the Nanda Devi region was lost in 37 years which affected the people living in nearby areas. MPS Bisht, director of USAC, who was among the researchers involved in the study said, “The changes in the glaciated areas had a major effect on various aspects of the life of people living in about 47 villages in the buffer zone of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve hosting the Nada Devi glaciers.” “It was found that the people in those villages who used to wear heavy winter clothing due to low temperatures, had stopped wearing them due to climatic changes in the last few decades which have caused the receding of glaciers there,” said Bisht. Agricultural practices and housing changed The locals in the region were now growing a wide variety of vegetation which points to a change in the agricultural practices as well.“Their agricultural practices have also changed as earlier they used to grow only buckwheat, potato and kidney beans. But now they have started growing green vegetables also due to the change in temperature and climate over the last three decades,” Bisht added. During the ground surveys for the study Bisht and other researchers also found that food habits and housing designs have also changed. “First they used to build houses with logs and grass on the roofs to bear the snowfall. But now, due to the climatic changes, the snowfall has stopped but rains have started due to which they are now using tiles on the roofs which used to be unthinkable a few decades ago,” he said. Also Read: Report urges action on tidal flooding, beach erosion due to environmental damageOn the food habits, he said the locals used to have ghee-mixed tea to keep warm earlier but now that has been replaced by normal tea.Major effect on the cultivation of apples Bisht informed that one of the major effects has been on the cultivation of apples in the area and livelihood of the people in the villages. “Earlier the chilled variety of apples like Golden delicious was cultivated in those areas but it has now stopped because of rise in temperatures due to which those apples could not grow. Similarly, the locals in those villages used to collect medicinal herbs from the jungles and sell for their livelihood. That has been also affected as those herbs are now growing less due to climatic changes,” said Bisht. The areas vacated by the glaciers are now occupied by vegetation which used to grow in lower regions.During the study, the team of researchers examined eight glaciers in the Upper Rishi Ganga catchment in Nanda Devi region. “In 1980, the Upper Rishi Ganga catchment which covers an area of 690 sq km had a glaciated area of about 243 sq km, about 35% of the total area. In 2017, it reduced to 217 sq km, a loss of 26 sq km. Now the total glaciated area is only 26% of the total area,” Bisht said on the receding snowline. Srikrishna Nautiyal, another researcher involved in the study, said, “The study also suggested that the glaciers in the region have responded to deprived precipitation conditions since 1980, overlapping our understanding of glacier retreat due to temperature increase in the context of global warming scenario.” Also Read: Why climate scientists believe natural gas won’t avert environment disasterHe informed that it was found that the largest glacier of the region, UND glacier covered an area of 71.42 sq km in 1980 which was reduced to 63.72 sq km in 2017. “Similarly, the smallest one, Changbang which occupied 7.85 sq km in 1989, had shrunk to 5.95 sq km in 2017. It was also found that the north-facing glaciers such as Trishul, DRB and Raunthi lost the minimum percentage area compared to south-facing ones like Changbang and Ramni,” said Nautiyal. “This shows that the slope and aspect play a very important role in glacier change variability,” Nautiyal added. Non-climatic factors also play a role in variable loss of glaciers Nautiyal also informed that the study also suggested that “The dynamic response of glaciers to climate is strongly dependent on glacier size and geometry.” “It can be suggested that besides global warming, the local climatic and non-climatic factors like aspect and slope, play an important role in variable loss and dynamics of glacier snouts even in the same valley,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/receding-glaciers-in-nanda-devi-region-affecting-lifestyle-agriculture/story-YFrtdfy32boPQrIMyA7RCJ.html

Khan, who has been sent to police custody for eight days, is from Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Balrampur district.Khan, a former cosmetics shop owner, who goes by his alias Abu Yusuf Khan acording to police, was allegedly riding a motorcycle from Dhaula Kuan towards Karol Bagh on Friday night, when he was arrested from the Ridge area. Police said two “pressure cooker-based improvised explosive devices (IEDs)” were seized from him. The IEDs were loaded with around 12 kg of explosives. A pistol and a few bullets were also recovered from Khan. Pramod Kushwah, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (special cell), Delhi Police, had said on Saturday that Khan was acting at the behest of his ISIS handlers, who are based abroad, to carry out “lone wolf attacks” at places with a high footfall in the national capital. Also read: ‘I asked him to stop’ - Wife of alleged ISIS operative held in DelhiOn Sunday, the DCP said that a host of explosives and devices meant to be used for detonation have been recovered from Khan’s home in UP. “We found a brown and a blue-coloured jackets containing seven explosive packets. Each of these seven packets was wrapped with transparent tape and contained explosives and cardboard sheets pasted with ball bearings. Electric wires were jutting out of these packets,” said Kushwah. The police claimed to have recovered cylindrical metal boxes containing explosives and electric wires wrapped with transparent tape, two more cylindrical boxes with ball bearings pasted over them and a broken wooden box that Khan would allegedly use for “target practice”.A dozen boxes containing ball bearings, three lithium batteries, a table alarm watch, an ampere, wires and other smaller subversive items were also seized from his home, said DCP Kushwah. “An IS flag was another incriminating piece of evidence recovered from his home,” the DCP said. Khan was trained in making IEDs with timer mechanism, suicide vests and suicide belts, Kushwah said. “Earlier, he had tested an IED at a graveyard near his home,” the DCP said. Khan is accused of being a member of the IS sleeper cell for the past five years. The police are on the lookout for accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explosives-recovered-from-is-suspect-s-home-in-uttar-pradesh-police/story-tY3iY3XQlHq7HZHPq7SMOK.html

23-08-2020||India||‘Get together and find a new chief’: Sonia Gandhi in response to letter on leadership||Congress president Sonia Gandhi has responded to a letter written by a group of party leaders, who sought a complete overhaul of the organisation, saying that all of them should get together and find a new chief as she does not want to carry out the responsibilities any further, people familiar with the development said. In her response, Gandhi has told them that she was not interested in leading the party once again when the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on August 10 requested her to assume the reins of the organisation again, a senior functionary said on condition of anonymity. Sonia Gandhi accepted the post of the interim chief after much persuasion only on one condition that the party will find her replacement soon. The leaders made desperate pleas to her after Rahul Gandhi rejected their calls to withdraw his resignation that he had put in on May 25 in the wake of party’s rout in the national elections. At that time too, Sonia Gandhi mentioned in her response that she had insisted that the new president should be someone from outside the Gandhi family, the functionary quoted from the letter. For his part, Rahul Gandhi while resigning from the top post had told the CWC in its meeting on May 25, that the party should elect a non-Gandhi as its new president. HT has learnt that the letter has been in the works for at least the past month. Several leaders that HT spoke to confirmed that Ghulam Nabi Azad and Kapil Sibal, both Rajya Sabha MPs have taken the main initiative in drafting the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-together-and-find-a-new-chief-sonia-gandhi-in-response-to-letter-on-leadership/story-ARVkXIpV9GTNF7ZbX7ibeP.html
23-08-2020||India||Congress must give consensus a chance instead of elections for leadership: Salman Khurshid||Amid calls from within the Congress to hold polls for presidency, senior leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said the party should give consensus a chance instead of elections which create divisiveness.Khurshid also said Rahul Gandhi enjoys the “full support” and “endorsement” of party leaders and workers, and it does not matter whether he wears the label of a president or not.Also read: Demanding change in leadership and complete rehaul, top Congress leaders write to Sonia Gandhi “I have said very clearly that the Gandhis are leaders of the Congress. Nobody can deny this, even the opposition cannot deny this. I am quite happy having a leader, I don’t worry about whether or not we have a president, we have a leader (in Rahul Gandhi) and that is comforting for me,” the former Union minister told PTI in an interview.His remarks assume significance as they come just ahead of the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision making body, which is likely to deliberate on the leadership issue that is in the spotlight with Sonia Gandhi completing a year as interim chief. Also, 23 Congress leaders, including some ex-ministers have written to party president Sonia Gandhi for the overhaul of the organisational structure.Asked about the section of party leaders calling for elections to the CWC and presidency, Khurshid hit out at those asking for internal polls, saying why are people so anxious to make these demands in the Congress when they are not made in any other party.Also read: CWC crucial meet tomorrow, convincing Rahul Gandhi to return as party president on agenda “I am very surprised. I have not heard a single demand being made in the Communist party or in the regional parties or in the BJP. I have not heard about demand for elections in any of those parties,” Khurshid said. “Elections are important, but the historical context in which elections have to be held, circumstances, have to be taken into account. Consensus has been an important part of the political process in the Congress,” he said. Giving up consensus and opting for elections, without reflecting upon the implications and consequences might be running into “unknown, unchartered territory”, he said. Khurshid also said that such issues should be discussed within the party and not outside it.His comments come days after Shashi Tharoor had said that he has been advocating elections to the CWC and for the post of the president as it would certainly have a number of beneficial outcomes for the party. Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit had also said recently that it is “high time” that the Congress appoints a full-time president by “selection or election”. Asked if consensus was the way forward instead of internal polls, Khurshid said, “My instinct says this. My understanding of the Congress says that consensus is extremely important.” “People react to that by saying that you are being anti-democratic. I don’t know if consensus is in some way an undemocratic thing to happen. It should be a genuine consensus. Of course it should not be a forced consensus. I think we should give consensus a chance,” he said.Also read: Agree with Rahul that non-Gandhi should be Congress president, Priyanka in new book On whether polls can lead to divisiveness in the party, Khurshid said elections do divide. Elections, in the right spirit, should not divide, but the ground reality is that elections do divide, he said. “So, let us just hope we gradually mature to a stage where elections will not divide,” he said. Asked if Rahul Gandhi should come back as party chief, Khurshid said it was up to him to make his decision and leaders should allow him to take a call. “When you give someone your allegiance as a leader then you have to listen to the leader and whatever the leader wants to do. There is a view in a large number of people that he should not stay away from presidentship of the party,” he said. Noting that Gandhi has his own reasons to keep himself away from the presidentship, Khurshid said party leaders should respect his decision and not in any way create a situation that becomes difficult for him.“Let us wait for him to take a call, I think he understands what people’s expectations and hopes are and I think he will respond to those hopes,” he said. Asked about Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s remarks carried in a book endorsing Rahul Gandhi’s views that the party should have a non-Gandhi president and whether that person would be under pressure of the Gandhis, Khurshid said where is the question of pressure as there “may be a president who is a non-Gandhi, but there will also be a leader who is a Gandhi”.“Even the president will have to accept ‘the leader’ Gandhi. You cannot choose a leader who is already chosen. People have given full support and have given their endorsement to Mr Rahul Gandhi and that will remain a fact,” he said. “Whether he (Rahul) wears the label of a president or he doesn’t wear the label of a president, he remains a leader,” Khurshid said.If Rahul Gandhi is a leader, surely, he should also be respected for his views on what the presidential structure or what the organisational structure should be in the future, he said. Khurshid said if Rahul Gandhi is the leader and he gives respect to a president, everybody will give respect to the president, he said. The party should not be breast-beating about the leadership issue and it will get resolved, Khurshid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-must-give-consensus-a-chance-instead-of-elections-for-leadership-salman-khurshid/story-e4JuSaVus3AlLxAoZpTUJO.html

The average annual production of organic and inorganic Darjeeling tea at the estate is 5,00,000 kilograms.The suspension of work was declared days after the workers started an agitation, demanding payment of arrear wages, provident fund and festive bonus. The management could not make the payments and said it was facing a financial crisis. “Though the management earlier agreed to pay the remaining part of the 2019 Durga puja bonus and some pending wages, it failed to do so and cited financial duress,” said Nima Lama, a senior leader of the Gorkha National Liberation Front, the second-largest political party in the hills which is opposed to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). Also read: Ranjan Gogoi as CM face? Assam BJP rejects Congress claimNabin Bomzan, the Darjeeling district president of the tea garden workers’ union, which is directly affiliated to the TMC, said, “The workers have set aside their political differences and staging a hunger strike.” Santosh Golay, the local unit president of Darjeeling Terai Dooars Plantation Labour Union, affiliated to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binay Tamang faction), said, “This is the first time in many years that all trade unions of the opposition and ruling parties have joined hands.” The GJM (Binay Tamang faction) is the ruling party in the hills and an ally of the TMC. For the state government, the suspension of work at Longview Tea Estate has become a cause for concern. Uden Lepcha, assistant labour commissioner in Kurseong said, “We are trying our best to reopen the garden.”AP Singh Dahiyal, senior manager of the tea estate, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Rahengra Lama, head clerk at the tea estate, said, “Though the management was regularly paying current wages, the arrears towards old wages, festive bonus, provident fund and gratuity are huge and run into a few crores of rupees.”The agitation at Longview Tea Estate has inspired workers at some tea gardens in the Dooars region such as Kohinoor, Rahimabad and Naya Sailee. Workers in these tea gardens have been staging protests for the last couple of days, demanding payment of arrear bonus and other benefits. Workers owing allegiance to the TMC, Congress, CPI (M) and BJP have united in these tea gardens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-affiliated-to-all-parties-unite-in-agitation-at-bengal-s-biggest-tea-garden/story-EdKk9l7FSLRxVB2oxOp2eM.html

Moreover, Kharghar node itself has been witnessing relentless quarrying, the petition said.“It is prudent to avoid the development of Kharghar hills into real estate projects and instead conserve it as a Nature Project,” said B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation.“The urban planners must learn lessons from the landslides at Kandivali and Malabar Hill and abort the Kharghar Heaven Hills plan,” he said, calling for a thorough Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) before urban planners venture into such projects.Environmentalists also vehemently opposed CIDCO plan to develop an affordable housing project along the quarried Parsik Hills under the PM Awaas Yojana. “These houses in the vicinity of the Parsik Hills could face landslides,” Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said. “This is forest land and must be preserved and conserved as one,” he said and cautioned CIDCO against playing with bio-diversity.“CIDCO seems to be only commercially minded, ignoring and destroying nature be it at Belapur, Uran or Kharghar,” he said.Kumar pointed out that the land below the Parsik Hills is also being dug up now for real estate projects. In fact a big private hospital has come up cutting into Parsik Hills in Belapur, he said and wondered as to how these will be safe from possible landslides or mud-floods. “We do not seem to learn any lessons from Kerala and Mumbai floods despite the environmentalists’ warnings.” he lamented.Activist Jyoti Nadkarni pointed out that residents of Kharghar have been trying their best to save the hills by planting trees and educating the people about the importance of the hills. “The government must take ownership of the hill conservation and develop it as a nature project for education and botanical research with limited hours of eco-tourism,” she said.The hills will be ruined once a real estate development starts, she argued.Another activist Chaya Taralekar said the government could develop organic farming and rainforest on the hills rather than promoting concrete jungles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/learn-from-mumbai-landslides-avoid-homes-on-kharghar-and-parsik-hills-say-green-activists/story-u8FtsdOUB4rDTShcbWBwCL.html

In the past one year, Pakistani deep state is using Chinese commercial drones to transport assault rifles, pistols and grenades to the Khalistani terrorists in Punjab as well as jihadis in Jammu and Kashmir.By killing five Pakistani intruders carrying assault rifles and Afghan heroin on Friday morning, the new DG has made his intentions clear that the BSF will be pro-active on both the borders and will not allow any anti-India activity. It is understood that the BSF chief personally spoke to the company commander who carried out the successful operation in Taran Taran sector.As Rakesh Asthana also holds the charge of DG, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the G Branch or the intelligence branch of the BSF is also being revived so that Afghan drugs do not make their way across the Pakistan border or the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir. In this context, a common strategy will be adopted between the BSF and NCB to bring big cross border drug kingpins to book as the narcotic trade funds the cross border weapons smuggling and terrorism both in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. In the past decade, India has not only become the hub of drug transhipment but also a major consumer of narcotics like heroin and cocaine from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-to-undergo-tech-upgradation-to-get-436-drones-and-anti-drone-systems/story-ozQo4aTjYtBQkJXnBRLM8J.html

She said she had warned Mohd Mustakeem Khan, alias Abu Yusuf, against doing so but he told her not to stop him, news agency ANI cited her as saying.According to ANI, the woman said she wished her husband, who according to police had planned to carry out terror strikes in Delhi’s crowded areas on the instruction of his handlers in Afghanistan, could be forgiven. “I have four kids. Where will I go?” she said.The 36-year-old Khan’s father Kafeel Ahmed told a news channel that his son was a “very good person” who never fought with anyone and that he never imagined he would take to terrorism. When asked if he knew about his son’s Khan’s terror plot, Ahmed said, “I have not heard anything about explosive material.

23-08-2020||India||Bombay HC rejects anticipatory bail plea of RTI activist, accomplice in extortion case||The Bombay high court on Friday rejected anticipatory bail applications of two Pune residents, including RTI activist Ravindra Barahate, accused of conniving with a dancer to extort money from a 64-year-old builder. Barahate and his alleged accomplice Amol Chavan had moved HC after being booked by Kothrud police in Pune, on the basis of a complaint lodged by the builder Sudhir Karnataki. Karnataki in his complaint alleged that he was introduced to the dancer, 34-year-old Dipti Aher in 2007 during the wedding reception of his nephew. A friendship developed between them and he started attending her dance programmes in Pune. In November 2013, on the dancer’s request, Karnataki arranged a three-bedroom flat at Bavdhan for her family on rent and two years later purchased it showing Aher a co-owner. However, from last year Dipti started threatening the builder Karnataki alleged that from 2019, the dancer started threatening to implicate him in a false rape case and started extorting money from him. He said in November 2019 she visited his office and demanded Rs. 6 lakh and also full ownership of the flat at Bavdhan. The builder also alleged that he was coerced into transferring full ownership of the flat to the dancer and also pay her primarily because of her accomplices - RTI activist Ravindra Barahate, extortionist Amol Chavan, a director of a well-known newspaper from western Maharashtra, and a suspended policeman. He alleged Barahate was the brain behind the extortion. Karnataki alleged that on December 26, 2019, when he was about to leave a mall after shopping, Aher and Chavan accosted him and demanded an additional sum of Rs 2 crore and the transfer of a plot that he owned in Pune in the dancer’s name. He was, thereafter, made to call different people, who too terrorised him and asked him to fulfil Aher’s demands. The builder eventually approached police and lodged a complaint after he had been booked on the basis of complaint of rape lodged by the dancer. Apprehending arrest in connection with the crime, Barahate and Chavan had moved HC, primarily on the ground that the FIR did not attribute any active role to the applicants. Barahate also claimed that he was falsely implicated, as being a RTI activist he had exposed many wrongdoings. Additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh opposed the plea and pointed out to the court that Barahate has amassed illegal wealth to the tune of Rs. 2,760 crore. “The nature and the gravity of the accusation, as can be seen, is quite serious,” said justice Prithviraj Chavan while rejecting both applications for pre-arrest bail.According to the prosecution, Barahte runs a ‘land mafia’ and is the prime accused in many of the cases registered against him in Pune. “Prima facie, it is demonstrated that he (Barahate) has been the brain behind drafting a false complaint of rape against Sudhir,” said justice Chavan after perusing statements of several witnesses in the case. “The said report, it seems, is nothing but a calumny,” the judge said. The judge said antecedents of the applicants speak for themselves and need no further elaboration. “Although nothing is placed on record as to whether the applicant had suffered any conviction or imprisonment, yet the material on record is quite sufficient to refuse the pre-arrest bail to the applicants. From the entire material on record, it is difficult to infer that false accusations have been made against the applicants with an object of injuring or humiliating them,” said HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-rejects-anticipatory-bail-plea-of-rti-activist-accomplice-in-extortion-case/story-j9YMmHJnXHooymORN5E5uO.html
23-08-2020||India||Centre raises concerns over slow pace of housing scheme for poor||The Union rural development ministry has raised concerns over the “drastic slowdown” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship housing scheme for the rural poor and has recommended that an “intense follow-up” is required by states/Union Territories (UTs). The ministry has pointed out several factors behind the delay in meeting targets. An agenda paper of the ministry for an annual review of its schemes has cited that the gap between number of houses sanctioned and those that have been completed stands at 3.12 million in the second phase of the rural housing programme in 2019-20. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), which is an upgraded version of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)-era Indira Awas Yojna, 17.2 million houses have been completed since 2014, after Modi came to power at the Centre. The scheme not only helps the rural homeless population get pucca houses, it also generates work, as up to 90 days of work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005, is required to build one house. Also read: Javadekar announces SOPs for resuming film, TV shootingHowever, this year, the programme got off to a tepid start. The government’s agenda paper attributed the delay to factors such as “inactivity during the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions, saturation of eligible beneficiaries from the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) category, tardy pace of work and lack of timely allocation of targets to districts”. Bihar tops the list of states lagging behind, as it has 988,000 incomplete houses. Other states that have failed to implement the scheme on time include West Bengal, which has 573,000 incomplete dwelling units, Madhya Pradesh (300,000), Odisha (240,000 ) and Rajasthan (223,000). Rahul Ranjan Mahiwal, special secretary in Bihar’s rural development department, said the shortfall in meeting the target was because of several factors, including last year’s floods and the Covid-19 lockdown that led to shortage of labourers. He said authorities will expedite work and set a target of completing 300,000 units in the next three months from October to December.“Last year, the floods in north Bihar disrupted work...Besides, the lockdown (that began in March-end) also disrupted construction activity for several months,” he said.West Bengal’s panchayat and rural development minister, Subrata Mukherjee, said, “This calculation should be done at the end of the year. West Bengal has not lagged behind in social welfare schemes ever since the Trinamool Congress came to power (in 2011). Our state was awarded by the Centre last year for completing projects under PMAY on time. The certificate is displayed in my office.”The Union rural development ministry has a target to construct 6.1 million houses in this financial year. It has also asked states that are facing shortage of land to consider building multi-storeyed structures. “Considerable progress in terms of allocation of land and further completion of their house is required,” the agenda note stated. The note prepared for a review meeting, to be held in August-end, stated: “Some states such as Maharashtra and Bihar have their own schemes for allotment of land and the same may be replicated by the other states. The states that cannot proceed with allotment of land from their schemes must actively explore the option of construction of multi-storey houses on government land.” Land acquisition for the scheme is a state subject. The Centre has pointed out that Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries is a pending issue and 63% of the unique identification number has been updated in the scheme’s central database to date. The ministry has directed states that seeding should be done “on utmost priority”. The note pointed out “in respect of some states, saturation of eligible beneficiaries from the SC/ST category is one of the reasons behind the slow allocation of houses and their completion. State governments are expected to start the process of allocation of houses to the newly added eligible beneficiaries after their Aadhaar seeding is done.” The ministry has also warned that “no deletion of (Aadhaar) entries can be done by the states/UTs”.

23-08-2020||India||JEE, NEET controversy: All you need to know||Students across the country have requested the government to postpone the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), scheduled to be held in September, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The students even approached the Supreme Court, but it refused to interfere in the exam schedule. The National Testing Agency (NTA), which is conducting these exams, has refused to defer them further saying it will affect next year’s academic calendar.Politicians are now joining the cause, urging the government to listen to students’ demands.Here is everything you need to know about the JEE and NEET postponement issue:What are JEE and NEET?These are the two national-level entrance exams for professional courses. Around 16 lakh students have registered for NEET-UG this year, while close to 9.3 lakh students had registered for JEE-Mains (Paper I) that was conducted in January. An equal number of students were expected to appear for the second phase of the exam, which are scheduled for April-May each year.This year however, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the National Testing Agency (NTA) kept postponing the exam dates. When are these exams going to be held?While the JEE is scheduled to be held from September 1 to 6, the NEET will be held on September 13.Also Watch | JEE, NEET update: What students feel about exams not getting postponed What are students’ contention?Several students and parents around the country have shared their concerns over conducting exams as Covid-19 cases are on a rise. However, an equal number of parents of students are also hoping that the exams are held as per the schedule so that the delay in the postponement of exams comes to an end.“Medical admissions are time bound, and therefore, it makes no sense to further delay NEET, which will eventually delay the admissions process as well. Leaving an entire batch of medical seats vacant will be unfair because next year, the intake capacity of medical institutes will remain the same but the applicants will double in number, which will lead to more chaos,” said activist Sudha Shenoy, who is the parent of an aspirant.How are the students fighting for their cause?Students from 11 states across the country filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking the postponement of these two exams.The court, however, rejected the plea on Monday. A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the NTA to hold the examinations in September.The political reactionsThe Congress has jumped on this opportunity to attack on the government. Several party leaders, including former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, asked the government to listen to students’ demands.“Today lakhs of students are saying something. The GOI must listen to the Students Ke Mann Ki Baat about NEET, JEE exams and arrive at an acceptable solution,” Gandhi said in a tweet.Congress leader Kapil Sibal called it an “injustice”, and suggested that the only just, fair and sensible solution is to postpone JEE and NEET.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jee-neet-postponement-all-you-need-to-know/story-eyMlyXSS7IeRji5icIoT0H.html

23-08-2020||India||Ranjan Gogoi as CM face? Assam BJP rejects Congress claim||The Assam unit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has rubbished veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi’s claim that the former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi could be the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate for next year’s assembly polls. “People utter lot of meaningless stuff, when they grow very old, and we would like to put Gogoi’s statement in that category. I have met many former CMs, but no one makes such baseless assertions such as Tarun Gogoi. There is not one iota of truth in what he had said,” Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass told HT. On Saturday, Tarun Gogoi (85), who was Assam CM from 2001 to 2016, told mediapersons in Guwahati that the former CJI, who took oath as a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha (RS) in March, could be the BJP’s CM face in the assembly polls. “I have heard from my sources that Ranjan Gogoi’s name is in the list of BJP’s probable CM candidates. I suspect he might be projected as the CM by the party in the next assembly polls,” Tarun Gogoi said. Also read: Will fight Bihar polls under Nitish Kumar’s leadership - BJP chief JP Nadda“The BJP is happy with Ranjan Gogoi for the Ram Mandir verdict and, as a result, he was nominated as a RS MP after his retirement as the CJI. (Ranjan) Gogoi could have refused to be a RS MP, but his acceptance shows he is interested in active politics,” he added. Ranjan Gogoi was the CJI when the Supreme Court, last November, awarded the disputed land in Ayodhya to Hindu parties, clearing the decks for a Ram Temple there and settling a 135-year-old legal dispute.Tarun Gogoi, who represents the Titabar seat in Assam assembly, said that he would contest next year’s elections, but would not be the Congress’s prospective CM candidate. On Saturday, the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) came together to form an alliance against the ruling BJP for the 2021 polls. “There’s nothing to comment on Tarun Gogoi’s utterances. He seems to know more about our party than those who are in it,” said Rupam Goswami, chief spokesperson, BJP’s Assam unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ranjan-gogoi-as-cm-face-assam-bjp-rejects-claim/story-NKcy9gqPmcXweZempCHcdM.html

For the past few days, Covid-19 cases in Dharavi are emerging in single digits daily, with a few exceptions. On Saturday, five new cases were detected in Dharavi while on Friday, three fresh cases were reported.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi said, “The BMC is watching these four slum pockets because they are very densely populated. We have very few cases from random areas now. Mostly migrated labour who have returned or medical staff that are turning positive now. But these four localities could spiral out of control very easily so our interventions continue.”These four slum pockets are among 13 high-risk zones that were identified by the civic body for focused interventions in April and May when the number of cases in Dharavi peaked.Also read: BMC advises home immersion of Ganesh idols, processions bannedInterventions in these high-risk zones have included door-to-door surveys and screening of a maximum number of residents to identify those at high risk if exposed to the virus (such as people with co-morbidity, senior citizens, and those with low oxygen saturation in their bodies), and early detection of Covid-19 positive patients to isolate them from the community. So far, Dharavi’s average doubling rate has touched 406 days, as opposed to 300 days in July, 108 days in June, 43 days in May, and 18 days in April. The average growth rate of cases in Dharavi is 0.24 percent, as opposed to 0.39 percent in July, 0.83 percent in June, and 4.3 percent in May, and 12 percent in April. Till August 19, a total of 116 new cases were reported in Dharavi as opposed to 358 cases in July. Its peak was in May when a total of 1,216 cases were reported which dropped to 480 cases in June. The recovery rate in Dharavi at present is 87 percent, higher than Mumbai’s recovery rate of 80.79 percent.On Thursday, Dharavi witnessed a sudden spike in its trend of reporting single-digit cases when 17 new cases were reported in a single day. Kiran Dighavkar said, “A few nurses from Dharavi working at KEM and Sion hospital tested positive. The hospital organised tests for their family members some of whom tested positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-four-densely-populated-pockets-in-dharavi-continue-on-bmc-watchlist/story-crFpRZVMveJbHuNcv9SxBK.html

You all (BJP workers) are going to be an ambassador of change. For this we have to contest at each and every booth to win and add value not only for BJP contestants but also for alliance partners,” the BJP president told party workers during the virtual meeting.Pointing towards the challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic, Nadda asked party workers to take all precautions of physical and social distancing and resort to small door to door campaigning, which he said was the best form given the trying times.“Touch all sections of the society, all age groups of people and tell them about the work done by the Centre and state,” he added.The senior leader also slammed the opposition in Bihar as well as other states saying, “they have become a spent force.”He also renewed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pitch for self-reliance. “In Bihar, we have to take forward the Makhana industry, Madhubani painting, and Bhagalpur’s Silk industry in a push for PM Modi’s local for vocal initiative,” he said.“Litchi of Muzaffarpur, honey of Madhubani, we all have to pursue a self-reliant India,” he added.Nadda also lauded Bihar’s Covid-19 recovery rate that stands at 73.48% and congratulated the state government for conducting one lakh tests and 10 crore door to door screenings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-jd-u-and-ljp-to-fight-bihar-polls-together-says-jp-nadda/story-OygVIs85lXCS1MDpzSffNN.html

My request to the Centre is to cancel both these exams immediately and make an alternative arrangement for admission this year. In this time of unprecedented crisis, an unprecedented step will lead to a solution,” Sisodia tweeted.The National Testing Agency (NTA) has announced that JEE-Main will be held from September 1 to 6 and NEET for undergraduate courses on September 13.There has been no official word from the education ministry on postponement of these exams. A person aware of the developments, however, said there was no such decision at the moment. The reluctance to defer the exam is centered around the government’s view that it would be difficult to get the 2020-21 academic year moving without the exam.On August 17, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking the postponement of the NEET and JEE scheduled to be held in September 2020. The decision came on a petition filed on August 7 by 11 JEE/NEET aspirants seeking postponement of the exams in view of Covid-19 pandemic.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra said “life has to go on” despite the outbreak of the viral disease and the court cannot put the career of students in jeopardy by interfering with the decision of the NTA to hold the examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-should-listen-to-students-mann-ki-baat-rahul-gandhi-on-postponement-of-jee-neet/story-o1Z4OEsyASIvVB6WhMwevM.html

Police said Khan had planned a “lone wolf” terror strike in a high footfall area in the Capital “using a high-intensity pressure cooker-based improvised explosive device (IED)”.The police team had reached Balrampur on Saturday with Khan, who was arrested from Ridge Road area in central Delhi following a brief exchange of fire on Friday night. Police said they had recovered two pressure cooker IEDs weighing around 15kg, a.30 bore pistol and four cartridges that Khan was carrying in a bag. Khan was on a white TVS Apache motorcycle at the time of his arrest.Pramod Kushwaha, deputy commissioner of police (Special Cell), said that they had been tracking the contacts of the IS operative for the past one year. Kushwaha said Khan was in direct touch with the commanders of Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan through social media platforms.“He was connected with ISIS for the last many years and was directly in touch with ISIS commanders. He was handled by Yusuf Alhindi, who was killed in Syria later. After that, Abu Huzafa, a Pakistani, was handling him,” he said during a press briefing. His next handler instructed him to operate as a lone wolf operative from India,” the senior official had said.In a press statement, police said Khan’s interrogation has revealed that his original plan was to carry out the IED blasts during the Independence Day celebrations on August 15. “However, because of the heavy security arrangements, Khan could not enter the city and had to drop the terror strike plan, Kushwaha said.He said Khan confessed to the police that he tested the explosive device at his village a few months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explosives-seized-from-suspected-isis-operative-s-house-in-up-report/story-2wdZgwemtthqfMXDCRttaJ.html

Delhi received a spell of ‘heavy’ to ‘very heavy’ rainfall on August 20-21. “As per the forecast received from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the week, it is expected that air quality will remain in the ‘satisfactory’ category and may even improve to ‘good’. The continuous spell of showers has washed out the pollutants in the air. Since August 20, the air quality index (AQI) has been below 60 in the ‘satisfactory’ zone, which is a good sign,” said a senior CPCB official. At 8 am on Sunday, Delhi’s AQI was 51, as per CPCB data. On Saturday, the 24-hour average AQI was 56, while on Friday it was 57. On Thursday (August 20), the city experienced a ‘Good’ air day with an AQI reading of 50. This was the second ‘good’ air day in the month of August and third for this year so far. Also read: Cong opposes South Delhi civic body’s tax movePreviously, on August 13, after heavy rainfall, Delhi’s AQI was recorded ‘50’, in the ‘good’ zone.

The first was recorded on March 28 with an AQI reading of 45, during the first week of the Covid-19 induced lockdown. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’ with no health impact. A reading of ‘51-100’ is considered ‘satisfactory’, which means it may have a minimal impact on health of sensitive people such as those having chronic breathing difficulties. Scientists at the IMD said that with another week of rain forecast, this August is likely to become among the wettest compared to at least the last five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-quality-to-be-satisfactory-this-week-due-to-showers-officials/story-LhuNpiCUay1OUWy987yg4O.html
23-08-2020||India||Villagers dependent on Loktak Lake narrate woes owing to Covid-19, seek govt help||The coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the virus have shown the devastating impact on the locals of Champu Khangpok village who are dependent on fishing from the famous Loktak Lake for their livelihood.Loktak in Manipur is the largest freshwater lake in the north-eastern region of the country and is famed for its ‘phumdis’ or floating islands. The lake provides the livelihood for close to 30,000 people, and these floating islands are permanent homes of several fishing communities who have been conserving this unique wetland ecosystem.The floating islands are a thick heterogeneous mass of vegetation, soil, and organic matter that looks like small lush green islands. On the Phumdis, the fishing community builds small thatched huts to live in.About 240 fishing families from the Champu Khangpok village too are amongst those who were dependent on the lake. However, the lockdown affected them greatly since they were stuck inside the lake on the floating islands and could neither sell their catch nor buy essentials as they used to do earlier due to the closing down of the nearby markets.To ensure their survival during the scarcity of essentials like rice and pulses, some of the villagers had started depending on available vegetables alone for their daily meals. The fishing families, who have no other source of livelihood, have now made an appeal to the government to pave a way to designate the opening of two docks at Ningthoukhong and Yangoi Karang, twice a week so that they can sell their catch and procure their daily needs from the markets.Nabachandra Oinam, a villager told ANI, “Most of us are fishermen and we are not able to sell fish in neighbouring markets due to restrictions. We are facing a lot of trouble due to this. The government should pay heed to our woes.”The woes, however, do not end here as the education of children has also been impacted in this phase, due to the lack of smartphones to access the online classes. The first floating school in the north-east has however filled that gap to some extent as it continues to provide education to the children of the community even during the crisis phase.Ningthoujam Ongbi Thasana Devi, another local, however, said that the government should pay heed to these difficulties, as buying a smartphone for education would be the last thought on mind of those who have been struggling to survive each day.Meanwhile, the villagers also raised the issue of rising pollution in the Loktak lake. Several small rivers and streams of the valley and hills in the state find their way into the lake which is spread over an area of 26,000 hectares.This leads to waste materials from all areas pouring into the lake thereby posing a threat to the ecosystem of the freshwater lake.

23-08-2020||India||Delhi jeweller fakes robbery to escape repaying bank loans||To escape paying the EMIs on loans he had taken for his gold jewellery business, a man got his friend to wear a burqa and use a toy gun to carry out a fake robbery of gold worth Rs 61 lakh from his shop in Central Delhi’s Chandni Mahal on Friday night, the police said on Sunday. While the “robbery” itself was carried out convincingly -- the jeweller got himself thrashed and bound up with rope -- the police scrutinized CCTV footage to determine that he had allowed a friendly entry to the robber and that it was eventually a fake robbery, said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central district). The police have arrested three men -- the jeweller Abhijeet Samanta, and his friends property dealer Farhan and mechanic Munna. While Farhan allegedly arranged the burqa and the toy gun, Munna was the man who carried out the fake robbery. The DCP said that 40-year-old Samanta had a jewellery making shop and he would supply readymade gold jewellery to showrooms in Central Delhi. “Between 2017 and 2018, he had taken loans of a total of Rs 61 lakh from three banks to enhance his business. But his business never took off the way he had hoped,” said the DCP. It turned worse during the lockdown as he got no business and the banks were pressuring him to pay the equated monthly installments (EMIs) for the loans. “Samanta thought that if he could show that his gold stock was robbed, he could avoid having to pay the loan. So, he roped in his two friends,” said the DCP. While he asked Farhan to arrange the toy gun and a burqa, he tasked Munna with the fake robbery, the officer said. As per the plan, Samanta had returned to his shop after collecting a payment of Rs 50,000 from a jeweller around 8.30 pm on Friday. “Soon after he entered his shop, Munna wearing a burqa followed him, placed the gun on his forehead, beat him up and robbed the cash from him. Samanta then allowed himself to be tied up with a rope and then pretended that he was forced to hand over the keys to the lockers. Munna picked up a 1.6 kilo of gold and another one kilo gold brick and fled,” said the DCP. On receiving a call soon after the fake robbery, the police began checking the CCTV footage inside and outside the shop. “Samanta and Munna had done well to make it appear like a real robbery, but the shopkeeper leaving the door open behind him aroused our suspicion. So, we began observing the footage more keenly and found Samanta’s overall behavior during the robbery quite fishy,” said the DCP. Police said that they questioned Samanta for six hours on Saturday following which he broke down and revealed his plan.The police have recovered all the gold, the burqa and the toy pistol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-jeweller-fakes-robbery-to-escape-repaying-bank-loans/story-Mta3aQR1TGzoZiir8Iaq4I.html

23-08-2020||India||Bengal govt fixes bed charge for Covid patients, seeks 10% discount on medicines||Flooded by complaints of exorbitant rates being charged from Covid-19 patients by private hospitals, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission on Saturday issued an advisory, saying bed charges have to be kept at what they used to be on March 1. The commission also said that hospitals have to offer a 10 per cent discount on the price of medicines or else allow the patients’ families to provide it. A three-member committee would review the need for pathological tests, the 12-member commission said after a meeting. The commission further said that no Covid-19 patient can be denied admission. This is the 11th advisory to private hospitals, amid allegations of inflated billing and unnecessary pathological tests.“I have been assured cooperation by the highest quarters of the state government in this exercise,” the commission’s chairman and retired Calcutta high court judge Ashim Kumar Bandopadhyay told a television channel on Saturday evening. The private hospitals said on Saturday night bed charges were not increased after the pandemic began. Rupak Barua, president, Association of Hospitals of Eastern India and group CEO of Kolkata-based AMRI Hospitals said, “Private hospitals review their rates at the end of every financial year and, after factoring in inflation, rates are revised by an average of no more than 5-10%. This comes into effect from April 1 every year. The same was done this year too and bed rates were not increased for Covid treatment.” “In regard to the other advisories, we have requested the commission for some time to discuss internally and also to share some more clarity. As for incidents of over-billing are concerned, those should be treated as stray incidents and not standard practice. We have let the government know that private hospitals are there to support the state’s fight against the pandemic and we are always at the service of the people,” said Barua. On August 8, the commission said in an advisory that no hospital can charge more than Rs 50,000 as advance deposit during admission and patients’ families have to be given 12 hours to get the money. The commission said that sanction from patients’ families have to be taken for pathological tests if these cost more than Rs 2000 and necessity of the tests have to be explained to the families in advance. The commission, however, added that if a test is considered urgent then it could be conducted but the attending doctor would bear the responsibility. On August 2, the commission said that most hospitals were charging patients for the most expensive antibiotics, antifungals, analgesics and other drugs although these are available in different price ranges. The commission said, “Patients’ relatives shall be offered to choose which brand they would like to purchase.” The commission said that high-end antibiotics such as “Meropenem” used in critical care management are available under different brands with different prices and hospitals must keep adequate stock of at least three or four brands. Unless a doctor specifically prescribes a particular brand the pharmacy must supply “Meropenem” having the lowest price tag, the commission had said on August 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-fixes-bed-charge-for-covid-patients-seeks-10-discount-on-medicines/story-8FQkZjZYB8EMQajRTVfm2O.html

Singh was questioned for the third time this morning. The CBI will also question the key maker who opened Rajput’s room on June 14 when he was found dead. Pithani and Singh’s questioning comes a day after a team of CBI officials and forensic experts visited Rajput’s Bandra home and reconstructed the sequence of events before he was found dead.Pithani and Singh, who were present at the flat when Rajput was found dead, had also accompanied the CBI team that spent over five hours at the actor’s residence, people familiar with the development said.The officials first went to the building’s terrace and then to the flat. They shot pictures and videos of the bedroom. An official quoted above said that the CBI was investigating whether suicide was possible at the spot.Also read: Sushant Singh Rajput’s housekeeper reveals what happened on night Rhea Chakraborty left actor’s homeEarlier in the day, CBI officials also met doctors at the Cooper Hospital who conducted Rajput’s autopsy.Meanwhile, Neeraj Kumar Singh Bablu, a BJP legislator and Rajput’s cousin, said Pithani and the actor’s colleague Sandeep should “definitely” be arrested and interrogated by the CBI.“CBI investigation is going in the right direction. We are hopeful that the guilty will be caught. Sidharth Pithani should be definitely arrested. When we went for the last rites of Sushant, we saw that there was no sadness apparent on Pithani’s face. I am suspicious of his activities. He used to be a colleague of Sushant,” Bablu said.“Another colleague of Sushant, Sandeep also started giving clean chits to people on the media just ten days after my cousin’s death. He was acting like a gangster. I have confidence that CBI will investigate and come to a result in this case. My belief is that third degree is important to get the truth out in this case,” he added.The central agency that took over the probe into the high-profile case on orders of the Supreme Court has so far recorded statements of Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda apart from his roommate and cook.They have also collected documents from Mumbai police including forensic report, post mortem report, statements of more than 60 people that Mumbai police has recorded in the case, and other material evidence, a police official said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-calls-sushant-singh-rajput-s-friend-siddharth-pithani-cook-for-questioning/story-2sNqwKq5D3sCbnhLyQeUNK.html

The patients need not necessarily be the ones who were already undergoing treatment in the hospital,” added the health secretary.As per the guidelines, the hospitals should be registered under the Clinical Establishment Act 2010, have a separate Covid-19 ward with separate entry and exit doors, 24x7 emergency and ICU facilities with specialists on-call. The hospitals should have a 24x7 pharmacy facility and oxygen supply with every bed at the isolation ward.There should be a dedicated Covid-19 ambulance with the hospital and the authorities should ensure proper protective equipment (PPE) for all doctors treating the Covid-19 patients.

Every year on the first day, over 35,000 idols are immersed in the city. In 2019, over 46,000 idols were immersed on the first day.The BMC has uploaded a list of natural and artificial ponds on its website http://stopcoronavirus.mcgm.gov.in/ganesh-visarjan-locations. In case of 70 natural immersion spots that also includes sea, only those citizens or devotees residing within 2 km radius of these spots are allowed to immerse their idols there by handing them over to the BMC. The citizens or devotees shall not be allowed to enter the sea water or water of natural spots to immerse the idols themselves under any circumstances, the BMC said in an advisory.“Devotees who are celebrating Ganesh festival in their homes are advised to carry out idol immersion of the Ganesh idols at their homes in a bucket or a drum as their first preference,” the advisory also said.The BMC has also asked mandals and those celebrating from home and residing in containment zones or sealed buildings to either defer immersion for next year or make arrangements on their own using buckets or drums.The advisory issued by BMC in this context reads, “The Ganeshotsav Mandals as well as citizens situated in Containment Zones shall immerse their Ganesh idols by creating necessary arrangements in the mandap /pandal and their homes itself . Alternatively they can defer the immersion of the idols to the next year. Devotees who are staying in sealed buildings shall mandatorily immerse their Ganesh idols in their homes itself (in bucket/ small drums) or postpone the immersion to the next year.”Further, the BMC has said that devotees shall perform pooja and aarti in their homes itself and then hand over the idols to the BMC because these will not be permitted at the immersion spots. Those taking part in immersion will have to use masks, sanitizers and follow necessary social distancing, added the BMC.Meanwhile, as a special arrangement, BMC this year has created the mobile immersion spots on wheels by making necessary arrangements by fitting suitable water tanks in trucks.

Scindia was addressing a gathering at Phoolbagh Maidan in Gwalior, his home turf, on the occasion of the launch of the party’s 3-day membership campaign in Gwalior-Chambal region on Saturday.The state is supposed to witness the bypolls by mid-October to 27 assembly constituencies 16 of which lie in Gwalior-Chambal region. As the BJP leaders claimed on Saturday, as many as 5,000 Congress workers and office-bearers joined the BJP in presence of Scindia, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, state BJP president VD Sharma and state home minister Narottam Mishra.Scindia said, “Kamal Nath ji was ahead of Modi ji in imposing lockdown restrictions that he did 15 months prior to what Modi ji did. But whereas Modi ji imposed the lockdown restrictions on the country to save lives of people from coronavirus, Kamal Nath ji imposed it on common man’s entry to the state secretariat Vallabh Bhavan.”He said people had voted the Congress to power in 2018 assembly elections with a lot of expectations that they would see an honest and transparent government and that it would fulfil their aspirations but there was rampant corruption in the government.

Scindia said, “I raised my voice for public and withdrew my support to the government to serve people of the state.” Addressing the gathering, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “When Scindia ji raised his voice for people, then chief minister Kamal Nath asked him to take to streets.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities have forecast extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 centimetres (cm), in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat on Sunday and Monday. There is a well-marked low-pressure area lying over northwest Madhya Pradesh (MP). It is very likely to move westwards across Rajasthan during the next 24 hours, IMD said in its Sunday bulletin. Central Water Commission (CWC) has warned that there is a high risk of flash floods in some areas of western MP, parts of eastern and western Rajasthan and Gujarat on Sunday. The monsoon trough is active and south of its normal position (from Ganganagar to the Bay of Bengal). It is likely to remain active during the next two-three days. Due to these favourable conditions, IMD is expecting extremely heavy rain over Rajasthan and Gujarat; heavy to very heavy rain over ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan during the next two-three days. Another low-pressure area is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal on Monday; rainfall activity is likely to increase over east and adjoining central India from Monday again. Also read: Delhi air quality to be ‘satisfactory’ this week due to showersLow-pressure areas are the main rain-bearing systems during monsoon months in the core monsoon zone that includes large parts of central and eastern India. Heavy to extremely heavy rain is very likely over Odisha between Monday and Wednesday, and very heavy rainfall over Gangetic West Bengal on Tuesday and Wednesday and over Jharkhand on Wednesday. IMD has also forecast moderate thunderstorms with lightning in some places over southern Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, Gangetic West Bengal and Jharkhand during the next 24 hours.

The continuous spell of showers has washed out the pollutants in the air. Since August 20, the air quality index (AQI) has been below 60 in the ‘satisfactory’ zone, which is a good sign,” said a senior CPCB official. At 8 am on Sunday, Delhi’s AQI was 51, as per CPCB data. On Saturday, the 24-hour average AQI was 56 while on Friday it was 57. On Thursday (August 20), the city experienced a ‘Good’ air day with an AQI reading of 50. This was the second ‘good’ air day in the month of August and third for this year so far. Previously, on August 13, Delhi’s AQI was recorded ‘50’ in the ‘good’ zone after heavy rainfall. The first ‘Good’ air day was recorded on March 28 with an AQI reading of 45, during the first week of the Covid-19 induced lockdown. An AQI reading between 0-50 is considered ‘good’ with no health impact. On a scale of 51-100 is considered ‘satisfactory’, which means it may have a minimal impact on the health of sensitive people such as those having chronic breathing difficulties. Scientists at the IMD said that with another week of rain forecast, this August is likely to become among the wettest in the last five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-to-keep-delhi-s-air-quality-in-check-in-wettest-august-in-5-years/story-EdyqwcyQnJF7siP91Ki5TM.html

23-08-2020||India||Bihar govt in overdrive to implement statute change for appointment of asst professors||With the Election Commission likely to announce the Bihar assembly election early September, the state government has moved fast to carry out changes in the statute for appointment of assistant professors in universities through the Bihar state university service commission (BSUSC) before the model code of conduct for polls come into force.The action comes after chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Independence Day address in which he specifically mentioned that the statute would be modified to bolster prospects of candidates from Bihar.Kumar had referred to the government’s move to amend the statute, which was notified by the Raj Bhawan on August 10, following concerns expressed by academicians that certain clauses in it would work against the interest of candidates from Bihar.The very next day after the CM’s statement, the statute was referred to the BSUSC to work out the changes and after that it was sent to the department of education. It has now reached the Raj Bhawan for its final approval and fresh notification.A vice chancellor, who did not want to be quoted, said the Raj Bhawan has sent the revised draft statute to all the VCs for their opinion. “Once that is received within a few days, a fresh notification will be issued. With the commission and the state government having already incorporated the required changes, then the same line will be adopted,” he added.According to highly places sources in the BSUSC, the doctorates from the Bihar universities would no more be rendered ineligible for not conforming to the 2009 Ph.D regulations of the University Grants Commission (UGC), as it would now be made effective from the date of notification in the concerned universities. Earlier, it was from the date of UGC notification.The commission took into cognisance the fact that while the 2009 UGC regulations was notified in Bihar in 2012, it could only be effectively implemented in the Bihar universities 2014 onwards. “Now, the doctorates from Bihar universities will get exemption from the National Eligibility Test (NET) or state-level eligibility test (SLET) up to 2016 depending on the date of implementation of UGC regulation. Some other states also did the same to ensure that the candidates did not have to suffer due to delay in implementation,” said BSUSC chairman Rajvardhan Azad.Even for those having done Ph.D from Bihar universities prior to the 2009 UGC notification, the commission has adopted flexibility to give them some exemption if they conformed to six of the 11 points laid down by the UGC for institutions awarding Ph.D.Another change incorporated in the statute is that seven point weightage to M.Phil has been done away with, as none of the Bihar universities award M.Phil. Some more changes have been introduced on the requirement of certain levels of research papers published in international journals.In the statute, the marking scheme in career had omitted Matric and Intermediate marks which were included in the criteria till last appointment in 2017 in line with the UGC requirement of “good Academic Record”. Some experts also suggested that the bracketing of marks obtained by candidates be done on a smaller scale for awarding additional marks. At present, 60-80 % has been kept in one bracket. Some groups of students have also written to the CM and the Raj Bhawan for more weightage to NET scholars as just 5 marks to them will deny young NET qualified genuine candidates.Over 5,000 vacancies for assistant professors are likely to be advertised In the state, which has its universities functioning at less than 40% of the sanctioned strength. The universities will furnish the vacancy details to the commission in accordance with the reservation roster.Before this, it was on March 19, 2013 that the state cabinet had cleared the proposal for recruitment of 3,364 assistant professors through the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) in the seriously understaffed state universities. The target was to complete the process before the start of the 2014-15 academic session but it stretched till 2020. Before that the appointments were made in 2003 on the basis of a 1997 advertisement in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-govt-in-overdrive-to-implement-statute-change-for-appointment-of-asst-professors/story-ak6v8wC2VAB4EbbacpQOIM.html

In a circular issued on Saturday, the education department stated that students who have registered on the portal and applied for FYJC admissions but failed to validate the one-time password (OTP) to confirm their seat will be given time until August 25 to update their status. As per the schedule, the entire process for quota admissions was supposed to end by August 22. “If a student does not get an OTP due to a technical reason, he/she should not be denied admission solely for this. Time will be given until August 25 to update it,” the circular stated.

While admissions to various quotas like minority, management and in-house, have to be done at the college level, the education department has been facilitating them and helping to make them zero-contact. As part of this, students get an OTP on their registered mobile numbers which colleges have feed in the online database to confirm a seat. With the OTP being time-bound, it was a struggle for colleges and students to complete the process. The department, however, said that the time limit on entering the OTP has been removed. While colleges said that they have managed to complete most quota admissions that were allotted to them, some seats are not confirmed due to the OTP trouble. “Students had not received OTPs in time and in some cases they couldn’t be contacted easily. We hope we can complete the process for them now with this new concession,” said an official handling admissions at a college in the western suburbs.The office of the deputy director will release the first general merit list of all students for them to be able to verify and rectify any errors if needed. Until Saturday, 2.25 lakh students had filled their college preferences. The first general merit list will be declared on August 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-year-junior-college-aspirants-in-maharashtra-get-concession-in-admission-process/story-24NN9FhvS71Q4w5BRZkePN.html

But just weeks after her marriage, Sabitri started pestering Kulamani for staying away from the family. Kulamani, who worked as a mason, ignored her demand. After the birth of their daughter last year, Sabitri kept on pressuring her husband to take up separate accommodation for them which led to frequent quarrels.On Friday morning, when Kulamani and other family members had gone to their farmland Sabitri allegedly strangled her daughter.“When Kulamani and others returned home at noon only they found Sabitri sobbing with her daughter lying close to her. She confessed to her crime. When she attempted to end her life by slitting her wrist, the family members rescued her and informed the police.

23-08-2020||India||Demanding change in leadership and complete rehaul, top Congress leaders write to Sonia Gandhi||At least 23 senior leaders wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, asking for a complete rehaul of the organisation, The Indian Express reported on Sunday. It said the writers of the letter include former chief ministers such as Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, former ministers Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor, and younger leaders such as Milind Deora and Jitin Prasada.HT had earlier reported that the letter was delivered to Gandhi on the Independence Day. The Express reported that the letter called for a “full time and effective leadership’’ which is both “visible’’ and “active’’. It said that the leaders, in the letter, pressed for an “urgent establishment of an institutional leadership mechanism” to “collectively guide the party’s revival’’.Former Rajya Sabha leader PJ Kurien confirmed the letter to HT. “I can’t tell you the details but I can only tell you that I signed it. The letter will be made available after the CWC meeting tomorrow,” he told HT. Also read: CWC crucial meet tomorrow, convincing Rahul Gandhi to return as party president on agendaThe letter now sets the stage for a stormy session of the Congress Working Committee on Monday. When former party spokesperson Sanjay Jha spoke of such a letter recently, the party’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, took to Twitter to rebut Jha, whose claim created a buzz in the Congress circles. He called it a ploy by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to divert attention from other issues.“Special Misinformation Group on Media-TV Debate Guidance in its Whatsapp of today directed to run the story of a non-existent letter of Congress leaders to divert attention from Facebook-BJP links. Of course, BJP stooges have started acting upon it,” Surjewala had tweeted.The letter, Express reported, didn’t name former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi but said that the uncertainty over the leadership demoralises the workers and has weakened the party.  Around 300 Congress leaders from all over the country, representing all regions and states are signatories to the letter, over and above the 23 seniors already in the public domain. Their names remain undisclosed as that would distract from the core message of the letter itself.“It is estimated that around 100 Congress leaders (including MP’s), distressed at the state of affairs within the party, have written a letter to Mrs Sonia Gandhi, Congress President, asking for a change in political leadership and transparent elections in the CWC. Watch this space,” Jha had tweeted.Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor took to Twitter on Sunday and posted a cryptic tweet on loss of hope and lack of “passion and urge”. Tharoor posted a quote by former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.  'Without passion and urge, there is a gradual oozing out of hope and vitality, a settling down on lower levels of existence, a slow merging into non-existence. We have become prisoners of the past and some part of its immobility sticks to us'. ~ Jawaharlal Nehru“Without passion and urge, there is a gradual oozing out of hope and vitality, a settling down on lower levels of existence, a slow merging into non-existence.

23-08-2020||India||Middlemen make money as workers from Bihar return to other states||Earlier this week, Dharmanand Das, 45, resident of Jokihat in Bihar’s Araria left for Punjab with a resolve to earn enough for his daughter’s marriage.“Here you can’t get a job, only assurances,” he said. “Even though we pay twice the fare to transporters carrying us to Punjab and Rajasthan, we are hopeful that we will earn more there.”Afroz Alam (40), of Kamaldaha village in Araria has a similar story. He too plans to get his daughter married with the money he would earn in Rajasthan. “I waited here for over two months but was unable to get any meaningful employment so I decided to leave for Rajasthan,” he said.Over 100 buses, each carrying 50-60 migrant labourers, have left from Araria for Punjab and Rajasthan in the last month.But the promised job and transportation comes with a price. “We have to give a fixed share of our daily income to the contractor (middleman) who is arranging jobs for us. Earlier also we used to pay a part of our income,” said Das.However, what is new this time is that during the initial days of lockdown, when employers from different states were providing free tickets to migrants, now those willing to go back have to cough extra money for tickets to these middlemen.Most of the people, who left from Araria, alleged that they have to pay Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 for a seat in the bus while earlier it was just Rs 1,500. “Earlier the bus charged a maximum of Rs 1,500 but after lockdown the same bus charges Rs 3,000 for a seat), Narayan Sada, of Dabhrha village under Araria sadar block said.“After lockdown we are charged by two agents - one transporters’ agent for a seat and the other by contractors of labourers for a job” Mangan Rishi, 40, of Palasi lamented.Reports from various corners of Seemanchal comprising four districts -Purnia, Kishanganj, Katihar and Araria - suggest that over 10,000 to 12,000 labourers have already left for Punjab and Rajasthan. A bus charges Rs 1, 50,000 for a trip and about 2 lakh is collected from migrant labourers.“contractors of the labourers pay for those who can’t pay, and later the money was collected from them in their work place,” Das alleged.Labourers also alleged that the work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme has sunk into corruption depriving them of their wages. “Everybody knows about the corruption but nobody comes forward to check it,” they said alleging “The work is done by JCB machines and wages sent to accounts of the labourers having labour cards and later they have to return the money to the contractors.”Kursakanta block development officer (BDO) Madhu Kumari denied there was corruption in providing jobs to labourers.“We are providing jobs to workers under various schemes under PM Garib Kalyan Yojna,” she said.She, however, added that the administration couldn’t stop anyone from going to other provinces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/middlemen-make-money-as-workers-from-bihar-return-to-other-states/story-ec7mIfteBIfB9vE5mjoxWJ.html
23-08-2020||India||Mask it: Makeup junkies say it with a trend||Makeup has almost always been a trendsetting artistic expression for many social causes. From the rainbow hued eyeshadows that support the Pride of LGBTQI+ to the animal prints that have many a times helped raise awareness against animal cruelty, there are examples aplenty to prove how crucial makeup artistry has been, since forever! And the newest trend is mask makeup, wherein makeup artists are drawing masks on their faces to encourage the masses to wear face masks in the Covid-19 era. “I was the first makeup artist to kick-start this trend of mask makeup in India,” claims Manjeet Khehra, a Bengaluru-based makeup artist and beauty expert. She adds that the reason behind her painting her face with a mask was to “salute everyone across the world, who have had to choicelessly wear masks to help fight this horrible virus, and to encourage more and more people to wear face masks, to respect the efforts of Covid-19 warriors.”Talking about how a makeup trend can act as a useful means to raise awareness, Khehra says, “The mask makeup trend is definitely one that can make an uncomfortable mask look trendy, and hence encourage people to wear it. Masks are in, masks are cool!” Among those who have taken a liking to this trend, since it has gone viral, is Divya Sharma. A Chhattisgarh-based makeup artist and vlogger, Sharma says, “I like this trend because it motivates people to wear masks, which is anyway a plus point. And not only that, mask is soon becoming a fashion statement, and it’s fun recreating and designing new mask patterns on the face!”And to add to this, “many youngsters take to social media to check out online tutorials and seek their next inspiration for #igotuplikethis look,” says Shivani Mehra, a makeup artists and beauty blogger, adding, “As a content creator, I feel like it’s our responsibility to stimulate good habits like wearing masks in public places! Taking up mask makeup challenge was fun, and I felt I’m able to help raise awareness for what the world is fighting. I believe I made a positive difference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mask-it-makeup-junkies-say-it-with-a-trend/story-98XRSpHwlFaPR090GULEpM.html

There were 2.97 million infections until Saturday morning, health ministry data showed. It has a relatively low case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.9%, compared to the world average of 3.5%, but that may be due to underreporting. CFR is the proportion of incident patients dying because of the disease or injury in a certain time window, which in India is lower than in several western countries. Case fatality rates are about 3% in the US and Brazil.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-more-than-900-deaths-daily-india-reports-over-5-800-covid-19-deaths-in-a-week/story-20r9ry2v9RdvMZgzxuocwI.html

As soon as the report is submitted, appropriate decisions will be taken about the age of marriage of daughters,” he said.The PM was likely referring to a task force set up by a central government notification issued on June 4. The terms of reference of the task force require it to examine the correlation of health indicators such as infant and maternal mortality rates and nutrition with the age of marriage and motherhood. It has also been asked to suggest measures for promoting higher education among women. An HT analysis shows that motherhood increases the chances of nutrition-related deficiencies. However, marriage also has a deeper cultural and economic impact on the lives of women. The norms of marriage seem to matter more than the legal age of marriage for these effects. Marriage restricts women from seeking skilled employment and education way beyond the minimum age of marriage, and also affects their mobility. The minimum age of marriage for men and women in India is 21 and 18 years, respectively. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2015-16, 58.8% of 20-49-year-old women were married by the age of 20, below the minimum age of marriage for men. The survey also shows that motherhood has an impact on the nutritional status of women. Fifty-eight percent breastfeeding women and 50% pregnant women were anaemic compared to 52% women who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. This suggests that while nutritional status improves slightly during pregnancy, it actually becomes worse during childcare. Also read: ‘1 in every 5 girls in UP is a child bride’However, malnutrition among Indian women is generally high. In the reproductive age group (15-49 years), 22.9% of Indian women are underweight (those with body mass index less than 18.5) compared to 20.2% men; and 53.1% women are anaemic compared to 22.7% men. Indian women are also worse off than their peers globally. According to the 2020 ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World’ report of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released earlier this year, the share of reproductive age women in India who were anaemic was 51.4% in 2016. The share was 39.9% for Bangladesh, 48.7% for Southern Asia (including India), and 43% for lower-middle-income countries (including India). According to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in countries across the world, the share of women who are underweight is also higher in India and decreasing slowly. In 1998-99, the share of such women was 36.3% in India, much lower than in Bangladesh at the time (45.4%). This share dropped to 18.6% in Bangladesh in 2014, but was at 22.9% in India in 2015-16.These statistics highlight the urgent need for addressing women’s nutrition in India. The focus of such an effort has to be on younger women, as they suffer more from malnutrition. The share of anaemic women was 54.1% among 15-19 year old women and about a percentage point lower in each subsequent 10-year age group, according to the latest NFHS. The share of underweight women was 41.9% in the 15-19 age group and 25% or lower in the subsequent 10-year age groups. Addressing malnutrition among women will need the government to spend money, as it is the poorest women who suffer the most from malnutrition. Women from the bottom 20% households were three times as likely to be underweight as those from the top 20% and 1.2 times more likely to be anaemic, according to the latest NFHS. However, budgetary allocation under the biggest nutrition scheme of the government – the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) – whose beneficiaries are children in the 0-6 age group, pregnant, and lactating women has been falling as a share of total budget expenditure. The amount of expenditure under the Anganwadi Scheme (or core ICDS) has also declined in real terms compared to 2014-15. In 2019-20; the real expenditure under the scheme was 86% of the amount in 2014-15. Some of this gap has been filled by more money being pumped into a maternity benefit programme from 2017-18. However, accounting for this too only brings the 2019-20 real expenditure under nutrition-related schemes of the umbrella ICDS to the 2014-15 levels. The real expenditure under these schemes for 2020-21 cannot be calculated because annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for this fiscal year will be available only at the end of it.   The minimum age of marriage may have an impact on women to the extent that motherhood affects their nutritional status. The task force’s findings on this aspect will be useful. However, marriage also has an adverse cultural and economic impact on the lives of women that has little to do with the minimum age of marriage. For instance, contrary to popular belief, in the 15-17 and 18-20 age groups, married women are more likely to participate in the labour force -- number of people who are either working or looking for work -- than unmarried women, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted in 2018-19. It is in the older age groups that unmarried women are more likely than married women to participate in the labour force. To be sure, this doesn’t mean that it is good for younger women to be married just because marriage is positively correlated with labour force participation in those age groups. Experts say that participating in the labour force at an early age implies that the work is going to be of unskilled or semi-skilled nature. It is possibly because married women primarily do unskilled and semi-skilled work that the labour force participation rate (LFPR) is higher among married women in younger age groups. These statistics, therefore, highlight a more urgent need to address the norms surrounding marriage than the minimum age for marriage.  “The real question is about decoupling marriage norms from entering the labour force,” said Neelanjan Sircar, assistant professor, Ashoka University, and visiting senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research. “What we do know is that as women get married, there is a consequence in terms of what is expected of them at home. So, the big challenge that we have is women are restricted in how far they are able to go from their home and the hours for which they are able stay out of home. So agricultural labour is fine, but being in a full-time job an hour away is difficult,” he added.In an article published in this newspaper in September 2018, Jayati Ghosh, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University had highlighted one of these aspects. The article argued that if a women’s unpaid domestic work is recognized, the share of workers among women is higher than among men. The PLFS data shows that marriage is to blame for pushing women into domestic work. Marriage doesn’t prevent younger women from seeking unskilled work, but it does affect their prospects of pursuing education. Ninety-five percent married women (including those who were widowed, separated or divorced at the time of the survey) in the 18-20 age group, for instance, were engaged in some kind of domestic work if they were not looking for work, according to the PLFS conducted in 2018-19. In the same age group, only a third of those who were never married were engaged in domestic work if not looking for work. The remaining two-thirds women were studying. To be sure, even among unmarried women, the share of those doing domestic work increases with age. This comes closer to the share among married women in higher age groups.  The 2015-16 NFHS report further shows that trends in education and employment are influenced by cultural norms around marriage. A quarter of men, for instance, said decisions about visits to wife’s family or relatives are made mainly by the husband, compared to 7% who said the decision is mainly made by the wife. 16% men similarly said husbands are justified in beating their wife if they go out without telling him. This sentiment was also shared by 26% women respondents. Ghosh said the government’s move addresses a side issue rather than the actual needs of women. “It just involves another law and creating a criminality where there is none. What we need to do for women is very well known. We need to make sure they get adequate nutrition; we need to make sure they get through the 12 years of schooling; and we need to make sure that marriage is not made the only important thing in a woman’s life. This, of course, would involve much more work on the part of the government,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-changing-age-of-marriage-help-women/story-HjwRZpu30ESfYlu7SybGtO.html
23-08-2020||India||At Sushant’s Mumbai residence, CBI recreates sequence of events||A team of Central Bureau of Investigation officials, along with forensic experts, visited the house of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Bandra on Saturday to reconstruct the sequence of events before he was found dead on June 14, people familiar with the developments said. The team, which was accompanies by Rajput’s cook Neeraj Singh and roommate Siddharth Pithani, spent more than five hours in the actor’s flat, the people added. The three were present in the flat when Rajput was found hanging in his room. The team first went to the building’s terrace and then entered the flat. From outside, they were seen clicking pictures of the bedroom and shooting video. The CBI team was investigating whether suicide was possible at the spot, said the official quoted above. Earlier in the day, CBI officials visited Cooper Hospital at 11 am to meet the doctors who conducted the autopsy. On Friday, investigators hadquestioned Neeraj Singh, the actor’s cook at the DRDO’s guest house in Mumbai. Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda was questioned in the guest house of a private company at Marol in Andheri. The CBI team also collected documents from Mumbai police including forensic report, post mortem report, statements of more than 60 people that Mumbai police has recorded in the case, and other material evidence, a police official said. The team als o collected the three mobile phones that Rajput used, his laptop, clothes, blanket, bedsheets, a green kurta, a glass used to drink juice and CCTV footage of his house and building. On Wednesday, the SC allowed the CBI to continue with its probe into the case filed against actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family for allegedly abetting the suicide of Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-sushant-s-mumbai-residence-cbi-recreates-sequence-of-events/story-RKZLmMfuQSgH4DiVLAgPaI.html
23-08-2020||India||‘Not just my father, he was India’s son’, writes Sonali Jaitley||On the morning of 15th August, I watched as the Prime Minister spoke of the government’s efforts to provide affordable sanitary napkins, emphasising the importance of women’s health in his Independence Day speech. It was inspiring to see our country’s top leader speak freely about these issues, and attempt to make them mainstream in public discussion.I continued to ponder over progressive thinking, and it struck me — it’s been almost a year since we lost dad. Whether it was his lifelong support for implementation of a Uniform Civil Code, staunch opposition to regressive personal laws or exemplary foresight of the importance of skilling youth — he was undoubtedly the most visionary figure I knew. You see, the world already knows of Arun Jaitley’s professional prowess. We know how he spoke, we know how he acted. I thus do not wish to eulogise him today, but to simply remember what made him, him. And as the memories begin to flow, I write not of the astute politician or lawyer — I write of the man who was my father… He was forged in fire as a young man, imprisoned in 1975 as an ABVP karyakarta for protesting against the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi. This stint in prison stayed with him forever, permanently impacting his health. However, it never dented his spirit — instead giving him a steely resolve and an iron will. Many friends he made in jail remained close to him till the end.Also read: In Arun Jaitley’s death, nation loses a brilliant strategist in public lifeWhen I was young, he attended every annual day and parent-teacher interaction at school. This was all the more special because he was at the time a party worker, lawyer as well as India’s ASG (also tasked with investigating the Bofors scam). Though the country always came first, he never neglected his family. Festivals, birthdays, other essential engagements — he was there every time. Though at the time a senior minister in the Modi government, he made time to personally make all the arrangements for my wedding! A firm believer in family values, he talked of how elders had made us what we were. As a society, it was thus our duty to be there for them and give them their due. True to this ethos, he introduced several benefits in the 2018 budget such as hiking the exemption limit on income from interest for senior citizens by five times. He made it a point to never miss important occasions such as weddings or funerals of friends and associates, no matter how busy he was. This was true to the extent that even if there was something going on at our home, he’d still go for a bit.One of dad’s interesting qualities was that he never forgot a face. He’d remember everything about you, whether you met him the next day or 20 years later! Also read: Arun Jaitley’s death marks end of an era of a reporter’s politicianHe cared deeply for his employees, holding their dedicated service equally responsible for his success. As a senior advocate, he created the Arun Jaitley Clerkage Account to cater to their needs. Through this, he paid for the education of their children, which he undoubtedly regarded as crucial to success. Some of his staff members’ children went to school with me, and many are today successful professionals — having studied in reputed institutions such as New York University and Newcastle University. With great delight, dad would often speak of their success — he even checked up on these young men and women whenever he travelled to their cities. By the way, this clerkage account’s role didn’t end here. It also paid for his staff’s houses and children’s weddings (Now don’t ask if dad attended, you know the answer!). All my life, he made sure I took whatever I got without expecting favours. When I began travelling for basketball tournaments, he instilled in me the value of team spirit. Whether it was travelling by second-class trains or eating bad food — I was told to stick with my team without complaining! These values were instilled in me for every activity I did, and they guide me well today. And when it came down to it, dad practised what he preached. At every party working committee meet over the years, he always stayed in the accommodation given by the party, though he could’ve easily afforded a five-star hotel. This was despite the health issues he faced later in his life. However, he certainly preferred good old Indian food and always tried to have some wherever he travelled — be it France, America or Mexico. When I opened my law firm, he could have gotten me many clients. But Arun Jaitley did not disappoint! He said: ‘I helped you with an office, but don’t expect anything else from me… including clients! If you depend on me, what will happen when I’m not around?’ However, I must add that dad showed us both sides of the world — the fancy and the simple. We’ve eaten at the best restaurants, but the meals I’ve loved most were those of roti sabzi, sitting at home as a family. He gave us all the luxuries he could. Our family went on some amazing holidays. I’ve watched Wimbledon live, including a heated Federer-Nadal encounter at Centre Court! I’ve also witnessed some memorable cricket matches at stadiums. But honestly, nothing beat sitting on our living room sofa and fervently cheering for Sachin during India-Pakistan matches! One might inquire: ‘Sonali, everyone thinks their father is amazing. What made yours so unique?’ My answer: It’s not what he did, it’s how he did it. Dad went about tasks in a way that often left newcomers in disbelief. He could literally do 10 things at the same time! Example? His evening routine: Dinner, phone calls, replying to messages, watching the news, having his secretary tell him the next day’s schedule… all at the same time. I’d say his top three TV preferences were cricket, news and old Bollywood songs.I’ve seen dad churn out some of his best articles while in boisterous conversation with guests and clients. If I pointed them out to you today and told you the environment in which they were written, you probably wouldn’t believe me. Such was the agility of his mind! Dad was not a career politician — he was first a brilliant lawyer. His secretary once asked him why he entered politics when he could’ve raked in millions through his practice. He just smiled and said: ‘Law is my profession, Politics is my passion!’ It was this passion that gave my father the rare ability to be equally comfortable with both prominent public figures, as well as ordinary people in remote villages of India. Political differences never came in the way, for him friendship was paramount, and cut sharply across ideological lines. He was often known as the ‘Spirit of the Central Hall of Parliament’ — for there, he used to sit and eloquently regale everyone (regardless of party) with interesting observations and anecdotes. This camaraderie combined with keen negotiation skills (honed through his years of legal practice) enabled him to unite opposing blocs — aptly earning him the sobriquet ‘Troubleshooter of the Party’.A great instance of this troubleshooting was the passage of the GST Bill, which took all his consensus-building talents to ensure full acceptance by all the parties involved.Though in my eyes, an event 17 years ago really tested dad’s diplomatic skills and brought them to the forefront — the WTO Cancún Ministerial Conference, 2003. An incident during this conference was quite unforgettable: Around 100 countries had formed a coalition for some issues at Cancún. However, word soon spread that a key country was planning to opt out of this coalition. Then, dad got into action and quickly called a press conference — where he ensured that this country’s delegate was put in the media spotlight. Thoroughly basking in the attention, the delegate quickly dropped the idea of leaving. This was not the only tour de force he pulled off at Cancún. As minister of commerce and industries, he took on developed countries with determination to protect India’s interests. Soon after, developing countries in WTO started to grow increasingly influential on matters of trade, agriculture and investment! Dad believed in giving back & helping others, no matter when or where. One of his most powerful quotes is still with me — ‘It is easy to be a politician, but a leader is one who nurtures talent and creates future leaders’. Many astute politicians today regard him as an inspiration and guru-like figure. This makes me proud, as he succeeded in doing what he always believed in. As a three-time MP from Gujarat, dad was always concerned for the state’s wellbeing. In 2014, he adopted the villages of Karnali, Pipaliya, Vadiya and Baglipura under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojna. Over time, he worked to understand the issues faced by these villages, and subsequently transformed them. He built a bridge, a four-lane ring road, toilets in every household, installed solar lights and made a science lab for rural students — among many other reforms he introduced there. Apart from these, he brought about significant changes in the fields closest to his heart: health, education and cleanliness. But as I remember all he did, I must mention a regret dad had. He always wanted to hold the portfolio of health minister — and contribute to making healthcare affordable and accessible (Though I’m certain he’d be proud of all that Ayushman Bharat has achieved in that regard). Lifelong, he held that our country’s doctors and nurses were the best. When advised to travel to Singapore for a kidney transplant, he didn’t — trusting Indian doctors more. Dad’s admiration for medical staff and health workers was tremendous, strengthened by his personal interactions. He often said doctors must be respected outright, for they gave it their all to save us. While in the hospital, he expressed sadness at how doctors were treated — as he often came across newspaper reports on violence against medical professionals. He told me that when better, he’d surely pursue legal measures to ensure their safety. Sadly, that did not come to pass. In April ’20, PM Shri Narendra Modi ji’s government approved an ordinance to ensure stricter punishment for violence against health workers. This would certainly have made dad very, very happy! The Kashmir issue too was close to his heart, especially since he shared a deep and personal connection to the land. Article 370, he believed, was an impediment to progress. In his last months, he regularly studied J&K’s constitution to figure out the perfect legal strategy to deal with Article 370. And along with Narendra Modi ji & Amit Shah ji, history was made with its abrogation in August ’19! The region is now steadily on its way to becoming an education and investment hub, and I’m sure this is just the beginning! Dad had a truly outstanding vision for this country, and though he will not be there to witness its fruition, I hope to be there to witness it for him. He wanted India to be equitable and just, with opportunities in health, service and education for all. He wanted the youth to stand up and get involved, just like he did almost half a century ago. Let us aspire to take his vision forward, and never stop trying to bring about change. As I end, saying that only I miss him would be wrong — there are many across this great nation who do... For Arun Jaitley wasn’t just my father, he was India’s son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arun-jaitley-death-anniversary-not-just-my-father-he-was-india-s-son-writes-sonali-jaitley/story-m2kPfiAg5q2yrNRbEqFXFP.html
23-08-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Digitising sector a step towards universal care||With Covid-19 cases in India crossing the 3 million mark on Saturday, scaling up the digital health ecosystem to improve access and quality of care is as critical as strengthening systems to optimize healthcare delivery.“India’s response strategy remains the same. Our focus is on trying to bring down mortality to less than 1%. To do that, we will continue with... the test, trace, track and treat strategy and an aggressive vaccination strategy to prevent infection...,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.Experts agree that India’s case count is bound to increase over the next few months, given its 1.3 billion population, and the way forward remains diagnosis, containment, and treatment. “No new response is needed beyond trace, test, isolate and treat [strategy],” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.Also read | Covid-19: A testing primerThe health system strengthening as part of India’s Covid-19 response will be further boosted by the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day. Pilots have rolled out in the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep. “The NDHM aims to create a digital health ecosystem that encompasses private and public health systems to deliver improved healthcare services across the country in a highly inclusive, equitable, and secure manner. The systems built are completely digital, patient-friendly, and totally interoperable,” said Vardhan.The four key components of NDHM are national health identity, personal health records, Digi-Doctor, and health facility registry. “Every Indian who wishes to participate has to create a unique Health ID, which will be valid across states, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and pharmacies, and will be linked for seamless flow of health information. All digital health records issued will be automatically-linked to the respective Health IDs,” he said.Health records, both legacy and new, will be accessible electronically only with the consent of the patient. This framework will create a longitudinal health track of every patient to assist the clinician in decision-making and give patients access and control of their health data.Also read: Want to enrol in a vaccine trial? Know your eligibilityIn a move to increase access, transparency, and accountability, the system has the Digi-Doctor option. The option allows doctors from modern and AYUSH systems of medicine from across the country to register, get authenticated, share data on a web portal, and to write prescriptions with digital signatures.NDHM will next be scaled up to take e-pharmacy and telemedicine services to all states.The health facility registry component in NDHM will be a certified and standardised repository of all health facilities in the country, including hospitals, medical colleges, diagnostic labs, pharmacies, and health and wellness centres to ensure the quality of care through regular audits, tracking outcomes and collecting feedback.“The registry will be centrally maintained, and will store and facilitate the exchange of standardized data of both public and private health facilities in the country,” said Vardhan.“All products have been built with the highest standards of security checks. The applications are hosted on a highly secure Government Community Cloud. Access to the cloud is restricted with permissions, and an advanced level of security is implemented. All applications, as well as infrastructure, go through rigorous security audit before utilization over the public domain,” said Vardhan. Additionally, individuals can choose where to keep their data. “There is no mandate to keep data on Government servers only,” said Vardhan. Patients also have the option of choosing the time period for which they want to grant consent.NDHM will take India another step closer to universal health care. India’s public health expenditure is 1.28% of its GDP, with per capita public health expenditure being ~1,657 in 2017-18. For people living in rural areas completely dependent on government hospitals and clinics, the government allopathic doctor-patient ratio is 1:10,926, according to the National Health Profile 2019, leading to inequities in access.Mainstreaming digital health and telemedicine is the most transformative in healthcare delivery post-Covid-19, but it cannot replace a strong primary health system and connectivity. For that, we need motivated healthcare workers and an enabling infrastructure, which must be equally high on the government’s priority list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-crisis-digitising-sector-a-step-towards-universal-care/story-Wyw4vNMxYp0C8tJ1WtPeZP.html
23-08-2020||India||Want to enrol in a vaccine trial? Know your eligibility||A televised advertisement led to about 1,000 people volunteering at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to participate in human trials of the first vaccine being indigenously developed, signifying the beginning of a careful process to handpick participants for such studies that are pivotal in the future of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.There are currently three Covid-19 vaccines at various stages of development in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on August 15 that along with a plan for mass production, the road map for distribution of vaccines to every Indian was in place.The three vaccine candidates approved for conducting various stages of human trials by the central drugs controller are Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D and Oxford University and AstraZeneca’s vaccine. Also read | Covid-19: A testing primer“We needed 100 volunteers but the phone number that we had advertised would not stop ringing. People were even sending requests through WhatsApp texts, which was apart from hundreds of emails that the hospital received from volunteers who wanted to participate in the trial. But we had to stop after a while because even after keeping extra numbers as buffer, the applications overshot the requirement,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, AIIMS, Delhi. He is one of the principal investigators of the human trial of one of the vaccines.Any healthy Indian adult can apply to participate in a Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial provided certain conditions are met. “The age group of the study participants is what is looked at first; the participants need to be ideally between 18 and 55 years of age. The next important criterion is that the prospective participants should not be suffering from any medical condition such as high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. They have to be absolutely healthy volunteers,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ICMR is also supporting the Covid-19 vaccine projects.There are many ways that can be used to publicise the enrolment process for trials, including advertising through print and electronic media, institutional or other websites, etc. Institutes that participate in the trials usually take a call on which medium to pick. “How these centres that are chosen to conduct the study select their study participants is purely their call to take. Normally, contact details are advertised through newspapers, television, websites, etc, but is decided locally,” said Dr Srivastava.There is a window for the volunteers to apply. “Among the applications received, the selection is usually on first-come-first-served basis; like first 100 applications that fulfil the basic criteria will be short-listed, and invited, for the initial screening process. And if any of those fail, then others in the list are invited,” said Dr Rai.Normally, about 25-30% applications are kept aside as buffer. Once basic screening is done, the participants are made to undergo a battery of tests that first begin with checking their Covid-19 status.“A swab sample is taken to run a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) which is important to know whether they are infected or not. We have to look for participants who are neither currently infected nor have been infected in the past,” said Dr Rai.Apart from nasopharyngeal swabs to run the rRT-PCR test, blood samples are also collected to check for possibly existing antibodies and other health statistics of trial participants.“The blood test is to confirm whether the participant has antibodies against the virus in question as it would tell whether the volunteer has been infected at any point in the past without knowing it. For the trials, they need a participant who is not exposed to the virus in the first place, apart from them having to be free of any other disease. The tests are done for viral markers and blood parameters,” said Dr Navin Dang, owner, Dr Dangs Lab. His lab has been selected to conduct a part of the testing for one of the three vaccine trials.The panel of blood tests for screening is to determine blood sugar levels, liver and kidney functions, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, HIV, blood count, etc. If any volunteer shows past infection or any other infection or unsatisfactory blood parameters, then they are not involved in the trial. “The panel of tests is done on Day 1 and then repeated periodically, say on Day 15, Day 28, etc, to check the changes that may develop as an after-effect of vaccine administration. The candidates are tracked not just till the trial period, but for a few months after the trial gets over,” said Dr Dang.Those who are not eligible include people with acute illnesses with or without fever at the time of experimental vaccine administration, history of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, history of severe allergic reactions after previous vaccinations or hypersensitivity to any component of study vaccines, any confirmed or suspected condition with impaired/altered function of immune system, and pregnant women.No money is given to participants except for compensation in case of an injury or adverse reaction with the vaccine candidate. “The volunteers are not paid but there is a provision for providing compensation based on the damage or injury,” said Dr Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-to-enrol-in-a-vaccine-trial-know-your-eligibility/story-b947WXXQZ0qtPYDGby2E8M.html
23-08-2020||India||Covid-19: A testing primer||India crossed the 3-million Covid-19 case mark on Saturday. Data released on Saturday morning showed that India conducted over a million tests on Friday. This column recommended on July 7 that India set that target for itself with a deadline of August 15. The only country to have done more, albeit in a short burst, is China, where, on one day in May, Chinese health officials tested around 1.5 million people in Wuhan (where it all began). In a two-week period, they tested almost all 11 million of the city’s residents. China clearly has more testing capacity. A June 24 report by Reuters, citing an official at the country’s National Health Commission said the country was capable of conducting 3.78 million nucleic acid (molecular) tests for Covid-19 in a day, up from 1.26 million in early March. In absolute terms, India is third in terms of testing (according to data from worldometers.info on Saturday morning). The country has thus far carried out almost 34.5 million tests, behind China’s 90 million and the US’s 75 million. In terms of tests per million, the country (it has tested around 25,000 per million of its population) lags many others. It is ninth among the 10 countries that have seen the most number of cases, and 16th among the 20 countries with the most cases. Russia tops in terms of tests per million (around 232,000), followed by the US (225,547) and the UK (223,403). Still, India’s achievement, given its size and the low testing capacity it started with — see front page — is very significant. Just to put the number in context, if India does as many tests as it did Friday on every day between now and the end of September, even accounting for the drop off in testing over weekends, it would have tested around 5.5% of its population. In fact, that should be the next target.Also read | Covid-19: A million and a manifestoIndia’s overall number hides extremes (like averages do). At one end, Delhi has tested 70,300 people per million of its population. At the other, Madhya Pradesh has tested 13,788. Many Indian states are testing above the 140-per-million daily benchmark recommended by the World Health Organization, but this is a woefully inadequate number. For instance, it would require a state with a population of 100 million to carry out a mere 14,000 tests a day. Starting from zero, it would take the state 286 days to cover 4% of its population.But how much should a state test? What tests should it use? And, given all the talk of pooled testing as a way to rapidly test a large number of people, should India start doing that? These are the three most important questions India’s health ministry, states, and the Indian Council of Medical Research have to answer — and the answers may well decide the trajectory of the pandemic in India from now to the end of the year.The first question is simply answered. Universally, epidemiologists recommend that 10% of the population be tested. This writer’s own opinion (which has been stated before) is that states with a population in excess of 50 million should test 4-5% of their population; a population between 20 million and 50 million, 5-7%; and a population below 20 million 7-10%. If the positivity rates in these states plateau and then start to fall with increased testing, and reaches 5-7%, it means they are testing adequately. Otherwise, they aren’t, and they should just test more, even if they have already met the benchmark listed above.The second question, too, has been answered before in this column (but no one seems to be listening). The best tests to use for diagnosis are molecular tests such as the RT-PCR one. Antigen tests, which accounted for roughly around 30% of the tests on Friday, are much faster (effectively an hour compared to 3-4 days for molecular tests) but inaccurate. They should be used when time is a constraint — in a containment zone where cases are peaking for instance, and infected people have to be quickly identified and isolated; or at a public event which needs to be held; even in airports and railway stations (every traveller should be administered one). I have previously suggested using two different antigen tests on a sample (or using the same test twice) to reduce the inaccuracy, and testing authorities should consider doing this. When time isn’t a constraint, testers should only use molecular tests.Also read | Covid-19: What we still don’t knowAs for the third question, pooled testing would appear to be out for India. Positivity rates are still high, and antibody surveys (where they have been conducted) indicate that the proportion of those infected is high. Pooled tests work only when a fraction of those being tested is infected.One target has been met — now India should focus on the next.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-a-testing-primer/story-AhnvwH3gAqlfZeXmDZ44MJ.html

No casualty was reported in the incident. As per the available information, it is suspected that the fire started in godown of the unit and the drums containing solvents started exploding one after another and the fire spread rapidly, they said. Seven fire tenders, including two from the Dundigal Airforce Academy, were pressed into service to extinguish the flames, a Fire Department official told PTI, adding the blaze has been brought under control. Thick black smoke emanated from the area, he said. “The intensity of the fire has been reduced... there is no human loss or injury to anyone. No one was there in the unit at the time of the incident,” the official said. The shed collapsed after the drums exploded, the official added. On August 21, a major fire broke out in the Srisailam hydroelectric power plant located on the Telangana side of the border with Andhra Pradesh leaving nine people dead, most of them engineers, and three seriously injured.

23-08-2020||India||Where does Dawood Ibrahim live in Karachi? Pakistan has three addresses||Three addresses in Pakistan’s Karachi city are in focus following Islamabad’s tacit acknowledgement that the United Nations designated global terrorist and the main accused in 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, Dawood Ibrahim, could be having multiple residences in the Pakistani port city apart from being in possession of at least one Pakistani passport.The admission by Pakistan has come after years in denial of India’s assertion that it was actively involved in sheltering one of the most wanted fugitives from Indian justice system. The implicit admission has now come in the form of an official order that sanctions 88 individuals and several organizations in Pakistan involved in terrorism and terror financing ahead of a review of Pakistan’s compliance with international rules against money laundering and terror financing networks by FATF, the international watchdog.The Pakistan government document lists White House, Karachi as one of Dawood’s three addresses in the city of Karachi, long suspected to be Dawood’s base. The document also lists the other two addresses- House Number 37 - 30th Street - defence, Housing Authority Karachi, Pakistan and a “Palatial bungalow” in the hilly area of Noorbad, Karachi.It is for the first time that Pakistan has admitted the presence of the underworld don in the country. In 2003, the US declared Ibrahim as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The UN and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US treasury department have listed Karachi as Dawood’s residence for years and dossiers have been given to Pakistan in the past requesting action against his interests and network, but without luck.In March 2010, the 1267 Committee (the al Qaeda Sanctions Committee) listed four addresses for Ibrahim in a statement: “a) Karachi/Pakistan, White House, Near Saudi Mosque, Clifton b) House Nu 37 - 30th Street - defence, Housing Authority Karachi Pakistan c) Palatial bungalow in the hilly area of Noorabad in Karachi d) Property at Margalla Raod F 6/2 Street no. 22, House number 29 in Karachi.”According to counter terror operatives based in New Delhi and Mumbai, who were quoted in a Hindustan Times report earlier this year, Dawood has been living in Karachi under the protection of the state. Not just that, he also has three-bullet proof cars in his convoy and often travels to Islamabad.Also Read: Pakistan mentions Dawood Ibrahim’s Karachi addresses in sanctions documentThe UN statement also lists his latest passport as being issued in Rwalpindi, the twin city of Islamabad where the army headquarters are based. He used to carry Indian and UAE passports in the 1980s and early 1990s. The UN documents are in the public domain. The Pakistan government document reportedly also refers to the passports issued to Dawood from Rawalpindi and Karachi offices.Bharatiya Janata Party national spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain on Saturday said that Pakistan should hand over Dawood Ibrahim to India.Speaking to ANI, Hussain said, “Pakistan knew that it had given shelter to Dawood Ibrahim. His children were married to a famous Pakistani cricketer. Every person in Pakistan knew that he lives in Karachi. However, till date Pakistan did not accept it. Now Pakistan should immediately hand over Dawood Ibrahim to India. Because he is the most wanted in India.”He said that he is still involved in crime in India and even today many crimes are done in India through Dawood Ibrahim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-does-dawood-ibrahim-live-in-karachi-pakistan-has-three-addresses/story-yQQycwMwEOePyQSc6PluZI.html
23-08-2020||India||Private school ousts 120 students over fee||Around 120 students of KR Mangalam World School in Greater Kailash II have been served with termination notices over “deliberate and persistent non-payment of fee and arrears of fee”, school officials said. While the school maintains that around 120 students have been served with the termination notices, the school’s parents’ association said the number is 137. A group of parents and the school have been involved in a court case over increased fee since May 2019. As per a Delhi high court order dated July 21 in the matter, parents were directed to deposit the fee and arrears within 28 days, the school said. In a copy of the termination notice sent to the parents, the school said, “Almost six months have passed since the date of the first order dated February 19 whereby you were directed to pay the fees as per the current rates, but you have not cared to clear the same. It is a classic example of your seeking to misuse the present pandemic situation, wherein you deserve none of its benefits and have not been affected by it at all.” A parent, whose children’s names have been struck off from the school rolls, said, “Parents are willing to pay the fee (old) but they have missed the deadline due to various reasons and they can be given a grace period of a few days instead of just striking off their child’s name.” “The school has only allowed payment through demand drafts or cheques which further limits the option for parents. We were allowed to pay through PayTM but that shows the hiked fee and not the old fee,” he added The outstanding arrears for last year were submitted to the school but they didn’t encash it as they wanted the hiked fee,” claimed the parent.School principal Sangeeta Arora said, “Names of defaulters, who have been avoiding payment of school fee despite the honourable high court’s directions in February 2020, March 2020 (twice) and July 2020, have been struck off in accordance with the Delhi School Education Rules.”In an email to the Directorate of Education on Saturday, the parents’ association said many students had their examinations from Monday and requested that the termination notices be withdrawn.“We are examining the matter and have asked the school not to expel the students and postpone the exams for at least 15 days. Within a day or two, we will come out with a solution to the matter,” said director, education, Udit Prakash Rai.Kamal Gupta, counsel for the school in the matter, said, “A small group of parents, despite repeated requests and reminders and court orders, did not pay the school fee for the entire last year 2019-20 and did not pay towards even tuition for the last five months from April 2020 till date. This is in defiance and non-compliance of the orders passed by the high court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-school-ousts-120-students-over-fee/story-yIOjAw9VcJ5P02oD1g7TXI.html
23-08-2020||India||Testing times ahead as NTA gears up to hold key entrance exams amid Covid||New Delhi: The National Testing Agency has geared up to hold key examinations in September amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic even as clamour grows for the deferment of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) (Main).The agency, which is responsible for conducting entrance examinations for higher educational institutions, is slated to hold the Delhi University Entrance Test (DUET) from September 6 to 11. The test is for candidates seeking admissions to undergraduate, post-graduate, MPhil and PhD courses offered by the University of Delhi. The NTA also plans to hold entrance exams to undergraduate programme of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) from September 7 and 8.From September 16 to 18 and again from September 21 to 25, the agency is scheduled to oversee the UGC-NET examination, which is a national-level exam conducted to select candidates for the post of assistant professor or/and both junior research fellowship in universities and colleges. While the NEET and JEE register at least 2.5 million candidates on an average, the other tests the NTA is scheduled to hold in the coming months also see participation from hundreds of thousands of candidates. Meanwhile, political leaders continued to express concern over holding exams during the pandemic. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday sought cancellation of the NEET and JEE on account of the Covid-19 outbreak. “The government is playing with lives of lakhs of students in name of JEE and NEET. I appeal Centre govt to immediately cancel both exams and adopt an alternative admission process,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-times-ahead-as-nta-gears-up-to-hold-key-entrance-exams-amid-covid/story-TpoFlfvbQXfmDVGkaPWOtK.html
23-08-2020||India||India rejects reference to J&K in China-Pak joint statement||New Delhi India rejected on Saturday a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in a joint statement issued by China and Pakistan, saying it was tantamount to interference in the country’s internal affairs. After Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi briefed his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi of Islamabad’s views on the situation in the Union territory of India during talks on Friday, the joint statement said China opposes any “unilateral” actions that complicate the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Responding to the joint statement, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “As in the past, we categorically reject the reference to the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir in the joint press release of the 2nd round of China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue. “The Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India and we expect the parties concerned to not to interfere in matters that are internal affairs of India.” Srivastava also reiterated India’s opposition to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a key component of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). “At the same time we also reiterate our consistent position on the so-called ‘China-Pakistan Economic Corridor’. India has repeatedly conveyed its concerns to both China and to Pakistan on the projects in [the] so-called China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which are in the territory of India that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan,” he said. “We resolutely oppose actions by other countries that change the status quo in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and call on the parties concerned to cease such actions,” he added. The Kashmir issue figured in the second strategic dialogue of the Chinese and Pakistani foreign ministers in the southern province of Hainan on Friday. Qureshi arrived in China on Thursday for the talks against the backdrop of the dragging India-China border standoff. “The Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, including its concerns, position and current urgent issues,” said the joint statement issued at the end of the two-day strategic dialogue. “The Chinese side reiterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left over from history between India and Pakistan, which is an objective fact, and that the dispute should be resolved peacefully and properly through the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation,” the joint statement added. China and Pakistan backed a “peaceful, stable, cooperative and prosperous South Asia” and the joint statement further said: “Parties need to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect.” Beijing had adopted issued a similar position immediately after New Delhi scrapped Kashmir’s special status in August last year. Since then, China has also sought to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Pakistan’s behalf several times, but without much success. In a recorded message addressed to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, Chinese President Xi Jinping had on Friday described CPEC as “a landmark project” under BRI, and said it is of “great importance to promoting in-depth development of the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-reference-to-j-k-in-china-pak-joint-statement/story-wFD2QSy9weCZ3seNd4PsuJ.html
23-08-2020||India||Rajnath Singh, Ajit Doval and military top brass security meet focuses on LAC situation||Defence minister Rajnath Singh, national security adviser Ajit Doval and the military’s top brass on Saturday met for a security review during which they also deliberated on the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese forces have been locked in a standoff for more than three months and the disengagement process has hit a roadblock, people familiar with the developments said. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, air force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh attended the meeting that took place two days after diplomatic talks between the two nuclear-armed countries on the border issue, the officials said, asking not to be named. Details of the discussions were not immediately known. India and China were unable to bridge their differences on the disengagement and de-escalation process along the LAC during diplomatic talks on Thursday, with New Delhi emphasising the need to resolve “outstanding issues” speedily, as reported by Hindustan Times on August 20. The top-level security review also came a day after the army’s top commanders discussed the security situation at the northern and western borders.“A meeting of the Army Commanders was conducted on 20-21 August 2020 to review the security situation and operational preparedness on both the Northern and Western Fronts,” the army tweeted on Saturday. The army is preparing for a long haul in the Ladakh sector, stretching through the harsh winters. People familiar with developments during the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs dismissed an assertion in a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry that the two sides had “positively evaluated the progress” in the disengagement process. The military dialogue between senior commanders from the two sides has hit a roadblock due to Chinese reluctance to restore status quo ante in some key friction areas along the LAC. The commanders set the time-frame and method of disengagement while the WMCC monitors the process. No dates have yet been fixed for the next round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers who have so far met five times but failed to break the deadlock, the officials said. The August 20 WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and Hong Liang, director general of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry. This was the body’s fifth virtual meeting since the Ladakh standoff emerged in the open in May. The sizeable Chinese troop presence at friction points, particularly Pangong Lake and Depsang, remains an area of key concern for the Indian Army. The Finger Area—a set of eight cliffs jutting out of Sirijap range overlooking Pangong Lake—has emerged as the hardest part of the disengagement process. Disengagement has progressed somewhat smoothly at friction points in Galwan Valley and Hot Springs, but its pace remains sluggish in Gogra area. There is growing consensus among Indian officials and China experts that military talks are unlikely to deliver further results, and the resolution of the issue will require political and diplomatic intervention. De-escalation along the disputed border can only begin after complete disengagement between the two armies on the LAC. The ground situation remains unchanged in Ladakh sector, where both armies have deployed almost 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-meet-focuses-on-lac-situation/story-SGZLVHCMRZgwm5hEAyRyoL.html
23-08-2020||India||BSF shoots downfive Pak intruders||The Border Security Force (BSF) shot dead five Pakistani intruders in self defence after the infiltrators opened fire on the Indian troopers along the India-Pakistan International Border in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district early on Saturday morning, senior officials of the force said. Ammunition and drugs were recovered during a search operation at the site, which falls under the Dal border outpost in the district. One AK-47 assault rifle with two magazines and 27 live rounds, four .9mm Berretta pistols with seven magazines and 109 live rounds, 9kg heroin, two mobile phones and Rs 610 in Pakistani currency were recovered from the infiltrators, a BSF spokesperson said. According to senior officials aware of the developments, troopers of BSF’s 103rd battalion first noticed the movement of two infiltrators who were trying to take cover under paddy crop near the border around 11:30pm on Friday night. “When the troops checked the suspected movement in the cameras installed at the border, they found that there were five suspects,” said BSF’s inspector general (IG), Punjab Frontier, Mahipal Yadav. Following this, a surveillance operation was launched around 5am and the area was cordoned off. The “Pakistani armed” intruders were then asked to stop and surrender, but instead they opened fire at the BSF personnel, he said, adding that Indian troops retaliated in “self defence” Punjab shares a 553km frontier with Pakistan, apart from Jammu, Rajasthan and Gujarat -- which together constitute the remaining part of the International Border. According to the IG, prima facie, it appears the five men were trying to infiltrate as they were carrying arms and drugs, but their exact motive will be ascertained by the Punjab Police during their investigation. The mobile phones recovered by the intruders could contain vital information, Yadav said. Yadav added that the BSF is likely to lodge a “strong protest” with Pakistan Rangers – deployed along the other side of the border -- and ask them to keep vigil. Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Tarn Taran, Dhruman H Nimbale said a case has been registered against the five unidentified intruders under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act , Indian Passport Act and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS Act at the Khalra police station in the district. The Dal outpost is located in the Khalra border region in the district. The bodies of the five men have been handed over to district police officials for identification and further investigation. No documents were recovered from their possession. Protocol states that after getting the post-mortem of the suspects, Tarn Taran police will hand over the bodies back to the BSF, which will then ask Pakistani Rangers to claim them. The paramilitary force seized over 356kg heroin and 25 illegal weapons so far this year, officials said.  Punjab Police had said in October last year that some Pakistani miscreants had attempted to use drones to smuggle weapons into India along the Khalra border. This was disclosed by the police after they busted a Pakistan-backed Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terrorist module in October 2019 with the arrest of four persons from Tarn Taran’s Chohla Sahib village. The police recovered two drones from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-shoots-downfive-pak-intruders/story-ZQIwpEi8jvruNfDrla4v3K.html
23-08-2020||India||50kg ovarian tumour removed from woman’s body at Delhi hospital||A 52-year-old woman from Delhi who had an unexplained gain in weight over the past few months was found to have a 50kg ovarian tumour, which accounted for close to half her body weight of 106kg. The tumour was surgically removed at a leading private hospital in Delhi. Post-surgery, the woman’s weight has dropped to 56kg. She has recovered from the complicated surgery and is set to be discharged from hospital on August 22. The woman, who prefers to remain unnamed in this report, had the tumour removed in a three-and-a-half-hour surgery at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. The team of surgeons said it was the largest ovarian tumour ever to be operated in the world, with the previous biggest reported from Coimbatore where a woman was operated for a 34kg tumour in her ovary in 2017. The Delhi patient began gaining weight rapidly over the past few months, which led to her experiencing breathlessness and acute pain in her lower abdomen that caused difficulties in walking and sleeping. When the rapid weight gain didn’t stop and the associated complications increased, she consulted a neighbourhood physician, who referred her to Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. Diagnostic investigations revealed she had a large, progressively expanding tumour in her ovary, which was putting pressure on her intestine (intestinal adhesions), leading to acute stomach aches and inability to digest food. As a result, she had developed acute anaemia, with her haemoglobin count dropping to 6 gm/dl, against a normal of 12-15.5 gm/dl. “The size of the tumour and the patient’s exceptionally low haemoglobin made the extract a challenge, and she had to undergo six units of blood transfusion before, during and after the procedure. That apart, there was no space in the abdomen for insertion of equipment via laparoscopy or robot-assisted methods, so we performed traditional surgery with a multidisciplinary team from the gastroenterology, gynaecology and anaesthesiology teams,” said lead surgeon Dr Arun Prasad, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and bariatric surgery. “The patient was admitted with complaints of stomach ache, breathing stress and weight gain. She was advised immediate surgery as further growth would have up put pressure on other organs, leading to possible organ failure. Fortunately, the tumour was benign and the patient had no co-morbidities, which enabled a faster recovery,” said Dr Abhishek Tiwari, consultant, surgical gastroenterology, part of the team that performed the surgery. Experts say the fear of getting infected with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is keeping patients away from hospitals, where they are increasingly seeking treatment in advanced stages of disease, which require more complex surgeries. “Many procedures that can be done using minimally invasive technique now need open surgery. The complications also lead to a longer hospital and ICU stay,” said Dr Vinod Bindal, vice-chairman of minimally invasive surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50kg-ovarian-tumour-removed-from-woman-s-body-at-delhi-hospital/story-0b75yKv8I1FZX3NEz4d1kI.html
23-08-2020||India||Covid-effect: Before taking flight, a three-hour deep clean||Every commercial aircraft that flies into Delhi from an overseas or domestic airport, or even if it is just in transit, is being rigorously cleaned for 3-4 hours by a team supervised by the airline’s engineering services staff before it is reused. That’s one of the precautions put in place by airlines to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).From the lavatories to windows and from baggage cabins to the cockpit, every fixture in the aircraft, including the seats, foldable tables and hand rests, are being cleaned with disinfecting chemicals so that passengers can rest assured on the flight that their chances of being infected by the virus are minimal .Covered in personal protective equipment from head to toe, these cleaners enter an aircraft when all the passengers have disembarked and all the luggage has been taken out.The process starts with spraying disinfectants on every surface inside the aircraft, said YS Rao, general manager, engineering, Air India. “The wet surface is then left to be disinfected for 25-30 minutes and only after that the cleaning crew enters again, this time to deep-clean every corner of the plane,” he said.Rao said using strong disinfectants, every surface is thoroughly wiped, be it the doors, windows, seats, foldable tables, baggage cabins, or the seat hand rests. “Even the cockpit is cleaned ,but under the strict supervision of our engineering staff so that safety of the passengers and aircraft is not compromised at any level,” Rao said.Rao also added that while travelling, especially during long flights, a flyer may unintentionally touch a window or the arm-rest or may want to use the lavatory often. “We want to assure our passengers that their flight would be clean and safe for travel. There are also sanitizers kept inside the lavatories, which can be used by the passengers. Our airline crew onboard takes care of hygiene when airborne. A cleaned surface gets infected only when an infected person touches it,” Rao said.Rao said the entire cleaning exercise lasts for about a couple of hours, depending on the size of the aircraft. “An Airbus can be deep-cleaned in less than two hours, but a Boeing 777 may take up to four hours. It depends on the capacity and how big an aircraft is,” the GM added.The number of staff used also varies from aircraft to aircraft. “While an Airbus A320 can easily be managed by 8-10 cleaners, for Boeing 777, which is the biggest aircraft being used in Vande Bharat Missions, we might need at least 15 cleaners at a time,” he said. Vande Bharat is the government initiative to bring back Indians stranded overseas In India, the national carrier Air India is the only airline operating international flights during the pandemic.Another official from Air India said that the airline has outsourced the deep-cleaning task to AI-SATS, a joint venture between Air India and Singapore Airport Terminal Services.“We pay SATS the service charges. Roughly, for deep-cleaning of an Airbus A320, we pay around Rs 6,000 as service charges. For an ATR aircraft, it is Rs 4,500 to 5,000 and for a Boeing 777, service charges may go up to as high as Rs 14,000. Logistics are all of SATS but at times we also provide with chemicals used in cleaning,” the official said, wishing not to be named.A spokesperson from AISATS said its staff follows industry standards for all aircraft cleaning processes, customising the process based on an airline’s guidelines. “Stringent set of measures are in place to ensure we are delivering the best aircraft cleaning service. Our team ensures cleaning at key touchpoints throughout the day with disinfectants and cleaning agents. From interior services including cleaning of the aircraft cabin, galleys, flight deck and toilets, dressing of seats and seat pockets, crew bunks and toilets, to changing and replenishment of blankets carpet and leather cleaning solutions, we are adhering to standard operating procedures issued by important authorities,” the spokesperson said.While focusing on an aircraft’s cleaning, AISATS also follows safety protocols for its own staff by providing them with optimal safety and sanitation equipment. “Our teams are following measures aligned with the guidelines issued by IATA {International Air Transport Association} , the government, DGCA, {Directorate General of Civil Aviation} and other important organizations. Our team is deployed round the clock and is working behind the scenes with airport and airline staff to help support and execute the cleaning process,” the spokesperson said.Private airlines operating domestically are being as careful. SpiceJet is carrying out “best-in-class” cleaning procedures on all its aircraft in addition to disinfecting customer touch points and surfaces before every flight, a spokesperson said. “The cleaning procedure for flights includes a thorough wipe-down using an effective, high-grade, Boeing-approved disinfectant across aircraft interiors including the places customers touch most – the tray tables, seat covers, armrests, seatbelts, window shades and lavatories and their knobs,” the spokesperson said. SpiceJet said all its aircraft now have synthetic leather seats. “These non-porous seats don’t allow the Covid-19 virus to penetrate inside them and can be easily wiped off compared to standard fabric seats,” the spokesperson said. IndiGo, in addition to disinfecting aircraft, is also carrying out fumigation. “All common surfaces such as the baggage drop counters, boarding gates, coaches, ramps, wheelchairs, crew vehicles and of course, the aircraft itself, are being thoroughly disinfected using approved cleaning agents. The tray tables, armrests, overhead nozzles, lavatories and galleys are receiving special attention, given the frequency of contact,” a spokesperson said. Om Dinekar, a student who returned to India in a Vande Bharat flight from France, said because he was sitting on the middle seat, he was made to wear a PPE suit. “I therefore didn’t move at all in my 8-hour-flight and didn’t use the lavatory either. The aircraft looked clean, but how does one know if its disinfected. Only the airline would know how clean it was. I hope they maintain the best of standards,” Dinekar said.Another passenger, Vijay Kale, who travelled to Delhi from Bangkok, said the cabin crew gave passengers five sachets of sanitizers. “The plane looked clean, but we do not know what cleaning agents were used and how effective are they. Crew were also ensuring minimum touch policy. Food was already placed on our seats and face shields were also provided,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-effect-before-taking-flight-a-three-hour-deep-clean/story-hjzldaWvC6QH65jxWdEiMM.html
23-08-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: India tests a million samples in one day||India tested more than 1 million samples for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in a day, official data showed on Saturday, achieving a target that could be instrumental in controlling the pandemic even as infections of the viral disease continue to mount steadily and spread to emerging hot spots in the country.On Friday, 1,023,836 tests to detect Covid-19 were conducted across the country, the Union health ministry said.India conducted an average 889,935 tests in the previous five days, testing around 74.7 people per 100,000 population, much higher than the World Health Organization’s guidelines of testing 14 people per 100,000 population, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).While reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests remain the gold standard for diagnosing Covid-19, rapid antigen testing has also played a key role in scaling up diagnoses of the disease at a larger scale. According to an ICMR official who spoke on condition of anonymity, since rapid antigen testing was approved for diagnosis in India on June 14, about 40% of the overall tests were done using this method.In total, India has performed 34.4 million (34,491,073) tests since January 22 when Covid-19 testing started with one lab at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune. As of Saturday, testing was being done at 1,511 labs across the country. Of them, 983 labs are in the government sector and 528 are private labs.The data from states such as Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh showed the percentage of antigen tests was lower than the national average.Experts say that to control the outbreak, aggressive testing is crucial. In this case, the number of Covid-19 cases diagnosed in the country is likely to see an increase before it starts seeing a dip, indicating that the spread is slowing. Until Saturday, India recorded 3,041,463 cases and 56,837 deaths.“To curtail an infectious disease from spreading, one must be able to identify, through testing, as many infected individuals as possible in time so that they are isolated and put on treatment,” T Jacob John, former head of virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, had said.A July 7 column in this newspaper suggested a target of a million tests a day.Much of the recent increase in testing can be attributed to the growing role of antigen tests in the states. Antigen, or rapid, tests usually provide results within hours and are relatively cheap. These kits are designed to detect antigens (substances in our bodies that stimulate an immune response) and can be performed in mobile stations and don’t necessarily need labs. The downside is that they have a far higher chance of returning false negatives (showing infected people as uninfected), and thus can let cases slide under the radar.The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, on the other hand, is the gold-standard for Covid-19 testing and is the most definitive test available. It is used for the detection of nucleic acid from Sars-CoV-2 and is based on PCR, a process that duplicates and amplifies genetic fragments of the virus, so that it becomes easily detectable. The downside is that the process, from samples collection to results, for these can generally take 24-48 hours and needs dedicated machines.HT has repeatedly pointed out that antigen tests are best used when time is a constraint and results are needed quickly – in a containment zone or a hot spot, for instance.In terms of states, the wide disparity in testing rates remains as higher-than-average testing states have continued to fuel the nationwide boost to testing numbers in the past weeks. While Delhi has tested 70,300 people per million of its population, Madhya Pradesh has tested 13,788. All Indian states are testing above the 140-per-million daily benchmark recommended by the World Health Organization, but this is an inadequate number. The national average of tests is currently 580 per day per million population. “Through our ardent efforts, it was ensured that specific testing platforms are made available addressing general testing (RT-PCR), High-throughput testing (COBAS), testing at remotest places and Primary Health Centres (TrueNAT, CBNAAT), in containment areas (rapid antigen testing) and for large number & migrant population testing (pooled sample testing)… The ultimate goal is that testing should be available to everyone in need and no one should be left behind,” ICMR said in a statement. The Union health ministry tweeted on Saturday: “Early identification through testing, prompt and effective treatment through supervised home isolation and quality medical care, and innovative graded policy measures have resulted in almost 100% increase in recovered cases in the last 21 days.”In an interview with Hindustan Times, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan underscored how the government was aggressively pursuing its targets. “We have met our goal of doing one million Covid-19 tests a day at least six weeks ahead of target – just as we have done in the past for other goals. When we promised to take testing up to 100,000 a day by May 31, we achieved that target by May 10. A few weeks ago, I had promised to reach the one million a day mark in 12 weeks. And now look at our progress,” he said.ICMR director general Balram Bhargava, in a recent briefing, said the research body adopted an intelligent and calibrated approach to meet the testing requirement based on requirements on ground, with greater focus on regions where there was lack of testing facilities. “In a diverse country like India, for equitable access to testing, optimization of resources based on the evolving epidemic was an essential part of the sustainable scaling up. Due to the concerted, focused and collaborative efforts of the Centre, State/UT government along with dedicated support of lakhs of front-line workers we have ensured the successful implementation of testing aggressively, tracking comprehensively and treating efficiently which has enabled us to rapidly increase the number of tests done per day,” he said on meeting the one-million target.Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said: “To be able to do one million tests in a day is a big achievement not just for a developing country like India but also by the standards of a developed country. Since I was actively involved in the field and know how difficult it is to set up infrastructure for this scale of testing, including adequately trained manpower. Before the H1N1 pandemic hit us in 2009, hardly five labs were doing RT-PCR testing, and we began ramping up since then but one-million tests in over 1,500 labs capable of RT-PCR is indeed a great achievement, and is going to hold us in good stead in dealing with such outbreaks in future also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tests-a-million-samples-in-one-day/story-acqhK7fBFKRqSt0AjK30FL.html

These glasses have been lying in a drawer for the best part of 50 years. The vendor literally told me to throw them away if they were ‘no good’. Now he gets a life-changing sum of money”.“It’s the ‘good news’ story that we all want – as an elderly gentleman, our vendor has probably had a rough time in recent months and to be able to change his life is just incredible. The price is outstanding, but it’s not about the money.”“We had interest from all over the world – bids came from India, Qatar, American, Russia, Canada. It’s completely spellbinding, and a wonderful thing to be a part of. It’s been a complete honour to handle these spectacles and find them a new home.”The glasses were in the vendor’s family for nearly a century, given to his uncle by Gandhi between 1920 and 1930. The uncle was working with British Petroleum in South Africa, where Gandhi spent years before returning to India to launch the freedom struggle.“It can be presumed that these (glasses) were gifted by way of thanks from Gandhi for some good deed. A note from the vendor is included,” the auctioneer said.The glasses were described by the auctioneer as being “of usual form, with sprung gold plated arms and prescription lenses. Jointed by a gold plated nose bar. The spectacles formed an important and somewhat iconic part of Gandhi’s overall appearance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhi-s-glasses-sell-for-260-000-in-auction/story-JirhEa1ket5n83A3iKdcML.html
23-08-2020||India||Uttar Pradesh passes bill to recover damage costs||The Uttar Pradesh state assembly on Saturday passed several important bills, including the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Properties Bill 2020 which empowers the state to put up hoardings/posters of the protestors at public places and recover from them the cost of damages to property. The House passed the key bill amid protests by Opposition members who entered the Well with banners and raised slogans against the state of law and order, handling of the coronavirus pandemic and floods in Uttar Pradesh. Once the bills were passed, the Monsoon Session, which was scheduled to continue till Monday, was adjourned sine die after Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna abruptly moved a proposal for it.“In all, 27 bills were tabled in the assembly and passed by the House. The average attendance of MLAs was above 300,” news agency PTI quoted Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit as saying. “It took 60 to 90 minutes,” he added.All of these bills will now be sent to governor Anandiben Patel for final approval.The Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Properties Bill 2020 will replace the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Properties Ordinance 2020 that was promulgated earlier this year in the backdrop of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. As per the statement of object and reasons, the bill aims at dealing with “all acts of violence at public places and to control its persistence and escalation, and to provide for the recovery of damage to public or private property during hartal, bandh, riots, public commotion or protests”.Hitting out at the government, senior Samajwadi Party MLA Mehboob Ali (from Amroha Assembly constituency) told PTI, “Never in the past it has happened that all the rules of democracy have been openly flouted, and the bills have been passed on Saturday. You can check the previous records.” UP Congress chief and MLA from Tamukhiraj Assembly constituency Ajay Kumar Lallu also attacked the state government. “The intention of the government was to not run the House, and it was only indulging in allegation and counter-allegation. Democracy and the constitutional values were murdered. Imagine 27 bills were passed in a single day. What does this mean? Discussion on 27 bills would have needed 12 days for detailed discussions to find shortcomings,” Lallu told PTI.Among the bills which were passed were the Uttar Pradesh Public Health and Epidemic Disease Control Bill, 2020 and Cow-Slaughter Prevention (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Uttar Pradesh Public Health and Epidemic Disease Control Bill 2020 aims at ensuring stricter punishment for those harassing coronavirus frontline workers, which includes doctors, paramedical staff, police personnel and sanitation personnel. Spitting on any worker is also considered an offence under this. The Cow Slaughter Prevention (Amendment) Bill 2020 provides for stricter punishment for violators and permits the prosecution of the driver and owner of the vehicle used to carry a cow for the purpose of slaughter. It penalises cow slaughter with jail terms ranging from a minimum of one year to a maximum of 10 years and imposes monetary fine between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-passes-bill-to-recover-damage-costs/story-m2SQoi1QDXDIrgqkjl1YiO.html
23-08-2020||India||Jammu and Kashmir leaders to strive for special status, statehood||Top Kashmiri leaders, who signed the Gupkar declaration last year, have decided to strive for the restoration of Article 370 and 35A, the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and its statehood, six political parties said in a joint statement on Saturday.National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti, Congress state president Ghulam Ahmad Mir, CPI (M) general secretary MY Tarigami, Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Gani Lone and Awami National Conference vice president Muzuffar Shah issued the first such statement by mainstream parties after the nullification of Article 370 on August 5, 2019.“We all reiterate that we are bound, wholly, by the contents of the Gupkar declaration and will unwaveringly adhere to it. We are committed to strive for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, the Constitution of J&K and the restoration of the State and any division of the State is unacceptable to us. We unanimously reiterate that there can be ‘nothing about us without us’”, the joint statement said.The statement said the signatories to the Gupkar declaration of August 4, 2019, have barely managed to establish a basic level of communication with each other in the face of a series of “prohibitive and punitive” curbs imposed by the government, aimed at “impeding” all social and political interactions.The central government nullified Articles 370 and 35A, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir and gave its residents certain privileges, last August and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one.As protests erupted, several political leaders and activists including former chief ministers were detained as a preventive measure, and curbs on movement and communication imposed.While most of the curbs have been lifted in a phased manner and prominent politicians such as ex-CMs Farooq and Omar Abdullah released, about 20 leaders, including PDP’s Mufti, are still in detentionLast year, the Gupkar declaration was signed in a meeting of the political leadership of Kashmir at NC chief Farooq Abdullah’s residence at Srinagar’s Gupkar Road (that’s how the declaration got its name). It stressed that “all the parts would be united in their resolve to protect and defend identity, autonomy and special special status of the J&K against all attacks and onslaughts whatsoever”. Laying stress on a collective political fight, Saturday’s statement said: “The limited confabulations held within the constraints imposed have resulted in this unanimous resolution that the unfortunate events of 5th August 2019 have unrecognizably changed the relationship between J&K and New Delhi. In a spitefully shortsighted and unconstitutional move, Articles 370 and 35A were abrogated and the State was bifurcated and relegated to the status of two Union Territories and its Constitution tried to be made unenforceable.”“The measures attempt to redefine who we are. These changes were accompanied by repressive measures meant to silence people and coerce them into submission, and continue unabated,” it added.The statement also expressed gratitude towards people, political parties, the intelligentsia and other civil society groups for opposing the Centre’s August 5 move.PDP president Mufti could not attend the meeting since she continues to be in detention. However, her daughter tweeted to express her support for the principle of a ‘joint struggle’ as expressed in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-leaders-to-strive-for-special-status-statehood/story-kH7oCnPBoaHfvUBHulA8gN.html
23-08-2020||India||Kerala minister: Ready to face any probe over holy book consignment||Kerala high education minister KT Jaleel said he is ready for a probe, amid reports that the Union finance ministry directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to probe the alleged import of holy books and acceptance of contribution from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate. While investigating the Kerala gold smuggling case, in which 30 kilograms (kg) of gold was seized by the customs on July 5 from a diplomatic consignment, investigating agencies in March had stumbled upon another consignment, weighing more than 4,000 kg, at the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Later, the minister had admitted that these were 31 consignments of Quran, meant for distribution in his constituency. He also said the consular office provided money for food kits to be distributed in his constituency. “Let any agency probe it. I am least worried because I did not do anything wrong. Among 31 bags arrived, only one bag was opened. Anybody can examine them. I think distributing Quran is not a big crime either,” Jaleel said. However, members of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that some of the boxes carried gold. They alleged that the minister was using religion to camouflage his alleged wrongdoings. Diplomatic experts said religious books can’t be imported in this manner and the minister can be charged under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, for receiving funds from a foreign country without the permission of the ministry of external affairs. Jaleel came under the scanner after his name figured prominently in the call list of Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the gold smuggling racket. But he insisted he interacted with Suresh as a diplomatic official and he did not know of her background or other dealings. Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency, which is heading the multi-agency probe in the gold smuggling case, told a special court in Kochi that blue corner notices will be issued to four more persons staying abroad to unearth larger conspiracy in the case. It also said during investigation it found that a well-organised racket was functioning in the state, wielding influence in the higher echelons of power. The NIA has arrested 20 persons in connection with the case so far. It told the court that the accused had conspired to damage the monetary stability of the country and destabilising the economy by smuggling large quantities of gold from abroad, and it is suspected that they had used the proceeds of smuggling for financing terrorism through various means.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-ready-to-face-any-probe-over-holy-book-consignment/story-VIhqnUgQcVWwIMD0foF8dP.html
23-08-2020||India||Foundation takes up land for mosque||Members of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) on Saturday officially took possession of the five-acre land allotted to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village for construction of a mosque in compliance with the Supreme Court verdict of November 9 last year. IICF members said they also took measurements at the site. Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation is the trust formed by the board to look after the development of the five-acre plot. Besides a mosque, a hospital, community kitchen, research centre and a library are likely to come up on the land. “We visited the site today and took measurements of the land for a topography plan of IICF. On the visit to Dhannipur, I was accompanied by Imran Ahmad, a trustee,” said Athar Hussain, secretary and spokesperson for IICF. Hussian said after the demarcation work, which was completed by the local Sohawal tehsil, it was necessary to have exact dimensions of the five-acre plot in order to prepare an architectural plan for the complex. IICF had recently said the mosque on the land is likely to be known as ‘Masjid Dhannipur’. Many suggestions had come and the name ‘Masjid Dhannipur’ topped the list, it had said. IICF has also invited applications from architects across the country to help with the design of the mosque that would be built on the Indo-Islamic theme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foundation-takes-up-land-for-mosque/story-0L9KaH1qsxxclAOZPu5JGO.html
23-08-2020||India||Supreme Court sets Sept 30 deadline to complete Babri trial||The Supreme Court has set a new deadline of September 30 for completing trial and pronouncing the verdict in the criminal case against BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti for the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.The apex court had in May asked the special judge, Surendra Kumar Yadav, to complete the trial and deliver its judgment by August 31. A three-judge bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman extended the deadline by one more month after taking into account a report by Yadav stating that the trial was at its fag end.“Having read the report of Mr. Surendra Kumar Yadav, learned Special Judge, and considering that the proceedings are at the fag end, we grant one month’s time, i.e., till September 30, 2020, to complete the proceedings including delivery of judgment,” the bench which also comprised justices Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee said in its order passed on August 19.This would be the fourth instance of the top court setting a deadline for completion of trial in the case. The BJP leaders are on trial for the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. They have been charged for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including promoting enmity between religious groups (section 153A), making statements affecting national integration (section 153B) or which are likely to cause public mischief (section 505).In April 2017, the Supreme Court ordered that an additional charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120B of the IPC should be framed against the accused BJP leaders. The apex court had also ordered the special court to complete the trial within two years.Subsequently, the court had taken up the matter in July 2019 and extended the deadline for completion of trial and delivering the verdict by nine months.That deadline expired on April 19 and special judge Yadav wrote to the apex court on May 6 this year seeking a further extension. The court then took up the matter on May 8 and set a deadline of August 31 while also asking Yadav to make use of video-conferencing facilities to ensure that recording of evidence is complete and there is no inordinate delay in concluding the trial.Meanwhile, the top court on November 9 last year decided the title suit to the disputed site at Ayodhya in favour of Hindu parties while also acknowledging that the demolition of the Babri Masjid which stood at the site was a “calculated act”.“During the pendency of the suits, the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship. The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago,” the November 9 judgment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-sept-30-deadline-to-complete-babri-trial/story-6yF9uhvUwKPluIkNJvYAAO.html
23-08-2020||India||India records highest 1-day spike in recoveries at 63,631||The country on Saturday recorded the highest ever single day spike in recoveries with 63,631 coronavirus disease patients recovering from the viral infection. This has to led a further decline in the case fatality rate, or deaths among people diagnosed with Covid-19, which stands at a new low of 1.87%.The development came on a day the total Covid-19 cases in India crossed the 3 million mark. On Saturday, the total recoveries crossed 2.2 million, with recoveries exceeding the active cases by at least 1.5 million cases, according to ministry of health data. Active cases comprise 23.43% of the Covid-19 cases in the country.The recovery rate is 74.69%, with a high number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients being discharged from the hospitals and those with mild and moderate disease under home isolation being declared free from Covid-19.An improved understanding of the disease and evolved treatment protocols have helped to reduce the number of critical patients in need of ventilator support, said clinicians.“At the start of the pandemic in March and April, ventilation was the global standard of care given to Covid-19 patients, but over the months, we learned we could delay intubation by using new drugs and other treatment methods, such as awake-proning, where a patient is asked to lie on the stomach without ventilation. The fatality rate of Covid-19 patients on ventilation globally is 40%-70%, so treating them without ventilation helped recovery,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman of anaesthesiology and critical care, Medanta-The Medicity, who has been treating Covid-19 patients since the first week of March.Under the health ministry’s standardised clinical management protocol, mild and moderate cases are treated under supervised home isolation, while critical and severe patients are hospitalized in isolation wards and ICUs, depending on severity of disease.“Non-invasive oxygen, better skilled doctors in the ICUs and hospitals, improved ambulance services and streamlining of treatment protocols have led to deaths rates falling. As more new drugs and treatments get approved, we aim to bring the case fatality rate to under 1%,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity. The ramping up of health infrastructure across states has also helped in better management of Covid-19 cases, doctors on the frontline said. “In the first two months of the pandemic, treatment was available only in a few tertiary care hospitals, but now standardised treatment is available in isolation at secondary hospitals that now have the required infrastructure, including isolation wards ICU beds, oxygen supply, ventilators, medicines, and ambulances, among other essentials needed in every hospital,” said Dr Mehta. “States have been asked to address the issues of low lab utilization of less than 100 tests per day for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 10 for others; low tests per million population; decrease in absolute tests from last week; delay in test results; availability of ambulances; high infection among healthcare workers; and timely referral and hospitalization to prevent deaths,” said the ministry official.“There is need to closely monitor asymptomatic cases under home isolation through physical visits/phone consultation as some states reported high death rates within 48 hours of hospital admission because people were beginning treatment when the disease has progressed and the patient is already critical,” said the ministry official.The Centre is continuing to handhold states and districts that need support. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, holds virtual sessions on Tuesdays and Fridays, where a team of specialists provides guidance on effective clinical management of Covid-19 patients in the ICUs through tele/video consultation.Strict surveillance of pregnant women, older adults, and people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and obesity, has also helped in the early identification of high-risk populations for timely assessment and preparedness. “Clinicians do the best they can and science can only do so much, and we have to make protective behavior a part of our everyday lives as mild and asymptomatic people can also spread infection. Population behavior has a huge role to play in infection control and people must wear masks, maintain social distancing and wash hands frequently to protect themselves and others and contain the spread of Covid-19,” said Dr Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-highest-1-day-spike-in-recoveries-at-63-631/story-gp1CLAGLVr0hXfbvHWBm5O.html
23-08-2020||India||No restrictions on interstate and intrastate movement: MHA order||Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday asked all the states to make sure that there are no restrictions on interstate and intrastate movement of persons and goods during the ongoing unlocking process. The home secretary cited Unlock-3 guidelines dated July 29 while asking the state governments and administrations of Union territories not to stop people at borders. This includes movement of persons and goods for land border trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) was forced to intervene as there were reports that local-level restrictions on movement were being imposed by various districts and states. Bhalla said in his letter reviewed by HT: “Such restrictions are creating problems in interstate movement of goods and services and are impacting the supply chain, resulting in disruption in economic activities and employment.” The unlock guidelines clearly state that there shall be no restrictions on interstate and intrastate movement of persons and goods, he said in the letter. The guidelines also stated that no separate permission, approval or e-permit will be required for movement of persons and goods for crossing state borders. Bhalla said that restrictions amount to the violation of guidelines issued by the MHA (ministry of home affairs) under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The home ministry didn’t specify on Saturday which states were violating the guidelines. The Unlock-3 is currently in force till August 31. The unlock process began on June 1 with the opening of industrial activities and offices across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-restrictions-on-movement-mha/story-iylqwo4s7PG37TywDfXFvL.html
23-08-2020||India||‘Priority to compelling cases in distress’: Centre issues SOPs for international travellers||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Saturday issued a standard operating protocol (SOP) for international travel on non-scheduled commercial flights under the Vande Bharat scheme and the air transport bubble arrangement. The SOP, reviewed by HT, states that people desirous to travel to India on Vande Bharat flights will register themselves with the Indian missions in the country where they are stranded/residing, along with necessary details as prescribed by the ministry of external affairs (MEA). On the other hand, people coming to India on flights operating under air bubble arrangement will not need to register themselves with the Indian missions. India so far has bilateral air travel arrangements or ‘air bubbles’ with the US, the UK, Germany, France, Qatar, Maldives and the UAE while negotiations are going on with 13 more countries. The Vande Bharat flights have been operating since May 6 and currently the scheme is in its fifth phase. The SOP issued on Saturday said that priority will be given to compelling cases in distress, including workers who have been laid off, short-term visa holders faced with expiry of visas, persons with medical emergency, pregnant women, elderly people or those required to return to India due to death of family member, and students. For inbound passengers, the MEA (ministry of external affairs) will prepare flight/ship wise database of all travellers, including details such as name, age, gender, mobile number, place of residence, place final destination, and information on RT-PCR test taken and its result. “This database will be shared by MEA with the respective state/UT in advance (where the passenger is heading),” the SOP reads. It said that “in case of people travelling to India under the air bubble arrangement, passenger manifest containing the same details as above for Vande Bharat flights or in a revised format as may be finalised by the MEA with the country concerned, will be submitted by the airlines to the Indian mission in the country concerned before operation of each flight with a copy to the state/UT government of the destination port in India”. All travellers coming to India will have to give an undertaking that they are making the journey at their own risk, according to the SOP. In case of people desirous to travel out of India under these two programmes, they will have to apply to the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) or to an agency designated by it for this purpose, along with necessary details, including the place of departure and arrival, the SOP issued on Saturday said. It said that Indian seafarers seeking to accept contracts to serve on vessels abroad can travel on non-scheduled commercial flights as allowed by the civil aviation ministry or flights arranged by their employers subject to clearance given by the ministry of shipping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-sops-for-international-travellers/story-s16PBGXSfgvUMPG9KcfKEP.html
23-08-2020||India||With over 70k cases, India’s tally crosses 3 million mark||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India crossed the 3 million mark on Saturday, with the country reporting 70,182 fresh infections as the pathogen finds news hot spots across the country amid efforts by the Centre to stop the situation from spiralling out of control.India became the third country in the world, after the US and Brazil, to report more than three million Covid-19 cases — the third million coming in a little over two weeks. With 914 new deaths on Saturday, the total number of patients who succumbed to Covid-19 in India reached 56,837. The total number of Covid-19 cases stood at 3,041,463India’s case fatality rate, which is the total number of deaths among the laboratory-confirmed cases, however, has been steadily declining to become one of the lowest in the world.Also read | ‘Confident that Covid-19 vaccine will be developed by end of 2020’: Health minister Harsh VardhanExperts maintain the focus of the battle against the infectious disease needs to shift to the hinterland and the peninsula, both high population density regions with, in the case of the former, significant rural populations and relatively inadequate health care systems.“As a result of various measures taken by the government, the outbreak situation in India is very much under control. The health care infrastructure is not overwhelmed, the testing capacity is more than enough to meet the demand and even the percentage of Cocvid-19 patients on ventilator is very minuscule,” said a senior official of the Union health ministry, asking not to be named.Previously, India’s journey to two million cases took 158 days, with at least 90% of these cases coming after the lifting of the nationwide lockdown that was announced at the end of March.India’s current case positivity rate, which gives the number of cases that return positive out of all the samples that are tested, is about 8%. Many states have positivity rates lower than the national average.Dr Gagandeep Kang, clinician scientist, formerly with the Translational Health Science And Technology Institute, said: “The numbers we are seeing (in India) are expected given our population and this rate of cases is likely to continue because there are many parts of the country where the epidemic is just starting, though there are some cities where the first peak is over.”Experts in epidemiology said increased testing had a role to play but also that the number of positive cases were directly linked to the number of tests that were being done. “The number of cases reported ultimately is a function of the number of tests that we do,” said Dr Tarun Bhatnagar, senior epidemiologist, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology.Also read | Anti-fibrotic drugs effective in Covid-19 patients: ArmyDr Shobha Broor, former head, department of microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said: “For a country like India to have just about 3 million positive cases in an outbreak of this nature means we have done very well. Aggressive testing clearly has a role to play in keeping the numbers low as detecting and isolating cases early, and successful contact tracing is what is important in effectively controlling outbreaks in the long run.”However, experts also warn that it is too early to say categorically whether India was on the path to controlling the epidemic. “It is so far so good but we will have to wait and watch how this pandemic pans out in the long run,” said Dr Broor. Dr Bhatnagar said: “We are doing wonderfully well if we look at from where we started and where we are standing now, but we will be always catching up because of our huge population density. It is not feasible to test everyone and it is not required also; what is required is for people to make Covid-19 appropriate behavioral changes that will eventually change the course of the epidemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-over-70k-cases-india-s-tally-crosses-3-million-mark/story-InmGaAOMezFC3ImKOWL46M.html

23-08-2020||India||Kamal Nath imposed curbs at secretariat: Jyotiraditya Scindia||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Saturday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown during Covid-19 pandemic to save lives, but former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath imposed a lockdown on common man’s entry into the state secretariat. “Kamal Nath ji was ahead of Modi ji in imposing lockdown restrictions that he did 15 months prior to what Modi ji did. But whereas Modi ji imposed the lockdown restrictions on the country to save the lives of people from Coronavirus, Kamal Nath ji imposed it on common man’s entry to the state secretariat Vallabh Bhavan,” said Scindia while addressing the BJP’s 3-day membership campaign in Gwalior, his home turf.The state is likely to witness bypolls to 27 assembly constituencies by mid-October. He said people had voted the Congress to power in 2018 assembly elections with a lot of expectations that they would see an honest and transparent government which would fulfil their aspirations but there was rampant corruption in the government. Public couldn’t get access to Vallabh Bhavan (state secretariat), while industrialists and businessmen were seen inside it. “I raised my voice for public and withdrew my support to the government to serve people of the state,” he added. Addressing the gathering chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “When Scindia ji raised his voice for people then the then chief minister Kamal Nath asked him to take to streets. However, Scindia ji brought down the Congress government itself on road. We will work together for progress and development of Gwalior-Chambal region,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nath-imposed-curbs-at-secretariat-scindia/story-GcXfxS0r7QqALnPNP2nasK.html
23-08-2020||India||CWC crucial meet tomorrow, convincing Rahul Gandhi to return as party president on agenda||The Congress has called a meeting of its working committee on Monday following calls within the party to conduct internal elections and convince Rahul Gandhi to return as the party president, Congress functionaries familiar with the matter said.The lease of 24, Akbar Road where the party headquarters is situation is also likely to be on the agenda. The lease is set to expire on November 30.“There have been repeated attempts by leaders, young and old, to convince Rahul Gandhi to return at the helm,” said a Congress functionary. The meeting comes in the backdrop of various leaders seeking ‘transparent elections’ for the top post and the party’s top decision-making body. Rahul Gandhi had resigned from the post of the party chief following the party’s loss in the Lok Sabha elections last year – the party won only 52 seats. Sonia Gandhi was then appointed the interim chief. The secretary (organisation) has asked that all members, permanent invitees and special invitees to be present for the meeting, Congress functionaries said. The party is facing an imminent leadership crisis with many Congress leaders such as Sanjay Jha, who was expelled from the party, questioning the functioning of the top leadership. Jha, on August 17 tweeted, that a “100 Congress leaders (including MP’s), distressed at the state of affairs within the party, have written a letter to Mrs Sonia Gandhi, Congress President, asking for change in political leadership and transparent elections in CWC”. The party had dismissed the statement saying that Jha was spreading canards at the behest of the BJP Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor has also repeatedly said that the party should hold elections to the CWC and the post of president. “We also need to arrest the growing public perception, fuelled by a dismissive media, that the Congress is adrift and rudderless, incapable of taking up the challenge of a credible national Opposition,” the former Union minister had told PTI on August 9.Tharoor added that the Congress needs to ‘urgently address’ the issue by ‘expediting the process of finding a full-term president, through a participatory and democratic process that will offer the winning candidate a legitimate mandate and the credibility that will be indispensable in ushering in much needed organisational and structural revival of the party’.Most Congress leaders, however, were unaware of the points for discussion for the meeting till late Saturday evening. “We found out from KC Venugopal’s tweet that the meeting is happening on Monday,” said a Congress functionary who did not wish to be named. Venugopal, general secretary (organisation), tweeted “A meeting of the Congress Working Committee will be held on Monday, the 24th August, 2020 at 11.00 AM via video conferencing.”A second Congress leader said that he had not received a call for the meeting until late Saturday evening as well. A test run, however, was conducted for the meeting on Saturday to ensure that the leaders who are not familiar with the video conferencing application WebX can familiarise themselves. Congress had until now conducted their virtual meetings over Zoom. Nearly 35 leaders attended the test run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-to-hold-crucial-meeting-tomorrow/story-gBzj7yOziY0jCZJAisJyjP.html

23-08-2020||India||‘Scapegoat’: Court’s biting remarks on FIRs against Tablighi Jamaat members||The Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench on Friday struck down criminal cases registered against 34 people, including 28 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members, in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district, saying foreign nationals were virtually persecuted.“A political Government tries to find scapegoat when there is pandemic or calamity, and the circumstances show that there is probability that these foreigners were chosen to make them scapegoats,” said a bench of justice TV Nalawade and justice MG Sewlikar. “The material of the present matter shows that the propaganda against the so-called religious activity was unwarranted.”The Jamaat hit the headlines in March when authorities blamed a congregation at its headquarters in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area for a jump in Covid-19 infections. The headquarters was sealed and thousands of attendees, including foreigners from countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the US, were quarantined. Police initially filed a case against Jamaat chief Maulana Saad for violating a ban on big gatherings. He was later booked for culpable homicide, which carries a maximum punishment of 10-year imprisonment.The Jamaat, which has followers in over 80 countries, maintained many visitors at its headquarters were stranded after the government declared a lockdown to check the pandemic spread. The Centre blacklisted around 1,500 foreign Tablighi members for violating their visa norms and multiple cases were registered against them across the country, including in Maharashtra.The high court said foreigners having valid visas to enter India cannot be prevented from visiting mosques if they go there to observe religious practices.“It is true that in view of wording of Article 19 [the right to freedom of speech and expression] of the Constitution of India, the freedoms given under this Article are not available to foreigners, a person who is not the citizen of India,” it said. “However, it needs to be kept in mind that when permission is given to the foreigners to come to India under visa, Article 25 [freedom of professing religion] comes in to play. Then Articles 20 and 21 [that relate to fundamental rights] are also available to the foreigners.”All the foreigners, who petitioned the high court, had participated in the Nizamuddin congregation and thereafter gave religious lectures at mosques in Ahmednagar district allegedly in violation of lockdown norms in the last week of March. Initially, cases were registered against the trustees of mosques where the foreigners had stayed.All the 34 accused, including the foreigners, moved the high court seeking quashing of the criminal cases registered against them. The foreigners contended they came to India on valid visas and argued they were here mainly to experience Indian culture, tradition, hospitality and food. They said on their arrival at airports, they were screened for Covid-19.The foreigners argued they were struck in Ahmednagar after the imposition of the nationwide lockdown because of the suspension of the transportation services. They said that is why they stayed at mosques.Ahmednagar police maintained the Jamaat members were found preaching and so cases were registered against them. They added the foreigners were arrested after institutional quarantine and subsequently five of them were found to be infected.The police insisted there was sufficient material to indicate the accused had breached lockdown norms and visa conditions.The court cited guidelines and added foreigners visiting India on tourist visas are prevented from engaging in preaching activity. But it noted under the recently updated visa manual, there is no restriction on foreigners for visiting religious places and attending normal religious activities like attending discourses although tourist visas limit the purposes of a visit to recreation and site seeing.“Social and religious tolerance is a practical necessity for unity and integrity in India and that is also made compulsory by our Constitution. By hard work over the past years after independence, we have reconciled religion and modernity to a great extent. This approach helps participation of most in a developing process. We have been respecting both religious and secular sensibilities since independence and by this approach, we have kept India as united,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bombay-hc-strikes-down-cases-against-28-foreign-tablighi-members/story-Ux4qS1ouqyGS7JZNjOjqiJ.html
23-08-2020||Editorials||A letter rocks the Congress||According to a report in The Indian Express, 23 senior leaders of the Congress — including former chief ministers, former Union ministers, members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), senior office-bearers — have written a letter to the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi. In it, they have acknowledged the erosion in the support base of the party and pointed to the lack of honest introspection after electoral defeats. The leaders have also outlined an agenda for reform — a full-time, effective, active and visible president; elections at all levels in the party (including CWC); establishing an institutional leadership model to collectively guide the party; a national coalition with like-minded parties, among other steps. For weeks, rumours of the letter have swirled around but been strenuously denied by some of its signatories. The report came a day ahead of an important CWC meeting. The letter comes in the backdrop of the exit of young leaders of the Congress over the past year, increased factionalism in state units, a continued sense of drift over the direction of the party, and uncertainty about leadership — even as Narendra Modi continues to enjoy high levels of popularity. Ever since the 2014 polls, and definitely more so since 2019, many observers outside the party have pointed to the structural, organisational, ideological, and personality-centric weaknesses of the Congress — this view was shared by insiders too, but they weren’t willing to speak up publicly. The true significance of the letter is not as much in what it says but the fact that it has finally been said, by a cross-section of party leaders — from the north and south, old and young, those experienced in electoral politics and those more comfortable with policy. Having served the Congress for decades, they are speaking from a position of anguish and a desire to see the party do better.The letter is also significant because of what it does not say. By emphasising on collective leadership, it is signalling to the Nehru-Gandhi family that the entire notion of the control of party high command needs to be redesigned. By asking for elections at each level, it is seeking democratisation of the organisation. By calling for a president who meets various qualities, it is suggesting that an absent leadership, with limited mass connect, would not be able to revive the party’s fortunes — this is even more important because the face of the party needs to have the abilities and stature to challenge Mr Modi in 2024. The letter recognises the scale of the challenge faced by the Grand Old Party. For its own sake, and for the sake of Indian democracy, the Congress should act on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-letter-rocks-the-congress/story-v5Dsa7D3feJehiQbsKqBDP.html
