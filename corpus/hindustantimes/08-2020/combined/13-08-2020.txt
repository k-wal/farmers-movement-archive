13-08-2020||News||NEP 2020: Where it scores, where it falters | Opinion||As the education secretary during whose tenure the National Education Policy (NEP) process started, I am fortunate to see its completion. I congratulate my successors who, as policy managers, made it happen, navigating the minefield on something as contentious as the education policy. This could not have been possible without the visionary stewardship of K Kasturirangan.In policymaking, the paths chosen are the most important. Following best practices everywhere is one path. But will it be equitable and achievable in a country like India? The challenge in choosing paths in policy is not choosing what seems best, but also ascertaining whether the best is workable. Is it equitable enough or an attempt at branding which helps only a small percentage? Does the architecture exacerbate exclusion, while paying lip service to inclusion? These are the touchstones on which the policy must be assessed.There are different approaches to policymaking. One can change the question to suit the answers. Any government will have its low-hanging fruit and even ideological baggage. If it prioritises these elements, the government can change the questions. That would be an opportunistic compromise. But it has happened in the past. The second approach is to retain the questions, but come out with answers which are convenient to handle. That would be dishonest and unauthentic. On these two counts, NEP passes muster; it has done neither. But there is a third approach. Retain the questions, give attractive answers, knowing fully well that neither the political economy nor the ecosystem of education will have the capacity to meet the challenge head-on. Past policies fell short despite valiant efforts because there was no willingness to do things that are not necessarily popular. Sacking teachers, introducing differential salaries on performance, ensuring the attendance of teachers, calls for a degree of tenacity which has been missing. It is one thing to have a vision document and quite another to have a policy. Policy is meant for praxis. It is to be implemented effectively for impact. It is the prerogative of the government to prepare and choose a policy option among different policy choices, and use its special power to resolve conflict arising out of it. On NEP, here are some first-cut problems.The first problem of NEP is arriving at a budget of 6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for education with the states and the Centre striving to reach it. In reality, with 50% of the population below the age of 25, what is perhaps required is more than 10% of GDP. If a stand is taken that education, though under the Concurrent List, is mostly under the purview of the state, thus, the responsibility of states, we are running faster to stay in the same place. The Kothari Commission in 1966 suggested 6% of GDP as the advised outlay. After 54 years, we are nowhere near that. States, which have been further impoverished after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into effect, will be hit by a double whammy if this is passed on to them. The Centre will have to arrive at a mechanism to incentivise states and carefully take into account what states can really spend on their own. This requires reconfiguring existing budgetary priorities.The second problem is historical and centred on what the government intends to do with its institutions. An overwhelming majority of India’s population is financially stressed, and cannot seek services beyond government institutions or questionable private institutions. Education and health costs are similar. They are essential but tend to become expensive unless government institutions are accessed.So it is the same set of institutions, and the existing cohort of teachers and professors, which will be enjoined to deliver new outcomes. One-and-a-half million teachers, whose presence is more marked by absence, and professors who are not sure how the classes will fill up, are to be repurposed. Issues such as changes in the ecosystem, supervisory structure, and incentives and disincentives are too complicated to be left entirely to the states. My suggestion is that the transfer of money from the Centre for education should be contingent on a reform plan being implemented by the states.The third problem is an alarming fall in returns to education. From the enrolment of nearly 100% students at the primary level, it becomes 72% at upper primary, 52% at secondary, 43% in higher secondary and only 20% to levels above higher secondary. The National Statistical Office (NSO) reports show a clear deterioration in access between 2014 and 2018. It is as much a function of poor quality education and a lack of interest on one hand, and sharply falling returns to education on the other. The tragedy in India has been more unemployment for better-educated people. While the survey shows 6.8% as the unemployment rate, for school graduates it is 10.7%, for college graduates, it is 13.2%, and it is 35% for women graduates (CMIE data). Discrimination makes the picture more complicated. A jobless world, which is likely to further deteriorate with artificial intelligence and automation, is not the ideal place to think in terms of 50% gross enrolment ratio (GER) only because China adopted that figure and succeeded.There are other issues too. Introducing early childhood care and education through the anganwadi workers is an attempt to face a brave new world with a rusted system. In most places, these workers may not even be trainable. How well NEP has been designed in the context of India will depend upon how well the capacity is commensurate with efforts. After all policies are designed, not conceived in an inspired burst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/nep-2020-where-it-scores-where-it-falters/story-eiVXpNWfmPK2Td8151heHJ.html
13-08-2020||News||The disjunct between the promise and reality of GST | Opinion||The Goods and Services Tax regime completed three years on July 1. The concept of GST came in 2005 when the Vijay Kelkar-led task force submitted its report and recommended the replacement of all indirect taxes with GST. Even earlier, then finance minister Yashwant Sinha constituted a seven-member Expert Group on Taxation of Services as per his budget speech for FY2000-01. The expert group led by M Govinda Rao submitted its report in March 2001. The group made the first recommendation on GST. The dream became a reality when the new tax was introduced at the midnight of June 30 and July 1, 2017. It was introduced as the biggest tax reform for indirect taxes. But unfortunately, it has failed to live up to people’s expectations. To remove glitches, the government has made 697 changes in GST since its inception by issuing notifications related to rates, the amendment of rules and waiver of penalty. Besides this, 146 circulars and 19 orders have been issued so far on various issues. It was expected that the introduction of GST would increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country because a simplified tax structure will eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and increase government’s revenue. While there may be a set of complex factors that have led to a dip in growth, the fact is that the expected boost has not happened. The growth rate of GDP of Q4 of FY20 has declined to 3.1%. The growth rate of GDP for FY20 has fallen to 4.2% — the lowest in the last 11 years. The coding of goods under various Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) brackets has always been a challenge for the GST council. Take this example. In the recent past, the Authority for Advanced Rulings (AAR)-Karnataka bench has said that 18% GST will be levied on parathas and roti will be taxed at 5% of GST slabs rate. The AAR has ruled that a paratha is different from a roti. The same problem arose with the rate of tax on hand sanitiser. The AAR-Goa bench established that alcohol-based hand sanitisers will be taxed at 18%. Hand sanitisers are essential in the Covid-19 battle. While the GST Council has made efforts to resolve such issues, the fact that they keep recurring is a sign of the weakness of the system. Various states were ready to hop on to the same boat on the condition that the central government would compensate their revenue loss for the first five years. Accordingly, a provision was made under section 7 of GST (Compensation to State) Act, 2017. As per the provision, the loss of revenue will be compensated at the end of every two months for five years. When states were fighting against the pandemic and struggling for revenue in the middle of the lockdown, the Centre did not release compensation money, which had not been paid since November 2019. The Centre only released Rs 36,400 crore on June 4, due to the states and Union territories for the period starting from December 2019 to February 2020. The government further released Rs 13,806 crore for March 2020 on July 27, and paid all dues for FY20. The amount for April-July for FY21 is still due. While states need the compensation, the Centre seems to lack the resources to meet its commitment on a consistent basis. On the revenue front, there was an unofficial target to collect Rs 1 lakh crore GST every month. The average collection was Rs 89,885 crore in FY18, Rs 98,114 crore in FY19, though this improved to Rs 101,845 crore in FY20. The total revenue collection was Rs 7.19 lakh crore in the first eight months of FY18. The total revenue collection was Rs 11.77 lakh crore in FY19 and Rs 12.22 lakh crore in FY20. There was no budget provision made by the central government for FY18. The revised estimate was made of Rs 4.44 lakh crore. But the actual realisation was Rs 4.42 lakh crore. The government had made a budget provision of Rs 7.43 lakh crore for FY19. The target was revised downward to Rs 6.43 lakh crore in the midterm budget review for FY19. However, the actual realisation was Rs 5.81 lakh crore. The government has made a budgeted estimate of Rs 7.61 lakh crore for the collection of GST for FY20 in the interim budget. However, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s revised budget estimates to Rs 6.63 lakh crores in her maiden budget speech for FY20. The target was further revised to Rs 6.12 lakh crore. All these figures show a consistent overestimation of the collections. The government has already set a budgeted target of Rs 6.90 lakh crore for FY21. The collection for the first four months for FY21 is Rs 32,172 crore, Rs 62,151 crore, Rs 90,917 crore and Rs 87,422 crore respectively. The signs are clear. There will be a shortfall again, making the reality of GST more sobering than the promise of GST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-disjunct-between-the-promise-and-reality-of-gst/story-cfsbnyNWUNM6qYiAOmAC9K.html
13-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Storm sewer line to be installed to stop water accumulation on railway station road||: With an aim to stop water accumulation at railway station road (old GT road), starting from Rekhi cinema chowk to clock tower, the municipal corporation (MC) has decided to lay a new storm sewer line which will dump the accumulated water into the internal drain moving behind Bhadaur house.Area councillor Rakesh Prashar said, “An estimated Rs 35 lakh has been approved and tenders have been floated for the project. Bids will be opened on August 17, following which word order will be issued. This will bring huge relief to the shopkeepers, who are troubled due to water logging.” Area councillor Prashar and shopkeepers of the stretch have been raising the issue for a long time, but the MC has failed to find a solution for the water logging. The district headquarters of Congress and BJP are also situated on the road.Water accumulates on the stretch even after a short spells of rain causing vehicles to develop snags. Earlier, a proposal was made to install the line under Smart City Mission, but higher authorities rejected the proposal due to technical issues. The project is now being funded out of the councillor quota funds. The accumulated water also enters shops and shopkeepers rued that water logging also takes a toll on the business.One of the shopkeepers, Sukhpreet Singh said, “The water accumulation has been inconveniencing shopkeepers and commuters for a long time. No action has been taken by the MC despite several complaints. The shopkeepers have to keep some temporary structures handy to stop the water from entering their establishments.”Another shopkeeper, Ashok Kumar, said, “Water logging takes a toll on our business as it becomes difficult to cross the road even on vehicles after it rains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-storm-sewer-line-to-be-installed-to-stop-water-accumulation-on-railway-station-road/story-GIEhoZGYqGqn2EG1jHzr8L.html

This year, the entire FYJC admission process will be based on ‘zero contact’ owing to the Covid-19 situation. “We have provided data of students who have applied under various quotas to the colleges so that they can make calls to the students to seek details on an aspirant’s interest for applying to their institute. If interested, students can complete the entire process online and do not have to visit the college,” said a senior official from the department. Colleges have to complete quota admissions (also called the zero round) and update the status of admissions conducted on the portal for FYJC admissions by August 22. Students who wish to confirm their admissions will get a one-time password (OTP) on their phones, which they have to enter before securing a seat at a college. The same process would be conducted if a student wishes to cancel the admission. Once a student confirms admissions under any of the quotas, he/she will be out of the Centralised Admission Process (CAP) for general admission rounds. Meanwhile, until Thursday evening, around 70,000 students had filled Part 2 of their admission forms, which consists of their college preferences. The department started the process for filling the Part 2 forms from Wednesday. Admissions for students who are not applying under any quota will start from August 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admissions-education-department-facilitates-zero-contact-process-for-quota-round/story-4r5IVGZVjP7OlhQBZG0vcO.html

13-08-2020||City||Wildlife department writes to MCG over spilling of leachate into the Aravallis||The district wildlife department earlier this week wrote to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram(MCG), warning against spillage of leachate from the Bandhwari landfill into the surrounding Aravalli forests. The department’s notice to the MCG — dated August 11, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times — urges the civic body and Ecogreen Energy, its concessionaire for waste management, to rectify the issue, failing which prosecution may be initiated as per the Wildlife Protection Act (1972).The notice also warns that the wildlife department’s no objection certificate (NOC), which had been granted for setting up a waste management plant at the site, also stands to be revoked in case of continued violations. Signed by R Dangi, district wildlife officer, Gurugram, the notice says, that the area is a well-known wildlife habitat, which is the home to leopards, hyenas, hedgehogs, monitor lizards, black partridges, peafowls, cobras, jackals and mongoose. Ecogreen Energy, however, denied any wrongdoing on its part. In a response sent via a text message on Thursday evening, a company spokesperson, referring to a recent chemical analysis of leachate samples by the HSPCB, said, “Concerned department personnel visited the plant in the July and Aug, 2020. It appeared like a rainwater and was confirmed after conducting lab test. Bhandwari plant is designed and developed in such a way that no dirty water can go out (sic).”However, after experts raised concerns over the integrity of these findings, fresh leachate samples collected from the landfill site last week have been sent for testing to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s headquarters in Panchkula last week, as well as to a private laboratory in Delhi. “The lab reports are expected in a day or two. We will share the results when we receive them,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Gururgam, HSPCB. Rajesh, a junior engineer with the MCG who is currently overseeing day to day compliance at Bandhwari, said, “We have not let any leachate runoff happen this monsoon. We have built an elevation at the edge of the dump to keep leachate inside. Because of rains the water level inside the landfill is a little high, but we will also complete building the boundary wall soon, once the water level recedes. We have also lined the edges of the dump with an impermeable material so the leachate doesn’t seep into the ground.” Despite repeated attempts, HT was unable to reach Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildlife-department-writes-to-mcg-over-spilling-of-leachate-into-the-aravallis/story-9qIH8MHItk3jq0lHZfbicL.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Rains bring long power cuts in many areas of Gurugram||Several residential colonies on both sides of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway witnessed long hours of power outage on Wednesday night after rain started at around 11pm. Residents of Palam Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Sector 45, Sector 40, Sushant Lok-1, Ardee City, Sector 31, Jalvayu Vihar, Sector 46 and several adjoining areas complained of unscheduled power cuts, which lasted for anywhere between six to eight hours. In some areas, residents complained, power did not come back till Thursday afternoon. Residents vented their anger on social media against the power distribution company for failing to provide them with adequate power. Many complained that the power infrastructure in the city poor, and even a light spell of rain leads to frequent power outages. Sanjeev Saxena, a resident of Sector 45 and an RWA member, said that power went off at around 11pm on Wednesday night and came back only at around 2pm on Thursday. “The DHBVN should inform the residents about such long hours of power cuts. There is no communication on the part of the distribution company and people, including Covid patients, are being left to suffer,” he said.Residents also said that the power outage hampered their work from home routine. A resident of Sector 45 said that his daughter is pursuing management studies and she could not study due to power outage. “It was only after the RWA president helped her to charge the laptop that she could appear for her virtual exam,” said Raj Bhateja.In many areas, the power supply was hampered due to faults in cables, said DHBVN officials, adding that the power was restored in the first half of the day. The residents, however, said that they had to remain without supply for almost 12 hours.The residents of Sushant Lok -1 complained that they had been facing trouble since the past several days but the power cut on Wednesday night was particularly bad. “The residents of Sushant Lok -1 suffered immensely due to the power cut that started at around 1am in the night,” said AK Nagpal, a resident.The consumers also complained that despite DHBVN repeatedly asserting that it was upgrading infrastructure across the city, the situation on the ground has improved very little. AK Munjal, a resident of Palam Vihar, wrote on Twitter, “The malaise is much older and continues, don’t know for how long. We are living in 21st century and that too in a millennium city contributing max to the state exchequer.(sic)” Chaitalee Mandhotra, a resident of Ardee City said that there was a major fault in their area, which took almost 12 hours to be fixed. “The situation was really bad and everyone, including senior citizens,suffered due to power cuts. The fall in temperature helped a bit though, she said.In response to these allegations, Joginder Hooda, superintendent engineer, DHBVN, however, said that he handles around 548 feeders in the city, out of which only 19 had suffered breakdowns on Wednesday night, due to snapping of wires because of rain and strong winds. “In the majority of the areas, electricity supply has been restored and our teams are working on the ground, trying to fix these issues since early morning. In many colonies developed by private realtors, the electricity infrastructure is less than adequate and this also the reason for the frequent disruptions in power supply. We had also carried out trimming of trees in many areas. However, during the monsoon season, tree branches fall, thereby snapping the power distribution cables,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rains-bring-long-power-cuts-in-many-areas-of-gurugram/story-PvIetbpAQPlkZvv2Mn6tLK.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s Covid count crosses 10,000, virus growth rate slows down||Gurugram’s Covid cases shot past the 10,000 mark on Thursday with 78 new cases being added to the tally on Thursday. The district breached the 10,000 mark five months after the first case was detected on March 15.As per official reports, Gurugram now has 10,016 Covid-19 cases and 128 fatalities, with one fresh death being reported in the health bulletin on Thursday. This puts the mortality rate from the virus in Gurugram at 1.27%, which is slightly higher than the state’s average of 1.14%.Gurugram’s mortality rate is also the second highest in the state after Faridabad (148 deaths), a district which currently has the highest number of active coronavirus cases (906) in Haryana. Out of the 128 deaths in Gurugram so far, 90 are due to co-morbid conditions and 38 are without any co-morbidities.Gurugram district at present only has 706 active cases. At least 9,182 people have recovered from the illness, which is 91.67%, the highest in the state. Of the active cases, 577 are home isolated, 31 in Covid care centres, and 98 are hospitalised in various private hospitals of the city.In terms of growth rate, cases in the city are increasing at 0.98% (as on Thursday). In June, the cases were surging by 12.6% , which had reduced to almost 1.7% by July’s last week. Due to increased testing in the last two-and-a-half months, the daily growth rate has seen a decline.From just 18,000 tests in May, the number of tests has increased to 130,878 on Thursday. On an average 2,000 tests are being conducted daily, which includes both gold standard RT-PCR and antigen detection tests. Gurugram currently has the highest testing rates in the state, with 91,860 tests per million population. The state testing rate is over 30,000 tests per million (till August 9), while the national testing rate is almost 18,000 per million population.The test positivity rate has also come down to 7.14%, which was almost 18% in June. Ideally, it should be around 5% as per the World Health Organisation’s ( WHO’s) recommendations.This has reduced Gurugram’s Covid-19 burden on the state. In Haryana, out of the 44,817 total Covid cases, 6,820 are active, of which 10% is from Gurugram. The number has come down from 50% in June, when the district reported more than 3,700 cases in just a month.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer said that although active cases are declining, citizens should not be complacent. “Due to continuous testing in worst-affected areas, the number of coronavirus cases have reduced. But with the festive season about to start and temples being reopened, citizens should be cautious and follow basic norms to prevent contracting the infectious virus. They should not be complacent.”Yadav said that to further lower the positivity rate, at least 70 testing camps will be organised in the next week in containment zones and areas outside it. “A testing strategy plan is being prepared to test more people,” said Yadav.The city had witnessed its first wave of Covid-19 cases from March 15 onwards, with patients having travel history to Covid-19 affected countries testing positive. Thereafter, it was Tablighi Jamaat attendees who attended a religious congregation in Nizamuddin, Delhi and then there was spread of infection among neighbouring districts. Cases in June were getting doubled as fast as in four to eight days. This has decreased to almost 104 days now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-covid-count-crosses-10-000-virus-growth-rate-slows-down/story-ntF03lWNqsFQ9rf9yHJH8H.html
13-08-2020||Mumbai||Can’t reopen temples amid Covid-19 pandemic: State to HC||The Maharashtra government has refused to reopen places of worship – closed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic – the Bombay high court (HC) was informed on Thursday. Government pleader Purnima Kantharia informed the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar that Kishore Nimbalkar, the secretary of the disaster management department, has rejected the representations of two petitioners – Bhandup resident Ankit Vora and a Jain temple trust – who had requested the court to direct the state over the reopening of Jain temples on the occasion of the community’s nine-day Paryushan festival, which starts on Sunday. The two petitioners had also sought permissions for allowing members of the Shwetamber Murtipujak Jain community to perform religious functions and worship during the nine-day festive period in Jain temples. Vora contended that the central government had permitted the opening up of places of worship – by ensuring physical distancing norms are followed –and therefore, the state government should also allow religious shrines in Maharashtra to open up and come out with the necessary guidelines for the purpose. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh had then supported Vora’s claim by pointing out that the central government had permitted the opening of places of worship outside containment zones and had issued separate guidelines on July 29. Acting on the petitions by Vora and the trust, the bench had on Tuesday directed the secretary to consider their representations, with restrictions and conditions as may be imposed by the government. Nimbalkar has, however, said that the request cannot be acceded to in view of the prevailing situation in Maharashtra, which is the worst-affected state owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. In support of his claim, he has cited that until Tuesday, Maharashtra had recorded a total of 5.35 lakh Covid-19 cases, including 18,306 deaths. The secretary has also claimed that the administrative machinery has already been stressed and overburdened, and it will be impossible to monitor strict compliance of the conditions to curtail the spread of the virus, which will result in the irreversible spread of Covid-19. After his decision was communicated to the court, the lawyers for both the petitioners requested the court to consider allowing Jains to visit their temples only on the last day – considered to be the most auspicious of the nine days of Paryushan. The bench refused to consider the request. “This is a very sensitive issue. We will have to be very careful,” said the bench. The judges clarified that they had ensured that the petitioners had the opportunity to make a representation and get the state authorities decided on it. The bench said that it cannot accede to the request of the petitioners even for the limited relief, as it will open floodgates of petitions seeking similar relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/can-t-reopen-temples-amid-covid-19-pandemic-state-to-hc/story-yaykvoYF0tpU66qJGx4D1L.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Heavy rain lashes Gurugram; air quality improves||The city witnessed heavy rain on Wednesday night and early morning on Thursday, providing much-needed relief from a spell of humid weather for the last couple of days. As per the district administration’s report, 60mm rainfall was recorded in Gurugram up till 8:30am on Thursday. As per IMD officials, light to moderate rainfall can be expected on Friday.Officials attributed the rain to the south-westerly winds that are bringing moisture to parts of north-west India. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi, said, “Rains can be expected in parts of Delhi-NCR for the next two days on account of the presence of the moisture-laden south-westerly winds.”As per IMD, a low-pressure area is also likely to develop over the northwest Bay of Bengal which will lead to the strengthening of the monsoon flow over the northern parts. It may lead to rainfall at various part of Haryana between Friday and Saturday. The maximum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 36 degrees. The minimum temperature stood at 25 degrees Celsius. Gurugram’s maximum temperature is expected to fall further and touch 31 degrees Celsius on Friday, as per IMD’s weekly forecast. The relative humidity in air on Thursday evening was 75%. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 26 degrees on Friday, as per the forecast. As per the weekly forecast, cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers will prevail until the weekend. Air quality in the city remained ‘good’ on Thursday, recording 44 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was an improvement from the previous day’s recording of 58 in the ‘satisfactory’ category. The improvement in air quality was largely attributed to an increase in the wind speed and rainfall. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the lower end of ‘satisfactory’ or the ‘good’ category on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/heavy-rain-lashes-gurugram-air-quality-improves/story-nBN7rd8NY1P6LIGM52YPTL.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Moderate rain inundates many areas in Gurugram||More than 60mm of rainfall left several stretches across the city heavily waterlogged on Thursday. The worst affected areas included the Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch, on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, IFFCO Chowk on e-way, Basai Road, and the sector 46-Bakhtawar Chowk stretch.At each of the stretches, waterlogging was so severe that at least a portion of one carriageway or the service lane could not be used by motorists altogether. Gurugram traffic police officials cautioned commuters over social media to avoid travelling on these lanes.“The road from sector 46 towards Bakhtawar Chowk was inundated. At several points, traffic police officials were diverting traffic through the opposite carriageway as one entire carriageway was filled with knee-deep rainwater. Fortunately, the affected stretch was less than 500 metres and it did not take long to clear,” said Harshit Shukla, a resident of sector 50.The city witnessed continuous rain of moderate intensity from 10.30 pm on Wednesday night till Thursday noon.As per the district administration’s rainfall report, the city recorded 60mm of rainfall till 8.30 am on Thursday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) classifies rain between 15.55mm and 64mm as “moderate.”A pedestrian subway located opposite Haldiram, near Kherki Daula was also inundated. The 100-metre subway is used extensively by residents of Sihi village and Kherki Daula/sector 76 to cross the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.As per an official of the Millennium City Express Private Limited (MCEPL), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) concessionaire for the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, a 10 horsepower motor pump was installed at the subway to drain out rainwater, which was finally cleared around 1 pm.“The entrance and exit side of the subway are located in low-lying areas. As a result, rainwater from highway and nearby villages used to accumulate here. To counter this, we had built a speed breaker on both sides to ensure the rainwater backflowed. However, today, the volume of rainwater was much higher and it crossed the speed breaker as well due to which the subway was flooded. With a motor pump, it took us more than two hours to clear the rainwater,” said an MCEPL official privy to the matter.The MCEPL official said that seven motor pumps, two of 60 HP, one of 20 HP, and four of 10 HP were used to drain the rainwater from the Kherki Daula-Narsinghpur stretch.“From the moment it stops raining, depending on the extent of waterlogging, it takes us a minimum of three hours and a maximum of six to drain the rainwater with motor pumps. By 4pm, after nearly five hours of continuous use, rainwater was cleared from the stretch,” said the official.Many arterial stretches located in sectors 27, 28, 33, 43, 46, 47, 49, 50 DLF Phases 1-2, South City 1-2, Palam Vihar, Himgiri Chowk, Bristol Chowk, Gurudwara Road, Old-Delhi-Gurgaon Road, Sohna Road, also reported heavy waterlogging.Raman Sharma, chief engineer of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that at all these points tractor-mounted motor pumps were deployed by the civic body to drain out rainwater.“Overall, more than 25 motor pumps of ours were positioned at different points across the city to drain out rainwater. In most areas by 2pm, rainwater had receded but there were a few low-lying areas where we are expecting rainwater to clear by 8 pm,” said Sharma.Waterlogging is an annual problem across the city during the monsoon season. Despite many measures, civic bodies have not been able to find a permanent solution to tackle it.VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that they were caught up dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. The 68-day national lockdown obstructed work on cleaning the drains, affecting monsoon preparations.“This year, our objective was very straightforward. At whichever area we found heavy rainwater accumulation following rains, we subsequently initiated draining procedures there so that it does not create a problem for a long duration. This is how we have approached tackling waterlogging this monsoon season. Until we start work towards long-term solutions, waterlogging will remain a recurring issue,” said Kundu.Kundu said that this year both GMDA and MCG had come up with various long-term solutions for waterlogging-prone areas, however, they weren’t able to execute it, this year due to the coronavirus crisis.“All of these long-term measures require months of continuous, manpower-intensive work. We are aiming to ensure that these can be implemented prior to the 2021 monsoon season,” said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/moderate-rain-inundates-many-areas-in-gurugram/story-7vtc8RHfQZMDs5BLjR45gL.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Rents in local markets drop by at least 25%; grocers, chemists least affected||With the exception of pharmacies, grocery stores and general stores, most of the other commercial establishments at city marketplaces are operating at reduced rents due to the economic crisis unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic, said multiple stakeholders, including shopkeepers, tenants and brokers. Heads of various market associations across Gurugram estimated that the rents have dipped by at least 25% across most of the locations in the city. Tej Singh, head of the Vyapar Kendra market association in Sushant Lok-1, said that of the 200 odd shops in the market, almost all have resumed their business, with nearly half of them having negotiated lower rents. “Only 20 or 25 shops are still shut. Mainly pharmacies, general stores and even a few path labs remained open during the lockdown. The rent amount for such establishments has not changed much, since they continued to do good business during the lockdown,” Singh said.However, for businesses that were more affected — bakeries, salons, coaching centres and suchlike — landlords have agreed to reduce rents. Ankit, who runs a cosmetics store at Sushant Lok Vyapar Kendra, said, “I have been here for many years. The landlord and I have a good relationship. During lockdown, I paid only half the rent, now I am paying 70% till October. We are hoping that business will pick up around Diwali.” Singh clarified that, in most instances, negotiations between stakeholders have been smooth, with landlords recognising that footfall continues to be less than before. “Most of the establishments in the sector markets are old. Most people have been doing business with each other for years, so there is also an obligation to compromise on rent,” he explained. However, Singh added that the market association has, in some cases, intervened directly. “If a shopkeeper or landlord brings a complaint to us, we mediate for fairer terms depending on the person’s need. If someone’s business has not suffered during lockdown, we don’t get involved,” he said. This also appeared to be the situation in other commercial hubs in the city, such as South City-1 market, Sector 31 market, Huda market in Sector 14, and Palam Vihar Vyapar Kendra. Most shopkeepers, barring grocers and chemists, said that they have actively been seeking lower rents. Prakash Khatri, who runs who runs a brokerage firm out of South City Arcade in Sector 42, and is a member of the local shopkeeper’s association, said, “Most of the shops here are either chemists or grocery stores, which have done good business even during the lockdown. For eateries, electronic stores and suchlike, rents are definitely at least 20 to 30% lower. Even if business is picking up slowly, people would still prefer to pay a slightly lower rent because they are unsure of the future.” In South City arcade there are least 150 shops on rent which have negotiated lower rent. Harinder Rana, a shop owner and president of the Palam Vihar Vyapar Kendra market association, gave a nearly identical account. “Business is not happening at the pace as before. No owner wants to lose a tenant, and tenants also want to hold on to their space. In Palam Vihar too, most landlords have lowered rents, or deferred a portion of the rent for a later date,” Rana said, adding that this benefits both parties. “Not many people are looking to rent new commercial spaces right now,” he said.There are approximately 700 shops in Palam Vihar. About 300 are shut currently. Of the remaining, 200 are with owners and the rest with tenants. The tenanted properties have all reduced rents by at least 25%. Bablu Gupta, president of the Sadar Bazar market association, however, claimed that the locality has seen a sharper drop in rental rates than other markets, owing to the diversity of businesses it houses across retail and wholesale categories. As per Gupta, a larger number of businesses have been impacted in Sadar, as opposed to sector markets. “In Sadar, there are jewellery stores, handloom stores, furniture makers. Such businesses have suffered more businesses in sector markets, which are slowly bouncing back. Wholesalers are a little worse off than retailers. So a larger number of shopkeepers here are seeking lowered rents,” he said. Gupta claimed that in case of certain businesses, landlords have agreed to slash rents by as much as 50%. “I have intervened in a few matters where owners have not agreed to lower the price. Market associations are clear that they will only take up cases where a party has been badly affected. Any proprietor who was doing business in April and May is paying mostly the same rent as before,” Gupta said.In Sadar Bazaar, there are at least 500 shops which have renegotiated rent, from over 1,200 in total.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rents-in-local-markets-drop-by-at-least-25-grocers-chemists-least-affected/story-mw8oZzRg2djlCBX2mrytoK.html
13-08-2020||City||Shops in Thane allowed to stay open on all days from August 15||All shops within the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) limits, barring those in hot spots, will be allowed to remain open on all days from August 15, in lieu of the current odd and even system. Those do not include shops in malls or market areas. The civic body released an unlock order on Thursday, after a meeting with traders within the city.As per the new order, shops can remain open from 9am to 7pm.Dr Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “The traders cited that they were facing losses as shops were open based on the odd-even plan. As the number of positive cases is declining within Thane, the unlock order for August 15 was released. Shops have to strictly maintain social distancing norms and only standalone establishments have been permitted to open.”However, those in hot spot areas, malls and market paces will not be given permission to open. Shopkeepers in the city are happy with this decision. “We are delighted with this decision from the civic body and want to get back to business soon. Due to this odd and even concept, we were able to do business for only 15 days in a month. The strict lockdown and the current rules have had a deep impact on our business,” said Rasik Chedda, chairman, Ram Maruti Road Shopkeepers Association. Earlier in the day, in a special meeting of civic officials, guardian minister for Thane Eknath Shinde asked the civic body to consider the request from traders. “As per state government norms, shops can remain open all day, however, the rule was not implemented in Thane keeping in mind the increased number of cases in the city. Now that the situation is in control, the civic body can decide on shops being open for more hours,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shops-in-thane-allowed-to-stay-open-on-all-days-from-august-15/story-546gKSjReUyNsFGMhkXiEJ.html
13-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport implements revised quarantine rules for international passengers||Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on Thursday announced that it has started to implement the revised quarantine rules for international passengers arriving in the city. The Central government revised the guidelines last week. According to concessions on quarantine regulations made for international passengers, those who have undertaken an RT-PCR test within 96 hours prior to their journey will have to fill the self-declaration form online at least 72 hours before their scheduled travel in order to be exempted from institutional quarantine. A statement from the airport operator read, “An initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation allows international passengers arriving at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to skip the compulsory institutional quarantine. Concessions on quarantine regulations have been made for international passengers traveling due to emergency and those who have undertaken an RT-PCR test within 96 hours prior to their planned journey. The initiative enables arriving passengers to fill the self-declaration form online at least 72 hours before their scheduled travel in order to be exempted from institutional quarantine as mandated by the state of Maharashtra; it helps in reducing the passenger processing time substantially on arrivals.” Previously, all international passengers arriving at the airport had to undergo two stages of quarantine — first they had to observe a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine and then a seven-day home quarantine. However, as per the revised guidelines, passengers will be able to bypass the institutional quarantine by filling in the self-declaration form that is available online on the portal www.newdelhiairport.in 72 hours before their planned travel. On this portal, passengers will also have to upload proof of the negative RT-PCR test undertaken within 96 hours before the scheduled journey. Spokesperson of airport operator Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said that CSMIA, along with APHO (airport health organisation) team, has created a green channel for all arriving passengers who have pre-filled the applications. In the absence of an emergency or timely submission of the negative RT-PCR test on the portal, passengers will be subjected to the previous quarantine rules of the state. However, MIAL clarified that all arriving international and domestic passengers will have to undergo thermal screening at the airport without exemption. It also mentioned that the rules for domestic passengers remain the same and travellers intending to leave the city within seven days can produce their travel ticket confirming their return/onward journey to be exempted from home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-implements-revised-quarantine-rules-for-international-passengers/story-hIYUEsxvJP8itNThRAlJWJ.html
13-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC: Ready to handle rise in Covid-19 cases||RWith the city lifting several relaxations, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expecting daily Covid-19 cases to increase to nearly 2,000 from the present average of 1,000 to 1,200 cases. However, civic officials said that BMC is equipped to handle this surge. Currently, the city witnesses 1,000-1,200 daily positive cases on average, of which nearly 85% are asymptomatic cases. Arrangements for hospital beds have been made for the remaining 15%. The requirements for daily beds may go up if the cases increase. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “There could be a possible hike as more people are stepping out of their homes and there is more traffic on the roads. Three things are important to handle a rise in cases – bed capacity, medical equipment and sufficient manpower. To tackle this, we have set up Covid centres, dedicated hospitals, and additional manpower. As of today, we have thousands of beds lying vacant; 20% of the ICU beds are vacant, and 50% of oxygen beds are vacant.” Kakani added that even if the number of symptomatic patients goes up, Covid facilities are well-equipped to handle the rise. As of August 13, the total hospital-bed capacity for Covid patients in the city was 23,166, of which 10,513 are vacant. BMC has an additional 23,477 beds in CCC2 facilities and 49,409 beds in CCC1 facilities. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mumbai recorded 1,200 Covid-19 cases and 48 deaths.

13-08-2020||Gurugram||Three held with 331 kg of marijuana worth over ₹30 lakh from Palwal||A special task force (STF) from Rohtak on Wednesday arrested three people and seized 331 kilograms of marijuana (ganja), estimated to be valued at over ₹30 lakh, from Palwal. The police said the accused men had hidden the contraband substance in a secret chamber installed beneath a tractor trolley. Preliminary probe has revealed that the arrested men used to procure the narcotics from Chhattisgarh and sell them in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The accused men, identified as Vijaypal, Rishi Pal and Prawesh, all hailing from Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh, were arrested near Katesra village in Palwal, after the STF team intercepted their trolley. An STF official, requesting anonymity, said, “The accused men had hidden the narcotics in small packets which were concealed in a chamber underneath the trolley. They used to procure the consignment from a contact in Bemetra district in Chhattisgarh for ₹2,000 per kilogram and sell it for ₹10,000 per kilogram in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.” The police said the accused had paid ₹6.62 lakh for the consignment of marijuana. Among the accused, Prawesh, was arrested last year in alleged possession of 28 kilograms of marijuana from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh. STF officials said that police are questioning the suspects to trace their supplier and other people involved in the supply chain. Earlier, on June 27, the police had arrested a man in alleged possession of 112 kilograms of marijuana (ganja), estimated to be valued at least ₹50 lakh, from village Sadhrana in Sector 10, Gurugram. The accused man had purchased the narcotics for ₹5,000 per kilogram from a city-based supplier and had been peddling narcotics for at least 18 months in the Delhi-NCR region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-held-with-331-kg-of-marijuana-worth-over-30-lakh-from-palwal/story-hanL22QSQCHHIHoqzradwI.html
13-08-2020||City||Man arrested for killing wife for dowry||A 40-year-old man was arrested on charges of killing his wife in Greater Noida West three days ago. The suspect was identified as Lalit Talan, a software engineer. The couple had married six years ago and has two children, police said.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said the suspect lived with her wife and two children in a high-rise society. “A native of Tappal, Talan worked in a private company in Noida. On Monday, the suspect informed the police that his wife, Ekta, 38, ended her life after consuming a toilet cleaner. However, his statement was not coherent and appeared dubious,” he said. Talan failed to tell police the name of the doctor who attended to her and whether she was taken to any hospital for treatment. Police said the suspect was not sharing sufficient information about how the woman fell ill and died. He also was not able to tell the police what might have triggered his wife to consume toilet cleaner. Chander said the body was sent for a post-mortem examination and the medical report revealed that she had suffered head injuries. The victim’s family members came from Pune, Maharashtra, and filed a police complaint against Talan accusing him of dowry harassment.

13-08-2020||Chandigarh||Baljit Singh Daduwal elected president of Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee||Karnal: In a major turn of events in Haryana’s gurdwara politics, Baljit Singh Daduwal, the parallel jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib, was elected president of the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (ad hoc) on Thursday. Daduwal’s election at Gurdwara Patshahi Chhevin and Nauvin at Cheeka in Kaithal district assumes significance as he has been among the pro-Khalistan leaders in neighbouring Punjab. Soon after his election, Daduwal announced his decision to resign from the post of the Damdama Sahib jathedar “to continue the fight of Haryanvi Sikhs for the formation of an independent Sikh body to govern the management of gurdwaras in Haryana”. Daduwal was backed by former HSGMC senior vice-president Didar Singh Nalvi and defeated Jagbir Singh Khalsa of former president Jagdish Singh Jhinda’s group by a narrow margin of two votes. According to election officer Darshan Singh Barari, all 36 members of the HSGMC exercised their franchise. Earlier, there were three candidates in the fray but it was a straight fight between the groups led by Jhinda and Nalvi after Swaran Singh of Ratia backed the Nalvi group. “Daduwalji has been elected after he got 19 out of 36 polled votes, Nalvi said. On his controversial background, he said, “He has announced that he will resign from Damdama Sahib and work for Sikhs of Haryana. He is a Haryanvi Sikh and belongs to Daduwal village in Sirsa district.” Daduwal along with other pro-Khalistan leaders such as Dhian Singh Mand and Amrik Singh Ajnala led a week-long protest against the Haryana BJP government in March 2018, over the cremation of former militant Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa, who died after jumping off a high-rise water tank. In 2014, the outgoing Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government had constituted a 41-member ad hoc HSGMC team to manage, supervise and take over the assets of cash-rich gurdwaras in Haryana, giving a boost to the demand of a separate Sikh body in the state. The committee, constituted under the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Act, 2014, was passed by the state assembly. While Jhinda was appointed president of the Haryana Sikh body, Nalvi was given the senior vice-president’s post. But later the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) approached the Supreme Court and challenged the formation of a separate Sikh body in Haryana. Reacting to Daduwal’s election, Joga Singh, a former general secretary and supporter of the Jhinda group, said that Khalsa was defeated as some people changed their mind at the last moment and voted for Daduwal. “But we will sit in the opposition and will strongly and jointly back our case for the formation of a separate Sikh body for Haryana as the case is pending in the Supreme Court,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baljit-singh-daduwal-elected-president-of-haryana-sikh-gurdwara-management-committee/story-uUmxqHdh0V8ZodLBpD1qwL.html

There were chances of high rainfall recently due to favourable weather conditions but that has passed. Yet, the region will see moderate to light rainfall for three to four days and the mercury will remain under the season’s average as well. The rains will, however, will be patchy and not regular or uniform as it was on Thursday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.

13-08-2020||City||New CNG vehicles rot in stockyard, corporation prefers private vehicles||A member of Ghaziabad corporation board has written to the city mayor and sought her intervention in roping in around 100 new CNG vehicles that were purchased for transportation of solid waste but are lying unused at a stockyard in Govindpuram.Ajay Sharma, who is councillor from Sanjay Nagar and also member of the corporation’s executive-committee, in his letter to the mayor, Asha Sharma, has alleged that despite the corporation having new CNG vehicles, the vehicles of private contractors are being used for door to door collection of daily solid waste. “There are about 50 four wheelers and similar number of e-rickshaws, besides other equipment, which are lying unused for past one and half months. Instead, the vehicles of private contractors are being used which is causing unnecessary financial burden on the corporation. It seems that the new vehicles are not being used just to favour the contractors,” councillor Ajay Sharma said. Sharma added that the hiring of private vehicles was causing an additional financial burden of Rs 40 lakh per month for the corporation. In response to Sharma’s letter, mayor Asha Sharma has written to city health officer Dr Mithlesh Kumar and directed him to ensure that the new CNG vehicles are deployed at the earliest. According to officials, the new vehicles were procured through funds received under the fourteenth finance commission under infrastructure development head. “Earlier we had about 68 vehicles hired from private contractors. But many of these were old and resulted in spilling of solid waste. We also had to provide fuel to these vehicles for daily operations. Thereafter, about 50 of these were replaced by corporation vehicles for door-to-door collection of solid waste from residential wards. At present, we have about 18 such vehicles of contractors and they will also be replaced,” mayor Asha Sharma, said. “As for the new vehicles, we are yet to get the insurance done for them. This will be expedited in another 3-4 days. The new e-rickshaws will be roped in for areas having smaller lanes while other bigger vehicles will be given to wards having bigger roads,” she added. City health officer Dr Mithlesh Kumar said that he has already written a letter to several officials of the corporation for deployment of the CNG vehicles. “I had written on July 9 for deployment of vehicles and the letter was addressed to several senior officers. We are probing as to why despite my letter the new vehicles were not roped in. The work will be expedited,” he added. Municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra, on his part, said that some of the new vehicles have been roped in while others will be deployed in next 3-4 days. “There was some issue with the drivers which has been sorted out. The rest of the new vehicles will be deployed in another 3 to 4 days . However, it will not be correct to say that all the private vehicles will be replaced as our requirement is rising,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-cng-vehicles-rot-in-stockyard-corporation-prefers-private-vehicles/story-kLGTd4tdsPrvxIcf4NMLTP.html

According to officials, a 62-year-old Covid-positive man died in Meerut on Wednesday and overall, 33 deaths out of total referrals have taken place at Meerut since April. During the past four days, a 37-year-old man died after five days of treatment at the L3 hospital in Ghaziabad while a 30-year-old woman from here, who was referred to an L3 hospital in Meerut, died on the night of August 10. Meanwhile, another 62-year-old man died on August 12 after he went on his own for treatment to Meerut. Going by state records, the 37-year-old’s death was the first Covid-related fatality in the district in 19 days, the previous one having taken place on July 21.“All the three patients had tested positive for Covid-19. The 62-year-old man from Muradnagar suffered from uncontrolled diabetes and went on his own to Meerut for treatment. He succumbed on August 12. With the three deaths, the total tally of fatalities in Ghaziabad has gone up to 67 till August 13. Since Delhi hospitals are closer and have started admitting our patients, we will be trying that all complicated case referrals be made to hospitals in Delhi,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.District officials had raised the issue of referral and admission of patients from Ghaziabad to hospitals in the National Capital during a meeting held earlier with a team of officials led by Dr VK Paul, member of the Niti Aayog.The issue was reiterated on July 27 during a video-conferencing held with the officials of the Delhi government, led by the Delhi chief secretary. According to official figures, about 155 patients (Covid and non-Covid) have so far been referred from hospitals (MMG Hospital, District Women Hospital and L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar) in Ghaziabad to Meerut and 33 fatalities have taken place. Of the 67 Covid-19 related deaths, 33 have taken place in Meerut, 30 in Ghaziabad and two each in Delhi and Noida, officials said. “During a review meeting on Thursday, we directed that supervision and distribution of prophylactics to close contacts of Covid-19 patients should be monitored by senior officials. We are distributing hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin through our surveillance teams deployed in containment zones. The distribution will now be strictly monitored by senior administrative officials to ensure that prevention measures yield results and no complications result in bad health status,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.In a government order on August 6, the state health department has recommended use of Ivermectin tablets as prophylactic for close contacts of Covid-19 patients and also for health workers, besides treatment of positive cases (in asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients along with doxycycline). “Further, we will also be focussing on immediate testing of patients who are to give birth or have comorbidities. The surveillance teams have also been directed to trace all pregnant women and get them tested, irrespective of whether they are from containment or non-containment zones. The district already has sufficient Covid and ICU beds and we are focussing on qualitative treatment to each patient,” he added.According to the records of the health department upto August 13, the district has 576 beds available in two L2 hospitals at ESIC Sahibabad (earlier L1 hospital and now converted to L2 hospital) and Sanjay Nagar, besides those in L3 hospital of Santosh Medical. The L2 hospitals have 13 while the L3 has 20 ICU beds. Further, the three hospitals also have 3, 12 and 21 ventilators, respectively.

The police said that the boy was found hanging in his room after his mother and his gym trainer opened the door on Thursday morning. “For the past 2-3 days he had been asking his mother to buy him a pet kitten. His mother had told him that she would get him a pet once his father arrives from China, where he is presently working. The boy, however, insisted that he wanted a pet immediately and was angry at having been turned down. Later, he went to his room on Wednesday evening and that was the last time anyone ever saw him. Since, he had a habit of confining himself to his room, his mother did not think much of it in the beginning,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram). “However, when the mother opened the room on Thursday morning, she found him hanging from the ceiling fan . The boy studied in a Delhi school and had come to his parents during the lockdown,” Jain added.

13-08-2020||Chandigarh||Hooch tragedy: Punjab CM flays Majithia for targeting DGP||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said that SAD’s targeted attack against a senior and highly-professional officer of the Punjab Police is a “shameful attempt by them to exploit the unfortunate hooch tragedy” to push their own political agenda with eye on the next assembly polls in state.Reacting to Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia’s statement accusing Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta of ‘shielding’ SSP Amritsar Rural over the latter’s alleged failure to act on complaint against the liquor mafia, Captain said there is no need of `shielding’ an officer who had an unblemished track record including war on drug and illicit liquor smugglers and traders.He said SSP Dhruv Dahiya had been on his personal security team. “A person with links with the mafia, as was suggested by the SAD, can hardly be trusted with the CM’s security,” he quipped.Stating that all SSPs and DCs were appointed directly by him, the CM said that the DGP or CS cannot be held responsible for their actions in any case. He said that contrary to what Majithia is falsely claiming, the SSP had received no specific complaint from any citizen regarding manufacturing of hooch.“If there had been even a suspicion of the SSP protecting or conniving with liquor smugglers, I would have been the first to take action against the officer as was done against five others immediately after the tragedy came to light,” he said.Expressing shock at SAD’s “continued attempts to seize the major tragedy for promoting their own vested interests”, Amarinder said, “it reflects the appalling low that SAD has touched in its desperation to connect with the people.”The CM said, “Small-scale manufacturing of illicit liquor had been going on for years, but police busting several modules in recent months and the covid-induced lockdown had spiked demand for liquor. Some liquor smugglers saw this as an opportunity to make a quick buck and started using chemicals in manufacturing hooch, leading to the tragedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooch-tragedy-punjab-cm-flays-majithia-for-targeting-dgp/story-I9UUQrvYZoeT1IZtoH5nqL.html

13-08-2020||Delhi||Depts of school and higher education need to work closely to send every child to college: Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday urged the departments of school education and higher education to work closely together so that they are able to send each and every child to college in the coming years.The minister said this while welcoming the new director of school education Udit Prakash Rai and the new director of higher education Azimul Haque. “Every year, around 2.5 lakh students graduate from schools. Our responsibility is to ensure that every student gets admitted to college. For this, both our departments need to work closely together. Earlier, only 90,000 students graduating from schools could get into colleges. But with the efforts we made over the past few years, 1.3 lakh children are now being admitted to colleges. We are hopeful that, soon, we will bridge the gap with the inauguration of the skills and sports university,” Sisodia said.While Rai has taken over school education from Binay Bhushan, Haque has replaced SS Gill in higher education. Sisodia said both outgoing officials had made significant contributions to the education sector in Delhi, including revamping schools and increasing seats in colleges. “We have seen seamless coordination between the DoE and the higher education department and we expect the same in the future as well. The director of higher education should be aware of the number of children in the first grade today so that accordingly, (s)he can plan for 12 years hence -- how many seats will be needed in higher education,” Sisodia said. Emphasising the importance of education, the minister said, “Education is not something that most people may want but it is something that they need. One of the biggest mistakes of our nation is not to focus on the education sector. The moment we came in power, in the first budget itself, we dedicated 25% of our budget for education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/depts-of-school-and-higher-education-need-to-work-closely-to-send-every-child-to-college-sisodia/story-CEteoJjOmIv4MXCKKlMM6M.html

A proper budget is allocated for de-silting of drains but nobody knows where the money goes. The MCDs under the BJP are in the most inefficient condition and they (the BJP) shall get an answer in the next municipal elections in 2022,” Pandey said in a press conference at the party office in central Delhi.Several localities and arterial roads in the Capital were waterlogged after heavy showers lashed Delhi over the last couple of days, leading to severe traffic snarls and causing massive inconvenience to residents of the city.Adesh Gupta, the BJP’s Delhi unit president, however, blamed the PWD for not de-silting the drains under its jurisdiction and said that’s what led to the water logging. He said the Delhi government had claimed to spend ₹100 crore on cleaning of drains but this claim was “washed away in the water”.“Despite having the Drainage Master Plan approved, the Delhi government has not implemented it yet, due to which Delhi gets waterlogged even with little rain. The PWD, under the Delhi government, did not complete even 50% of silt removal from the drains before the monsoon. Arvind Kejriwal talks about making Delhi London, but due to the negligence and poor policies of his government, Delhi is now flooded in rain.” he said.CORRUPTION CHARGESIn the same press conference, Durgesh Pathak, in charge of municipal corporation affairs, demanded that the building surveys by the MCDs be probed and those found guilty of corruption be given strict punishment.“The MCDs are supposed to survey buildings every year. The North MCD, under mayor Jai Prakash, had submitted its report last month which stated that around two out of 800,000 buildings surveyed are in a vulnerable state and could collapse any time. In the last 24 hours, two buildings have collapsed in the northern municipal zone. This raises concerns about the survey and suggests corruption. We demand that this be probed and those found guilty be given strict punishment,” Pathak said.A police officer died and another was injured after a building in North Delhi collapsed on Wednesday.Responding to Pathak’s allegations, Jai Prakash, mayor of the north corporation, said, “Allegations levelled against me are absolutely baseless. I inspected the location where the building collapsed yesterday and have ordered a probe into the matter. I will also send a legal notice to Pathak for making false allegations and tarnishing my image.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/water-logging-aap-bjp-play-blame-game/story-lAlH5Ow4OEIzLRdxh5I9KP.html
13-08-2020||City||After highest 24-hr spell in August since 2013, Delhi can expect light showers for 2-3 days||New Delhi: Delhi will continue to get light to moderate showers over the next two to three days owing to moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea and the monsoon trough (a line of low pressure) passing near the national capital.Delhi’s Safdarjung station recorded the highest rain for August in 24 hours since 2013 on Wednesday evening and Thursday night. Between 5.30pm on Wednesday and 2.30pm on Thursday, the station recorded 83.8mm of rain, the highest since 95.2mm on August 21, 2013.Delhi’s rain deficiency (since June 1) fell from 35% on Wednesday to 10% on Thursday, considered to be in the “normal” category for monsoon. The Palam station recorded 99.9mm, while Lodhi Road recorded 84mm and Ridge recorded 98 mm. Most of the rain was recorded in two intense spells between 11.30pm on Wednesday and 2.30am on Thursday and another between 2.30am and 5.30am, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Delhi.“We can expect more rain. NCR (National Capital Region) may record moderate category rains while Delhi will continue to record light to moderate rains. The monsoon trough is passing along Ferozepur, Narnaul, Gwalior, Satna, Ambikapur and Chaibasa towards the low pressure area over Bay of Bengal. There is also a cyclonic circulation over south Haryana. So rains will continue for two to three days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“Palam recorded a very heavy spell by 5am on Thursday and then parts of central Delhi recorded a spell after some time. South Delhi got the highest share because moisture incursion is from the south now, from the Arabian Sea. We may not see such intense spells from Friday in Delhi-NCR, but 5 to 7cm rain can be expected. The heavy spells are dependent on convection and monsoon winds,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Extremely heavy rain (over 20cm) was recorded in Himachal Pradesh and heavy to very heavy rains were recorded over east Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Konkan, Goa and Telangana.There is a low pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha and West Bengal coasts. It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and become more organized during the next 2-3 days according to India Meteorological Department’s Thursday bulletin. The monsoon trough is active and lies near its normal position (Ganganagar to Bay of Bengal.) it is likely to be in the active phase during the next 4-5 days. High convergence of strong southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and monsoon trough at lower levels is likely over northwest and central India during next 4-5 days, the bulletin said.These favourable conditions are likely to bring widespread and very heavy rain over major parts of northwest India (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh) during next 2 days and decrease thereafter.Widespread and heavy rain is also very likely over Gujarat, Konkan, Goa, ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra, east Rajasthan and parts of central India during next 4-5 days. Extremely heavy rain is likely in Gujarat and east Rajasthan. Moderate to severe thunderstorm accompanied with lightning is likely over Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, east Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh during next 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-highest-24-hr-spell-in-august-since-2013-delhi-can-expect-light-showers-for-2-3-days/story-SgDKD9PsOWudL2EwbWg5MK.html

The protests were led by Mullana MLA Varun Chaudhary along with Naraingarh MLA Shally Chaudhary, state treasurer Rohit Jain, former MLA Ramkishan Gujjar, and other party leaders.Raising anti-government slogans, the party workers said that the state government was looting people which had been revealed through registry and liquor scams. Party workers later submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner.Addressing media persons, MLA Varun said that the government took this pandemic as an opportunity to loot the state through different “scams.”“There have been discrepancies in nearly 30,000 registries and the special enquiry team (SET) in the liquor scam has said in its report that bureaucrats were not cooperating in the inquiry. If they would have cooperated with the team, what could have come to the fore can’t be imagined? So, Congress has demanded an investigation into all the scams during this pandemic and before by a sitting high court judge,” the MLA said.Rohit Jain alleged that instead of forming a special investigation team in the liquor scam, as promised by home minister Anil Vij, the government constituted an SET that was totally powerless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambala-congress-protests-over-series-of-scams-unearthed-during-khattar-regime/story-TDJaBTOA4x6NAwdZMdk09N.html

It noted that both the Centre and the DCB were yet to file their replies and wanted more time to do so.“Time, as sought, is granted to file the replies. Meanwhile, no coercive action be taken against the petitioner (DIAL) till the next date of hearing,” the bench said and listed the matter on September 14.Besides seeking quashing of the June 15 order demanding over Rs 2,589 crore, the plea sought a declaration that the land on which the airport is located is not a cantonment and, therefore, does not fall in DCB’s jurisdiction.The petition sought setting aside of the past letters of DCB seeking payment of varying amounts of property tax in respect of a certain portion of the airport land that purchased in 1940 by the International Airport Authority of India from the Defence Estate Authorities (presently DCB) for a consideration of Rs 4.61 crore.According to the petition, part of the airport land falls in the jurisdiction of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation for which DIAL pays property tax to the civic body. For the remaining portion, DCB has been demanding property tax.DIAL has contended that instead of explaining how it arrived at the earlier amount, DCB “completely revised the amount and sought to impose a completely arbitrary and exorbitant amount”. DIAL also said if such a huge amount is levied on it, it would be constrained to recover it through the tariff charged at the airport, which would ultimately be transferred to the passengers as an undue financial burden. No immediate comment was available from DIAL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/property-tax-no-coercive-action-against-delhi-airport-operator-high-court-tells-cantonment-board/story-JmbZrsbrhqh2x6CjJq9rgK.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||DDA challenges Rs 50 lakh fine in HC, says did not pollute stormwater drain||The Delhi high court has directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to deposit ₹50 lakh with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) as a fine for the alleged water contamination of stormwater drains on the Samalkha-Dwarka Road in south-west Delhi.Justice Navin Chawla directed the DDA to deposit the amount with the DPCC within two weeks of August 10 and added that the deposit would be subject to the outcome of the plea moved by DDA against the environmental damage compensation fee imposed on it.The DDA had filed a plea challenging the DPCC’s July 10 decision to impose the environment damage compensation fee of ₹50 lakh on it for allegedly spoiling the water quality in the stormwater drain.The DDA has contended that the July 10 order of DPCC was “illegal, arbitrary and unreasonable” as it does not have the jurisdiction to take such a decision.The petition has contended that unless there is a specific provision in the statute enabling the authority (DPCC) to levy a penalty, it cannot levy any penalty or damages with reference to the general powers provided under the Environment Protection Act.The DDA has also claimed that it has no control over the area in question — the Samalkha T-Point to Bharthal road also knows as the Urban Extension Road (UER-II).“The primary responsibility of disposal of the waste/surplus sewage flow discharge beyond the boundary wall of each complex on the road is with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the Delhi Jal Board,” the petition has said.The DDA has also claimed that in compliance with earlier directions issued by the National Green Tribunal, the DDA, in December 2019, had closed all rainwater harvesting systems installed in stormwater drains on Samalkha-Dwarka Road.While issuing a notice on the plea, the court posted the matter for further hearing on November 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-challenges-50-lakh-fine-in-hc-says-did-not-pollute-stormwater-drain/story-z14joMOAuWJR19henTsLWK.html

The plea was filed through advocate RK Kapoor by a resident, Nitin Gupta.The judge had said the photographs shown to him reflect the “horrific” condition of the “grand old tree, which has seen the unfolding of the city, and that it existed from a time when the Britishers could not have even thought of coming to our country”. The judge was astonished at the condition of the tree, whose aerial roots were chopped and also damaged by cement and stones. On Thursday, the court was informed by advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, that the stones and rods had been removed. However, the court said the wall surrounding the roots of the tree was still there. He sought to know the reason from the counsel and expressed displeasure that the orders had not been followed. It noted that even though some stones had been removed, the tree officer did not observe two glaring obstructions -- a wall around three sides of the tree and another structure.“I am appalled with the non-compliance of my order on the removal of concrete…….The tree officer should have taken note of it as it prevents the growth of the roots. There is another structure around the tree, which needs to be removed. Let an affidavit be filed as to why this was not addressed by the tree officer,” the court said in its oral order. Senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the builder, told the court that they had accepted the mistake and were ready to comply with any orders passed by the court and the authorities.Advocate Ajay Arora, standing counsel for the North DMC, told the court that construction had completely stopped and the builder was issued a show cause notice, asking why his sanction not be revoked as they had not mentioned the presence of the tree while seeking permission for the building plan. Asora said the commissioner had directed an enquiry against erring officers.In compliance with the earlier order, Arora told the court that a tree census had been conducted in the area and altogether there were 1,700 trees.The court, noting these submissions, asked the civic body’s counsel to look into after the banyan trees near Subhash Marg, Urdu Bazaar and other adjoining places and preserve them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/remove-wall-round-300-year-old-banyan-tree-delhi-high-court-tells-authorities/story-qwTbesblpGCJDGo93utw0K.html

The Border Security Force (BSF) is holding low-key functions on August 14 and August 15, in view of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to organising a band display on August 14 (Friday evening), BSF personnel will hold a parade on August 15 evening. “BSF’s director general Surjeet Singh Deswal, along with other senior officials, will be present during the parade on August 15. No visitor will be allowed to visit the JCP due to the pandemic. Only men in uniform, wearing masks and gloves will be there,” said a senior BSF official, who didn’t wish to be named.He said, “It will be the first time in the history of the JCP that the Independence Day functions will be organised without spectators. The ceremonial drill might have been suspended after the 1971 War, but not on Independence Day.”In the first week of March, the BSF restricted the entry of visitors at the JCP to witness the Beating the Retreat Ceremony, a daily drill performed by the BSF and the Pakistan Rangers. With the infection not abating, only flag lowering ceremony is being observed at the border on a daily basis.

At many places, residents had to call the fire tenders to pump out water from the streets. Former Congress councillor Kuljit Singh Bedi said he used the water pumping system to drain out water from the streets and parks in his area. “Every time there is heavy rain, residents get terrified and start ringing us. They suffered massive losses during the 2017 flooding. This time, we installed water pumping sets at key points to drain the water.”Surinder Singh, another former councillor of Mohali, said, “In some areas of Sector 76 and 77, waterlogging was up to three-feet high.

13-08-2020||City||Pak court allows Sikh girl to go with her Muslim husband or place of her choice||Lahore The Lahore High Court on Wednesday allowed Jagit Kaur of Nankana Sahib, who married one Mohammad Hassan in September last against the will of her family, to go with her husband or any place of her choice, saying she was not a ‘minor’.Since September 2019, Kaur has been living in Darul Aman (shelter house) in Lahore following her family’s allegation that she was kidnapped by Hassan who forcibly married her.India had voiced its concern with Pakistan over the alleged abduction and forced marriage of the Sikh girl and sought “immediate remedial action” from the Pakistan government.LHC justice Chaudhry Shehram Sarwar gave the ruling on the petition of Hassan, seeking custody of ‘his wife’ Kaur whom he gave Muslim name Ayesha.Police brought the Sikh girl to the court amid tight security. Her brother and other family members were also present in the court who expressed their dismay over the decision.Representing the Sikh family, Khalil Tahir Sindhu, argued that the school-leaving certificate was enough to prove that the girl is minor. He challenged the record of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) regarding her age. Sindhu also informed the court that as per a settlement reached by Punjab governor Muhammad Sarwar between the two parties, the girl is supposed to be handed over to her family. “Emotions of the Sikh community will be hurt if the girl is allowed to go with the Muslim man,” he contended.Counsel for the petitioner Sultan Sheikh told the court that as per the record of Nadra, the girl was 19. He said a medical board previously constituted by the court had already declared the girl a major.The judge rejected the arguments of Sindhu, saying only the documents of Nadra were valid to establish the age of a person. Justice Sarwar further observed that the high court had nothing to do with any decision made by the governor in a private capacity.“The Constitution of the country safeguards the rights of Kaur and she is free to live with a person of her own choice,” the judge said. The judge also ordered the police to provide “foolproof” security to Kaur.At the previous hearing, Kaur told the court that she married the petitioner with her free will, after converting to Islam, and did not want to go back to her family.Tension between Sikh and Muslim communities in Nankana Sahib has risen following the court decision. Nankana police have been put on alert, officials said.

13-08-2020||Pune||Pune’s organ donation numbers in 2020 less than half of the previous year||With three months of complete lockdown, the number of organ donations in the Pune region has reduced significantly in comparison to the corresponding period last year. Since January to August, only 21 donations have taken place in Pune region this year, while during the corresponding period of 2019 the number was 63. This was mainly due to fewer transplants during the lockdown from March till August, which saw only nine organ donations in the Pune region. The Pune region includes Satara, Nashik, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur, Dhule and Jalgaon districts. “With elective surgeries pertaining to organ donation not allowed in the first phase of the lockdown, we have seen fall in numbers. There were strict standard operating procedures (SOP) and since travelling was banned we could not call people for a donation from the other cities,” said Aarti Gokhale, central coordinator of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) Pune region. Pune was the first city to restart the transplant surgeries in the state from May and till July it conducted 7 donations and 16 people were benefited from the transplant. “People are scared of donation due to the Covid pandemic and even, there are still strict SOP’s from the government which need to be followed,” added Gokhale. The SOPs said if the risk of death within 6 months without organ transplant is more than 50 per cent, which is much higher than the risk of contracting Covid-19, then that patient should get the benefit of organ transplantation. Renal patients who require urgent transplantations are included in this high priority group. If there is no suitable recipient in these super urgent categories the SOPs recommends that the organs are allocated to other recipients on the waiting list so that there is no wastage of organs. “Last year there were 160 deceased donors who gave 456 patients a new lease of life. This year we’ve already crossed the halfway mark, and there have been only 50 deceased donors” said Dr Astrid Lobo Gajiwala, director, regional/state organ and tissue transplant organisation, west Maharashtra. “The poor donation rate is bad news for the 5,514 people waiting for a kidney. The worst is that 1,097 patients waiting for a liver, 74 for a heart and 16 for lungs. Kidney failure patients have the option of dialysis. Patients waiting for a liver, heart or lungs, have no option but for a transplant. For these patients, organ transplant is a life -saving intervention,” added Gajiwala. Dr. Gaurav Chaubal, director, transplant surgery Jupiter hospital, Baner said, “It is highly important for people to understand the need for organ donation. The burden of patients suffering from organ failure is huge. Around 2.5 lakh patients die every year of liver failure, while only 2,000 patients end up getting a transplant.” “The ratio of people donating organs in India is around 0.8 persons per million population. The donation rates have dropped by 70 per cent during this pandemic,” said Chaubal.

13-08-2020||Chandigarh||Supreme Court orders status quo on Faridkot royal property worth ₹20,000 crore||Faridkot: The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered status quo on the ₹20,000-crore worth properties of the last ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Faridkot, Maharaja Harinder Singh Brar, which means the trust will continue as caretaker till further orders. The double bench of justice Uday Umesh Lalit and justice Vineet Saran issued notices to the respondents, including Brar’s younger daughter Amrit Kaur, and the next hearing is scheduled on October 6. The court order came on a plea by the Maharawal Khewaji Trust that challenged the recent order of the Punjab and Haryana high court declaring his will in favour of the trust forged. Trust chief executive officer Jagir Singh Sran said, “We will continue to take care of all royal properties as per the Maharaja’s will, which is real and correct. The order comes as a relief as the Maharaja’s daughter Amrit Kaur’s men were trying to take possession of the royal properties illegally. Now this matter is in the court’s knowledge.” On June 1, the high court had upheld a Chandigarh court’s order, awarding majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Brar to his daughters Amrit Kaur, who challenged the will in 1992, and Deepinder Kaur. The court held that descendants of Manjit Inder Singh, the last ruler’s brother, would get their mother Mohinder Kaur’s share. On the will in dispute, the court observed that trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated and shrouded with suspicious circumstances,” the court order said. In 2013, the Chandigarh district court had declared the will, which had entitled the Maharawal Khewaji Trust as the caretaker of the properties, as illegal and void and granted inheritance to Amrit and Deepinder. FARIDKOT ROYAL DISPUTE Crowned maharaja at the age of three in 1918, Harinder Singh Brar was the last ruler of the Faridkot estate and was married to Narinder Kaur. The royal couple had three daughters, Amrit Kaur, Deepinder Kaur and Maheepinder Kaur and a son, Harmohinder Singh. The son died in a road accident in 1981. One of the rulers of the seven Sikh princely states, Harinder died in 1989 and left behind prime properties in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana and Chandigarh. Maheepinder Kaur died a spinster, while Deepinder died while the legal battle was on. Amrit Kaur lives in Chandigarh. The property dispute started soon after Harinder Singh Brar died in October 1989 after a will surfaced in which he had bequeathed his properties to the Maharwal Khewaji Trust, with his daughter Deepinder as its head. The property dispute reached the high court in 2018 after a Chandigarh court declared the trust void and gave property to the daughters. In June this year, the high court upheld the Chandigarh court’s order. WHAT’S AT STAKE The royal riches include movable and immovable assets in four states (Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana) and Chandigarh. Rajmahal, Faridkot: Spread over 14 acres, it was constructed in 1885 as the royal residence. Now, a 150-bed charitable hospital stands on a portion of the palace ground.Qila Mubarak, Faridkot: Built by Raja Mokulsi and reconstructed by Raja Hamir Singh around 1775, it is spread over 10 acres. The present main building was built around 1890.Faridkot House, New Delhi: Located on a huge piece of prime land on Copernicus Marg, it is currently leased out to Central government at a monthly rent of ₹17.50 lakh.

13-08-2020||Dehradun||Over 45 dead, 127 injured in Uttarakhand in rain-related incidents in July||More than 45 people died in rain-related incidents in Uttarakhand in the month of July, an official said on Thursday as parts of the Himalayan state continued to be lashed by heavy rainfall.State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) official Praveen Alok said, “Just in the month of July, 45 people died and 127 were injured in rain-related incidents while 61 rescue operations were conducted.” In July 2019, thirty six people had died in similar incidents and 71 people were injured in 46 rescue operations. On Wednesday, two women died in Rudraprayag district after an SUV plunged into a gorge as the driver lost control of the vehicle in heavy rain. According to SDRF officials, one person was also injured in the accident and search is underway for a fourth passenger.With continuous heavy rainfall, landslides and flash flood incidents have been reported from many parts of the state. The downpour has resulted in rising water levels of various rivers as well.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places in the state in the next 2-3 days. Bikram Singh, director of the regional meteorological department in Dehradun, said in the hills, even 50 mm to 60 mm hourly rainfall can cause harm as water levels in streams rises, leading to flash floods. According to the MeT department, Uttarakhand has already received 655.4mm of rainfall from June to August 12 compared to 750.7 mm (the normal range) for these months. Bageshwar district has received the maximum rainfall with a 168% departure from normal rainfall limit. The state is in an overall 13% rainfall deficit. Piyoosh Rautela, executive director of Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre in Uttarakhand, said, “In the hills, the catchment area of even small streams is very large. These streams can be seasonal also, but during monsoons with heavy rainfall the water spills. This heavy rainfall leads to flash floods or rain-induced disasters.” He also said that due to the topographical conditions, the likelihood of cloudbursts or flash floods happening in the hills is more compared to plains. “The physiography or geomorphic conditions of the mountains is such that the wind gets a sudden upward thrust which leads to cloud formation. But due to the topography of mountains or valleys, in particular, the winds rise to form clouds and then rainfall occurs in a small area or the clouds get trapped in a valley amid mountains as the monsoon winds are not able to cross the topographic barriers (mountains). Due to this, the rainfall recorded in those areas is high leading to disasters,” said Rautela. The incessant rainfall has resulted in landslides in some areas of the state leading to blocking of roads. Authorities have moved people to safer places in many parts while all district magistrates have been directed to take precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/over-45-dead-127-injured-in-uttarakhand-in-rain-related-incidents-in-july/story-U192lbNPPIYnq9mYewEQSN.html

13-08-2020||Noida||Greater Noida residents to soon get Ganga water, 50 villages to get STPs||Residents in Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida will soon get Ganga water at their homes as the local development authority has expedited work on the drinking water project, officials said. Also, 50 villages in Greater Noida will be soon connected with sewage treatment plants (STPs) for better waste management, they said. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) had in its 119 Board Meeting taken a decision on these matters, the officials said. “The planning department has been directed to complete the civil work on the 85 cu sec Ganga water project by this September,” a GNIDA official said, adding the authority is hoping to ensure supply of Ganga water to the residents at the earliest. The board meeting was held on Saturday and chaired by Alok Tandon, commissioner of infrastructure and industrial development. GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshon, Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari, among others, were present in the meeting. “The planning department was also directed to complete the plan for connecting 50 villages with STPs within two months and ensure quick execution of the project,” the official said. In absence of fresh river water, the residents of the city depend on groundwater which has a high quantity of salt in it. The Ganga water project was envisioned almost 10 years ago at an estimated cost of around Rs 290 crore, according to the official. The GNIDA also decided to extend till September 30 the date for getting building maps approved for plots for IT projects during the meeting. In another key decision, the board granted “industry status” to warehouses and logistics’ businesses as per the Uttar Pradesh Warehouses and Logistics Rules, 2018. The move is expected to encourage setting up of industries and attract investment to fuel growth in this region, according to GNIDA. It also increased the floor area ratio (FAR) norms from existing 1.5 per cent to 2+1 per cent for industrial sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/geater-noida-residents-to-soon-get-ganga-water-50-villages-to-get-stps/story-WssMdST9iQn0lBT6W6IX1N.html

The party has issued a reason notice to them why they should be dismissed from the primary membership of the party for this disgraceful act,” read the post by the party’ Punjab incharge.  Saying that the AAP is a secular party, the Tilak Nagar MLA said that there is no place in the party for anyone who disrespects any religion.“The Sikh community is also very sad with their statement because such misfortune against any community is also against the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Aam Aadmi Party is a secular party and has no place in the party of anyone who disrespects any religion. Aam Aadmi Party strongly condemns this statement by Jarnail Singh (former MLA, Rajouri Garden) and is suspended from the basic membership of the party with immediate effect,” said Singh. However, the former Rajouri Garden MLA, denied the charge and said that his son had accidentally pasted a post using the phone for online classes. “Yesterday I had my phone with my little son for online class. He pasted a post copy and post. What I had deleted. I respect all the names of God Ram, Gobind, Keshav, Sadashiv and follow the principles of Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib,” he said in a Facebook Post on August 12.    The former legislator shot to limelight in 2009 after hurling a shoe at former finance minister P Chidambaram. In 2014, he unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from West Delhi, losing to BJP’s Parvesh Verma. A prominent Sikh face of AAP, Jarnail Singh was later elected to the Delhi Assembly from Rajouri Garden in 2015. He resigned in 2017 to contest the Punjab assembly polls from Lambi constituency -- against former CM Parkash Singh Badal and Congress stalwart (and current CM) Amarinder Singh. Jarnail Singh lost the polls. He is currently active in the Punjab unit of the AAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-suspends-ex-mla-jarnail-singh-over-objectionable-facebook-post/story-KUhtisbNwci6f67r4qUy0L.html

13-08-2020||Lucknow||Centre approves urban mobility plan of 13 cities in UP||Decks have been cleared for revolutionary changes in the urban transportation system of UP after the central government’s approval to the urban mobility plan of 13 cities, including Lucknow.Now, things like bus rapid transport corridor on city roads, flyovers , underpasses, cycle pathways, walking pathways, intelligent transport system and goods transportation management would be a reality in the state.“The centre has approved our proposal, now we are going to make a comprehensive plan for urban mobility in the state capital and other 12 cities of state. People require other means of transport besides Metro rail. Under the Urban Mobility India Plan, the central government will provide 80% money for the projects while state will have to bear 20% of the cost,” said Deepak Kumar, principal secretary, urban development. He added, “Transport planning is a regular exercise. Our department makes policies and strategies that give a direction to transportation planning for overall urban planning.”Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said, “There are many other aspects to a city’s sustainability. While preparing a plan for a city like Lucknow ,we will have to think about clean air, safe and open urban spaces to walk at the same time commute with safety.”Authorities are thinking about public bike sharing system, pathways for walkers, maximum utilisation of roads with hybrid and electric buses .The only thing worrying officials is that most cities of the state don’t have a strong network of buses or roads wide enough to accommodate buses under BRTS.An official of urban development department said, “You can adopt BRTS but from where will you bring wide roads like Mumbai , Ahmedabad, Vadodara or Surat. Here, most of roads are not that wide. Moreover, they are heavily encroached and vendors occupy a major part of road. For example, which type of BRTS would be planned for areas like Aminabad, Alambagh, Chowk and Thakurganj where even pedestrians struggle to walk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/centre-approves-urban-mobility-plan-of-13-cities-in-up/story-IvdAYIYXX503TPTu50RC5O.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the E-block wonder||One of the most beautiful things in Connaught Place, Delhi’s colonial-era shopping district, cannot be purchased. It’s a tree in E-block: semal, or bombax ceiba.The towering deciduous tree clashes with the harmonic series of white columns that line the Inner Circle corridor. One ought to see this as nature’s polite intrusion. Although there are many trees in Connaught Place, this particular semal—its trunk draped with dainty vines— offers a most fantastic sight.Semal is one of the 252 species of trees found in Delhi. Its branches grow in tiers. They radiate from the trunk like the ribs of an umbrella—as described in the website of Delhi government’s forest department. The best place to see the tree in great numbers is in the diplomatic avenue of central Delhi’s Neeti Marg, which is almost totally wooded with semal. Two huge trees on the front lawns of Teen Murti Bhawan are also worth a view. Another grand semal stands tall in Jor Bagh market. But this lone semal in E-block has a most unique perspective: it stands against a backdrop of showrooms; here’s a lone wood making a quiet statement against a cluster of commercial concrete.With greens vines crawling about the trunk, with insects spreading out on the vine leaves, this is a one-tree wildlife sanctuary. Upwards, the trunk ends voluptuously in a dense foliage of branches. Beyond lies the infinity, the blue sky (these days at least).This semal is like a homage to the vanished wilderness of Connaught Place, which was a babool forest before the British destroyed it to make a market. Sadly, this tree is barely noticed by pedestrians. In the pre-corona era, when Connaught Place tended to be super-crowded, insensitive shoppers threw empty ice cream cups around the trunk. Beggar children played around it. When idle, tourist guides—for some reason most of them working in Connaught Place are from Kashmir—sat on a nearby bench and stared blankly at the tree.Semal, as any observant Delhiite will tell you, plays out the poetry of seasons extravagantly. Its leaves start falling in January. In February, it is bare. By March, red fleshy flowers appear that fall on the ground making a soft plopping sound, covering the roadside like a battlefield stained with martyrs’ blood. This is that brief period in the year when semal catches the attention of the thrill-seeking masses, if at all. Squirrels feed on these flowers. In May, fruits—sort of woody capsules—ripen and break open to release masses of silky fibres that are collected to stuff pillows and quilts. (In fact, a shoeshine boy walking by doesn’t know this tree’s name but he does know that it gives cotton.) While the bark and roots of semal are said to find use as a tonic and stimulant, the stem is used to prepare an aphrodisiac, according to Pradip Krishen’s book Trees of Delhi: A Field Guide.But semal is more than its utilities—this one especially is a phenomenon, and not just during its flowering time. The more you crane your neck to trace the upward progress of the tree here in E-block, the faster you escape from the claustrophobia of this bustling metropolis, and enter into a space peaceful and meditative. To make cities, trees are cut for houses, rivers are dammed for power. And so we citizens drift further from the nature. But this semal, surviving so joyfully in the heart of the Capital’, is a civilising influence on the metropolis. It has made Delhi a little more loveable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwala-meet-the-e-block-wonder/story-iCAtYlC67jqywCQy84FeBN.html
13-08-2020||Arts||Ebrahim Alkazi: A guru who was a father figure, say NSD alumni||An eminent theatre actor and drama teacher whose name is forever etched in the world of theatre, Ebrahim Alkazi, passed away on August 4, at the age of 94. The legend was an institution who groomed his students into becoming his masterpieces. These students have been emotional since the news of Alkazi’s demise broke. Actor-singer Ila Arun, who did a short term course at the National School of Drama (NSD) — with which Alkazi was associated as a director for about 15 years — says, “It’s a great loss. I still remember the time when I was in NSD, and performed in King Oedipus under the guidance of Alkazi sa’ab and it became a life long bond. I was always in touch with him and his family. All his teaching will be with me, forever. He was like a father to me. He made a difference to all those who came in his touch. Humare liye it’s the end of an era, an institution. His disciples must be feeling like orphans today.” Known to be one of the greatest teachers of his time, Alkazi believed in living with his students. Actor-director Satish Kaushik says, “He was a man who made personalities; one of the greatest teachers. The kind of status we have achieved today, he deserves kudos for that. Our training under him was not just about becoming an actor, but he also taught us how to walk in real life, and on the stage. He carved out personalities from us. All great actors, be it late Manohar Singh, Anupam Kher, Naseer bhai (Naseeruddin Shah), and late Om Puri, all learnt under him. I’m blessed that he taught us.”   A treasured photograph, of a very precious time. Early 1987. Just the day after the NSD silver jubilee celebration week, Mr E.Alkazi invited us, (the two batches still studying and our just graduated senior batch) to his farm house for a picnic. He had seen out recent play Kalidasa's Abhignana Shakuntalam in which I had played Shakuntala. He would ask me a lot of questions about what I had studied in these 3 years at NSD. ..and listen carefully to my answers... We were truly lucky to have been given this time by him..what a wonderful, brilliant and affectionate person..and such an elevating presence. A few weeks later he personally invited me to his home for dinner with him and his lovely wife, and our discussions continued....I was too wonderfully naive to be nervous, (and so passionate about NSD, so was not tongue tied in his presence) ...and we chatted the entire evening.He pulled out books on paintings to illustrate something we were discussing... Blessed indeed was I, by the great Guru himself!! #nsddelhi #ebrahimalkazi #actorslifeA post shared by  mita vasisht (@mitavasisht) on Aug 9, 2020 at 9:51am PDTActor KK Raina also becomes emotional while talking about his guru. He recollects, “I came from a small town in Kashmir and knew nothing when I entered NSD. He was my father; that one person who taught me how to eat with cutlery on the table. I was like a child, and he taught me everything. It’s difficult to speak now because honestly I have no words. I shared a very personal and spiritual bond with him. Whenever I’m in confusion and have to deal with a trouble, I remember him, take his name and the problem gets solved. It’s a tragic loss for me.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/ebrahim-alkazi-a-guru-who-was-a-father-figure-say-nsd-alumni/story-aJGQHvnSW2xQrcOWyobfrL.html

13-08-2020||Mumbai||Shock for others, but solar consumers get ‘0’ power bills||Though inflated electricity bills for June came as a shock for most city consumers, those who use rooftop solar power have had net-zero electricity bills over the past three months. A net-zero electricity bill means the consumer has to pay only basic charges or metre cost to the electricity distributor. KG Mittal College of Arts and Commerce in Malad, Maharashtra College of Arts, Science and Commerce (MCASC) in Nagpada, two residential bungalows in Versova, and the Noorani Masjid in Pathanwadi all shared with HT copies of their net zero bills for April, May and June. All these buildings have managed their power consumption through rooftop solar projects, which have provided the consumers with a free source of renewable energy that does not cause pollution and instead reduces carbon emissions. “After our installation last year, we have reduced 21.1 tons of carbon emissions in environmental benefits while saving 9,500 units of electricity using solar power. That amounts to Rs 45,000 surplus, which is adjusted against our monthly bills. This was a major reason for a net zero bill,” said Dr SB Arya, director, KG Mittal College, which has a 45 kilowatt-power (kWp) project with 71 panels. Dr. Siraj Chougle, principal, MCASC said, “Initial cost to set up solar may be high but once installed, their lifespan is 25 years. Basic installation cost can be recovered within five years and the remaining benefits, including being cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, serves for at least 20 years.” With an 84.5 kWp project with 250 solar panels across 2,000 sq. foot rooftop area, MCASC estimates savings of 56 tons of CO2 annually. Projects at residential duplex bungalows at Yari Road were much smaller (8.5 kWp and 4.2 kWp). Prior to installing solar panels, the electricity bills were very high, said residents. “It is unimaginable that we are paying almost nothing against summer bills of Rs. 15,000 per month prior to installation,” said Alok Khandelwal, a resident. The centrally-airconditioned Noorani Masjid with its 60 ton AC units has a 25 kWp solar power plant made up of 72 panels, which caters to the common areas that see 5,000 devotees per day. “Units saved during summer will ensure bills remain net zero even during monsoon,” said Rashim Gulam Rasul Maredia, chairman of the trust that runs the mosque. In June, citizens reported sharp increases in their electricity bills, with some being charged almost three times the monthly average. The lockdown imposed at the end of March led to Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission directing electricity distributors to suspend meter readings and charge consumers based on average readings for the winter months (December, January and February) in April and May. However, actual electricity consumption was higher and the adjusted amounts for April and May combined with actual meter readings, resulted in higher bills. Solar power distributors said awareness was key to enhancing Mumbai’s rooftop solar capacity. “Citizens are opting for the zero-energy model. However, there is a need for more awareness to understand environmental benefits for shifting from burning coal, gas and oil for electricity generation,” said Rizwan Chunawala, head of department (business development), MSS Renewtech, a solar energy company. Experts said rooftop solar projects were gaining popularity but Mumbai has tapped less than 5% of its potential. “The city can scale such projects to achieve a 1,000 megawatt (MW) rooftop solar target against its present capacity of 45-50 MW. The state needs to come up with its own policy to promote enhanced solar use, and convince citizens through incentives,” said SP Gon Chaudhuri, energy expert and chairman, International Solar Innovation Council. “Cost of such projects is expected to rise since trade relations with China have taken a hit. This, however, means more opportunity for India to develop its own equipment but at a slightly increased cost for end consumers,” said Chaudhuri. Prashant Badgeri, deputy secretary (renewable energy) in the Maharashtra government said, following the Centre’s announcement of a revised rooftop solar scheme, both private and government electricity distributors can scale such projects in their jurisdiction. “This will bridge the gap for citizens to approach multiple agencies for installations, and also acts an incentive for distributors to garner Centre’s subsidies,” said Badgeri admitting that Maharashtra was lagging behind Gujarat in terms of solar capacity and projects. “Awareness can come from understanding the viability of each project. For Mumbai, the feasibility of having enough rooftop space is a concern, and it is essential citizens study requirements before adopting such projects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shock-for-others-but-solar-consumers-get-0-power-bills/story-MBXG3yZUQjhlj33ChkwiXM.html

Gupta made the claim citing provisions of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966, which, he said, provides for 40% of the space in the assembly building to the Haryana, which, however, has got only 27% of the space till now. At least 20 rooms of the Haryana share in assembly building is in the possession of Punjab, he added.“We are not begging, but demanding only our rightful share. We are asking for what is our rightful share in the assembly building,” Gupta said.Punjab assembly speaker Rana KP Singh, however, had earlier claimed that “not an inch was due” to Haryana in the assembly building.Gupta said earlier when he had met his Punjab counterpart, he had agreed to have a meeting arranged between the secretaries of the two assemblies on the issue.“He had said the two secretaries would meet and discuss the issue. Later, I do not know what happened and he went back on his word. The meeting never took place. Now, without the two sides having any meeting or discussion, the Punjab speaker has been saying that not an inch is due (to Haryana),” Gupta told reporters here.He said he has also raised the issue with Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore, who is also the administrator of Chandigarh.Gupta said he would urge Badnore to intervene in the issue. “Fifty-three years have passed since Haryana was carved out of Punjab. We are only asking for our due share in the assembly building in Chandigarh (which serves as the common capital of both the states,” he said.Since Haryana came into existence on November 1, 1966, both states are having common buildings for their secretariats and assemblies besides having a common high court.Gupta had also said if given their share, Haryana officials would get enough space for work, further improving the functioning of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-begging-from-punjab-demanding-only-rightful-space-in-assembly-building-haryana-speaker/story-sNXzLR9iUHE7SsEJdCU0YP.html

13-08-2020||Mumbai||Maha’s foster care scheme: Take care of kids for 1-3 yrs||The state government is launching a foster care scheme under which citizens can parent children from state-run child care institutions for a limited period of one to three years. The scheme is being implemented as a pilot project in five districts including Mumbai suburban. The government has invited applications from interested parents. Maharashtra has about 450 government-run institutes that house thousands of children who are either orphaned or whose parents are unable to raise them. Children living in these child-care institutions and between the ages of 7 to 18 may be placed with families under the foster care scheme. “The basic principle of the Juvenile Justice Act is non-institutional parenting of children. Besides the adoption scheme, this is an opportunity for the children to live with the unrelated families albeit for a limited period. Their stay in the families will help them their qualitative growth,” said Manisha Birasis, program manager of the integrated child protection scheme and assistant commissioner, department of women and child development. Birasis said district-level committees comprising district women and child welfare officers, child protection officers, members of the child welfare committee and protection officers of non-institutional care will look into the background of the family who apply to foster children. “There will be strict monitoring every 15-30 days by us with the help of interaction with the principals of the schools, neighbours of the family and with the child itself. Children in conflict with the law, those living in observation homes and those in the age group of zero to six years are excluded from the scheme. The first category is excluded for security reasons, while children younger than six years have prospects of permanent adoption, which is our top priority. Children from child care institutes and in the age group of six-18 years are being placed in this scheme, among which our first preference will be the children between six-10 years,” she said. Explaining the difference between adoption and foster care, Birasis said adoption gives parents the rights of biological parents while foster care is temporary and the parents have no legal rights over the child. “The Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 emphasises non-institutional parenting of children and foster care is the scheme launched to fulfill the principle. The selection of a family, monitoring the parenting and follow-up are the crucial things that will have to be followed rigorously by authorities. They will have to ensure the children are not misused. Not only the children in the government institutes, but those from poor families who cannot take care of their children can be given out temporarily to families willing to take on the onus of parenting,” said Santosh Shinde, child rights expert. Child-care institutes house children who have been abandoned or whose parents cannot raise them. For the pilot project, 40 children from each of the five districts – Mumbai suburban, Pune, Palghar, Solapur and Amravaiti – are being placed in non-institutional parenting, with financial assistance of Rs 2,000 a month to the family that takes in the child from the institution. Hrishikesh Yashod, commissioner, women and child development, said the scheme has scope for revision and expansion depending on its success in the first phase. “We will expand it to other districts and the number of children placed can also be revised. The success of the scheme largely depends on selection of the families in which the children are placed for caring. We have a robust mechanism and broad-based committee for such selection. We have been implementing Bal Sangopan Yojana (BSY) for years in which children are placed in extended families if the biological family is not able to take care of their children due to financial crisis. In BSY, we give monthly financial assistance of Rs 425 to the family in which the child is placed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-s-foster-care-scheme-take-care-of-kids-for-1-3-yrs/story-iA7R07iIKiIEDseEVOdNHJ.html
13-08-2020||Mumbai||Pawar calls Parth immature for demanding CBI probe in Rajput case||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar was irked with his grandnephew Parth for demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and publicly ridiculed him. Parth is the son of his nephew and state deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. “We give no importance to what my grand-nephew says. He is immature,” Pawar told media persons at YB Chavan Centre on Wednesday.Significantly, Pawar also said that he is not opposed to CBI probe in the matter, which has been demanded by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. CBI has filed a case against Rhea Chakraborty and her family members after the Centre approved its probe in the matter.Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai apartment on June 14. He allegedly committed suicide.Responding to media queries on Wednesday, Pawar said farmers also commit suicide but media does not take note of that. “The suicide by the actor is unfortunate, but the way it is being discussed in the media is surprising. In my district, 20 farmers have committed suicide but no media has taken note of it,” he said.Pawar said he has been watching the Mumbai Police for five decades and is confident that they would handle the probe well. “Maharashtra and Mumbai Police are capable and I have 100% faith in them. If someone still wants a probe by CBI or any other agency, then there is no reason to oppose it,” he said, taking a cautious stand.On July 27, Parth had met state home minister Anil Deshmukh and demanded a CBI investigation in the Rajput death case. Parth’s demand was contrary to the stand taken by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition government, in which NCP is one of the partners along with the Shiv Sena and the Congress. The state government has been in favour of a probe by the Mumbai Police.“With the whole country, especially youth, seeking a proper investigation into the death of late Sushant Singh Rajput, I urged Anil Deshmukh to take national emotions into consideration and initiate a CBI investigation,” Parth had tweeted, in which he had also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.Pawar’s statement, however, has sparked speculations about differences within the Pawar clan which had seen open a revolt by Ajit and a few other NCP lawmakers last November when they got together with the BJP to form a government. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had sworn in as chief minister with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. Ajit, however, returned to the party fold after the government lasted only 80 hours as most NCP legislators refused to side with the rebel faction. A month later, Ajit Pawar was sworn-in again on the same position in the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government.Meanwhile, few hours after Pawar’s comment on Parth, Ajit reached Silver Oak, residence of the NCP chief in south Mumbai, and held a meeting where Supriya Sule, Pawar’s daughter and state NCP chief Jayant Patil were also present.Patil, however, tried to downplay the matter and denied any differences in the Pawar family. He also refused having any discussion on Parth’s statements in the meeting.“It was a scheduled meeting. We had discussion on several issues. The party allows everyone to express their views. He (Parth) may have said something that I’m not aware of. There was no discussion on Parth’s statements, also no clarification will be sought from him,” Patil said while responding to the queries after the meeting. NCP insiders said Parth had already met Pawar and Supriya Sule on Tuesday evening on the issue and tried to explain his side. But the NCP chief public comment indicates that things have not yet resolved, said a party insider.Parth had contested last year’s Lok Sabha election from Maval constituency in Maharashtra against the wishes of the NCP chief, and lost to sitting Shiv Sena MP Shrirang Barne. Recently, Parth also tweeted a letter saying that Shri Ram, who embodies the faith and cultural identity of India, will finally be home in peace on August 5, the day of the bhoomipujan of Ram Temple at Ayodhya took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pawar-calls-parth-immature-for-demanding-cbi-probe-in-rajput-case/story-KcloWXNaNcVjaMmTgPLraK.html

The CM personally handed over handsets to six students.At 26 different places, the ministers and MLAs distributed 20 smartphones each to mark the launch of the scheme, which marked the fulfilment of another major poll promise of the Congress government in the state. The scheme, for which ₹100 crore was allocated in the state budget for 2017-18, will benefit 1,74,015 Class 12 students of government schools in the first phase, to be completed by November 2020. Of these, 87,395 are boys and 86,620 girls, with majority in the OBC and SC/ST categories – thus bridging a major divide that was obstructing these students from affordable access to online/digital education. The bulk of the students – 111857, are from rural areas, and the remaining in urban government schools. Amarinder, who launched the scheme on the auspicious occasion of Janmashtami and International Youth Day through video conferencing at the secretariat this afternoon, said people believe in the promises listed in the election manifesto and it was, thus, his duty to ensure the implementation of each one of them. When the Congress listed smartphones as a poll promise, it was to provide global connectivity and empower the poor youth who could not afford them, said Amarinder, adding that in the present pandemic situation, these phones had assumed a bigger importance as they had become a necessity for education continuity. The CM said he wanted Punjab’s students to be abreast with the latest technology which they can use effectively for their education, which leverages technology in a big way today. Gone are the days of chalks and boards, he said, adding that the Government schools, which had seen a major transformation over the past couple of years, needed to be supported through technological initiatives by the state government. State Congress president Sunil Jakhar said the scheme would break the barriers of poverty, with even SC/ST and OBC students getting access to online education. Smartphones have become a necessity in these pandemic times, he said, adding that making youngsters tech-savvy was also a major step towards making them employable. The SAD-BJP government of the past had promised computers, laptops, tablets etc but had failed to deliver on its promise, as had the BJP-led government at the Centre, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-govt-distributes-free-smartphones-to-class-12-students/story-Yr7PTyGvlGQKsTh5UiTfWJ.html

When I talked to a few HPSC officials, they told me that they had released roll numbers on their official website. I am surprised to hear that as to why they did not tell us about the same,” he added. An official, who wished to remain anonymous, said over 1,000 candidates had applied for ten posts of DIPRO, of which over 250 were shortlisted for the examination.“More than 150 candidates remained absent in the exam,” he added.Rohit Kumar, another aspirant from Hisar, said he had been preparing for the written examination for the last two years, but the HPSC failed to issue any notification about the exam date properly.“On the one hand, the government is claiming to recruit people in a transparent and fair manner and on the other, it has failed to send information about the exam date to candidates. The forms for the posts were filled two years ago and the HPSC had released roll numbers only on its website. It didn’t send an alert message to us about the exam date,” he added.When contacted, HPSC chairman Ranjit Kumar Pachnanda said he would respond to this issue after an important meeting he was attending. However, his response wasn’t received till the filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-dipro-aspirants-miss-exam-allege-hpsc-failed-to-notify-date/story-MLq1nQFRDQk2UzGjw6NCSK.html

These students could not get admission in government colleges for graduation and postgraduation courses as the number of seats for general category reduced due to the implementation of SEBC and EWS quota, and hence had to opt for private education institutions.The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.The state government enacted SEBC Act granting 16% reservation in government jobs and education to Maratha community in November 2018 while the Central government enacted EWS Act granting 10% reservation to those coming from economically weaker section. As a result, the number of seats for open category students was reduced.“These 112 medical and dental students also had to pay high fees to pursue education at private colleges. Considering this, the state government decided to pay their fees,” said a senior government official.The decision will bring a financial burden of ₹33.06 crore on the state exchequer.Meanwhile, the state government has also decided to increase the stipend of medical and dental students by around ₹10,000 per month. The decision, which will come into effect from this month, was taken considering the service of junior and senior resident doctors in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic, officials said.According to the state cabinet decision, all the resident medical students will get ₹71,247 as stipend whereas postgraduate dental students will get ₹55,258 as stipend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-to-pay-fees-of-medical-dental-students-affected-by-sebc-ews-quota/story-qOY9SkvNWl7wSXxtSfJjdJ.html

13-08-2020||City||Faridkot royal property case: Caretaker trust challenges HC verdict in SC, hearing today||The Maharawal Khewaji Trust that manages the ₹20,000-crore worth properties of the last ruler of erstwhile princely state of Faridkot, Maharaja Harinder Singh Brar, has moved the Supreme Court against the Punjab and Haryana high court order declaring as forged his (Brar’s) will dated June 1, 1982, in its favour.The trust has filed a special leave petition in the apex court and the matter has been listed for August 13.The high court had upheld a Chandigarh court’s order on June 1, awarding majority share in the ₹20,000-crore property of Brar to his two daughters — Amrit Kaur, who challenged the will in 1992, and Deepinder Kaur. The court held that descendants of Manjit Inder Singh, the last ruler’s brother, would get their mother Mohinder Kaur’s share.As of the will in dispute, the court observed, trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated and shrouded with suspicious circumstances,” the court order said.In 2013, the Chandigarh district court had declared the will, which had entitled Maharawal Khewaji Trust as the caretaker of the properties, as illegal and void and granted inheritance to Brar’s two daughters— Amrit and Deepinder.Trust CEO Jagir Singh Sran said the will was “real” and they have challenged the high court verdict. “It’s a registered will and there are proofs of its authenticity. Our counsels have included some new facts in the petition. On July 10, on directions of Maharaja’s daughter Amrit Kaur, some men had made an attempt to take possession of the Faridkot Raj Mahal illegally and the police are investigating the matter. We will also bring this matter to the notice of the apex court. We will also seek stay on the FIR registered against the trust members on Amrit Kaur’s complaint,” he said. In July, a case of fraud was also registered against 23 trust members on the complaint of Amrit Kaur. Those named in the FIR include trust chairman Jai Chand Mehtab, who is also the son of complaint’s elder sister Deepinder Kaur, and his (Mehtab’s) sister Nisha D Kehr, who is vice-chairperson of the trust. A special investigation team (SIT) led by SP Bhupinder Singh Sidhu is probing the case.WHAT’S AT STAKEThe royal riches include movable and immovable assets in four states (Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana) and Chandigarh.Rajmahal, Faridkot: Spread over 14 acres, it was constructed in 1885 as the royal residence.

13-08-2020||Chandigarh||To contain Covid spike, Punjab to go for mass antigen tests on Delhi lines||Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to 10 worst hit states to adopt National Capital Region (NCR) model in their fight against Covid-19, Punjab has decided to make antigen testing its key weapon in the coming days and make the contact tracing fool-proof. The NCR, especially Delhi, used antigen testing as the key tool in bringing per day caseload and fatalities down, besides strengthening containment of the hotspots, an area where Punjab has fared poorly. In Delhi, as per information procured from daily health bulletins of the Delhi government, it conducted 4,98,214 rapid antigen tests and 2,64,717 RT-PCR tests between June 30 and August 8, after a period when the capital witnessed maximum number of daily cases across the country. This plateaued the fresh infection graph in the national capital. Punjab, on the other hand during the same period conducted 3,71,454 tests, including around 14,000 antigen. Now, Punjab will go for mass rapid antigen test that gives result for the infection in half an hour, thus helping in early treatment and contact tracing. Till now, Punjab’s focus has been on RT-PCR tests which take around 24 hours to get the result. “Antigen test is the key to controlling the virus and Delhi has emerged as a model in using this successfully to control the spread of the virus. Now, we have ordered 2 lakh antigen testing kits and our focus will be on achieving 30,000 tests per day by September first week,” said Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. However, the only concern with antigen testing is that it can give a false negative report and a person has to go for the RT-PCR test if he/she develops symptom. Punjab lags in contact tracingIn the NCR model, more focus was given on tracing all the contacts of a positive person within 72 hours. As per a senior Punjab health department functionary, contact tracing has been poor in Punjab — six per positive person — as compared to ICMR recommendation of tracing at least 10 direct and indirect contacts of an infected person. “People lie or hide information during the contact tracing and the problem is more in villages. There have been instances of attack on teams going to take samples of the direct contacts. In past one week, we have focused more on containment strategy,” said the nodal officer. As per a senior doctor involved in Covid-19 duties in Patiala district, the stigma attached with Covid has been the biggest hurdle in contact tracing. Close watch on hotspots Punjab has also faltered on containment of Covid hotspots. Only last week, there were fresh instructions to fully lock the containment and micro-containment zones. The nodal officer said the state was already following the NCR model and Punjab was the first state to demarcate containment and micro-containment zones on Delhi lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-contain-covid-spike-punjab-to-go-for-mass-antigen-tests-on-delhi-lines/story-BaC3qgKG8OBJFKLy6eHYcN.html
13-08-2020||Mumbai||State to table bill to change Mhada Act to ease redevelopment||State cabinet on Wednesday decided to make changes in the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) Act, 1976 to pave way for the redevelopment of the 14,227 cessed buildings in the island city. The amendment will empower the state authorities to forcibly acquire the cessed buildings for redevelopment if the owners and societies fail to redevelop them within a year of notification. The decision has been taken in the wake of collapses of cessed buildings during monsoon. The bill for the amendment is expected to be tabled in the monsoon session next month.The state has also made a provision of paying transit rent to the tenants vacating the dilapidated buildings. Redevelopments of many buildings have been stalled owing to the disputes and litigations while some are stuck due to lack of agreement between tenants and landowners.“Cessed buildings have been divided into three categories — those constructed prior to 1940 in A, constructed between 1940 and 1950 in B, and constructed before 1969 in C. Most of these buildings are in dilapidated conditions and need urgent redevelopment. The amendment empowers Mhada to acquire buildings by giving six months to the landowners and six more months to the society for the redevelopment. If they fail to do so, Mhada will take over the redevelopment and complete it within three years for the old tenants. Mhada can also tie up with private builders for the same,” an official from the housing department said. According to the amendment proposed, landlords will be compensated with 25% of the land cost as per the ready reckoner rate or they can opt for 15% housing stock from the saleable component in the redeveloped buildings. “In most of the cases, landlords were not giving no objection certificates for the redevelopment, leaving the tenants to live in dilapidated buildings. A fourth of the population of the island city live in cessed buildings which are in dire need of the redevelopment,” said housing minister Jitendra Awhad. Fadnavis government had, in August 2019, taken the decision of issuing an ordinance in this respect but could not go ahead with it because of the change in the government. It had also announced cluster redevelopment of cessed and non-cessed dilapidated buildings in the island city. The decision taken on Wednesday has no provision for cluster redevelopment as Mhada is still preparing records of non-cessed buildings in the city. State to give compensation to kin of dead Maratha quota protestersState cabinet on Wednesday decided to give ex-gratia of ₹10 lakh to the families of the youths who lost lives during the Maratha reservation protests in August 2016. One eligible member of the family will also get a job in Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the government decided to fulfil the announcement made by the previous government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cabinet-proposes-change-in-mhada-act-for-ease-of-redevelopment-of-cessed-buildings/story-qSAgyIfNEQEgl8vklaTMXL.html

13-08-2020||Mumbai||Art teacher arrested for leaking exam papers||Azad Maidan police on Wednesday arrested an art teacher of a Chembur-based school who allegedly leaked intermediate papers on WhatsApp in September 2019. The police registered a first information report (FIR) against two art teachers, Amit Pore and Gangadhar Sawant, in July this year after an investigation report was submitted by the education department. “Amit Pore was arrested after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by session court and the high court recently. He was produced in the court and remanded in police custody till August 12,” said senior inspector Vidyasagar Kalkundre, Azad Maidan police station. Sawant has not been arrested yet. The mobile phones of the suspects have been given to the forensic department in Kalina forensic science laboratory to gather evidence, said Kalkundre. The intermediate drawing exams were scheduled to be held from September 26 to September 29, 2019 and the papers were leaked on September 24, two days before the exam. Following this, the concerned department of Directorate of Art of Maharashtra government cancelled the exams, said a police officer. The department then informed all the centres to return the sealed bunch of question papers to the examination centre. “The Art department formed a committee and during an inquiry, they found that the seal of one bunch of question papers, sent by the Chembur-based school, was tampered with,” said police. The inquiry further found the involvement of Pore and Sawant, who were the art teachers of the school and in-charge of the question papers. A written complaint regarding the matter was filed by the controller in September last year. “The police conducted an inquiry and found them to be involved. A case has been registered against both for breach of trust and under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act in the second of July, this year. Pore had first approached the sessions court and then the high court seeking anticipatory bail, but his plea was rejected. However, he surrendered in the metropolitan court on Monday and was arrested thereafter,” said Kalkundre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/art-teacher-arrested-for-leaking-exam-papers/story-awdv9JMFDpwYGZp9waz1rN.html

Dr Sheetal Radia, head and neck cancer surgeon in Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road led the bilateral neck dissection surgery. The patient has been discharged from the hospital and can eat, swallow and speak properly now.The patient had developed swelling on the right side of his lower jaw around two months ago and consulted local doctors but nothing helped the pain. However, as he started having difficulty in chewing food and also faced difficulty to open his mouth, he was later admitted at Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road.Dr Atul Narayankar, consultant medical oncologist at the hospital said the patient had swelling and pain in the lower right jaw for two months. A CT scan and biopsy confirmed that he was suffering from stage 4 cancer which includes cancer in the buccal mucosa throat, lips, mouth, nose, and salivary gland. The patient used to consume tobacco and gutkha and also had a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection which increased the risk of head and neck cancer, the doctor said. As the tumour was large and had spread to the nodes in the neck, the doctors suggested two chemotherapy sessions to shrink the tumour before surgery. The patient completed the chemotherapy sessions in April and May, and as the patient responded well to the therapy, the surgery was undertaken last week. In a five-hour surgery, more than half the lower jaw with cancerous lymph nodes in the neck was removed along with the upper bone, buccal mucosa muscle, and the skin, and it was replaced with the flap from thigh muscle (anterolateral thigh flap), Dr Radia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/9-5-cm-tumour-removed-from-man-s-jaw/story-UXAmvwMHmv8JEVFsQQmpHI.html

13-08-2020||Mumbai||Staff entitled to a switch in post if disabled during employment period: HC||Every employee who acquires a disability during the course of his employment is entitled to be shifted to another suitable post, irrespective the percentage of his disability, the Bombay high court said, on Wednesday A single judge bench of justice Milind Jadhav on Wednesday rejected argument advanced on behalf Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking that it was not bound to accommodate a bus conductor Sadashiv Gaikwad on another suitable post, after he acquired disability of a lower limb, since the percentage of his disability was less than 40℅. The judge also rejected BEST’s contention that Gailwad was not entitled to the benefit of shifting to another suitable post after his accident, as contemplated under section 47 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, and that the civic undertaking was justified in terminating his services. Justice Jadhav held that for claiming the benefit of section 47 a person does not have to be certified as a “person with a disability” - a person with 40℅ or more disability. The judge clarified that section 47 envisages that if an employee acquires a disability during the course of his employment and becomes unsuitable for the post held by him, the employee should accommodate him on another suitable post, with same service benefits, and if no other suitable post is available, he should be posted on a supernumerary post till the time such a post becomes available. “That is the mandate of section 47,” said the judge. “There is nothing to suggest that for applying this mandate, the employee must be shown to be a ‘person with disability’ within the meaning of section 2(t), that is to say, a person suffering from not less than 40% of any disability as certified by a medical authority.” HC said the interpretation sought to put by BEST on section 47 could not be accepted, as it would lead to an absurdity, in as much as, such reading of the benevolent provision would allow employers to terminate services of employees, if the percentage of disability acquired by them is less than 40℅. “That would be a travesty of justice and no sensible legislature could have ever intended such result,” said the court. Gaikwad was appointed as a bus conductor in September 1993 and was attached to Malvani depot. On May 3, 2011, he met with an accident in Pune district and suffered a serious injury to his left knee. After lengthy treatment, when he went to resume duty in January 2012, for some period he was accommodated on other posts with light duties, but eventually his services were terminated on September 1, 2015, on the ground that it was not possible to accommodate him anymore further on any post having light duty. In between, the bus conductor was referred by his employer to various public hospitals in the city, one of which evaluated the percentage of his disability at 17℅ and was also refused disability certificate as the disability was less than 40℅. Gaikwad then moved an appeal before the commissioner and competent authority for welfare of persons with disabilities, who on October 8, 2018 ordered his employer to reinstate him in service, pay him back wages and accommodate him on a suitable post. BEST had then approached HC challenging the October 2018 order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/staff-entitled-to-a-switch-in-post-if-disabled-during-employment-period-hc/story-cvs1WqhY5Wevxce297KP9M.html
13-08-2020||Mumbai||Whale shark found cut into pieces for sale; 2 detained||The carcass of a 20-foot-long dead female whale shark was caught by a fishing boat which was brought to Sassoon Dock in Colaba, on Wednesday morning. The shark was cut into pieces in an attempt to sell the protected species to a distributor. Two people have been detained in the matter and further investigation is underway by the fisheries and forest department.Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, and listed as ‘endangered’ species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are the largest species of any fish that can reach a maximum length of 40-feet.On Wednesday morning, Sassoon Dock fishers informed the police about the presence of the whale shark, forest officers said. “The fishermen who caught the protected species left it at the dock and fled, but as we were reaching the site for further investigation, a trader cut up the 20-foot marine animal into pieces, and intended to sell it,” said Suresh Warak, range forest officer (mangrove cell).“By the time we reached the site, the trader had fled, but we managed to detain the buyer, Jan Bahadur Yadav, 50, and tempo driver, Sham Rajaram Dhar, 35, under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Based on their statements, arrests will be made and they will be presented before a district court on Thursday,” said Warak. Warak said a punchnama had been filed. “Interrogations are underway to identify the trader responsible for desecrating the shark, and further course of action will be taken including arrests for offences under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” he said.Meanwhile, the fisheries department said they were investigating the boat responsible for catching the whale shark. “With help from Mumbai Port Trust, we have got a list of boats that arrived at Sassoon Dock on Wednesday for landings, and have identified a few that could be responsible for this incident,” said Sanjay Wategaonkar, assistant commissioner of fisheries. “They have already been informed to report to us at the earliest. On completing our investigations, we will hand over our findings to the mangrove cell for further action. In the meantime, we will be cancelling the license of the boat under the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981, responsible for this.”The incident comes eight days after the fisheries department initiated an investigation and called for action regarding unauthorised fishing practices affecting rare and endangered marine species along Maharashtra. “An incident like this has not happened along the Mumbai coast wherein the body parts are cut up. The fishing community treats the whale shark as a god and are also aware that they are entitled to a compensation of up to Rs. 25,000 for safe rescue of protected marine species,” said Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner (fisheries).The remains of the shark were transported to Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre in Airoli on Wednesday evening. “We will try to conduct a post mortem and the remains will be buried on Thursday after completing all formalities since it is a serious offence case,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Recent report warned about unsustainable fishing practicesMarine biologists from the Mangrove Foundation, under the state mangrove cell, had recently documented unsustainable fishing practices, excessive juvenile bycatch and illegal shark fin trade across seven landing centres along the state’s coastline including Sassoon Dock. They found that rampant fishing practices were leading to a rapid decline of threatened, vulnerable, and critically endangered sharks and allied species, the report had pointed out. Besides whale sharks, tiger sharks, white sharks, and speartooth sharks; other elasmobranch species such as hammerhead sharks, pointed sawfish, largetooth sawfish, longcomb sawfish, and guitarfish are also protected under the WPA, 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/whale-shark-found-cut-into-pieces-for-sale-2-detained/story-4ZWVPinrH8Lkv2tyzH4IhK.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Places of worship reopen after 5 months in Gurugram, Covid-19 scare keeps footfall low||Places of religious worship in the city reopened their doors for the first time in nearly five months on Wednesday, with strict administrative protocols in place to prevent crowding to check the spread of Covid-19.As per district administration’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), prasad (offerings) cannot be distributed to worshippers, deities cannot be touched, holy books cannot be brought to the respective religious institution and entry was to be permitted to only those wearing masks. Large gatherings were also prohibited, among other guidelines. With Janmashtami celebrations on Wednesday, Sheetla Mata Mandir reopened with extensive safety protocols in place, but the turnout of worshippers remained low on the first day. One gate was used for entry of worshippers while the second gate, located next to it, was for exit. The path between the two gates had been cordoned off with ropes, with around 80 temple workers and 40 police officers present to ensure that social distancing was maintained. Worshippers were allowed entry only after their temperature was checked with thermal scanners. The administration also ensured that everyone who gained access to the temple premises were wearing masks.“To ensure there is not a huge gathering of worshippers, we were allowing 5-10 people to enter after a corresponding number of people were seen leaving the premises. At several points, our workers had been deployed with hand sanitizers. They ensured sanitization and social distancing measures are properly followed,” said Yugdutt Sharma, temple officer, Sheetla Mata Mandir Shrine Board.At the Hanuman Mandir at Bristol Chowk, Shiv Mandir in Sikanderpur and Chintpurni temple in sector 5, only the temple priests were present, who said there was little to no footfall throughout the day.“Less than 10 people came to the temple today. I am not expecting a large footfall until the next month as most people wouldn’t be aware that places of religious worship had reopened. Regardless, boards have been erected outside informing worshippers to maintain social distance and that they will be allowed entry only if they are wearing masks,” said Sanjay Shastri, the head priest at Hanuman Mandir.Daman Rodgers, pastor of Epiphany church in Civil Lines, said that all 12 major churches in the city remained closed on Tuesday. However, he said that disinfection and sanitization measures were undertaken at all the churches.“There are two main reasons we didn’t open our churches today. Firstly, we were a little confused with the district administration’s guidelines, as it specified that no large gatherings are allowed but they did not specify a definite number. We have written to the administration for clarification on the same. In addition, we are also waiting for directions from our bishop, who oversees all churches in Northern India, on reopening,” said Rodgers. Rodgers further said that all churches have started working strategies to ensure social distancing is maintained and are keeping an upper limit of allowing in only 50 worshippers at a time.Jan Mohammad, imam of Sadar Bazaar mosque, said all 13 major mosques across the city reopened on Tuesday amid strict restrictions, but he added that there was virtually no footfall on the first day.“Through the loudspeakers in our mosques, we kept announcing that worshippers exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 should not venture outside and stay indoors. We also told our followers to ensure senior citizens and children stayed indoors preferably. At all entry points, we had placed hand sanitizers and thermal scanners, and worshippers were allowed entry only if their temperature was within the permissible limit,” said Jan Mohammad.He further said that a total of only 20-25 worshippers came to the mosque on the first day, and adhered to the administration’s guidelines to not allow religious texts inside. A few worshippers who had carried Quran with them were asked to leave them back at their respective houses and subsequently return to the mosque.“Gurdwaras reopened across the city on Wednesday after all necessary sanitisation and disinfecting measures were undertaken. Around 15 worshippers came to the gurdwara today. Their temperatures were checked with thermal scanners and hands sanitised before entry. They were only allowed to bow their head before the holy book and leave the premises immediately,” said Baljeet Singh, committee member, South City 1, Gurudwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/places-of-worship-reopen-after-5-months-but-virus-scare-keeps-footfall-low/story-83obVgnlo6bbdKRJq5aLrL.html

13-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram conducts over 91,000 Covid tests per mn population, highest in the state||The Gurugram health department has conducted the highest number of tests per million population among all districts in the state, indicating the wide testing net cast for detecting Covid-19 infections, officials said. With a total of 129,075 samples tested so far for SARS-CoV-2 virus, the tests per million for Gurugram has reached 91,860, health officials added. Experts say higher number of tests per million is helpful in monitoring the infection and reducing the overall positivity rate. Data also shows that Gurugram’s tests per million is higher than Delhi’s 64,412 (on Tuesday) but less than Goa which stands at 94,773. At the state level, Faridabad — which has the highest number of coronavirus cases — has done over 50,000 tests per million population and stands second in terms of testing on the list.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Within a week’s time, Gurugram will be crossing 100,000 tests per million, the highest among all the districts in the state, and probably across the country.” Experts too dubbed the feat as remarkable for Gurugram. Dr Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said, “The tests per million indicate how widely Covid-19 tests are being made accessible to the masses. It highlights the overall capacity of testing. Going by the data, Gurugram tests per million population is five times more than the national average.” To closely monitor the epidemic, the testing data should have details as to where the tests have been widely conducted. “Scientifically, the tests per million comprise testing of samples collected from hospitals, containment zones and overall general population. The data on tests per million population is useful in monitoring the prevalence of infection if it gives details on these three aspects,” said Dasgupta. Otherwise, these are just cumulative numbers which are least helpful, added Dr Sanjay K Rai, professor, centre for community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. “Tests per million population has nothing to do with the overall population of any district or state. But it is significant only when looked from a broader perspective by taking positivity rate or total number of positive cases detected into account,” said Rai.“To see the progression of the disease, weekly data on tests per million and positivity rate has to analysed to derive conclusions instead of the cumulative numbers,” said Rai. According to him, Gurugram and Delhi are almost at the same pace in terms of positivity rate. Currently, Delhi’s positivity rate is 5.7%, while Gurugram stands at 7.5%. “The tests per million will continue to rise as testing is increasing. By simply doing random tests, numbers will keep on adding. The impact can be seen only if positivity rate declines,” said Rai. On this CMO Yadav, said, “Until the current test positivity rate of 7.5% reduces to 5% — the international standard set by the World Health Organisation for keeping Covid-19 infection under control — the department will continue to do more than 2,000 tests per day.” Gurugram is conducting both antigen detection and gold-standard RT-PCR based testing to identify new cases.He added that only after the positivity reduces to less than 5%, the number of tests conducted in a day will slow down to 700. “If the positivity rate is further reduced to 3% then only those people who are reporting of symptoms or others who need to be tested, only their samples will be taken,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-conducts-over-91-000-tests-per-million-population-highest-in-the-state/story-KYT0uerF2GTTzMWOzDSdHK.html

They alleged that the landowner had a dispute with the developer, Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd (THIPL) and on Monday sent his men and forced the security team deployed at the site to leave. The daily wage labourers too were not allowed to enter, the complainant said. The landowner on his part said the developer owed him ₹50 crore since the last many years.Canary Greens project was launched by the THIPL in 2010, and possession was slated for 2014. The company had entered into insolvency proceedings with the National Company Law Tribunal since October last year. Buyers said 60% of the work had been completed.Nilesh Sharma, a resolution professional looking into the Canary Green project, in his complaint said four persons barged inside the project site on Monday. “These miscreants halted cleaning work undertaken by the labourers and threatened the security guards deployed for the security of the site,” wrote Sharma and asked police to take action against them. When asked about the matter, a spokesperson of THIPL said that the company has gone into insolvency because cases were filed by contractors and some of the buyers. “We are trying to get the project work started as per the rules, however, the landowners have taken over the project site illegally,” said a spokesperson of the company.Landowner Siddarth Yadav admitted that he had taken over the plot after he was not paid the ₹50 crore as cost of the land nor had the developer given him possession of a promised property in the project. “The title of the land has not been changed and neither has the payment been paid. The external development charges and infrastructure development charge (EDC/IDC) in crores is pending with the government. The project is under dispute and that is the reason work has been stopped,” said Yadav.The police, meanwhile, said that a complaint has been received in this regard and the matter will be probed.Rajeev Goel, president of the Canary Greens Buyers Welfare Association, said that the realtor failed to deliver the apartments and no action was taken by authorities to ensure the completion and delivery of the project. “THIPL has been undergoing insolvency proceedings in National Company Law Tribunal since October 31 last year. The buyers association, in collaboration with resolution professional, is trying to work out a solution by collecting money and completing the project somehow. There is pendency in the form of EDC/ IDC amount, Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority certification and the company is in dispute with the land owners with regards to the financials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/home-buyers-lodge-police-complaint-as-landowner-takes-over-21-acre-plot/story-SMFtUqbpzfnUWlIuOLeTWJ.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Cattle trader assault: Victim shifted to Safdarjung hospital as family demands justice, action||A 30-year-old cattle trader, Nasir, who along with his minor brother, was assaulted with sticks by at least two men in Begumpur Khatola , was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi on Wednesday afternoon, where his condition is stated to be stable.Nasir, who hails from Ghasera village in Nuh, and his brother had been called to Begumpur Khatola by the suspects on the pretext of selling a buffalo on Tuesday. The two suspects, identified as Adesh and Dilbag, from Begumpur Khatola, were arrested and released on bail, said police. The victims have alleged that the two men had assaulted them after accusing them of ‘framing people from their community in cases’, making a reference to an incident on July 31 in Badshahpur, where Lukman, a driver from Ghasera in Nuh, was beaten up with sticks and a hammer on the suspicion of transporting beef. In a video clip, allegedly recorded on Tuesday, Nasir, said, “For three days, the suspects had been calling us to Begumpur Khatola to sell a buffalo. They said ‘tum wo ghasera wale ho, hamara khaate ho and hum par mukadma karte ho’ (You are from Ghasera, you trade with us and then file cases against us). They said you are from Lukman’s village.” “After the assault, the villagers rescued us. We were taken to the police chauki. I did not record any statement to the police as I was not conscious at the time,” added Nasir in the clip. Police said that the suspects were arrested on Tuesday but have so far strongly denied that they had any links to the men involved in the attack on Lukman on July 31. Subash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “These allegations are false. The FIR was lodged on the basis of the complaint of the victims.” The victims and their families on Wednesday urged the police to book the arrested duo under stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code. Nasir’s father, Shahabuddin, said, “The incident took place between noon and 1pm. After my sons were rescued by the villagers, the police took them to the police station and an FIR was registered only at 6.30 pm. Two more people were involved in the attack. Police should add stringent charges of attempt to murder and conspiracy to the FIR as this was a preplanned attack. The accused have been booked under bailable offences.” Sandeep Malik, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sohna, said, “The sections in the FIR are based on the nature of injuries and medical opinion is sought for the same and accordingly the investigation is conducted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cattle-trader-assault-victim-shifted-to-safdarjung-hospital-as-family-demands-justice-action/story-GgQKXw53RJoSUVHA72r0sN.html

The rescue operation was held around 11pm on Tuesday at a shopping plaza near Jagat Farms in Greater Noida. According to the shopkeepers, a 30-day-old puppy had fallen under a defunct elevator through an opening duct. The pup was stuck under the lift for around seven hours while its mother, which is fed and taken care of by the shopkeepers of the shopping complex, was persistently barking near the duct which moved the shopkeepers into numerous unsuccessful rescue attempts. “There are around ten community dogs around our plaza and we take care of them. This one was a puppy that’s why it fell through the duct. We tried to rescue it ourselves, but could not succeed and sought help from the NGO. They came immediately and the animal was saved late night. Now, we have covered the duct,” said Abhay Kasana, a shopkeeper at Jagat Plaza-3, who googled the rescue team and called them for help. The NGO named Smart Sanctuary had to cut open the steel flooring of the lift using a metal grinder. “The puppy had fallen under the defunct lift through a small opening. The duct through which it had fallen was so small that there was no other way but to cut the duct open. We cut open a small portion of the lift,” said Yash Raj, founder trustee of Smart Sanctuary. “The pup was alive but distressed. The compassion of the shopkeepers is commendable. They were all very helpful with the rescue operation. A young local boy also helped us by getting through the opening to rescue the animal,” said Kaveri Rana, managing trustee of the NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-animal-activists-rescue-puppy-by-cutting-elevator-floor/story-ZySyBU90GrklfIHduk7W2M.html
13-08-2020||Gurugram||Education officers told to crackdown against tests, screening by private schools for Classes 1 to 8||The state education department has directed all its district elementary education officers to ensure that private schools do not conduct tests as a screening mechanism for students in class 1 to 8. The department said that it had received complaints about some private schools in the state had been conducting tests in contravention of RTE rules and hence had decided to crackdown. In a letter shared with district education officers last Thursday, the department said that it had received complaints from various parents about non-government schools that were holding screening tests for admission in classes 1 to 8 and charging them for the tests. “Apart from conducting the tests, parents also being charged for appearing in such tests. This is a violation of section 13(1) and 13(2) of the RTE Act,” stated the letter. Further, the department has asked district education officers to ensure that all screening tests are stopped immediately and appropriate action taken against the defaulters. As per the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009, children between the ages of six to 14 years cannot be subjected to any form of screening. Contacted, district elementary education officer Premlata Yadav said that the department had issued directions at the block level to curb screening tests being conducted by schools. Yadav said that parents could file complaints against the erring schools and necessary action would be initiated. “These tests are not allowed and continue to be invalid. Screening through tests is a violation of the RTE Act. Some schools, however, continue to test students before granting admission. This is a violation of the rules in place and we will take strict action against such violations,” said Yadav. She added that even as the department takes action against erring schools, parents on their part should remain vigilant and file complaints if they find schools flouting norms.Kailash Sharma, general secretary of Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said that many schools were continuing with screenings through different forms. “The screening works at various levels. Apart from taking written tests and long interviews, some schools also filter children by giving admission forms to only graduate parents. These screening mechanisms are against set laws but due to lax implementation, such practices continue to take place,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/education-officers-told-to-crackdown-against-tests-screening-by-private-schools-for-classes-1-to-8/story-WK1mA8d2RnzPBzpSlpxrZP.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||‘We fear for our lives’: Residents, workers in complex complain of apathy, neglect||“I have been working here since 2005 and whenever any train passes by, one can feel the walls of the building shudder. The building is old and in a precarious state, but people continue to make alterations to the structure. None of the authorities concerned took note of the state of the building and construction,” said Ram Niwas (50), who works at one of the factories in the complex, in which a portion of a building collapsed on Wednesday, killing a police officer, and injuring another.Built before 1922, the complex is located barely 40m away from railway tracks and spans a 5,000-square yard area in Ram Bagh near Azad Market in north Delhi. HT visited the spot on Wednesday, and the building was visibly run down. Most of the walls were cracked, the cement had peeled off the walls, and balconies hung precariously on rusted, exposed metal beams.In the records of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s records, Azad market comes under the walled city area, which also includes areas such as Chandni Chowk, Jama Masjid, and other parts of Old Delhi. A senior official of the north corporation’s building department said, “No fresh construction or addition of floors are allowed in old buildings in the walled city area. In some cases, if there are renovations required, or the building has become so dangerous that a new construction is needed, the property owner has to seek permission from the civic body before starting any such work.”On Wednesday afternoon, mayor of the north corporation, Jai Prakash inspected the area and ordered a probe. “It is a case of illegal construction. The building is very old, and no permission was sought for constructions here. We are already conducting a survey of dangerous buildings in the north civic body’s area. In the survey we have found that there are 125 old and dangerous buildings in the old city area. The survey is still underway, but I have ordered officials to check if this building features in the list of dangerous buildings,” Jai Prakash, north corporation mayor said.After a building is found dangerous, the civic body issues notice to the owner to either repair the property or demolish the portion of the building deemed “unsafe”.Sections of the complex are owned by a number of traders. The building also houses offices of real estate agents and godowns.According to local traders, the building used to be a biscuit factory as far back as 1922. But it was shifted in 1970, and the property was bought by a local businessman, Shiv Shankar Gupta, who still owns a few portions of the property.According to people working in the area, the building was dangerous. Gupta said the building portion which collapsed was purchased by a businessman in 2002. He said the businessman was making constructions on the upper floors. “The building is very old, and some portions have become perilous. Authorities concerned were informed about the poor condition of the building, to no avail. Not even a single official of the civic body ever came here for an inspection, and no notice was served,” Gupta said.Labourers working at these factories also live in portions of the building complex. “We live in constant fear for our lives. Officials should make efforts to restore such old buildings,” Roshan Sahu, a labourer at a factory in the building, said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/we-fear-for-our-lives-residents-of-complex-complain-of-apathy-neglect/story-ILT7q3GDweOPb7aGxfMiEI.html

The two officers were in the building for verification of the tenants, officials said. Police and municipal officials said a third floor was being constructed in the run-down building, but no permissions had been sought for the same. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “The information we have received is that illegal constructions were being done in the building. I have ordered an enquiry into the matter to probe how and why the construction was happening. Any official found responsible for the laxity in the incident will not be spared.” Also read| ‘We fear for our lives’: Residents, workers in complex complain of apathy, neglectThe complex in which the building is located used to house a biscuit factory earlier, and is spread over nearly 5,000 square yards. The rooms in the building are owned by different persons. One of the occupants of the building said the rooms inside are used as toy assembling factories or godowns.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said that in the wake of the forthcoming Independence Day celebration, the deceased ASI Zakir Hussain along with constable Debu Singh of the Bara Hindu Rao police station had gone to Azad Market for checking tenants living in the area. Around 10.30am, Bhardwaj said, the two policemen reached Gupta Building at Ram Bagh Road and while verifying tenants living there, noticed illegal constructions being done on the third floor of the building. “The ASI and the constable went to the third floor to note details and take photographs of the illegal construction to send to the municipal corporation. The floor collapsed, and Hussain fell outside the building, while the constable fell on the second floor,” Bhardwaj said. A police officer associated with the investigation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Hussain was standing on the edge of the third floor terrace, while the constable was near the staircase when the floor caved in. “Hussain fell almost 40-feet onto a cemented floor outside the building. Some portion of the collapsed wall also fell on his body, causing multiple injuries to his head and other body parts. His bike parked outside was also damaged,” the officer said, quoting eyewitnesses. The officer said the injured constable, with the help of some locals, rushed Hussain to Aruna Asaf Ali hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The constable was also admitted there and is undergoing treatment. Officials said he is out of danger. “A case under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) and 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered in connection with the mishap,” Bhardwaj said. She said that the portion of the building where the mishap took place is owned by a Civil Lines resident, while the contractor who was carrying out the illegal construction has also been identified. “They will be questioned about the illegal construction,” Bhardwaj added. Police said the building’s ground and second floors are used as storehouses. Around four labourers who work in nearby factories and storehouses live on the first floor as tenants, while two kiosks that sell tobacco and groceries are located on the ground floor. Hussain joined the Delhi Police in 1993 as a constable. Survived by his parents, brother, wife, a daughter and two sons, he was the sole bread-earner in the family. His wife and children live in Wazirabad village, Hussain’s parents and brother live in a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut. His brother, Shahid Hussain said, “My brother left home for work around 8.30am, and in less than three hours we received a call from the Bara Hindu Road police station regarding the mishap and his death. We have lost the only earning member of our family. He wanted to see his two sons crack the MBBS and civil service exams and daughter become a teacher. All his dreams are shattered with his demise.” Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled north body over the collapse.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak alleged that the building collapse was a result of “corruption” in the civic body. “Such illegal constructions in Ram Bagh, which is in Sadar Bazar area, cannot take place without the connivance of the local councillor Jai Prakash, who is also the mayor of the north corporation. An FIR should be registered against Jai Prakash for corruption and allowing illegal construction in the area,” Pathak said.Hitting back, Prakash said he would resort to legal action against Pathak for levelling “baseless” allegations against him. “These allegations are absolutely false and baseless. It is an attempt to malign my image. I will send a legal notice to Pathak for making false allegations and tarnishing my image,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asi-dead-constable-hurt-after-portion-of-building-collapses-in-north-delhi/story-ojbXH1dvVjBcz8felb04qK.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal to mark I-Day from Secretariat in view of Covid; guest list limited||This Independence Day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will hoist the tricolour and deliver his speech from the Delhi Secretariat, which will be telecast live via the government’s social media handles, in the light of Covid-19 lockdown norms that prohibit gatherings.This would mark a break from the traditional celebrations at North Delhi’s Chhatrasal Stadium where the chief minister participates in a parade —a tribute to the freedom fighters —followed by a flag-hoisting ceremony and a speech, in the presence of thousands of people. Most of the galleries are often occupied by school children.In his speech this year, a senior official in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said, Kejriwal will focus on Delhi’s fight against Covid-19—including a vote of thanks addressing all doctors, health care workers, sanitation workers, plasma donors and all “Covid warriors”. He will not, in all likelihood, announce any new scheme or policy.At Chhatrasal Stadium last year, Kejriwal had announced the government’s scheme of providing free rides to women in Delhi buses—which was implemented from September 29.“The guest list this year will be limited to 100. The flag will be hoisted in the outdoor area of the Secretariat. The chief minister is likely to give his speech from his office on the third floor. We are also considering using the open plazas on the first and second floors. A final call on that is yet to be taken. But there will be no parade or other celebrations, the CMO official said.Cabinet minister Gopal Rai said, “Keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi government has decided to cancel the mega cultural programme celebrating Independence Day at Chhatrasal Stadium. However, a small programme will take place at the Delhi Secretariat. The chief minister and all the Cabinet ministers will be present.”Among other invitees are all seven Lok Sabha MPs of Delhi, all three Rajya Sabha MPs, all MLAs, the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, mayors of the three municipal corporations, bureaucrats working with the Delhi government and officials of the Tihar central jail, Rai added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-to-mark-i-day-from-secretariat-in-view-of-covid-guest-list-limited/story-grfG3bibwp0ELJoBhvz58K.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: 64-year-old man with five comorbidities fights Covid||A 64-year-old man coronavirus disease patient with at least four chronic illnesses -- cancer, kidney failure, heart disease and tuberculosis -- in addition to suffering a bout of pneumonia, all diagnosed in the past three months, was thought to have beaten Covid-19 and was discharged from Lok Nayak Hospital on Sunday, only to test positive for the virus again on Tuesday at a private hospital.His family is perplexed by what doctors say could be a false negative or a false positive result, or simply a case of the second test picking up non-infective residual fragments of the viral genetic material from the past infection.The patient, Raj Dev Dixit, is a retired professor who lives in outer Delhi’s Najafgarh, where he runs an NGO called Garima that works for the welfare of women and children.According to his son Amit Kumar, Dixit had no diagnosed illness and appeared healthy until three months ago. “He had none of the ailments he was diagnosed with in the past three months. He used to walk 10km every day,” Kumar, who is an assistant director at the ministry of Ayush in Kolkata.Kumar said that on May 18, Dixit was suddenly takenl ill and lost his appetite, which prompted his family to move him to a hospital where he was diagnosed with one failed kidney. “Over the next few weeks, he was diagnosed with myeloma (a cancer of the plasma cells) and his heart was found working at 20% of its capacity,” Kumar said, adding that they got him admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital in Rohini where he received chemotherapy and dialysis.“As he grew weaker, we were told that he had developed tuberculosis and later, pneumonia, “ Kumar said.On July 17, Dixit tested positive for Covid-19 at the cancer hospital.Dixit was admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital on July 18 where he got plasma therapy for the coronavirus disease, and dialysis treatment every alternate day.Dr Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said this was a “rare” case of a man with four chronic illnesses, plus pneumonia, also contracting Covid-19. “So far, we have admitted 7,600 Covid patients here, but only 60 of them had multiple comorbidities. While the others had a maximum of three comorbid conditions, Dixit’s is a rare case of a man with five other diseases,” Dr Kumar said. “Dixit had a very low chance of survival. In such cases, usually, if one disease is treated, another starts causing trouble,” he said.But on Saturday, when the patient was tested for Covid for the fifth time at Lok Nayak Hospital, the results came negative and he was discharged on Sunday.“We were so encouraged by this particular result that we decided that this case should feature in all leading international medical journals,” the doctor said.On Monday, Dixit was admitted for dialysis in Venkateshwar Hospital in Dwarka, where he was tested again for Covid-19 and the result showed him to be positive for the viral disease.A doctor of Venkateshwar Hospital, who didn’t want to be identified, said the hospital used the approved Genexpert test which turned up positive and the patient was recommended an RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) for reconfirmation. “He is stable now,” the doctor said on Wednesday afternoon. The RT-PCR repeat test is yet to take place.Dr Kumar said recovered patients can test positive again. “Sometimes, the dead virus in the nostrils of patients is picked up in the swab and that gives a false positive result. We’ll need to see the results of a repeat test,” Dr Kumar said, offering to treat him again at Lok Nayak Hospital, if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-64-year-old-man-with-five-comorbidities-fights-covid/story-AfjvZiqXGSv2UrCZLDf1vM.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||ITO: Delhi govt to commission study on reducing snarls||The Delhi government has decided to commission a feasibility study aimed at reducing vehicular congestion in the chaotic ITO area in central Delhi. The study will propose ways to redesign the junction, if needed, said a senior government official on Wednesday. The government, on Tuesday, floated a tender in connection with the study and the bids shall close on August 24. HT has seen the tender document. Once the work order is issued, the study is supposed to be completed within five months. The objective of the study is to propose changes in road designs, prepare a road map to implement the proposed changes, and survey traffic volume and pedestrian volume in different points of time, read the tender document. The study is supposed to include a road inventory analysis under which shops, parking areas, etc. will be identified and re-organised. For instance, on-street and off-street parking areas will be designated and properly marked with signages, said a senior official in the public works department, who did not wish to be identified. The official further said the study would delve deep into components such as arterial roads, service roads, footpaths, bus stops, location of public amenities, street furniture, drainage and landscaping. Traffic from six major stretches—Mathura Road, Tilak Marg, Sikandra Road, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and Indraprastha Marg—converges at the ITO junction. The junction is one of the busiest in the city at any time of the day. Elaborating on the scope of the feasibility study, the tender document which pegged the cost of the project at ₹30 lakh—said that it should provide a “comprehensive solution” that addresses the needs of vehicles, ensures safe movement of pedestrians and seamless traffic flow at the junction. A PWD official, requesting anonymity, said that a skywalk had come up in the area in 2018 and it helped the traffic situation to some extent. “The traffic volume count during peak hours will be a major component of the proposed study. Another survey would be needed to identify patterns of traffic directions (in terms of origin and destination) at different points in time,” the PWD official said. The official further said, “The study will also help to ascertain how traffic is affected by VIP movements, sport events and protests. It is expected to cover an area of 4km. The outcome of the ITO decongestion plan, along with the ongoing Pragati Maidan redevelopment project, which includes a traffic circulation plan around Mathura Road, Purana Qila Road, Bhairon Marg and the Ring Road, will result in holistically decongesting all these stretches.” Considered one of the busiest intersections in the national capital, the ITO area witnesses snarls regularly. The peak hours are worse. “We have been taking measures to regulate traffic in the area. A government-sanctioned traffic study from 2017 suggests that nearly 4.5 lakh vehicles pass the junction throughout the day, but that study does not provide exact data about traffic flow at different tim,” said S Velmurugan, chief scientist at the traffic engineering and safety division in the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI). He further said, “The study should also consider pedestrian issues in the area. Measures such as the construction of a 1.2km-long tunnel between Purana Qila Road and Ring Road along with six underground U-turns on Mathura Road, Bhairon Marg and Ring Road will decongest the ITO crossing and W-point near Pragati Maidan. These measures should come up at the earliest. Delay only aggravates the problem.” Since 2003, the Delhi government and several agencies such as the traffic police, Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre, and CRRI, have conducted several studies and proposed numerous plans to decongest the ITO junction. The latest attempt comes around two months after the Delhi Police is learnt to have urged the government’s public work department to do a holistic study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ito-delhi-govt-to-commission-study-on-reducing-snarls/story-uG7XHT2FExW5vYMpaWRwTJ.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||OBE exams: Colleges get answer scripts of ‘unknown’ students, DU says will sort them out||Several Delhi University (DU) colleges have received answer scripts of “unknown” students during the first two days of the ongoing online open-book examination (OBE), raising concerns that these answer scripts could be “misplaced” and thus lead to “utter chaos” during the evaluation process. The OBE exams, being held as a one-time measure this year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, began on Monday and will continue till August 31. Around 2,40,000 final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students of DU are taking the exams. During the OBE exams, students can either upload their answer copies on the university’s online examination portal or email them to their colleges or departments.After two days of exams, a few colleges said they have received answer copies of students who are not registered with them. For instance, Indraprastha College (IP) for Women has received nearly 50 answer copies of students not o their rolls on Monday. College principal Babli Moitra Saraf said, “We have received around 50 answer copies from students who are not registered with our college. We could not identify the name of the colleges of those students. We have kept these answer scripts in a separate folder and have informed the university administration about them. We have to wait for either the student or the respective college to come forward and clear up the confusion.”Around 40 such answer scripts reached Kirori Mal College (KMC) on Tuesday. College principal Vibha Singh Chauhan said, “We have also received answer scripts of students from other colleges. Following this, we have put up a notice on our website requesting students to send their answer copies to their respective colleges only. We have forwarded the 40 answer scripts to the university administration with a note that they are not of our students.”Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, said, “On Monday, we had also received a few answer sheets of students who are not registered with our college. We immediately forwarded them to the university administration.”Several faculty members raised concerns about this. Rajesh Jha, a member of DU’s executive council (EC), said, “The colleges will have a harrowing time collecting and compiling the answer copies for evaluation. Colleges will have to send such papers to the DU’s exam branch, where there a possible breach of student privacy may take place. Who will take the responsibility if these answer copies get misplaced?”Despite several attempts, DU dean of examination Vinay Gupta did not respond to calls and texts seeking is comment. Sanjeev Singh, head of computer centre, DU, said, “Colleges have informed the examination branch about them getting answer scripts of students from other colleges. The colleges will send such answer scripts to the exam branch. The branch will segregate these answer copies on the basis of roll numbers. It will not be an issue. When the colleges have designated email IDs, students should refrain from sending answer scripts on other email addresses.” Abha Dev Habib, treasurer of DU Teachers’ University (DUTA), said, “The university’s exam branch is going to have nightmares while compiling answer scripts as several students are submitting them multiple times. How will the university decide which script, from among the multiple submissions, will be treated as the final script for evaluation?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/obe-exams-colleges-get-answer-scripts-of-unknown-students-du-says-will-sort-them-out/story-ySMry9oY9QW8AaXlzfTECM.html
13-08-2020||Delhi||Second sero survey results in another week: Satyendar Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the result of the second sero survey in Delhi is likely to be ready in another week. “The sample collection was done between August 1 and 7. We expect that the result will be ready in another week,” Jain said. On July 21, the first sero survey conducted by the Delhi government, conducted on Union home minister Amit Shah’s recommendation, showed that 23% of the 21,387 samples collected between June 27 and July 10 had a prevalence of antibodies, suggesting the individuals had contracted the Sars-Cov-2 virus and recovered. The next day, Jain announced that sero surveys would be conducted in Delhi on a monthly basis, with samples collected on the first five days of a month starting August. Between August 1 and 7, teams of district health officials collected more than 15,000 samples for the second sero survey. Sero survey is an epidemiological survey covering a representative population – the number of people, where they reside, their age and gender is meant to reflect the city’s demographics and who the outbreak affects. The highest number of samples for the second sero survey were collected from the north-west, west and central revenue districts in Delhi. On Wednesday, Jain said nearly one-third beds in Covid hospitals in Delhi were presently occupied by patients from other states. On June 7, when cases of Covid had started to peak in the Capital, the chief minister had issued an order, saying hospitals under the Delhi government as well as private ones should only be accessible to local residents until the situation subsided. The order was struck down by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-sero-survey-results-in-another-week-jain/story-OyXgk5humW190shplSv91M.html
13-08-2020||City||Students held for protesting at DU’s arts faculty||Six student activists from Delhi University were booked for unlawful protests and not following social distancing norms on Wednesday by holding a demonstration at Delhi University’s Faculty of Arts while demanding the release of DU professor Hany Babu who was arrested last month in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence case.Babu, a 54-year-old associate professor of English, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in Mumbai on July 28.“Students’ Federation of India (SFI) along with other progressive organisations protested at Arts Faculty, Delhi University demanding the release of Professor Hany Babu.The peaceful protest was met with severe hostility by Delhi Police. Students are being curbed from exercising their democratic right to protest,” SFI said in a statement.But police said around 10-12 students gathered at Arts Faculty on Wednesday afternoon to protest and were told that this was not allowed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.“The students kept on protesting despite several requests and have been apprehended for violation of order under section 144 CrPC. A case under section 188 of Indian Penal Code, 3 Epidemic Disease Act and 51/57 DM Act is being registered against them,” deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-held-for-protesting-at-du-s-arts-faculty/story-M5NRGWh1Aops1w0pLaXADI.html
13-08-2020||Pune||Number of Covid-19 patients in Pune on oxygen support up by 327 in August||As the Covid-19 positive cases surge there has been a rise in the number of patients on oxygen support and critical patients. In August 327 more Covid-19 positive patients have been admitted to various city hospitals who need oxygen support, with 97 more in critical condition.The reason doctors say silent hypoxia, in this case, is the symptoms to kick in late which is causing patients to land up at the hospitals at the last minute when they require oxygen.The number of Covid-19 positive patients who require oxygen treatment has gone up from 2,153 as of August 1 to 2,480 as of August 11.Along with the number of people who need oxygen the number of critical patients has also risen substantially with 638 critical patients as of August 1 to 735 as of August 11.As of Tuesday, 3,215 out of 14,705 or 21.86 per cent of the Covid-19 active patients are either critical in ICU (intensive care unit) or need oxygen treatment.Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director from Sahyadri hospital said, “It is true that we are seeing an increase in number of people who require oxygen. While earlier people saw symptoms in the first week itself, now due to hypoxia the symptoms kick in late like on the seventh or eighth day when the person requires oxygen.”“Also most people are now isolated at home and so when they come in the symptoms are severe that they need oxygen treatment. It could be because the virus has mutated and the strain prevalent in the city or country is causing these changes,” he said.“There is no particular age which requires oxygen treatment, we are seeing patients as young as 20 or 30-year-old who require oxygen, it is more related to their immunity,” he said.Dr Parikshit Prayag, Covid-19 consultant, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “It is true that people are coming at a time when they need oxygen and that the symptoms are seen late nowadays. This could be an indicator of the change in virulence of the virus but more needs to be studied.”“Drop in oxygen saturation is the first indicator and so everyone should check their oxygen saturation through a pulse oximeter which can be checked regularly and has to be maintained above 93. Patients come to us when their saturation levels have dropped below 80 sometimes when they need oxygen treatment,” he said.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer Covid19, said, “People are coming late to the hospital or are being detected late. For those who are isolated at home who have observed symptoms like fever, cold or cough take off the counter medicines which subsides the symptoms which later come back.”“We have also observed a similar pattern and there could be two reasons either the virus is mutating which is causing such changes, this need to be studied further, or that the patients are being detected late as the symptoms develop later,” he said.“Also, the period between seven to ten days after the virus has entered the body is when the cytokine storm kicks in and needs to be monitored carefully. Even those in home isolation, need to monitor their pulse oximeter and temperature and get in touch with the consulting doctor as soon as they notice any variation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/number-of-covid-19-patients-on-oxygen-support-up-by-327-in-august/story-VUyx9oreUvV4vrJnwCEGGP.html

The matter will be investigated,” Michaelwar said.According to local corporator Balasaheb Borate 12 bodies were crammed in the ambulance owned by Ahmednagar municipal corporation. “Bodies of four women and eight men placed on each other. They were taken to Amardham for final rites which is two-kilometre away from the civil hospital,” said Borate adding that if need be, he will file a police case against the municipal commissioner.Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation has only one hearse van to carry the bodies. Till August 12, total of 112 patients succumbed to Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection in the city. “The civic body should increase the number of ambulances. As relatives are not coming to perform final rites, the municipal authorities are neglecting this work,” said Borate.Another class IV employee, responsible for carrying Covid bodies on condition of anonymity said, “ We have been carrying out this work for last four months, but no one asked whether we are getting proper personal protection kits while performing our duties. If we are suspended at least will get relief from this work.”Guidelines for handling Covid-19 bodies· Body has to be secured in a body bag, the exterior of which is decontaminated.· Personnel handling the body may follow standard precautionsof hand hygiene, use of masks and gloves· Vehicle, after the transfer of the body to cremation/ burial staff, will be decontaminated with 1 per cent sodium hypochlorite.-Crematorium/ burial ground staff should be sensitised that Covid-19 does not pose additional risk.· Viewing of the dead body by unzipping the face end of the body bag (by the staff using standard precautions) may be allowed, for the relatives to see the body for one last time.· Religious rituals such as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling holy water and any other last rites that do not require touching of the body can be allowed.· Bathing, hugging of the body is not allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahmednagar-civic-chief-promises-action-after-bodies-of-12-deceased-covid-patients-crammed-into-ambulance/story-l2hGhh1kkj4oyiaslxlIXL.html
13-08-2020||Pune||Street food vendors, mess and hostel owners face the heat as students skip Pune||Street food vendors, food canteen businesses and hostel owners are facing a grim future as they slowly resume their operations after the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown is lifted. Their businesses, mostly located in central Peth areas in Pune, primarily focussed on consumers who were outstation students who had moved to the education hub for studies. Amit Khillare runs a small snacks centre in Shukrwar peth area and he resumed his operations a few weeks ago, however, he said that his finances are abysmally low, consumer numbers not picking up and there are added maintenance costs . “Earlier, I used to start our snacks centre at 7am and my business would continue till 4pm. My daily income ranged between Rs 7,000 and Rs 8,000 and the main reason behind it were the outstation students who had come to study here and needed quick bites. Now with students not coming back from their hometowns, there is no business here and my daily income has gone down to Rs 1,500,” said Khillare. Hundreds of other small snack centres, who operate through carts in the city lanes, are also facing a similar bleak future. Specifically in the old Peth areas, there are thousands of such street food vendors and food canteen businesses who depend on outstation students for their daily earnings. “Before the pandemic, there was a waiting list of students wanting to register at our food mess. Our mess provides quality food at reasonable rates and hence, students would want our services to fulfil their daily food needs. Now the business is very dull and we have to search for customers and can’t afford to run the mess. Earlier, we provided daily lunch and dinner to 300 students, but now the number hardly goes up to 100 daily,” said Shankar Deshpande, owner of Gurukrupa mess in Narayan peth. Apart from the food business, hostel owners are facing the heat too. When students from across the country come to Pune for studying, they look for accommodation and Peth areas have various old wadas converted into PG hostels. One such owner of a PG hostel in Sadashiv peth is Ulhas Tumne. “I had 18 students living at our PG hostel and only four of them have returned till now. Due to the pandemic, no student wants to return to Pune as it is one of the Covid-19 hotspots. We also cannot force them to come back or give us rent as this is an extraordinary situation. We need to support and help each other, however, we are suffering huge financial losses as maintenance of the hostel is an ongoing process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/street-food-vendors-mess-and-hostel-owners-face-the-heat-as-students-skip-pune/story-ewJIvlvcgOW60gErEFOw8J.html

The chief guests for the event are Stephen Schwarzman, founder and chief executive officer of Blackstone Group, and Duncan Haldane, professor at Princeton University and 2016 Nobel laureate in Physics,” he said.While Schwarzman will deliver the commencement speech, Haldane will deliver the chief guest’s speech. Graduating students will participate via video conferencing, and the entire event will be webcast for public viewing.This is the first time IIT-B will hold a virtual convocation ceremony, with over 2,100 students graduating in various programmes, said P Sunthar, co-convenor of the convocation committee.“Since the convocation will be held online, we are currently working out ways to make the event a memorable one for all graduates, despite not being present on campus. Meanwhile, we do understand that all our graduates want to have a gala end-of-school bash, and we will organise a special get-together for the entire batch once the pandemic is over,” said Chaudhuri.IIT-Madras will also conduct an online convocation ceremony. “IIT-Madras has already decided that the convocation this year will be held online, keeping in mind the current Covid-19 situation.

13-08-2020||World||UAE, Israel to set roadmap towards establishing bilateral ties: Mohammed Bin Zayed||Israel and the United Arab Emirates reached an agreement to work toward fully normalized relations, a potentially historic breakthrough that US president Donald Trump said will facilitate peace in the Mideast.The move means the UAE would join Egypt and Jordan as the only Arab countries with normal ties with Israel, signaling the nations will send ambassadors and open more direct commercial relations. According to a joint statement on Thursday, the UAE and Israel will begin a range of talks in the “coming weeks,” while Israel also agreed to suspend efforts to declare sovereignty over parts of the West Bank.As part of the deal, Israel also agreed to suspend controversial moves to annex portions of the West Bank, an effort that was widely seen as having put any final peace agreement further from reach.The deal is a “significant” step toward peace in the Mideast, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, while the joint statement said a signing ceremony will take place at the White House.Ties between Israel and Gulf Arab states have warmed in recent years, in large part due to a shared distrust of Iran. But they haven’t ripened into open relations, let alone normalization.“The announcement is big and the White House will be able to claim that it has achieved a breakthrough in the traditional wall of divide in Arab-Israeli relations,” said Ayham Kamel, a Mideast expert at the Eurasia Group. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and former Mideast official at the State Department, called the accord a “win for all 3” nations.Comments from the leader of the UAE, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed, were more nuanced than the remarks from Trump and in the joint statement issued by the White House.“During a call with President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, an agreement was reached to stop further Israeli annexation of Palestinian territories,” bin Zayed wrote on Twitter. “The UAE and Israel also agreed to cooperation and setting a roadmap towards establishing a bilateral relationship.”Nevertheless, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, called it “a historic day” in Hebrew on Twitter and said he would speak publicly later in the day. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi wrote on Twitter that he followed the agreement and its efforts to foster peace “with attention and appreciation.”Pushback came swiftly from Palestinian officials. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, writing on Twitter that “Israel got rewarded for not declaring openly what it’s been doing to Palestine illegally & persistently since the beginning of the occupation. The UAE has come out in the open on its secret dealings/normalization with Israel. Please don’t do us a favor. We are nobody’s fig leaf!”‘More Aggression’Officials with Hamas, the US-designated terrorist organization that runs the Gaza Strip, were more blunt. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told Al Jazeera that the move was a “stab against the Palestinian cause and will encourage the Israeli occupation to commit more aggression against our people.”The joint statement published by the White House suggested the move will reverberate across the Mideast, and Trump said there is “a lot more to come.”“This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to the bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential in the region,” according to the statement from the US, Israel and the UAE.The announcement could be a diplomatic coup for Netanyahu at a time when he is under intense fire at home from mass protests against his government’s mishandling of the coronavirus and his continued leadership while under indictment in three criminal cases.A White House signing ceremony would also help Trump -- lagging in the polls ahead of November’s election -- evoke the spirit of the original peace deal between Israel, Egypt and Jordan, facilitated by then President Jimmy Carter as part of the Camp David accords in 1978.Trump later joked to reporters in the Oval Office that he wanted the new agreement “to be called the Donald J. Trump accord.”The president has long sought a Mideast breakthrough that would allow him to withdraw U.S. troops from the region and get out of what he called “endless wars.” He’s also sought to strengthen an anti-Iran alliance in the region, led by Saudi Arabia.At the beginning of his term in 2017, Trump called upon his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to help broker a big Mideast deal, though his efforts had largely stalled. Trump’s move early in his term to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and his decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty of the Golan Heights, quickly alienated Palestinian officials and much of the Arab world, leaving Kushner’s peace plan -- which effectively sanctioned Israeli annexation of much of the West Bank -- with few champions in the region.The backdown on the West Bank may have helped seal the agreement, analysts said.“The timing of the move also allows Netanyahu and Trump to climb elegantly down the annexation tree, when neither leader has the stomach to follow through on what would likely have been be a destabilizing move in the region,” said Shalom Lipner, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has served seven Israeli prime ministers.The decision by the UAE may also be seen as a prelude for its far bigger neighbor, Saudi Arabia, which has close ties with the UAE and has been viewed as informal contacts with Israel. Trump has made the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia the centerpiece of his Mideast strategy.Kamel of the Eurasia Group said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will inevitably follow the UAE’s lead but that will take longer as “his society is more conservative and succession politics adds a layer of complications. However, Riyadh will eventually move in a similar direction, albeit at a slower pace and with hesitation given the risks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-israel-to-set-roadmap-towards-establishing-bilateral-ties-mohammed-bin-zayed/story-EZL0S3KR1OS817TxiOn85I.html

13-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Italian prosecutors ask to drop pandemic probe into Premier Conte||Rome prosecutors sought permission to drop a probe into Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and members of his cabinet after complaints were filed by several citizens on how the government handled the coronavirus pandemic, according to a note from the premier’s office.Prosecutors notified the premier and ministers that they are under investigation following complaints from all over the country. Prosecutors also included a note, which specified that they considered the allegations “unfounded” and “to be dismissed,” according to a statement sent by Conte’s office.The complaints include crimes such as causing an epidemic, offenses against health, manslaughter, abuse of office, and acts against the constitution and political rights, according to the statement.In Italy, prosecutors are obligated to follow up on criminal complaints made by the public. After a preliminary investigation, they have to go to a judge for permission to drop the case or proceed to a more in-depth probe.The prosecutors’ request to drop the case will now be reviewed by a judge who will decide whether to accept the dismissal or order a full investigation. In Conte’s case, the decision will be taken by a court that deals specifically with investigations into ministers.Conte said in a Facebook post that he always acted in Italy’s best interest and based on advice from scientists and experts.The other officials charged are Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri, Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini, Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese and Health Minister Roberto Speranza.Italy was among the first countries to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic and to implement a strict lockdown of its population and businesses. The lockdown began in late February in some parts of the North and was later extended to the entire country in early March. Over 35,000 people died in Italy due to coronavirus, about half of them in the Northern part of the country.Conte has been criticized by political opponents both for not doing enough to stop the spread of coronavirus and for doing too much to limit citizen’s rights with a draconian lockdown measures that paralyzed the economy. While businesses and people are once again free to work and move around, the government recently extended emergency powers until October arguing that coronavirus is still present and can pose a risk to the country.“Conte should be arrested,” political opponent and League party leader Matteo Salvini said, according to Ansa newswire. “He didn’t close the red zones when it was needed and he closed Italy when he shouldn’t have. That’s a crime.”Salvini’s attacks potentially pose a threat to political stability in Italy as Conte tries to drag the economy out of its worst recession since World War II with 100 billion euros worth of stimulus measures passed by the cabinet since the start of the pandemic. The European Commission forecasts an 11% contraction of Italian GDP this year, which along with the extra spending will push the country’s debt well over 150% of output.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italian-prosecutors-ask-to-drop-pandemic-probe-into-premier-conte/story-MTY2CNPmF1pHpBmtBW9dMN.html
13-08-2020||World||Donald Trump announces ‘historic’ peace deal between Israel, UAE||US President Donald Trump announced Thursday Israel and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to a “full normalization” of relations, including re—establishing diplomatic ties.“This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential of the region,” said a joint statement by the United States, the UAE and Israel released by theWhite House.The leaders referred in the statement are President Trump, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and UAE’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed.“This is a truly historic moment,,” Trump said in Oval office. “Not since the Jordan-Israel peace treaty was signed more than than 25 years ago that so much progress has been made towards peace in the Middle East”.He added: “Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates.”The UAE and Israel will sign an agreement at the White House some time in the future, and will follow that up with other agreements over the next few weeks setting up embassies reciprocally and on investments, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, healthcare and culture.As a result of the the joint statement said Israel will “suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined” in the President’s Vision for Peace unveiled earlier and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world. As the US president said, the joint statement the three countries are “confident that additional diplomatic breakthroughs with other nations are possible, and will work together to achieve this goal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-announces-historic-peace-deal-between-israel-uae/story-FySr4s3pjqwgJHvdZdRGAI.html
13-08-2020||World||‘Truly historic moment’: Trump announces peace agreement between Israel and UAE||President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates and Israel have agreed to establish full diplomatic ties as part of a deal to halt the annexation of occupied land sought by the Palestinians for their future state.The announcement makes the UAE the first Gulf Arab state to do so and only the third Arab nation to have active diplomatic ties to Israel.Trump tweeted a statement from the countries, acknowledging the deal. He then told reporters in the Oval Office that it was “a truly historic moment.” HUGE breakthrough today! Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends, Israel and the United Arab Emirates!“Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,” he said. Joint Statement of the United States, the State of Israel, and the United Arab Emirates pic.twitter.com/oVyjLxf0jdThe recognition grants a rare diplomatic win to Trump ahead of the November election as his efforts to see an end to the war in Afghanistan have yet to come to fruition while efforts to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians have made no headway.For Israel, the announcement comes after years of boasting by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that his government enjoys closer ties to Arab nations than publicly acknowledged. Netanyahu has sought to build settlements on lands sought by the Palestinians and embraced a Trump proposal that would allow him to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank while granting Palestinians limited autonomy in other areas.For the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers. It also puts the UAE out first in a regional recognition race among neighboring Gulf Arab states.And for the Palestinians, who long have relied on Arab backing in their struggle for independence, the announcement marked both a win and setback. While Thursday’s deal halts Israeli annexation plans, the Palestinians have repeatedly urged Arab governments not to normalize relations with Israel until a peace agreement establishing an independent Palestinian state is reached.A joint statement from the U.S., the UAE and Israel was issued immediately after Trump’s tweet. It said delegations would meet in the coming weeks to sign deals on direct flights, security, telecommunications, energy, tourism and health care. The two countries also will partner on fighting the coronavirus pandemic.“Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East’s most dynamic societies and advanced economics will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation and forging closer people-to-people relations,” said the statement by Trump, Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the day-to-day ruler of the UAE. It said the leaders had a three-way call discussing the deal.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised the deal.“This is a remarkable achievement for two of the world’s most forward leaning, technologically advanced states, and reflects their shared regional vision of an economically integrated region,” he said in a statement. “It also illustrates their commitment to confronting common threats, as small — but strong — nations.”He added: “Blessed are the peacemakers. Mabruk and Mazal Tov.”Among Arab nations, only Egypt and Jordan have active diplomatic ties with Israel. Egypt made a peace deal with Israel in 1979, followed by Jordan in 1994. Mauritania recognized Israel in 1999, but later ended relations in 2009 over the Israel’s war in Gaza at the time.In addition to Trump, the main U.S. mediators for agreement were the president’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, special Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.The UAE is a U.S.-allied federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Formed in 1971, the country like other Arab nations at the time did not recognize Israel over its occupation of land home to the Palestinians.“Arab oil is not dearer than Arab blood,” the UAE’s founding ruler, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, once pronounced when agreeing to an oil boycott over U.S. military support to Israel in the 1973 Mideast war.The UAE relied on white-collar Palestinians in creating its nation. Over time, it maintained its stance that Israel allow the creation of a Palestinian state on land it seized in the 1967 war.But in recent years, ties between Gulf Arab nations and Israel have quietly grown, in part over their shared enmity of Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Prince Mohammed also shares Israel’s distrust of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the militant group Hamas that holds the Gaza Strip.It remains unclear what prompted Israel and the UAE to make the announcement now. In June, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the U.S. warned in an Israeli newspaper op-ed that Israel’s planned annexing the Jordan Valley and other parts of the occupied West Bank would “upend” Israel’s efforts to improve ties with Arab nations.The agreement gives Netanyahu a domestic boost at a time when Israel’s shaky coalition government is plagued by infighting and facing the possibility of early elections in the coming months. Netanyahu has seen his popularity plummet as the country grapples with a renewed coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing unemployment as the result of earlier lockdown measures.Netanyahu also delivered a valuable diplomatic achievement to his good friend, Trump, ahead of U.S. elections.Still, by dropping the annexation plan Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has made clear that he would oppose any moves by Israel to unilaterally redraw the Mideast map and annex lands sought by the Palestinians.Netanyahu also risked criticism inside his own hard-line Likud Party, whose members strongly supported annexation. Netanyahu appears to be betting that Likud members — and the small, but influential settler movement — will agree the peace agreement delivers more benefits than unilateral annexation. Opinion polls have shown that annexation is not a high priority for the vast majority of the Israeli public.Abandoning its annexation plan changes little on the ground. Israel already holds overall control of the West Bank and continues to expand its settlements there, while granting the Palestinians autonomy in a series of disconnected enclaves. Some 500,000 Israelis now live in the rapidly expanding West Bank settlements.Next year, Israel will take part in the UAE’s delayed Expo 2020, the world’s fair being hosted by Dubai. A secret synagogue also draws practicing Jews in Dubai. The UAE also has announced plans to build the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, which will house a mosque, a church and a synagogue.Israelis traveling with Western passports routinely enter the UAE without a problem, though one still can’t make a phone call between the two countries. Israelis also work in Dubai’s gold and diamond trade as well.Emirati officials also have allowed Israeli officials to visit and the Israeli national anthem was played after an athlete won gold in an Abu Dhabi judo tournament. Israel also has a small mission representing its interests at the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truly-historic-moment-trump-announces-peace-agreement-between-israel-and-uae/story-yaoNey10Rz6hd60eM9hWYL.html

13-08-2020||World||Trump holds up coronavirus aid to block Democrats’ bid for election funding||Funding for the US Postal Service and to shore up election infrastructure became a major sticking point in congressional talks on coronavirus relief, as President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to block any money to facilitate mail-in voting.The Republican president has been railing against mail-in ballots for months as a possible source of fraud, although there is little evidence it takes place and millions of Americans - including much of the military - have used the post office to cast absentee ballots for years. Trump said his negotiators have resisted Democrats’ calls for additional money to help prepare for presidential, congressional and local voting during a pandemic that has killed more than 165,000 Americans and presented severe logistical challenges to organizing large events like the Nov. 3 election.“The items are the post office and the $3.5 billion for mail-in voting,” Trump told Fox Business Network, saying Democrats want to give the post office $25 billion. “If we don’t make the deal, that means they can’t have the money, that means they can’t have universal mail-in voting. It just can’t happen.”The amount of money in question is less than 1% of either party’s current proposed response, with Senate Republicans having unveiled a $1 trillion response while the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in May passed a $3 trillion bill.Democrats have cried foul, accusing Trump and his party of trying to make it harder for Americans to vote, as opinion polls show him trailing his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.“I initially was hopeful this wasn’t an intentional effort to throw the election. I am gravely concerned given the recent changes in the leadership of the Postal Service that we’ve seen by the postmaster general, who I’ll remind you was a major Trump campaign contributor,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons said on MSNBC.The ability to vote without going to a polling place is especially important this year as Americans look for ways to vote without risking being infected by the novel coronavirus.The White House negotiating team of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has not met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in six days.Pelosi said any coronavirus relief bill should include billions of dollars to protect not just Americans’ right to vote but also essential services, like mailing prescription medicines, during the pandemic.“The president has stood in the way of any money for the Postal Service,” Pelosi said on MSNBC.When the congressional Democrats and Trump’s negotiators last met in person on Friday, they were some $2 trillion apart in their negotiating positions. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed that Americans blame both parties for the standoff, which has led to the expiration of a $600-per-week lifeline to unemployed people.New Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who has donated $2.7 million to Trump and his fellow Republicans since 2017, has ordered operational changes and a clampdown on overtime in a bid to fix the financially troubled Postal Service, which reported a net loss of $2.2 billion in the last quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-holds-up-coronavirus-aid-to-block-democrats-bid-for-election-funding/story-OmNe5q76yitS4qX7253OhO.html
13-08-2020||World||US jobless claims fall below 1 million but remain high||The number of laid-off workers applying for unemployment aid fell below 1 million last week for the first time since the pandemic intensified five months ago yet still remains at a high level. The viral pandemic keeps forcing layoffs just as the expiration of a $600-a-week federal jobless benefit has deepened the hardships for many.The Labor Department said applications fell to 963,000, the second straight drop, from 1.2 million the previous week. The decline suggests that layoffs are slowing, though last week’s figure still exceeds the pre-pandemic record of just under 700,000.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The pandemic, the shutdowns that are meant to fight it and the reluctance or inability of many people to shop, travel or eat out are continuing to weaken the economy and force companies to cut staff. Twenty-three states have paused or reversed their business re-openings. In a hopeful sign, the rate of new confirmed viral cases has declined in the past couple of weeks, though it remains far above the rates that prevailed in May and June.All told, fewer people are also continuing to receive state jobless aid. That figure dropped to 15.5 million, from 16.1 million the previous week.For months, the unemployed had also been receiving the $600 a week in federal jobless aid on top of their state benefit. But the federal payment has expired, and negotiations in Congress to extend that benefit, likely at a lower level of payment, have collapsed in rancor.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The supplemental federal aid had enabled many jobless Americans to afford rent, food and utilities, and its expiration threatens to weaken consumer spending and further slow the economy. Unemployment benefits have accounted for roughly 5 per cent of national income since April, a larger share than even Social Security. The loss of the $600 has shrunk benefits for the average recipient by one-half to three-quarters.Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says that the loss of the additional aid will reduce Americans’ incomes by $18 billion a week.“That’s a big hit to purchasing power,” she said.Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that would provide $300 a week in federal aid to the jobless to replace the expired $600-a-week benefit. But experts say it would take weeks for the states to implement that payment.In addition to people who applied last week for state benefits, nearly 489,000 others sought jobless aid under a new program that has made self-employed and gig workers eligible for the first time. That figure isn’t adjusted for seasonal trends, so it’s reported separately.But including that group, the Labor Department says 28.2 million people are receiving some form of unemployment benefits, though that figure may be inflated by double-counting by some states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-below-1-million-but-remain-high/story-S6QmV5e6NVTtjdKC0SHekO.html
13-08-2020||World||Lebanon parliament grants military power in stricken Beirut||Lebanon’s Parliament approved on Thursday a state of emergency in the capital, Beirut, in its first session since the tragic explosion last week, granting the military sweeping powers amid rising popular anger and political uncertainty.The blast that killed more than 170 people and injured at least 6,000 others changed the face of the capital and forced the government to resign.Before resigning, the government declared a state of emergency in Beirut that granted the military sweeping powers including the power to declare curfews, prevent public gatherings and censor media as well as refer civilians to military tribunals for alleged security breaches.The move has been criticized by rights groups and other critics who say the civilian government was already operating with increased powers because of the coronavirus outbreak. Some pointed to the heavy military crackdown on protesters last week, fearing extended power could lead to increased use of force to silence dissent.The state of emergency required parliamentary approval.Parliament is convening outside its regular location to observe social distancing amid a coronavirus surge and because of protests outside the Parliament building by angry Lebanese who want the entire political class to step down. More protests were expected Thursday.The session opened with a moment of silence for those killed in the blast. It then moved to discuss the resignation of nearly a dozen lawmakers who quit last week in protest of the government’s handling of the Aug. 4 blast. A major Christian party bloc is boycotting the session.It still was not known what caused the fire responsible for igniting nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut’s port. But documents have emerged in the wake of the explosion that show the country’s top leadership and security officials were aware of the chemicals being stored in the city port.The explosion has fueled outrage and protests against top political leaders and led to the resignation of the government Monday. The Cabinet is now in a caretaker capacity.Parliament is required to approve the state of emergency eight days after it is imposed. But it wasn’t clear if the body had technically extended the government decision for 15 days or simply imposed the state of emergency starting Thursday, said rights lawyer Nizar Saghieh.“There is incredible chaos,” Saghieh said. He said the state of emergency’s only justification is to extend the power of the state and security agencies and “control the opposition.”“We were waiting for the army to help in reconstruction not be an extension of power,” he said.Lawmaker Simon Abi Ramieh protested that Parliament was convened to vote on the state of emergency while it was still in effect and called instead for forming a parliamentary committee to investigate the blast.“We are living in a state of institutional blunder,” he said. “We are in a place and the Lebanese people are somewhere else. ... The public wants to know the truth behind the negligence that led to the explosion.”Lebanon’s political landscape has been shaken by the blast. Before resigning, the caretaker prime minister proposed early elections, an idea that was not supported by the Parliament speaker and other political groups.Since the resignation, there has been a flurry of closed-door meetings and political haggling to form a government that meets the approval of domestic and international powers. Lebanon’s complicated sectarian-based political system requires the prime minister to be chosen from among Sunni Muslims. It wasn’t clear if there would be a national unity government — which would mean the participation of all political parties — or an emergency transition government.France’s defense minister was due to arrive in Beirut on Thursday amid a flurry of foreign visits to the stricken country. France has been leading efforts to help Lebanon emerge from the drastic blow, including talking to political parties to hasten the formation of a new government.Also on Thursday, U.S. Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale was due to arrive in Lebanon for a two-day visit. Hale is expected to “reiterate the American government’s commitment to assist the Lebanese people in recovering from the tragedy and rebuilding their lives,” a statement by the U.S. Embassy said. He will also stress the “urgent need” for embracing fundamental reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-parliament-grants-military-power-in-stricken-beirut/story-d8neuxDr5DEQObNNsPJliL.html

The human chains grew quickly, and by early afternoon filled the main central squares and avenues. Motorists blared horns in support.Nearly 7,000 people have been detained and hundreds have been injured in a ruthless police clampdown on demonstrators protesting the official results of Sunday’s ballot that gave President Alexander Lukashenko 80% of the vote, and his top opposition challenger only 10%. Police have cracked down in full force, breaking up the protests with stun grenades, tear gas and rubber bullets and severely beating many.“Belarusians have seen the villainous face of this government. I argued with my husband and voted for Lukashenko. And this is what I got in the end — I can’t find my relatives in prisons,” said Valentina Chailytko, 49, whose husband and son were detained during protests on Sunday.“I wonder how Lukashenko could keep ruling,” said Chailytko who has been unable to find any information about their whereabouts.One protester died Monday in Minsk, and scores were injured. The authorities confirmed that a detainee also died in the southeastern city Gomel, but the circumstances of his death weren’t immediately clear.The brutality and scope of the police crackdown was remarkable even for Lukashenko’s iron-fisted rule. He has won the nickname of “Europe’s last dictator” in the West for his relentless suppression of dissent.The Interior Ministry reported 700 new detentions late Wednesday and overnight, bring the total number of detainees to 6,700 since Sunday. Belarus’ Investigative Committee launched a criminal probe into the organization of mass rioting — a charge that could carry prison terms of up to 15 years for those found guilty.The ministry said 103 police officers have been injured since Sunday and 28 of them were hospitalized. In Minsk and Baranovichi, unidentified suspects ran over traffic policemen with their vehicles on Wednesday before being detained.The brutal suppression of protests drew harsh criticism in the West.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the 27-nation bloc would review its relations with Belarus and consider “measures against those responsible for the observed violence, unjustified arrests and falsification of election results.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the election in Belarus wasn’t free or fair and urged the government to refrain from violence against peaceful protesters.After three days of ruthless crackdown, police scaled down their response on Wednesday. In many parts of Minsk, the all-female “lines of solidarity” stood unchallenged for some time before police dispersed some of them without violence. Such peaceful demonstrations swarmed the city Thursday, but police refrained from immediately dispersing them.Lukashenko has derided the political opposition as “sheep” manipulated by foreign masters and vowed to continue taking a tough position on protests. “The core of these so-called protesters are people with a criminal past and (those who are) currently unemployed,” he said Wednesday.This year the economic damage caused by the coronavirus and the president’s swaggering response to the pandemic, which he airily dismissed as “psychosis,” has fueled broad anger, helping swell the opposition ranks and posing an unprecedented challenge to Lukashenko.Protesters on Thursday said they were undeterred by police violence. “We’re not afraid, there’s no fear,” Alla Pronich, 38, told The Associated Press.“To audacious rigging (of the election), to violence, to flash-bang grenades the authorities use we respond with solidarity and a peaceful protest. It is all we have,” Pronich said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-belarus-form-lines-of-solidarity-in-protest/story-uaNlXNLtYECu8FnQmo1ecN.html
13-08-2020||World||US says Iran briefly seizes oil tanker near Strait of Hormuz||The Iranian navy boarded and briefly seized a Liberian-flagged oil tanker near the strategic Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions between Tehran and the US, a US military official said Thursday.The US military’s Central Command published a black-and-white video showing what appeared to be special forces fast-roping down from a helicopter onto the MT Wila, whose last position appeared to be off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates near the city of Khorfakkan.The Iranian navy held the vessel for some five hours before releasing it Wednesday, said a US military official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public. The Wila made no distress calls before, during and after the seizure, the official said.The Iranian helicopter involved appeared to be a Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, which only Iran’s navy operates. The Iranian navy also handles all operations in the Gulf of Oman on the eastern side of the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all oil traded passes. Two other Iranian naval vessels took part in the seizure, Central Command said.The US military officials did not offer any reason for Iran seizing the vessel. Iranian state media and officials did not acknowledge the seizure or offer a reason for it.Officials in the UAE, a US-allied federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, did not respond to a request for comment.The Wila’s registered owner is a Liberian firm called Bandit Shipping Co., managed by Greek firm IMS SA, according to United Nations records. Bandit Shipping could not be reached, while IMS did not respond to requests for comment.The Wila had been off Khor Al Zubair, Iraq, in early July before traveling to near Dubai and later Khorfakkan, where it’s been for around a month, according to data firm Refinitiv. It wasn’t immediately clear what cargo it carried.Private maritime intelligence firm Dryad Global said it suspected two other ships had been harassed by Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in the Persian Gulf over the last week as well, based on the ships’ behavior.As tensions between Iran and the US heated up last year over America’s unilateral withdraw from its 2015 nuclear deal, tankers plying the waters of the Mideast became targets, particularly near the strait, the Persian Gulf’s narrow mouth. Suspected limpet mine attacks the US blamed on Iran targeted several tankers. Iran denied being involved, though it did seize several tankers.In July, a US-sought oil tanker was “hijacked” off the coast of the United Arab Emirates after allegedly smuggling Iranian crude oil. The vessel later ended up back in Iranian waters, suggesting Iran itself seized the vessel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-iran-briefly-seizes-oil-tanker-near-strait-of-hormuz/story-KyoIvfO3KjNnnePE7gM5GO.html
13-08-2020||World||Joe Biden raises $26 mn in 24 hours after Kamala Harris VP announcement||Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record and signaling enthusiasm among Democrats following the selection of the first Black woman on a major party’s presidential ticket.“It’s really palpable, the excitement,” Biden said Wednesday.The campaign hopes the haul is the beginning of a prolific fundraising push in the final stretch before Election Day. Democrats are close to matching, if not surpassing, the massive $300 million cash stockpile President Donald Trump and Republicans reported in July.Harris is expected to play a key role in that effort. She joined Biden in Delaware on Wednesday for their first fundraiser together as running mates and talked to grassroots donors about how her parents’ activism inspired her interest in politics.“This is a campaign that really fuels my hope because it is about knowing that this is fighting for something and not against something and it’s fighting for the best we are as a nation,” Harris said. “It’s fighting for the best of who we can be.”With large in-person events out of the question because of the pandemic, the campaign has an aggressive schedule of online fundraisers planned for Harris. That could play to one of her political strengths and offset an area where Biden has sometimes struggled.Harris already has a robust network of donors in her native California, a state that has long been referred to as the ATM of the Democratic Party. She can rake in cash from Wall Street. And Harris, who is also of Asian descent, has the potential to bring new money into the Democratic fold because of the historic nature of her candidacy.“To have someone on the ticket whose mother is from the south of India is a dream come true,” said Swadesh Chatterjee, a businessman from North Carolina who also raises money for political candidates. “You will see more fundraising from the Indian American community.”Lisa Hernandez Gioia, who was a deputy finance director for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, called Harris a “fundraiser’s dream.”“Donors already have an eagerness,” she said. “She adds the star power that will be like an afternoon shot of espresso to the campaign’s fundraising.”Before it was clear he would win the Democratic nomination, Biden was never a particularly successful fundraiser. As a longtime senator from Delaware, a small, solidly blue state, he never had to cultivate a national network of donors. And party fundraisers have long grumbled that he lacked the same touch with donors that he has shown when working a rope line.Biden’s campaign was virtually broke the time he won the South Carolina primary, which revived his prospects and powered his way to the Democratic nomination. And while his clinching of the nomination has led to a flood of campaign contributions, some believe Harris can juice totals even higher.Yet Harris, who dropped out of the Democratic primary last year, has had her own struggles with fundraising.She launched her presidential bid in early 2019 and raised $15.5 million by mid-March, an impressive showing at an early stage in the race. But her campaign hemorrhaged money. And while she wowed well-heeled donors, she struggled to develop a competitive base of grassroots contributors who chip in small amounts online, a phenomenon that fueled the fundraising success of rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.But there are also big differences between a primary and the general election, where agreements struck between the nominee and the party enable massive checks to be raised from individual donors.Already there are signs that suggest Harris is seeing some success.Act Blue, the left’s online fundraising arm, reported taking in almost $11 million in the hours after the Harris announcement. And Biden aides later said the flood of money generated by the Harris announcement broke the online fundraising platform’s all-time one-day record for a campaign.“The primary campaign folding early was not indicative of a lack of fundraising ability,” said Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and prominent Harris supporter from South Carolina. “Kamala is going to raise money and it’s going to be money that wouldn’t otherwise be raised.”The connections Harris makes fundraising now will serve her well in the future. At 55, she has years left in her political career. That could give her a leg up on the competition in 2024 or later.Steve Westly, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who has known Harris for over 20 years, said her dynamic presence serves her well in the staid world of political fundraising.“She’s animated, she’s smart and she’s lively. And this is in a world of bland, cautious, older Caucasian men,” said Westly. “She is going to do very well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-raises-26-mn-in-24-hours-after-kamala-harris-vp-announcement/story-k38WCERGvS4lXKmqiuSWbL.html
13-08-2020||World||Trump says Hong Kong can ‘never succeed’ under China control||US President Donald Trump said Thursday that Hong Kong’s global financial center will “go to hell” under tightened Chinese rule.“Hong Kong can never succeed having China as opposed to the thousands of geniuses that ran it, having China run it,” Trump told Fox Business news. “The Hong Kong markets will go to hell. Nobody’s going to do business.”Trump announced in May that he was ending the special US trading relationship with Hong Kong in retaliation for Beijing’s clampdown on the previously largely autonomous territory.Trump told Fox Business that the end to the special status meant that Hong Kong would lose its ability to attract business and serve as one of the world’s chief financial hubs, along with New York and London.Trump said he had approved of the longstanding relationship, which amounted to a “tremendous amount of money in the form of incentives to make Hong Kong free.”But “once China got aggressive and took it over, I took everything back. Everything’s back now and it will fail,” he said.Trump has made a trade war with China, followed by a truce at the start of this year, a pillar of his foreign policy. However, hopes for a follow-up “phase two” trade deal that would resolve some of the underlying issues in the rivalry between the world’s two largest economies have been dashed by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic.Trump has seen his election chances seriously hurt by fallout from the pandemic and is increasingly focussing blame on China, where the virus first appeared.“My mindset has changed on China since they allowed the plague,” he said.“It’s before plague and after plague. Right now I view China differently than I did before plague.”Asked, however, if he agreed with critics that President Xi Jinping should step aside, he answered: “Look, they’re running their country. We’re running our country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-hong-kong-can-never-succeed-under-china-control/story-ekEScYYt1LEgjUDoFvvkYO.html

13-08-2020||World||TikTok and WeChat expose big tech’s lack of innovation | Opinion||The jockeying by Microsoft Corp. and possibly other U.S. companies to buy TikTok’s U.S. operations shines a harsh light on how domestic technology giants are falling behind on innovation in social media and other areas of opportunity. Both ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat are living on borrowed time in the U.S. after President Donald Trump signed executive orders last week effectively banning the apps after 45 days. The renewed focus brings to the forefront how badly American social media apps have lagged their Asian counterparts. Consider Twitter Inc., for example. Despite spending roughly $700 million a year in research and development, the microblogging company’s main offering has stayed virtually the same over the past decade. Amazingly, its biggest innovation may be doubling the character count for each tweet in 2017. That’s not an impressive return on large amounts of investment spending. Similarly, Facebook Inc.’s and Google’s platforms haven’t been much better. The core functionality of Instagram’s photo-sharing scrollable feed and YouTube’s video search interface hasn’t changed much over the past few years.In contrast, TikTok has brought significant innovations to short-form videos. Its personalization algorithm surfaces the most-relevant entertaining content for its users, driving the app to be the most-downloaded in the world this year; it now reaches 100 million Americans. And while U.S. services languished, WeChat has also become a super-app, expanding from messaging to payment, shopping, gaming and many other features.Nowhere is the gap more apparent than in the critical and attractive growth market of video games. Demand has soared as consumers turn to video games for in-home entertainment under shelter-in-place orders. According to the NPD Group, U.S. video-game sales rose 30% in the second quarter compared with those a year earlier. And the industry growth spurt may just be starting. Coming technology advances from cloud computing, semiconductors and gaming engines are positioning the industry to be on the cusp of a multiyear wave of innovation. Research firm Newzoo projects the gaming market will grow from roughly $160 billion this year to nearly $200 billion by 2023.To take advantage of the next level of growth, Chinese and Japanese companies have prudently invested in some of the industry’s best assets around the world. Tencent now owns stakes in the preeminent mobile games leader Supercell, Los Angeles-based Riot Games — the maker of the tremendously successful “League of Legends” PC game, which has tens of millions of players — and Fortnite-developer Epic Games Inc. Last month, Sony Corp. also made a strategic investment in Epic, citing collaboration benefits of the studio’s industry-leading Unreal game engine, which powers many of industry’s best multiplayer game experiences.While Asian companies have made smart moves, American companies aren’t doing so well. For example, in May Amazon.com Inc. introduced its first big-budget game, “Crucible,” only to pull it from the market just weeks later after it failed to gain traction with players. Likewise, Google’s cloud-gaming service Stadia and Apple Inc.’s Arcade subscription service haven’t taken off with consumers. Further, the initial feedback from the gaming community points to another victory for Sony over Microsoft in the coming next-generation console war. In a stunning development, Microsoft announced on Tuesday that its critical anchor game “Halo Infinite” would be delayed to next year because of development issues, further complicating the company’s fall hardware launch. As a result, Sony now has a clear advantage with its lineup of exclusive games. To be sure, Big Tech’s core business franchises are still thriving financially. Last month, the companies all posted better-than-expected financial results for their latest reported quarters, demonstrating their ability to generate tens of billions of dollars in profits even amid a pandemic. But the technology industry’s history is littered with examples from Yahoo to Blackberry in which dominance in one era can disappear suddenly in the next. The key signal before the declines is lackluster innovation. With the rise of Chinese internet apps and Big Tech’s inability to invest properly in gaming, cracks are appearing in some of Silicon Valley’s giants.(Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

13-08-2020||World||Hooked in UK: Something is fishing in times of Covid-19||A record number of Britons have been hooked to fishing after lockdown restrictions were eased, with tens of thousands flocking the banks of the Thames and other rivers following what officials called a ‘boom’ in people applying for rod licences.Experts have encouraged people to take advantage of mental health and other benefits from fishing, which is a ‘Covid-secure’ activity that includes social distancing as well as allows friends and family to gather with social distancing norms.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Heidi Stone, fisheries manager at the Environment Agency said on Thursday: “Fishing licence sales have risen to an exceptional high against the last few years and we’re seeing a true revival for the sport as people recognise all it has to offer”.“As lockdown restrictions have eased there has been a boom in licence sales as now, more than ever, people have a desire to get outdoors and escape their daily stresses. Fishing is a sport that can be done by a person of any age or ability and it provides a great opportunity for families to try something new during the school holidays”.A licence is needed to fish for salmon, trout, freshwater fish, smelt or eel with a rod and line. Failure to carry it while fishing could lead to a fine up to £2,500. Fishing retailers have reported a spike in demand for beginners’ kits and tackle since restrictions eased on May 13.Experts list several benefits of fishing. In a survey by the Angling Trust, 99% of respondents agreed angling benefits their mental health and well-being. Since restrictions eased, 91% of respondents have been out angling, enjoying the social distancing benefits of fishing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The benefits of fishing to mental health and well-being include creating bonds with friends and family – re-connecting after the intensity of the lockdown period can help combat loneliness, anxiety and depression.It has also allowed discovery of new places, with tens of thousands ‘staycations’ and short UK-based trips planned this summer. The Mental Health Foundation backed the Environment Agency’s call to go fishing.Antonis Kousoulis of the foundation said: “Growing evidence suggests that spending time in ‘green’ and ‘blue’ spaces has a very positive effect on our mental health, providing protective and restorative benefits”.“Fishing remains one of the most popular outdoor activities in England and it is important for people’s mental health that they can continue to pursue this activity in a safe way both during and after the pandemic”.The Canal & River Trust, which runs over 150 introductory courses for newcomers as part of its ‘Let’s Fish’ campaign, believes demand for fishing has skyrocketed.John Ellis of the trust said: “We’ve seen record numbers of people take up fishing since lockdown, many of whom are completely new to the activity and some of whom have taken up the sport through family members and friends at local clubs”.The Environment Agency said it works to promote fishing and make it as accessible as possible. The income generated from fishing licence sales funds work to maintain, improve and develop fisheries, fish habitats and angling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hooked-in-uk-something-is-fishing-in-times-of-covid-19/story-4PVySRfBxeJAO0B7oxJUIN.html
13-08-2020||World||Trump administration to roll back curbs on methane from oil, gas operations||The Trump administration on Thursday will roll back regulations aimed at reducing emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas operations, its latest move to unwind environmental rules ahead of November’s presidential election.During a visit to election swing state Pennsylvania, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler will formally rescind 2016 Obama administration limits on oil and gas industry emissions of methane, a move criticized by environmentalists when initially proposed last August.The EPA is expected to retain some of the rules issued in 2012 that control methane emissions and also limit those of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOC) that cause smog.But it is also expected to remove sources of emissions, including the transport and storage of oil and gas, from regulation as well as requirements for companies to install equipment to detect methane leaks, according to a source familiar with matter.It would also prevent any future regulation of methane from facilities built before 2015.Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican representing a district at the heart of Pennsylvania’s fracking industry, welcomed EPA’s decision to “remove burdensome regulations” and “commitment to supporting Pennsylvania gas and oil operators.”The American Petroleum Institute, a powerful fossil fuel lobby, has said it supports the final rule even if some of its larger members like Exxon, BP and Shell have called for mandatory methane regulations. Smaller drillers say the rule is too costly for them to comply with.“We support this revision,” API regulatory affairs director Frank Macchiarola told Reuters. “But we understand that this rule has drawn diverse viewpoints across our industry.”The API said existing VOC regulations have led to methane emissions falling 60% from 2011-2018.Environmental groups said the move comes as scientific reports highlight the major role methane emissions play in worsening climate change. “Eliminating these safeguards would ignore the overwhelming body of scientific evidence documenting the urgent need to reduce methane pollution,” said Peter Zalzal of the Environmental Defense Fund.The rollbacks will be challenged in court, environmental groups and some state attorneys general have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-to-roll-back-curbs-on-methane-from-oil-gas-operations/story-Cu8y3FJWjX2qaL589ryySP.html

Cases are rising especially in the Helsinki-region.Key Indian Ministers Infected (3:50 p.m. HK)Several Indian ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past few days, underscoring the spread of the virus in the world’s second most populous nation.Five ministers including Modi’s key aide and minister for internal security, Amit Shah, have contracted the virus which has infected nearly 2.4 million Indians. The south Asian nation has the highest death toll after U.S., Brazil and Mexico. Some of the ministers, including Shah, are in hospitals while others are recovering at home.Spanish Regions May Curb Smoking to Combat Virus (3:07 p.m. HK)Some of Spain’s autonomous regions are studying joining Galicia in restricting smoking in the street in order to contain the growing rise in Covid-19 cases, El Pais reported.Galicia from Thursday banned smoking in public if a two-meter distance can’t be guaranteed, claiming experts agree it will help limit infections. The regions of Andalusia, Castilla y Leon and Castilla-La Mancha may follow its lead, the newspaper said, citing local government spokespeople.Covid-19 can affect smokers more and increases the likelihood they develop pneumonia, El Pais said, citing Alberto Fernandez Villar, an expert on lung conditions, who is advising the Galician government. Smokers tend to touch their mouths more than non-smokers, he said.Philippines to Join Human Trials for Russian Virus Vaccine (2 p.m. HK)The Philippines will join the final phase of clinical trials for Russia’s coronavirus vaccine starting in October, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Thursday.A panel of Philippine experts will review the results of Russia’s initial findings on the vaccine developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute before large-scale human trials are started, Roque said. Russia will fund the phase 3 clinical trial in the Philippines, he said.The Russian vaccine is likely to win approval from the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration by next April, and President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to be inoculated as early as May, Roque said.German Cases Rise the Most in More Than Three Months (1:54 p.m. HK)Germany recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases in more than three months, with daily infections staying above 1,000 for three straight days.There were 1,319 new cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, the most since May 1 and bringing the country’s case total to 220,859, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Now India is only behind the U.S., Brazil and Mexico in the overall number of deaths. Its total number of confirmed cases, almost 2.4 million, is the third largest in the world.Thailand Reports Three Imported Cases (1:20 p.m. HK)Thailand confirmed three new cases on Thursday, all in state quarantine after arriving from Singapore and India, according to the Covid-19 center. They reported that 132 people are currently hospitalized and 3,169 have recovered.Two Chinese Patients Test Positive Months After Virus Recovery (1:16 p.m. HK)Two patients in China that recovered from Covid-19 months ago tested positive again, raising concern about the virus’s ability to linger and reappear in people who it previously infected. A 68-year-old woman in the central Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus first surfaced in December, tested positive on Sunday, six months after she was diagnosed with Covid-19 and recovered. Another man found to have contracted the disease in April after returning from abroad tested positive in Shanghai on Monday.The two cases are the latest addition to a growing number of “virus reactivation” anecdotes found among patients believed to have recovered from the viral infection. While it is rare, the phenomenon raises questions over why some patients suffer from long-term symptoms, and whether any immunity to the disease might be too ephemeral to protect against re-infection.Chinese City Says Chicken Wings From Brazil Test Positive for Virus (12:05 p.m. HK)Consumers in the Chinese city of Shenzhen have been urged to exercise caution when buying imported frozen food after a surface sample of chicken wings from Brazil tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement from the local government.The positive sample appears to have been taken from the surface of the meat, while previously reported positive cases from other Chinese cities have been from the surface of packaging on imported frozen seafood. The chicken came from an Aurora Alimentos plant in the southern state of Santa Catarina, according to a registration number given in the statement.New Zealand to Quarantine Virus Cases as Auckland Cluster Grows (11:58 a.m. HK)New Zealand, amid reporting 13 new cases, said it will transfer anyone infected into quarantine facilities as the government attempts to stamp out the nation’s first outbreak in more than three months.The cluster of infections in the largest city of Auckland now stands at 17 people and the government will decide Friday whether to extend a three-day lockdown there. Health Director-General Ashley Bloomfield told reporters in Wellington that he expects the number of infections to grow, and the mandatory quarantine would help stop the spread.Australia Jobs Surge as Economy Absorbs Victoria’s Virus Relapse (11:54 a.m. HK)Australia added almost four times as many jobs as forecast in July as the economy’s recovery in areas where the coronavirus pandemic is under control withstood Victoria’s renewed lockdown and concern about the infection spreading.Employment surged by 114,700 from June, when it advanced an upwardly revised 228,400, compared to an expected gain of 30,000, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. The jobless rate edged up to 7.5%, the highest level since November 1998.Venezuela Information Minister Contracts Virus, Fourth Maduro Ally to Be Infected (10:55 a.m. HK)Venezuela’s Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said he’s tested positive for Covid-19, becoming the fourth close ally of President Nicolas Maduro to become infected.Besides Rodriguez, during the last month Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami, the president of the powerful Constituent Assembly Diosdado Cabello, and the governor of Miranda state Hector Rodriguez have become infected. All have said that they have recovered.New Zealand Reports 13 New Community Cases Amid Outbreak (9:50 a.m. HK)New Zealand reported 13 new community virus cases on Thursday from the previous day as the nation reels from a new outbreak. Health Director-General Ashley Bloomfield told reporters in Wellington that he expects the covid cluster to increase.The nation also reported a case from an overseas arrival on Thursday, and now has 36 active cases.

Ms. Mazari, we are waiting,” the statement said.Responding to the concerns raised by the women journalists, Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari said that it is disturbing to learn of women journalists being targeted and abused for their views.“Abusing women because they are critical is never acceptable. Journalists do their job and to target them, especially gender-based abusive attacks on women journos, is absolutely unacceptable and disgusting,” the minister wrote on Twitter.Meanwhile, Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also noted with concern the threats faced by women journalists.In a tweet, the PPP leader said: “Have taken notice of threats to women journalists as chair of human rights committee. Would like to invite you all to come brief our committee on the issue.”Benzair Shah, an award-winning journalist and an analyst, told a local news channel that she has been trolled and faced online abuse in the past as well, but the attacks have become more relentless after her reporting of coronavirus in the country.“This has been happening so often that I can now recognize the accounts which target me and other women in the media,” Shah said. “The names have become familiar. Most, if not all, declare their support for the ruling party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-women-journalists-accuse-imran-khan-s-govt-of-instigating-online-abuse/story-Q5aHfDLFgKVL2b1LVuzAhJ.html

The two ministries are responsible for port operations.The blast killed more than 170 people and injured thousands, exacerbating the country’s worst economic and political crises in decades.Special courtNone of the group of past and present finance ministers was immediately available for comment. A person in Wazni’s office said the minister had nothing to do with the explosion and wouldn’t be questioned.Lawmaker Ghazi Zeaiter, who served as public-works minister between 2014 and 2016, said in a televised press conference Thursday that he was ready to appear in court and had asked the speaker, Nabih Berri, to lift his parliamentary immunity.In the event that ministers are implicated in the case, a third of parliament’s lawmakers would have to approve their referral to a court that specializes in trying members of the government and presidents.The blast that was heard in Cyprus rocked the capital on Aug. 4, severely damaging surrounding neighborhoods and wiping out the port, the country’s lifeline. Authorities say that 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had been kept at the port since 2013 despite repeated safety warnings.At least 20 people are already in custody, including the current and former general managers of the Lebanese Customs and port officials. State prosecutors have also questioned officers in the army and state security, as well as other officials.Blast in Lebanon’s Port Capped Deadly Game of Pass the BuckThe Supreme Judicial Council on Wednesday turned down the caretaker justice minister’s proposed pick to lead the investigation, citing possible close ties to the president’s party, according to a different judiciary official.The council, which was asked to look into the explosion last week, said Judge Samer Youness is close to Gebran Bassil, the head of the largest Christian bloc in parliament and the son-in-law of the president, the second official said. Other people are now being considered to head the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-judiciary-to-question-former-finance-ministers-on-blast/story-g1g6TchMkNfSSta4tEAOjL.html

That put an end to its spring climbing and hiking season, which draws visitors from around the world.The containment measures were partially eased in June but economic activity would take some time to recover, even if the coronavirus was eliminated, said Gunakar Bhatta, an executive director of the Nepal Rastra Bank, who led the study.“Businesses, specially the hotels, said it will take them 13 months to return to a pre-Covid-19 situation,” Bhatta told Reuters.Workers faced average salary cuts of more than 18%, the study found, while the virus forced 61% of business to close completely.Production and turnover of those that stayed open were on average up to 73% lower, the report said.Nepal, wedged between China and India, has reported 24,432 coronavirus cases with 91 deaths and health workers say the peak of infections could still be weeks away.Following the outbreak, Nepal lowered its forecast for growth for the fiscal year that ended in mid-July to 2.3% from 8.5%.About 20% of Nepal’s 30 million people live on a daily income of below $2 and are heavily dependent on the informal sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-a-quarter-of-nepal-s-workers-lose-jobs-due-to-covid-19-central-bank/story-obLnZBAvAPWJQCipa7XCrJ.html

13-08-2020||World||‘Do something’: Kamala Harris applauds her mother for inspiring her to join public service||Appearing with Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, for the fist time after he named her his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday credited her Indian-born mother for inspiring her into a life in public service that led her to this historic moment.“Don’t just sit around and complain about things,” Harris said her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would tell her and younger sister Maya Harris, growing up. “Do something.” Gopalan, who came to the United States from Chennai and because a breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009. But she has remained the most enduring influence in Harris’s life in her telling, in public remarks and an autobiography she wrote ahead of her failed White House bid in 2019. Harris made history Tuesday as the first Indian American and and Black woman to run for vice-president.“Kamala is smart. She’s tough. She’s experienced. She’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class,” Biden said in his first public explanation for why he picked Harris, over the 11 other women candidates he considered for the job.And, after listing out her accomplishments and experiences as a public prosecutor, district attorney and attorney general in California, the former vice-president said, “As the child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country, as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up Black and Indian American in the United States.”He added: “Her story is an American story – different from mine in many particulars, but also, not so different in essentials. “The former vice-president then went on to frame his pick in a larger context of a changing America he had previewed earlier, but now in his typically folksy manner: “And this morning, all across this nation little girls woke up – especially little Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — but today, maybe they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way. As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.”Biden and Harris used their first public appearance to launch a blistering attack on President Donald Trump’s term in office. “As someone who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut,” said Harris.Their first appearance together after a historic announcement on Tuesday — making Harris the first Black woman and Indian American on a presidential ticket — was a quiet affair, held at school gymnasium in Wilmington, Delaware, which is Biden’s home-state. There were no on-stage hand-shakes or hugs, and stayed socially distanced for the photo-op with spouses. And they put on their masks as they left the stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-something-kamala-harris-applauds-her-mother-for-inspiring-her-to-join-public-service/story-wNkTLfbiQgcvKmwkJGWcOL.html
13-08-2020||World||Facebook, Twitter step up fight against misinformation on US elections||Social media platforms stepped up fight against misinformation on the US elections, with Facebook starting a hub to help users with poll-related resources and Twitter expanding rules against misinformation on mail-in ballots and early voting.The move comes as online social networks have been drawing flak for what has been called a lax approach to fake news reports and misinformation campaigns, which many believe affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.Twitter’s move will involve coming up with new policies “that emphasize accurate information about all available options to vote, including by mail and early voting.”“We’re focused on empowering every eligible person to register and vote through partnerships, tools and new policies,” Jessica Herrera-Flanigan, Twitter’s vice president for public policy in the Americas, told Reuters in an email.Facebook, meanwhile, launched a Voting Information Center to help users with accurate and easy-to-find information about voting wherever they live.The company said in a blog it was also speaking with officials about misinformation surrounding election results as an emerging threat.Twitter said it would roll out measures on new tools, policies and voting resources in the next month. It is exploring how to expand its “civic integrity policies” to address mischaracterizations of mail-in voting and other procedures. The finer details of the step are still being finalized.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that voting by mail, which is expected to increase dramatically due to the coronavirus outbreak, is susceptible to large-scale fraud.The process is not new in the United States — nearly one in four voters cast 2016 presidential ballots that way. Many experts have said that routine methods and the decentralized nature of US elections make it very hard to interfere with mailed ballots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-twitter-step-up-fight-against-misinformation-on-us-elections/story-xmdJOLjlbegNpWiPrkTGkO.html

Billed as the ‘world’s largest home antibody testing programme for coronavirus’, the study tracked the spread of infection across England after the first peak.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here People living in London were most likely to have been infected, as were those working in care homes and health care, and people from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups and people living in larger households, it said.Officials said it is the first mass antibody surveillance study to be rolled out across the UK using a finger prick test that can be used by individuals at home, if given approval in the future.While research showed several finger prick tests were accurate enough for large-scale surveillance studies to monitor the spread of coronavirus, no antibody fingerpick test has yet met the regulator’s criteria for individual use, which means none are currently approved for use outside of surveillance studies.Health minister Edward Argar said: “Large scale antibody surveillance studies are crucial to helping us understand how the virus has spread across the country and whether there are specific groups who are more vulnerable, as we continue our work to drive down the spread of the disease”.“We don’t yet know that antibodies provide immunity to coronavirus, but the more information we can gather on this virus, and the easier we can make it for people to participate in these studies, the better equipped we will be to respond”.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Key findings of the report study include: In London, 13% of people had antibodies while in the South West of England it was less than 3%; there were far higher rates in people from Black (17%), Asian (12%) and other (12%) than white (5%) ethnicity.Almost everyone with a confirmed case of the virus was found to have antibodies (96%).Those aged 18 to 34 were most likely to have antibodies (8%) with the lowest prevalence in those over 65 (3%).Graham Cooke, who led the research at Imperial College, said: “There are still many unknowns with this new virus, including the extent to which the presence of antibodies offers protection against future infections”.“Using the finger-prick tests suitable for large scale home testing has given us clearest insight yet into the spread of the virus in the country and who has been at greatest risk. These data will have important implications as decisions to ease lockdown restrictions in England”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-antibody-test-study-shows-6-england-infected-by-covid-19/story-QHDQ56P1ToQc5fEjzqJLoJ.html
13-08-2020||World||China’s Confucius Institutes under radar of US state department: Report||The US State Department may announce as soon as Thursday a requirement for Chinese government-funded cultural centers at US universities to register as foreign missions, Bloomberg News reported, a development that would be signal further deterioration in ties with Beijing.The move would amount to a conclusion that the so-named Confucius Institutes are “substantially owned or effectively controlled” by a foreign government and subject them to administrative requirements similar to those for embassies and consulates, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter.The State Department and other US government agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One Congressional source, who did not want to be identified, said he had heard such an announcement was coming.Last year, the US State and Education Departments promised stricter monitoring of the institutes, which have been criticized in Congress and elsewhere as de facto propaganda arms of China’s Communist government.In June, the State Department announced it would start treating four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies, calling them mouthpieces for Beijing.US-China relations are at their lowest ebb in decades, with President Donald Trump taking a tough line on Beijing ahead of his Nov. 3 re-election bid.The world’s top two economies are at loggerheads on issues ranging from handling of the coronavirus pandemic to China’s crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong and what US officials say is rampant espionage activity to steal US business and military secrets.According to the US non-profit organization, the National Association of Scholars, there were 75 Confucius Institutes in the United States as of June, including 66 at colleges and universities.The NAS charges that they compromise academic freedom, defy Western norms of transparency, and are inappropriate on campuses. China rejects criticism of the institutes, calling it politicized and baseless.

Sometimes kites are used in the makeshift attacks.In response, Israel has closed a goods crossing with Gaza and slashed the territory’s permitted coastal fishing zone, as well as launching air strikes on sites owned by the enclave’s Islamist rulers Hamas.“Over the last week, explosive balloons are being launched from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory,” the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) said in a statement early Thursday.“In response, a short while ago, IDF fighter jets and tanks struck a number of Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip.”The army said the strikes were aimed at a military compound and observation posts used by Hamas militants, who also fired a volley of rockets into the sea this week after repeated exchanges of fire.A Gaza security source said Israeli warplanes had carried out several strikes on Hamas sites.They said the strikes caused severe damage to the sites and some damage to citizens’ homes, but did not report any injuries.Israeli fire services in the south of the country reported 60 fires caused by balloons on Tuesday, and 24 on Wednesday, without recording any casualties.Hamas and Israel have fought three wars since 2008.Despite a truce last year backed by the UN, Egypt and Qatar, the two sides clash sporadically with rockets, mortar fire or incendiary balloons.The Gaza Strip has a population of two million, more than half of whom live in poverty, according to the World Bank.Palestinian analysts say fire from Gaza often aims to pressure Israel to give the green light for the transfer of Qatari financial aid into the strip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-launches-fresh-strikes-on-hamas-targets-in-gaza-strip/story-DrX5fpyq7CFPvJNG2sZoGN.html

Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales (NSW) reported 12 new cases, while Queensland state said it has found no new Covid-19 infections in the past 24 hours.Barring a large rise in cases from states that have an effectively eliminated the virus, that means Australia’s total of 290 cases would be the lowest one-day rise in new coronavirus cases since July 20. Australian authorities cautiously welcomed the decline.“I think we have to wait and see what happens over the coming week just to make sure that downward slope continues over the days ahead,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd told Australia’s Channel 9.Australia has identified about 22,500 Covid-19 cases while the death toll rose on Thursday to 361 after nine fatalities from the virus were recorded in Victoria and NSW.The slowdown in new cases comes a week after authorities imposed a total lockdown across Melbourne, Australia’s second largest city, including a night curfew, restrictions on people’s daily movements and large parts of state economy ordered to close. Nearly 5 million people in Melbourne have been confined to their homes except for essential reasons for nearly a month.Neighbouring New South Wales state is also on alert, having reported daily new infections in the teens for the past several weeks. Officials warned a failure by people there to observe social distancing guidelines could fuel community transmission, as they scrambled to trace several clusters stemming from schools and restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-on-course-for-lowest-one-day-rise-in-covid-cases-in-more-than-3-weeks/story-RCFcHxT7yrsnPnjfij1cPP.html

Misri’s meeting with Liu Jianchao, Deputy Director of the Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee Foreign Affairs Commission came amidst diplomatic and military-level talks between India and China on disengagment of troops from all friction points in eastern Ladakh. “Ambassador @VikramMisri today met H.E. Liu Jianchao, Deputy Director of the Office of the CPC Central Committee Foreign Affairs Commission and briefed him on India’s stance vis-a-vis the situation on the borders in eastern Ladakh UT and overall bilateral relations”, the Indian Embassy tweeted. No further details of the meeting were available. Misri’s meeting with Liu comes against the backdrop of reports that the disengagement process between the troops of the two countries has not moved forward as expected along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. At the latest round of military talks, the Indian side insisted forcefully on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to May 5 when the standoff began following a clash between the two armies in Pangong Tso. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of its troops has not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso, Gogra and Depsang as demanded by India, according to sources in New Delhi. India has been insisting that China must withdraw its forces from areas between Finger Four and Eight. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers. The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area.

This paves the way for the majority of these labourers to return to work by the end of the month. Migrant workers, who live in cramped quarters, have accounted for the vast bulk of Singapore’s confirmed Covid-19 cases, sparking questions about how the wealthy city-state treats these low-paid foreigners.Singapore is cautiously reopening after locking down most activities in a two-month “circuit breaker” designed to halt the spread of the virus. Schools have reopened, masks are mandatory, and restaurants are back to business. Yet life isn’t fully back to normal -- gatherings are generally limited to five people, large events have been canceled and international travel restrictions mean Singapore’s jewel of an airport is largely empty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-detects-covid-infection-in-cleared-worker-dorm-800-migrants-quarantined/story-hwAEhrUC0oACWwUKDFtVHO.html

Frank McKenzie. “We should all be concerned about that.” McKenzie said insurgents are operating with some degree of freedom, and he said the US and its allies have little hope the Syrian regime will do anything to tamp down the group there.Speaking online to a United States Institute of Peace from his US Central Command office in Tampa, McKenzie said that the slow-moving effort to transfer people out of Syrian refugee camps has been further complicated and delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. And that, he said, fuels concerns about the radicalisation of people — particularly the youth — in the camps, which officials worry are breeding grounds for IS insurgents.The al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria is home to as many as 70,000 people — mostly women and children — who were displaced by the ongoing civil war in Syria and the battle against IS. Many fled as the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces cleared out the last pockets of land held by IS last year.Leanne Erdberg Steadman, the USIP director for countering violent extremism, said getting people out of the camps is key to having them abandon violence and secure a new future. Officials said that there have now been the first few reported cases of Covid-19 at al-Hol.McKenzie said concerns about blocking the spread of the virus among European allies and other nations in the region has complicated efforts to repatriate camp residents to their home nations.Repatriation is the key to clearing out the refugee camps, and the US has aggressively pushed to get allies to take their own citizens back. Most nations, however, are reluctant to take in potential IS insurgents. And the potential spread of Covid-19 is now an added fear.Humanitarian groups say many of the women and children are not risks, but officials also note that there are a lot of women who were radicalized and active in the insurgency.McKenzie said that unless political leaders find a way to deradicalise and repatriate the displaced people in the camps, there will be another IS resurgence in the future.“As young people grow up, we’re going to see them again unless we can turn them in a way to make them productive members of society,” he said. “We can either deal with this problem now or deal with it exponentially worse a few years down the road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-threat-in-west-syria-growing-warns-us-commander/story-UJ58lQguw9D2HAJ2hZcq4O.html
13-08-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic threatens peace, risks new conflicts: UN chief Guterres||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that the Covid-19 pandemic not only threatens gains in fighting global poverty and building peace but risks exacerbating existing conflicts and generating new ones.The UN chief told a Security Council meeting on the challenge of sustaining peace during the pandemic that his March 23 call for an immediate cease-fire in conflicts around the world to tackle the coronavirus led a number of warring parties to take steps to de-escalate and stop fighting.“Yet, regrettably, in many instances, the pandemic did not move the parties to suspend hostilities or agree to a permanent ceasefire,” Guterres said.His predecessor as secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, told the council: “It is truly astonishing that in response to this pandemic, the world has placed billions of people under lock-down, closed international borders, suspended trade and migration, and temporarily shut down a whole variety of industries – but has not managed to suspend armed conflicts.”Ban criticized the UN Security Council for wasting valuable months “in arguments over the details of the text” and not adopting a resolution until July 1 demanding an “immediate cessation of hostilities” in key conflicts including Syria, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and Congo to tackle Covid-19.“This has weakened the message that this council needs to send to all warring parties: now is the time to confront our common enemy,” Ban said.And he said delayed council action “further aggravated the current volatile global security situations.”“The impact of Covid-19 on conflict-affected settings has been much worse than initially thought,” said Ban, who is a co-chair of the group of prominent world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela known as The Elders.He pointed to health and humanitarian ramifications, social cohesion, governance, the rule of law and threats to multilateralism which are jeopardizing ongoing efforts to sustain peace, “or may even cause a reversal in hard-won peace and security gains to date.”While governments try to confront the pandemic, some groups have seen an opportunity to ramp up violence, Ban said, citing as examples Boko Haram and other militants in Nigeria, growing mob violence in Congo and murders by drug cartels in Mexico.He also warned that the economic impacts of the pandemic “will be both long-lasting and severe, with ripple effects for many fragile and conflict-affected states.”As examples, Ban said Lebanon’s political and economic crisis, exacerbated by last week’s deadly explosion at Beirut’s port, is being compounded by COVID-19’s impact on two key money-earners, tourism and trade, while Iraq’s budget is being stretched thin because of the collapse in oil prices.Secretary-General Guterres said the pandemic has raised growing questions about the effectiveness of health systems, social services, trust in institutions and systems of governance.“All of this means that our commitment to sustaining peace is more urgent than ever,” he said.Guterres pointed to three key dangers: erosion of public trust, destabilization of the global economic order, and weakening of “the social fabric.”“The perception that authorities are mishandling the crisis, or not being transparent or favoring political allies can lead to public disillusion in government and its institutions,” he said.The UN chief also warned that “without concerted action, inequalities, global poverty and the potential for instability and violence could grow for years.”While there have been many peaceful protests, Guterres said, “in a number of countries, Covid-19 has been an excuse for harsh crackdowns and a spike in state repression.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-threatens-peace-risks-new-conflicts-un-chief-guterres/story-KayZSFV53k7Q65tvnS82aO.html
13-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Hundreds quarantined in schools that followed Trump’s advice||President Donald Trump is pushing US schools to open classroom doors wide. In some districts that have followed his instructions, they’re slamming shut again.Schools that reopened fully and early are seeing hundreds of students, staff and teachers put into quarantine as Covid-19 spreads. Some are closing buildings opened just days ago. Others are frantically looking for workarounds -- and for the money to pay for them. In Memphis, Tennessee, and Irvine, California, teachers must sign liability waivers in case they get sick.Nationally, most districts are ignoring Trump’s full-speed-ahead advice. New Jersey on Wednesday reversed course on mandatory in-person classes, and Boston won’t attempt them. Still, too many insist on putting educators and communities at risk, said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association and a sixth-grade teacher in Salt Lake City.“There is no one, maybe besides parents, who wants kids back in school as much as teachers do,” Eskelsen Garcia said. “We hate online learning, too. We’re throwing our computers against the wall, too. But we want to do it when and where we can do it without killing anybody.”Trump has been demanding schools reopen so that parents are able to work -- part of a bid to restart the economy and create the impression the US is returning to normal ahead of the November election. Yet the virus is continuing to rage across parts of the US, with the country’s death toll at about 165,000.Test subjectsThe president has tried to force reopenings by saying that half the money for schools in the next round of stimulus legislation should be reserved for those that open their doors. On Wednesday, at an event with parents and educators, he criticized districts trying to use halfway measures to bring students back to class, like combining virtual learning with class time, and having fewer kids in the school at a time.At a later briefing, the White House released simple advice for reopening: Students and staff should assess their own health, understand the symptoms of Covid-19, wash their hands, socially distance around vulnerable people, and maintain good ventilation. The guidelines also said schools should “encourage” wearing masks.Trump said there’s no substitute for traditional schooling.“When you have students sitting at home playing with a computer, it’s not the same,” he said at the briefing. “When you sit at home in a basement looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away.”Nationally, just over half of students in kindergarten through high school will attend school virtually in the fall, while 44% will take classes in person in some form, according to a survey of public-school districts by Burbio, a New York-based data service. And many of those going back to in-person classes won’t be going back full-time, with schools staggering attendance to groups small enough to maintain social distancing. Some 66% of students across the 200 largest districts are taking virtual-only classes, Burbio found.School’s outLarge urban districts that are starting the year online include Atlanta, Houston, Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago. Some have written off the entire semester for in-person classes. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced Wednesday that public-school students will not be showing up in person in the fall.In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy abandoned a requirement that New Jersey’s 2,500 public schools conduct in-person teaching, allowing some to use distance-only learning when the academic year begins in early September.Others are setting dates for students to come back to class that may roll forward, depending on the pandemic’s spread. In metro Atlanta, Fulton County schools -- in March the first in Georgia to shut down -- will bring in the youngest children and special-education students for limited hours in September, and then phase in the rest. But that’s only if the infection rates in the county are low enough and dropping, said Superintendent Mike Looney.He said he’s taken heat from parents and teachers alike, but will follow health guidelines about what’s safe.When students do return, they will be required to wear masks, he said. The district is also working to reconfigure its physical plant to allow proper distancing.Vanishing studentsOther metro Atlanta districts have pushed forward with reopening and paid an immediate price in an area with high community spread.In Cherokee County, north of the city, more than 900 people -- most of them students, but also teachers and staff -- are in quarantine just nine days after the school opened its doors because students reported infections. The high school had to close again.The district required masks of teachers and staff but not of students, spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby said.Nearby Paulding County also had to close its high school for cleaning this week, after students, teachers and staff tested positive. The district’s Aug. 3 opening day became briefly famous after a student sent out a photo of a throng of maskless students in a hallway there. She was promptly suspended and then un-suspended.Trump has asserted that children are “virtually immune” to the coronavirus. The president appears to be referring to the notion that children are less likely to become ill from the virus, even though they can spread it to adults.Relatively little is known about how Covid-19 is transmitted to and from children. On one hand, some early evidence has suggested that children -- and especially younger children -- don’t transmit it as frequently as adults or even older children.But children can certainly still contract the virus, and a growing number have as the virus has surged throughout the country. Covid-19 infections among US kids grew 40% in the second half of July, according to a report this week from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association.And while children do appear to be at a lower risk of getting very ill, a federal study published last week found that a growing number require hospitalization.Lasting damageAdvocates for reopening schools often point to regions that have already done so successfully, or never closed schools to begin with, such as several nations in Northern Europe. Experts, though, stress that those regions have had far less viral transmission than the US.Paul Peterson, director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance at Harvard University, said at the White House that students who miss school likely will earn less money when they’re older.To Eskelsen Garcia, the NEA president, the superiority of in-school teaching isn’t in question. “This is not about pedagogy,” she said. “This disease kills people.”Eskelsen Garcia said she’s been heartened by the number of districts resisting Trump’s pressure and that schools should reopen only when the community infection rate is low.Her advice: “Listen to what Trump says. Then do the exact opposite of whatever comes out of his mouth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hundreds-quarantined-in-schools-that-followed-trump-s-advice/story-DxGblr1aT9S9vzdK78IS8O.html

But ‘Momala’ will always be the one that means the most,” CNN quoted Harris as saying.Harris talked about how her parents, Jamaican and Indian immigrants, met while protesting for civil rights in Oakland in the 1960s.“My mother and father, they came from opposite sides of the world to arrive in America. One from India and the other from Jamaica in search of a world-class education. But what brought them together was the civil rights movement of the 1960s. And that is how they met as students in the streets of Oakland marching and shouting for this thing called justice in a struggle that continues today,” she said.Harris accused US President Donald Trump of the mishandling of coronavirus. The US leads the world with more than 5 million coronavirus cases “because of Trump’s failure to take it seriously from the start,” Harris said“His refusal to get testing up to and running, his flip-flopping on social distancing and wearing masks. His delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. All of that is a reason and the reason that an American dies of Covid-19 every 80 seconds,” Harris said regarding Trump.Harris also honoured the women who helped pave the way for her and acknowledged the work needed to curb the coronavirus pandemic.“After the most competitive primary in history, the country received a resounding message that Joe was the person to lead us forward and, Joe, I am so proud to stand with you. And I do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination and resilience make my presence here today even possible,” Harris said.The California Democrat said she was “incredibly honoured by this responsibility” and that she was “ready to get to work.” “I am ready to get to work,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-reflects-on-her-indian-and-jamaican-parents-in-first-campaign-speech/story-AXDm51OaESd4XAB1B9pRRL.html
13-08-2020||World||New Zealand registers 13 new coronavirus cases||New Zealand reported 13 new coronavirus cases in the community on Thursday from the previous day as the nation reels from a new outbreak.Health Director-General Ashley Bloomfield told reporters in Wellington on Thursday that he expects the Covid cluster to increase.The nation also reported a case from an overseas arrival on Thursday, and now has 36 active cases. All confirmed cases will be quarantined.New Zealand latest outbreak has thrown the largest city Auckland back into lockdown and threatens to dent the economic recovery.The country’s run of 102 days without community transmission ended this week with the announcement that four new cases had been detected in an Auckland household. A further four probable cases were identified Wednesday. Authorities are trying to stop the virus spreading to avoid the fate of nations like Australia, Japan and Vietnam, which after early successes in containing Covid-19 are now battling its resurgence.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has put Auckland, a city of 1.6 million people, into lockdown for an initial period of three days as health officials try to trace the origin of the infections. Social distancing rules and limits on gatherings have also been reimposed on the rest of the country.“I know this disruption to businesses is putting extraordinary pressure on you, but the best long-term economic response is for us to get this immediate response right,” Ardern said on Thursday.While Ardern said it was heartening that so far the outbreak was restricted to one cluster, she warned New Zealanders that the numbers would worsen.Health authorities are investigating whether the outbreak may have originated at a cold storage firm where one of the infected people worked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-registers-13-new-coronavirus-cases/story-LvdcdaTKGxFLAxxQNbmxhJ.html

13-08-2020||World||Israel says it foiled hackers targeting defence industry||Israel said Wednesday it foiled a cyberattack targeting its defence industry by a shadowy group that the US has linked to North Korea.The Israeli Defence Ministry said hackers with the Lazarus Group built fake profiles on the LinkedIn social network and posed as the CEOs and senior officials of international companies.They then offered job opportunities to employees at major Israeli defense firms in an attempt to gain access to their computers and networks to steal sensitive information.The ministry says the attacks were detected “in real time” and thwarted. It said there was no “harm or disruption” to the targeted networks.The ministry said the Lazarus Group is “backed by a foreign country,” without elaborating. It did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.The US Treasury Department announced sanctions against the Lazarus Group last September, saying it was controlled by the North Korean government.It said the Lazarus Group was behind the devastating WannaCry ransomware, which froze 300,000 computers across 150 countries in 2017, and the destructive cyber attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014.Ivan Kwiatkowski, a researcher at Kaspersky, a cybersecurity company, said that in the alleged attack on Israel, Lazarus appears to have been attempting technology theft rather than financial gain.“This is a very interesting development, because we tend to see Lazarus as an actor focused mostly on funds collection,” he said.“But as any other state-backed actor, its missions are diverse, and I think this is a prime example of other areas of interest the group has.” Israel said it thwarted a major cyberattack earlier this year targeting its water infrastructure, which was widely attributed to its archenemy Iran. Israel is suspected of retaliating two weeks later with a cyberattack on an Iranian port.Israel and Iran have engaged in years of covert battles that have included high-tech hacking and cyberattacks.Most famously, US and Israeli intelligence agencies are suspected of unleashing a computer worm called Stuxnet that disrupted Iran’s nuclear programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-says-it-foiled-hackers-targeting-defence-industry/story-C4PeeJLH173Qx8AYCCLi7O.html

Woman receives ID with photo of empty chair||Driver’s license photos aren’t always the best, but when a Tennessee woman received her new ID the picture was perfect — for a furniture store.Jade Dodd renewed her license online and received it last week, but to her surprise, the photo wasn’t a picture of her. It only showed an empty chair.“The lady at the DMV did not really believe me when I was like ‘hey, I need my license fixed,’” Dodd said.“Then, she looked it up in the system and goes, ‘oh, I need my manager for this.’” The chair ended up being the focal point of the license because it was the last photo taken and saved to Dodd’s file, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security told WKRN-TV. The photo was taken accidentally, the department said.Dodd said she wasn’t upset by the mistake. Instead, she said it lightened the mood amidst the coronavirus pandemic and provided her and her coworkers with a few laughs.“My boss thinks it’s funnier than anyone,” Dodd added. “I was at work Friday and he pointed to a chair outside of his office door and was like, ‘I thought this was you, I waved at it this morning.’“ She posted the photo to Facebook on Aug. 6 and as of Wednesday, it had been shared more than 19,000 times and turned into several memes.Dodd received her new license Monday — without the chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/picture-perfect-woman-receives-id-with-photo-of-empty-chair/story-qwDj2oN5PpXhLpevJvprqM.html
13-08-2020||World||Gotabaya Rajapaksa family dominates Sri Lanka govt with 3 in cabinet||Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa named two more relatives to a new government unveiled Wednesday, further consolidating his family’s grip on power.His brother Mahinda will lead the government, formed after their nationalist party’s landslide win in a parliamentary election last week.Gotabaya and Mahinda will control the key defence and finance portfolios, respectively, in the new 26-member cabinet.Their elder brother Chamal kept his place in the cabinet and was joined by Mahinda’s eldest son, Namal, who was named sports minister.The growing dynastic imprint was strengthened by one of their nephews, Shasheendra Rajapaksa, who joined the government as a state agriculture minister though he will not be in the cabinet. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 71, became president in November last year and named Mahinda, a 74-year-old former president, as prime minister.Pursuing a nationalist agenda, their party has won a two-thirds majority in parliament, which allows them to change the constitution and tighten their hold on power.The brothers want to scrap a 2015 constitutional amendment which transferred some executive powers from the president to the prime minister, along with independent institutions to run public services and the judiciary.In the new cabinet, Mahinda was given three portfolios -- finance, culture and housing -- while their eldest brother Chamal, 77, was given irrigation, a powerful position in largely rural Sri Lanka.Chamal was also made the state minister for defence, a non-cabinet position responsible for internal security and disaster management. The swearing-in of ministers was carried out at the Temple of the Tooth, the holiest Buddhist shrine, in the presence of saffron-robed monks and other guests in Kandy, 115 kilometres east of Colombo. The venue was carefully chosen to reinforce the Rajapaksa family’s appeal to their majority Sinhala-Buddhist constituency.The president took his oath after his November landslide in front of a pagoda built by a legendary Sinhala king known to have vanquished a rival from the minority Tamil community.Mahinda was sworn in as Prime Minister on Sunday at the Kelaniya temple which Buddhists in Sri Lanka believe to have been visited by the Buddha himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gotabaya-rajapaksa-family-dominates-sri-lanka-govt-with-3-in-cabinet/story-qUHrDFf1J6nOJCPYZVE8DI.html

It is the worst figure for any G7 nation in the three months to June.Sunak, who has been borrowing heavily to pay most of the wage bills of the private sector and the self-employed since March, said, “I’ve said before that hard times were ahead and today’s figures confirm that hard times are here. “Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs and, sadly, in the coming months, many more will. But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”German government asked citizens to follow guidelines as health authorities reported 1,226 new infections.

13-08-2020||World||Google turning phones into earthquake detectors||Google added an earthquake alert system in California on Tuesday, saying it is working on letting Android-powered smartphones double as tremor detectors.Android phones will receive warnings triggered by a “ShakeAlert” earthquake early-warning system implemented on the West Coast by the US Geological Survey and partners.ShakeAlert uses signals from hundreds of seismometers across the state to trigger warning messages that “an earthquake has begun and shaking is imminent,” according to the system’s website.“We saw an opportunity to use Android to provide people with timely, helpful earthquake information when they search, as well as a few seconds warning to get themselves and their loved ones to safety if needed,” principal software engineer Marc Stogaitis said in a blog post.People anywhere with smartphones powered by Google’s Android operating software were also invited to let handsets be part of a crowd-sourced network for detecting earthquakes.Smartphones are typically equipped with tiny accelerometers that sense movement and can catch shaking caused by earthquakes, according to Stogaitis. “This means your Android phone can be a mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world’s largest earthquake detection network,” Stogaitis said.Phones that detect what might be earthquake activity can automatically send a signal to a data centre, where computers quickly determine whether a quake is happening, according to Google.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-turning-phones-into-earthquake-detectors/story-OIEvaPXNxTOEVXSzhXaTNN.html
13-08-2020||World||Colour, gender and Silicon: Why Kamala sits well with a cup of Joe||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden received $10.8 million of campaign donations in the four hours after he announced Kamala Harris as his running mate - four times more than normal. Biden will see this as a sign that he and Harris, the first Indian-American and first black American woman to achieve such political prominence, will be greater than the sum of their parts. President Donald Trump is already tweeting hard to ensure Harris becomes a liability and undermines Biden’s 10-point lead in the polls.That Harris is black, Asian, and a woman, weighed heavily on Biden’s decision. He had promised to have a woman vice-president. He wanted to thank blacks for saving his candidacy. Her Indian background was arguably the least important factor in his choice. The choice of Harris is still more than just genes and gender. Biden says he will be a “transition” and “bridge” president, indicating he won’t run for a second term. His vice-president will be front-runner for the Democratic presidential candidacy in 2024. And being 77 years old, he wanted a running mate who had gone through the US election grinder, sought to be president, and had shown the steel to take on the Republican troll army. Harris alone fit the bill. Kamala Harris is the latest example of “Bay Area liberalism”. Arising out of San Francisco-Silicon Valley, these Democrats mix ardent identity and green activism with a belief in technology and business. Their clarion calls are climate and data, gay rights and internet rights. In Washington, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Harris are the most prominent representatives. Harris on the ticket complements Biden’s more traditional base of East Coast liberals and union workers. These origins are also why one does not hear Harris talk of breaking up Big Tech and imposing a wealth tax. Politico.com argues that since San Francisco politics is blue vs blue it encourages politicians good at bridging ideological divisions. Harris “has demonstrated an ability to appeal to liberal voting blocs…without alienating moderate allies.” This would appeal to Biden who sees his main task as healing the social wounds left by Trump. Silicon pragmatism explains Harris’s record of “talk left, walk right” on many liberal issues. When seeking election as attorney general, she campaigned on criminal justice reform for minorities but once in office she made concessions to the police unions. As an Oval Office candidate, she signed up for nationalised health care but her platform supported a mix of public and private. As a senator, she scored close to socialist Bernie Sanders in sponsoring leftist legislation. But Harris never did the legwork to get any of the bills passed. Trump is already trying to turn Democrats against her, calling her “Phoney Kamala.” Biden, however, sees this as common sense politics. He has to win a lot of right-leaning independent voters to win. After he wins, he may have to work with a Republican Congress. A pragmatic vice-president is what he wants. How would a Vice-President Harris look at a Narendra Modi government? After India ended Kashmir’s special status, she reportedly said in a fund-raiser: “We are keeping track of the situation. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands.” However, the source is a single Pakistani television station. She declared support for another Indian-American lawmaker, Pramila Jayapal, who was rebuffed by Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar for trying to score points with the Kashmir issue. Yet Harris has never taken any concrete moves against New Delhi and, as a candidate, her formal policy statements were silent on Modi. One can only surmise that a Bay Area politician would find resonance with the Indian Prime Minister’s digital focus, climate commitment, and actions on transgender rights. Harris, who was largely raised by her Tamil mother, has stayed close to her relatives in Chennai, and visits them almost every year. Her personal motto, adopted from her mother, is, “You may be the first, but make sure you’re not the last.” As US vice-presidential candidate she has already fulfilled the latter half of the motto. Come November, she may accomplish the earlier part as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colour-gender-and-silicon-why-kamala-sits-well-with-a-cup-of-joe/story-62eywxSOJWEBEzheOjey4M.html
13-08-2020||World||Kamala: A woman of many firsts||It’s not Cam-el-uh. Not Kuh-mahl-uh, either. Or Karmel-uh. It’s Kamala. Kamala Harris.This is from an ad Harris, now 55, ran in 2016 when she was running for the US senate from California. It was meant for Californians to whom Harris was not exactly a stranger. She had been in public life for years in the state by then and was then serving the second of her two four-year terms as the state’s top law enforcement officer, the attorney general.On Tuesday night, four years after those ads and Harris’s successful senate run, Tucker Carlson, host of America’s highest-rated prime-time cable news show, lost it when a guest insisted on air that Carlson correctly pronounce the name of the person Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, picked to be his running mate.“So it begins; you’re not allowed to criticize Ka-MAL-a Harris, or KAM-a-la Harris...or whatever?” Carlson said in exasperation, before conceding, “Ok look, I unintentionally mispronounced her name.”The Biden-Harris campaign might want to send Carlson a link to her senate race ad — which featured a bunch of children explaining how to get the name right — or just air it again.Born on October 20, 1964, Harris was named Kamala Devi by her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who was from Chennai. “Our classical Indian names harked back to our Indian heritage and we were raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for India culture,” Harris wrote in The Truth We hold: An American journey, her autobiography. Her only sibling — a younger sister — is named Maya Harris. Their last names are from their father Jonathan Harris, who is from Jamaica.The parents separated when Harris was seven, and five years later, the family moved to Montreal, Canada, where her mother had accepted a research position at a university.After graduating from Howard University, a predominantly Black university in Washington DC years later, Harris went on to study law at Hastings, University of Californian, in San Francisco. She became a lawyer in 1990. Harris returned to her hometown Oakland, and joined the Alameda county district attorney’s office as a deputy in 1991, to begin shortly a career that would set her on path to the vice-presidential nomination on Tuesday, as the first Indian-American, first South Asian-American and the first Asian-American male or female to ever make it onto a presidential ticket. That’s from her mother’s side. On her father’s side, she is the first African- American male or female to run for vice-president on a major party’s ticket. And, another series of “firsts” awaits her on November 3, election night, if the Biden-Harris ticket prevails.In 2003, Harris was elected district attorney in San Francisco. That would be the start of the “firsts”. Her election made her the first woman district attorney of the city, the first Black woman and the first South Asian woman in the state to hold that job and, of course, the first Indian-American, of any gender.That election also handed her one of her life’s most enduring controversies. On the first year on the job, a San Francisco police officer was killed on duty by a man using an automatic rifle. Harris, who had run for office as an opponent of the death penalty, did not seek capital punishment for the accused, which earned her the hostility of the police force in the city and the state. And it is an issue that is cited in almost every profile of her written since. The Trump campaign will not pass it up as an opportunity to portray the Biden-Harris ticket as weak on law enforcement, as a contrast to the president’s strong stand on the issue in the backdrop of the ongoing anti-racism protests and demand from certain quarters for defunding the police. It started Tuesday night, in fact. “She is now trying to bury her egregious record as a prosecutor in order to appease the anti-police extremists that are now controlling the radicalized Democrat Party,” said Katrina Pierson, a senior Trump 2020 adviser. “Kamala is in this for political convenience, it is clearly her primary motivator.”The Trump campaign and Republicans by and large understood well how formidable Harris can be. President Trump himself had conceded recently she would be a “fine choice” for Biden. Now, however, it’s different. “I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the US senate,” Trump said to reporters, referring to senator Harris’s grilling of Brett Kavanaugh, the president’s nominee for the Supreme Court at a bruising confirmation hearing.Harris has built over the years a formidable reputation as, among other things, a tough and tenacious interrogator. From her seat on the senate judicial committee, she could nail squirming witnesses with a steady, unrelenting gaze and unwavering questioning,which invariably went viral.Mike Pence, the vice-president, might find himself in that seat next.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-a-woman-of-many-firsts/story-ADf06n9mEscdJxNQXn5ihJ.html
13-08-2020||World||China’s Huawei, ZTE set to be shut out of India’s 5G trials||China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. are set to be kept out of India’s plans to roll out its 5G networks as relations between the two countries hit a four decade low following deadly border clashes.The South Asian nation will apply investment rules amended on July 23 that cite national security concerns to restrict bidders from nations it shares land borders with to keep out the companies, people familiar with the issue said, asking not to be identified citing rules.The Ministry of Communications will restart pending discussions on approvals for 5G trials by private companies including Bharti Airtel Ltd., Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., and Vodafone Idea Ltd. that were delayed by the nationwide lockdown, they said.India’s decision echoes actions by the US, U.K. and Australia, which have raised red flags about the companies’ Chinese government links. The US Federal Communications Commission has officially declared both companies national security threats.The process to auction 5G may spill into next year, according to the officials. A decision on the ban is expected to be announced in a week or two after approval from the prime minister’s office, they said.A spokesman for the communications ministry and the prime minister’s office didn’t immediately respond to queries seeking comment.Border tensionsWhile India allowed Huawei to participate in its 5G trials earlier this year, its stance against Chinese companies hardened after China’s actions along their disputed border in early May. That military standoff, which turned deadly in June killing 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops, is now in its fourth month.Huawei and ZTE didn’t respond to emails seeking comments.Reliance could be a serious challenge to Huawei in the world’s second-biggest wireless market after Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani on July 15 announced plans to soon roll out a 5G network for his Jio Infocomm using a technology developed in-house, without giving details.His conglomerate has said its carrier won’t need to spend much to switch to the new system, unlike some of its rivals, leaving it immune to political disputes linked to Chinese equipment vendors that global telecommunications companies are embroiled in.Yet, with its economy headed for a ‘deep slump’ amid a worsening Covid-19 pandemic, the government may not be in a position to push for a 5G spectrum auction in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-huawei-zte-set-to-be-shut-out-of-india-s-5g-trials/story-cFF092tFHqC4A4FpnEYMfK.html
13-08-2020||World||China extends anti-dumping tariff for 5 years on India-made optical fibre||China has extended an anti-dumping tariff on optical fibre made in India, the ministry of commerce said in a notice published on its website on Thursday.The duties will be renewed from Friday and remain in place for five years.In the announcement, the MOFCOM “…decided to continue to impose anti-dumping duties on imported single-mode optical fibers originating in India from August 14 on the basis of the final review of the investigation results. The implementation period is 5 years”.Several Indian companies were named in the announcement.The ministry defined single-mode fibre as a fibre that transmits only a single-mode optical signal within a certain wavelength range.The punitive tariff on single-mode optical fibre takes effect from August 14 and lasts for five years, with tariffs ranging between 7.4 percent and 30.6 percent depending on the specific Indian manufacturers, the ministry said.The extension of the anti-dumping duties comes in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension at Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and the cooling of bilateral economic ties.“The decision came after MOFCOM evaluated the possible damage to Chinese industries if anti-dumping measures are terminated, at the request of the domestic single-mode optical fiber industry on 13 August, 2019,” state media reported.The Ministry of Commerce began to implement anti-dumping measures on imports of single-mode optical fibers from India in August 2014. In June 2019, the MOFCOM initiated the final review investigation in response to a domestic industry application, the announcement said.The Chinese ministry ruled if the anti-dumping measures were terminated, “…the dumping of imported single-mode optical fibers originating in India to China may continue or recur, and the damage to China’s domestic industries may continue or recur”.The Chinese order comes three days after India sought to impose provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of black toner in powder form originating in or exported from China, Malaysia and Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) for six months, a government order issued on Monday said.The duty on a tonne of black toner would range from $196 for imports from Chinese Taipie, $1,686 for imports from Malaysia and $834 for those originating in or exported from China, it said.On June 23, New Delhi had slapped anti-dumping duty on certain steel products imported from China, South Korea and Vietnam after an investigation found that these items caused injury to domestic producers.India-China bilateral trade in the year 2019 decreased by 2.93 percent year on year to reach $92.89 billion. India’s exports to China decreased by 4.55 percent year-on-year to $17.97 billion, and India’s imports from China also witnessed a drop by 2.54 percent to $74.92 billion, according to data from China’s customs departmentIndia’s trade deficit with China stood at US$ 56.95 billion, a minor year-on-year decline of 1.88 percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-extends-anti-dumping-tariff-for-5-years-on-india-made-optical-fibre/story-w9YPufo6BXOMkk31qs4clL.html

13-08-2020||India||25 yrs on, access to quality internet possible for only half the population||When the internet came to India on the eve of independence day in 1995, it promised mass connectivity. With connectivity, citizens in cities, towns and villages alike would be able to connect to worlds beyond their immediate vicinity; information and services, hitherto the monopoly of the rich and powerful would become accessible to all. As an 11-year old growing up in Kolkata, I too was gripped by the heady prospect of having the world at my fingertips. My mother took me to the British Council Library where I set up a Yahoo account and spent hours digging up random trivia sourced from Encarta 95. Over time, I had a dial-up modem installed at home using which I checked examination marks online, did some extra research for school and became a truly digital citizen. What was available to me in the 90s in a middle class Kolkata home has today permeated large sections of the country. But the quest to get the country online has not even reached the halfway mark. According to a report by the Internet & Mobile Association of India and Nielsen in 2019, 451 million users aged above 5 were active online in India, less than 50% of the population. Female users accounted for half of the total male users. Rural internet penetration was abysmally low at 27%. Even for those who are online, the quality of service requires significant improvement. It ought to be a matter of some regret to governments, internet evangelists and civil society that 25 years on, fundamental, first-order problems of internet access and quality remain. A dominant reason for this state of affairs is a misguided contemporary narrative around the internet that focuses primarily on privacy and state surveillance. Needless to say, privacy on the internet is an issue that affects every user, rich or poor. But the prioritisation of privacy and state surveillance in the narrative over fundamental questions of access and quality has meant that public and governmental focus has leapfrogged fundamental issues to second-generation ones. What this has unwittingly done is to decelerate the spread of internet in the country. The BharatNet project of the government, designed to connect all Gram Panchayats, has missed multiple targets to very little public criticism. As of January 2020, only 7.45% of the 150,000 Gram Panchayats meant to be connected in Phase 2 are service-ready. Jio has stepped into this breach promising to connect every village. Private telecom operators may indeed be the country’s best chance to get online. It’s a pity though that in the process, ensuring access to the internet is no longer treated as a duty of the state; it has become contingent on the choices made by private corporations.Apart from benefiting Indian corporations, the state surveillance-centric narrative has also let large foreign corporations off the hook. Vast amounts of data of Indians has already been collected without the concomitant payment of taxes in India. Of course, like the East India Company, which started building railroads to connect the country, Indians have benefited from foreign corporations as well.The promise of free internet at railway stations, the ability to post videos or have a service that curates a timeline of photos, do make lives better. But these short-term gains have come at the cost of our long-term sovereignty as these corporations are ultimately their own masters. If August 15,1995 was India’s tryst with internet destiny, August 15,2020 is the time for the internet ecosystem in India to redeem its pledge. A pledge to dedicate itself to the service of the people of India, the unconnected, the digitally illiterate, the poor, and to the still larger cause of humanity. The internet that will emerge from these efforts will undoubtedly be very different from what we see today—more local, less in English, fairer in terms of empowering individuals to control their digital lives, and freer, without individual and community data being colonised by states and private corporations. But each of these can only happen if we make getting every Indian online our first priority—to give millions of 11-year olds in cities, towns and villages the joy of having the world at their fingertips. So as the internet turns 25 in India, here is a thought to set the ball rolling on the next 25—Parliament should introduce Article 21B of the Constitution, making the right to access the internet a fundamental right of all citizens. Happy internet independence day to all. (Arghya Sengupta is Research Director, Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. With inputs from Sumeysh Srivastava.

13-08-2020||India||Varsities can open for final exams: Govt to SC||New Delhi: The Union government has given relaxations to colleges and universities across the country and allowed them to open for the conduct of final-year examinations, which will be held in accordance with an order issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the Union home ministry said in an affidavit in the Supreme Court on Thursday.The submission to the court comes at a time when at least two states — Delhi and Maharashtra — have cancelled final-term exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic despite a UGC order mandating the holding of such exams by September 30.“Taking into consideration the academic interest of a large number of students, it was decided to grant an exemption for the opening of educational institutions for the purposes of holding examinations/evaluation work for Final Term Examinations of the Universities /Institutions,” the MHA affidavit said.Schools and colleges have been closed since March-end. There are indications that the government has prepared standard operating procedures for the reopening of schools. But there are no immediate reopening plans after the current restrictions end on August 31. The guidelines for the ongoing “Unlock 3” phase say educational institutions will remain closed until at least the end of this month.“...the universities/institutions will be and are clearly intended to be exempted from the said restriction for the limited purpose of holding Final Term Examinations/evaluation work in terms of the UGC guidelines on examinations,” the affidavit said.On July 6, higher education regulator UGC said universities and colleges across India will have to hold their final-year or final-semester examinations — online, offline or by using a combination of both — by September 30. The same day, the home ministry, which releases guidelines on Covid-19 restrictions and relaxations for businesses and activities, said final-term exams will be held in line with UGC guidelines.The decision was met with resistance with a section of students demanding the scrapping of examinations in view of the pandemic. The issue reached the top court, where multiple petitioners also argued that many do not have access to high-speed internet and online exams will not be feasible for them. Petitioners have urged the court to consider scrapping online/offline tests, and instead direct UGC to declare results by July 31 based on students’ past performance or internal assessment. But UGC argues that degrees cannot be conferred without the examinations; that it alone is empowered to take a call on whether or not the exams can take place or should be cancelled; and that the decision to conduct exams is in the interest of a large number of students. The affidavit becomes important because it spells out the MHA’s stand on the issue and provides for limited relaxations to educational institutes. On July 31, the bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah allowed the Centre and UGC to file their affidavits. The matter was taken up on August 10, when they sought permission to file their responses to additional petitions filed in matter. The court is expected to hear the case on Friday.Tanvi Dubey, an advocate for one of the petitioners, Yash Dubey, who has filed a writ petition against the July 6 UGC order, said, “We will oppose the exception granted by the MHA [home ministry] on the ground that it goes against the July 29 Unlock-3 Guidelines issued by the same Ministry which specifically provides for all schools, colleges to remain closed till August 31...”But professor Atul Khosla, founder and pro vice-chancellor of Himachal Pradesh-based Shoolini University, welcomed the home ministry’s stand in the court. “There is technology available to conduct such examinations and government institutions must wake up to the possibilities,” he said.Surajit Mazumdar, the secretary of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association, questioned UGC’s approach. “...what’s the purpose behind conducting only final year examination? There should be an explanation. If UGC thinks that examination is necessary part of the process to access the ability of students for giving them degrees then they should take the same decision for all students. If they can promote a first year student without any exam why can’t they promote students who have passed all the exams and reached to final year?”Rajesh Jha, a member of the Delhi University’s executive council (EC) and an associate professor of political science, said gatherings should be avoided and physical distancing maintained during the pandemic. “Even limited opening for exams will expose students to [health] risks, and the higher education system is not fully capable to conduct online exams across social, economic and digital divide,” he added.Hitesh Sharma, 20, a final-year student of BA (Hons) in political science at Delhi’s Rajdhani College and a resident of Jammu’s Kathua district, said: “Many countries have seen the adverse effect of reopening education institutions amid the pandemic. Who will take the responsibility of the safety of students?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varsities-can-open-for-final-exams-govt-to-sc/story-BOrMYljuhud7tm8QpMccJJ.html
13-08-2020||India||SC asks Centre to arrange funds for stalled Amrapali projects||The Supreme Court on Thursday gave the Centre a week to indicate how much funds it could provide for completion of real estate firm Amrapali’s stalled housing projects under the distress fund corpus of Rs 25,000 crore set up to revive their construction.A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and UU Lalit told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that if no positive response is given by Wednesday, the court will be forced to pass orders in the exercise of its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to pass orders for complete justice in a case before it.The court has been monitoring the completion of the projects since July 2019 when it cancelled the firm’s registration under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act. The cancellation followed a forensic audit that found the firm’s directors were allegedly illegally diverting the homebuyers’ money. The National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) was given the task to complete the pending projects.A committee comprising two forensic auditors and court-appointed receiver, senior advocate R Venkatramani, was formed to carry out auctioning of Amrapali properties and to examine possible sources of funding.Venkatramani on Thursday told the court that despite meeting the Union finance secretary, there was no progress on part of the Centre to arrange funds for the project. He is independently in talks with SBI Capital Ventures (SBICAP), which had agreed in principle to provide ₹995 crore out of the ₹25,000 crore fund for stressed real estate projects set up by the government.SBICAP, represented by senior advocate Harish Salve, informed the court on Thursday that certain “sticky points” on the choice of projects and mode of pricing have delayed infusion of funds and sought a week to get back with a formal proposal.Upset over the delay in sourcing funds, the bench told Mehta, “You are not giving any fund in a Court-monitored project that we want to revive. We are trying to persuade everyone but nobody is doing anything. SBICAP is creating every kind of problem. Now they want to levy 12%interest (on the loan they would offer). SBICAP is negotiating like a private player. This is not the way they (SBICAP) should behave and are your (the Centre’s) hands tied.”The court asked Mehta to use his good offices and ensure fund is arranged. “When distress fund is created why is it not being used?”Venkatramani informed the court he was willing to talk with public sector banks, a consortium of which could finance the projects securing the payment against the inventory of unsold flats in various Amrapali projects. The bench allowed the receiver to proceed with the decision and present a plan by the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-centre-to-arrange-funds-for-stalled-amrapali-projects/story-4l8gI66iN7pojfiliATRCK.html
13-08-2020||India||Former bishop of Jalandhar charged in nun rape case||The additional sessions court in Kottayam in Kerala on Thursday framed charges against former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal who has been accused by a nun of his congregation of raping her several times. The judge read out charges against him including rape, criminal intimidation, wrongful confinement and insulting the modesty of a woman but Mulakkal denied all charges. After formally framing charges the court posted the case for hearing on September 16 for the survivor’s examination.. Mulakkal, who surrendered before the court last week, was allowed to leave the state but was asked to appear before it as and when required. The court had cancelled his bail last month when he repeatedly failed to appear before it. Later he moved the High Court and Supreme Court which also refused to entertain his plea to stay the case following which he surrendered in the trial court in Kottayam which asked him not to leave the state still the charge sheet was read out. The case surfaced in 2018 after a 43-year-old nun complained to the police in Kottayam that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. But Mulakkal denied it saying he was implicated after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent. A special investigation team (SIT) which probed the nun’s allegations, arrested him in September 2018. He was granted bail after spending 40 days in jail. He was removed from the post of the bishop later. The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year but he failed to appear before the court several times. The petitioner had also complained that some of the witnesses were threatened by Mulakkal’s followers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bishop-of-jalandhar-charged-in-nun-rape-case/story-JkgYB4nS4LZNnbrzRE6vaP.html
13-08-2020||India||Consider amending Official Languages Act: Supreme Court tells Centre||The Central government should consider amending the Official Languages Act of 1963, to include scheduled languages other than Hindi and English as official language of the Government of India, the Supreme Court said on Thursday.Scheduled languages are those languages which are listed in the 8th schedule of the Constitution and are given official recognition and encouragement by the Central government. However, all official communication and publication of rules and notifications by the Central government are in Hindi and English.Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde said that people in various parts of the country might not know either English or Hindi and communication by the Central government in vernacular languages will come to their aid.“There might be people in Karnataka, Nagaland or rural Maharashtra who might not know Hindi or English. Your government should consider amending the Official Languages Act,” CJI Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Central government.The court was hearing an appeal filed by the Centre against a judgment passed by the Delhi high court on June 30, directing the Centre to translate the draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of 2020 into twenty-two scheduled languages.The Central government submitted on Thursday that as per Article 343 of the Constitution, the official language of the Union is Hindi along with English.“The Constitution of India does not have any provision whereby it may be inferred that all the languages mentioned in the 8th schedule of the Constitution would be used as official languages of the Union,” the plea said.Further, it was also pointed out that section 3 of the Official Languages Act states that Hindi and the English shall be used for resolutions, general orders, rules, notifications, administrative or other reports made by the Central government or any of its ministries or departments.The Supreme Court after examining the high court judgment observed that the arguments raised by the Centre before the Supreme Court were not raised before the high court.It, therefore, directed the Centre to withdraw the petition before the top court with liberty to file a review petition before the high court.The apex court also said that no contempt of court proceedings can be initiated against the Centre for non-compliance with the high court order till the review petition is decided. The draft EIA notification was issued by the Centre on March 23 and was published on the website of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for the information of stakeholders and public inviting their comments and objections.Environmentalist, Vikrant Tongad approached the Delhi high court seeking extension of the window allowed to the public to send in their responses, till September 30. The initial deadline allowed by the Centre was till June 11 and the same was later extended by the Centre till June 30.The high court extended the deadline till August 11 taking into account the fact that there was an error in the Centre’s notice extending the deadline to June 30. Tongad in his plea had also canvassed the issue regarding the language in which the EIA notification was issued.“The draft has been published only in English and Hindi, whereas it is proposed to have effect all over India and to several industries and comments have naturally be elicited from all over the country,” Tongad had submitted.The high court allowed the plea holding that EIA notification should be translated and published in all the scheduled languages.“Considering the far reaching consequences of the public consultation process for which the draft notification has been published, we are of the view that it would be in aid of effective dissemination of the proposed notification if arrangements are made for its translation into other languages as well, at least those mentioned in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution,” the high court said.Such translations should also be published through the website of MOEF as well as on websites of Environment Ministries of all the States and State Pollution Control Boards, the high court added.The Centre challenged this aspect of the high court order before the Supreme Court.“Such direction (by high court) apart from causing massive procedural and administrative difficulties is also devoid of any statutory requirement for the petitioner to do so,” the Centre said in its plea.“You (Central government) are right as far as the law is concerned. But we think the spirit in which the high court order was passed is correct,” CJI Bobde said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-amending-official-languages-act-supreme-court-tells-centre/story-PHYAnYDoEp4IqVnWtzAHSJ.html

The TMC leader had tested negative even though he was suffering from Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI). The doctors refused to admit him without an examination. He died later in the night,” said a senior doctor of the hospital. Hospital authorities alleged that dozens of TMC supporters came to the hospital to admit Mafijuddin Mondal, the party’s block president from Khargram. As the doctors and nurses were attending other critical patients, the TMC supporters entered the Covid-19 ward and started looking for a bed where Mondal could be admitted. “When a doctor objected, the TMC supporters started heckling him and tore his shirt. Later, some nurses and other hospital staff were also heckled when they tried to intervene,” said a hospital staff. A senior police officer said that four people had been detained on the basis of a complaint lodged by the hospital authorities. “Khalilur Rahaman, the ruling party’s member of parliament from Jangipur was also present. It is not desirable from an MP. Mondal was referred to the hospital as a SARI patient which means he was Covid-19 negative. But his supporters demanded an ICU bed,” said Sharmila Mallik, Superintendent of the Matri Sadan hospital in Berhampore. Rahaman, however, refused to comment: “I don’t want to comment on this.” Till Thursday, at least 13 people have died in Murshidabad from the Covid-19 infection and eight other people of the district have died outside Murshidabad from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-supporters-heckle-doctor-nurses-in-covid-19-hospital-in-bengal/story-hgOxwEliK0GcW0JW2QqlEO.html
13-08-2020||India||Ahead of opening of religious places, Srinagar administration sensitises 3,000 spiritual heads||Ahead of the reopening of religious places on August 16 in Jammu and Kashmir, the administration in Srinagar, the worst affected district by Covid-19, has sensitised over 3,000 religious leaders including Imams to about adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place to contain the spread of the pandemic.Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Shahid Chaudhary said that they had a meeting with around 3,000 religious heads of different institutions and the imams of mosques to discuss the SOP with them.“Last week there was good interaction with them and the state government has already notified SOPs what needs to be done. I hope our religious leaders will lead the people as per the expectations and take a message to the people, besides following the SOPs for religious institutions,” he said.The Jammu and Kashmir administration had re-imposed lockdown restrictions in Srinagar from July 13 and rest of the valley from July 27 following a surge in Covid-19 cases. On August 4, the government announced that all religious places and places of worship would reopen from August 16 but detailed Covid-19 SOPs will have to be followed that includes no large gatherings and no touching of statues.“We had already removed lockdown completely from June 13 following which there was a sharp spike in cases from 400 to 4,500 cases in a month or so which prompted us to go for a 10-day lockdown,” said Chaudhary.Srinagar is the worst affected district with a tally of 6,577 cases and 163 deaths. The active cases in the district fel to 2,036 after 311 recovered Thursday.“The recovered cases in Srinagar are double than active cases which is a positive development. Experts are saying that the positive cases will keep on getting reported. It won’t show a quick downfall,” the DC said but asked people to take precautions.“People need to adopt precautions like masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. Regarding the compact gatherings at religious institutions, the way religious institutions are prepared I am hopeful that they will adopt SOPs,” he said.He said that they have also discussed the SOPs with the trade and business community about the opening after August 16.“The SOPs like opening 50 per cent shops should be adhered to. If there is no crowding like last time then I think there is no need to go for another lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-opening-of-religious-places-srinagar-administration-sensitises-3-000-spiritual-heads/story-wxAsDAMC8TUFWyQgixUE9N.html

We are determined to act in the interest of the people of Rajasthan and in accordance with the promises made,” Pilot tweeted in Hindi.The return of Pilot and 18 of his supporters has come as a huge boost for the Congress that had been convulsed by infighting for more than a month.Gehlot and Pilot came face-to-face at the Congress Legislature Party meet on Thursday, underscoring that grievances of the dissident MLAs will be addressed and that the episode should now be buried for good.Pilot, who returned to Jaipur on Tuesday, had earlier expressed his gratitude to all for supporting him during his tenure as the state unit head for six years, said people present at the CLP meeting.Boosted by the return of the 19 rebel MLAs, Gehlot also short-circuited the BJP’s no-confidence motion move by announcing that his government will seek a trust vote in the assembly. Under the rules, if the CM moves a confidence motion, it overrides the no-confidence motion moved by any other member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/determined-to-work-for-people-of-rajasthan-tweets-sachin-pilot-after-meeting-with-cm-ashok-gehlot/story-kDAQUArT0UWmPYRkz5U1aM.html

To address the inflation impact, PTO(s) may consider increasing the tariffs/ fares. However, it may be noted that PTO(s) would be operating in a competitive environment, and PTO(s) ability to increase tariffs/ fares may be constrained,” the ministry said in the corrigendum document of its request for qualification (RFQ) for private companies to run 151 trains.The document has also advised the national carrier to clarify to prospective bidders that the project would not be under oversight of a regulator. Railways also stated in infrastructure projects Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects economic risks are generally assumed by the private partner as a “business risk.” “As per the envisaged structure for the Project, PTO(s) will have necessary operational flexibility to manage traffic demand, including selecting the product offering, determining fares to attract traffic etc,” it added.A pre-bid meeting was held by the ministry of railways on Wednesday with the firms. The private firms raised several queries regarding flexibility in clusters, eligibility criteria, bidding process, procurement of trains, fares, operations and maintenance, officials aware of the development said.One of the queries raised by a firm said: “As stated in the clause, it is clear that the fare will be decided by the concessionaire, but it is not clarified whether such an arrived fare will go through an adoption/approval from any authoritative/regulatory body.” The ministry responded by stating that the “fare will be market-driven and no approval is contemplated.”Railways had earlier indicated that a regulatory authority would be set up to review fares for private trains. In 2017, the NDA government first approved the setting up of the Rail Development Authority (RDA), to make “Pricing of services commensurate with costs, suggest measures for enhancement of Non Fare Revenue, protection of consumer interests, by ensuring quality of service and cost optimization, promoting competition, efficiency and economy”, among other things.To be clear, railway board chairman VK Yadav has stated that the ministry is planning to set up a regulatory authority in the near future. A feasibility study mentioned in the corrigendum also stated there is a possibility of a rail regulatory body being set up in India in the future “to regulate various entities and their functions.” The feasibility study in the report had advised the ministry to consider clarifying that the project would not be under oversight of the proposed regulator. “This would provide clarity/certainty to interested bidders. However, if MoR desires to have this project under the oversight of a regulator in future, provisions to this effect should be included,“ it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-trains-fares-to-not-be-regulated-operators-to-decide-railways/story-fTIRWPmedHhBne8eax79HP.html

Bhim Rai (53) was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering his wife in 2011. He was released on parole from Jalpaiguri central jail on July 24. After he showed symptoms, residents of the remote Lodhama village insisted that he undergo a Covid-19 test. The result on July 31 said he tested positive.He fled while being taken to a Covid hospital on the evening of August 2. A massive search operation was carried out by the West Bengal police and its counter insurgency force (CIF) and the forest department. Police used sniffer dogs and sought assistance from local people. The search was conducted in a 15 sq km dense forest in the Senchal wildlife west range. On Thursday morning, Rai was first spotted by a taxi driver in the Jorebungalow police station area. He informed the police and local residents. Though Rai was spotted by local people many times during the day in and around the Rangaroon forest no one dared to catch him as he had tested positive. A police constable involved in the search operation said, “Every time local youths went near him Rai pelted stones and escaped. He was running faster than the local youths.” “How can a Covid-19 patient, who was on the run for 11 days, could remain so strong? We were taken aback,” he added. Mingma Lepcha, officer in-charge of Jorebungalow police station, said, “Rai was finally caught in the evening from the Rangaroon forest range.” Teams of CIF, police and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) dog squads, forest personnel, civil volunteers and local people got involved in the manhunt. Abhi Tamang, a local resident who was among the three youths who first reached near Rai, said “He was running faster than us and was pelting stones. He told us to go home.” Some officials said a shortage of PPEs delayed the operation. Only a handful of people were wearing PPEs. Rai was sent to Darjeeling district hospital for checkup. Those who nabbed him would be tested too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murder-convict-who-tested-positive-for-covid-19-nabbed-after-11-day-manhunt-in-bengal/story-qO296yqhg0x7rQdWlI2iOI.html

Official figures released by the Telangana medical and health department indicate that there has been more or less a consistent fall in the number of positive cases in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits. The city, which reported 535 out of the total number of 2,092 positive cases for Covid-19 across Telangana on August 5, has registered only 298 positive cases out of the total number of 1931 cases in the state on August 12. Except on Tuesday, when the figure went up to 479, during the entire week, there had been a steady fall in the number of positive cases in the city. According to director of state medical and health G Srinivasa Rao, there has been a gradual fall in the number of positive cases in Greater Hyderabad due to effective containment measures. “We are hoping that the disease will be contained to a large extent in the city,” he said. However, Rao admitted that there was an increase in the number of positive cases in the districts surrounding Hyderabad like Medchal and Ranga Reddy, and also other parts of Telangana. “We are analysing the factors for this growth and shall take effective control measures,” he said. The officials suspect that the increase in the number of cases in the rural areas could be due to migration of workers from Hyderabad back to their rural areas in the last few weeks. “Moreover, testing facilities for Covid-19 in the districts have also been stepped up. Earlier, people used to come to Hyderabad for testing. Hence, more cases were reported in Hyderabad earlier and now, districts are reporting an increase in the number,” another official of the health department said. On an average, around 23,000 tests are being conducted in the state every day. Yet, the number of positive cases is not very high compared to many other states. The recovery rate in Telangana is 72.93 per cent, as against the national average of 70.37 per cent, the official said. As of Wednesday night, Telangana had recorded a cumulative number of 86,475 positive cases, of which only 22,736 are active cases and the overall number of recoveries is 63,074. So far, 665 people died of Covid-19, with the overall mortality rate being 0.76 per cent while the countrywide figure is 1.97 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-reports-dip-in-covid-cases-rural-areas-in-telangana-see-spike/story-lE3li7jSpetyPnwnCEWo7I.html
13-08-2020||India||‘Surveillance state’: Congress on Kerala tapping phones of Covid patients||With police collecting call detail records (CDR) of Covid-19 patients in Kerala, the opposition and legal experts questioned the legality of the move, saying it was an infringement on the right to privacy. The government, on its part, said it is for better tracking and surveillance of patients and that it was experimented in many places earlier also.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in pandemic situations such drastic steps will be needed but police will ensure that these records are not misused. He also said it was part of a scientific method to contain the spread of virus. But the opposition said in the name of records the government was trampling rights. “The government has violated the Supreme Court directive that collection of CDRs will be permitted only in serious criminal cases. It is planning to convert Kerala into a surveillance state. It is a violation of rights,” said Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. He said chances are the CDRs will be misused and patients will have to bear more stigma and taboo. The Congress said it will move the court if the order was not withdrawn. Kerala police chief Loknath Behera on Wednesday issued a circular which said the ADGP Intelligence and ADGP headquarters will get in touch with all service providers to get CDRs of Covid patients. After this, their route maps will be prepared. There are also reports that some service providers declined to share details. “The right to privacy of an individual has been defined in detail in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India. The decision to retrieve CDRs is against the right to privacy. The government can’t breach individual rights like this,” said Supreme Court lawyer MR Abhilash, adding that unless it was for a criminal investigation or a matter of serious national security issue CDRs can’t be retrieved. But the CM justified it saying it was done for the sake of public health and safety. “We have experimented this in the worst –affected areas like Kasaragod earlier. Strict instructions were given to the police not to misuse these details,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surveillance-state-congress-on-kerala-tapping-phones-of-covid-patients/story-haTF6ttrq8FQCmZZsRiECM.html

HT has reviewed a copy of the order.The Investigator-in-Charge will complete the inquiry and submit the report to AAIB preferably within five months from the date of issue of this order, it stated.He will be assisted by Operations Expert Ved Prakash; Senior Aircraft Maintenance Engineer -B737 Mukul Bhardwaj; Gp. Capt. (Dr.) Y S Dahiya, Aviation Medicine Expert and Jasbir Singh Larhga, Deputy Director AAB.“The Investigator-in-Charge may take the assistance of other experts/agencies whenever required. The headquarters of the investigation will be at New Delhi,” the order said.“Whereas Boeing 737-800 aircraft VT-AXH, of M/s Air India Express Ltd, while operating a scheduled flight from Dubai International Airport, UAE, met with an accident on August 7, 2020 during landing at Kozhikode International Airport. And, whereas the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), India desires as per its mandate to investigate and determine the probable causes) and contributory factor(s) leading to the accident and make recommendations to avoid recurrence of such accident in future,” the order said.“Now, in exercise of the powers conferred by the Rule 11 (1) of the Aircraft (Accident and Incidents Investigation) Rules 2017, the Director General-AAIB, India hereby orders an investigation into the said accident to find out the probable causes.”The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had announced last week that the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered from the crash site. The cockpit voice recorder keeps a recording of all the conversations taking place in a plane’s cockpit and along with the flight data recorder, which logs data such as airspeed, altitude and fuel flow, it can help in determining the cause of the crash.The Boeing 737 jet, on a Vande Bharat mission as flight AIX 1344 from Dubai that was bringing in Indians who were stranded abroad due to the Covid-19 pandemic, met with an accident while landing at the Kozhikode airport in treacherous conditions on August 7, breaking into two — making it one of the deadliest commercial aviation disasters in the country in nearly 10 years.The crash occurred around 7.40pm and bore striking similarity to the 2010 Mangalore airport crash when a plane, also an Air India Express Boeing 737, overshot a table-top runway and crashed nose-first.The aviation regulator has also banned the use of wide-body aircraft during the monsoon at Kerala’s Calicut airport and decided to divert them to neighbouring airports during the monsoon season. The aviation regulator is also planning to conduct safety audits across airports in regions that receive high rainfall, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-tragedy-to-probe-deadliest-air-disaster-in-a-decade-team-of-5-set-up-by-aaib/story-tAPxbSCx0lVH6WYduCRoyH.html

A Reuters report quoting military officials said the visit will take place this weekend but there was no independent confirmation from Riyadh.The visit is widely seen as an effort by Islamabad to repair ties with Saudi Arabia that has been upset at the Imran Khan government badgering Riyadh to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Conference to target India over Kashmir.Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi crossed the red line last week when he asked OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” and set a deadline for the Saudi-led grouping of 57 Islamic countries. “If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” Shah Mahmood Qureshi told a Pakistani news channel last week.The remark did not go down well with the Saudi leadership which had made Pakistan pay back $1 billion two weeks ago, forcing Islamabad to borrow from China instead. The Saudis are yet to respond to Pakistan’s request for a $3.2bn oil credit facility, part of a $6.2bn package announced in 2018. Analysts have said that the Pakistan military leadership enjoys better relations with the Saudi leadership than the country’s political leaders.Saudi Arabia is also asking for another $1bn back, putting pressure on Pakistan’s fragile foreign exchange reserves. But the bigger blow would be if the Saudi government starts to send back the approximately 2.5 million Pakistanis who live and work in the Kingdom.If need be, officials have privately said that the Pakistan Foreign Minister may be removed from his position in a bid to normalise relations with the Saudi leadership.The Pakistan foreign minister has twice postponed his press conference to explain his remarks in a bid to placate Saudi Arabia, the last on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-read-too-much-into-it-says-pak-army-on-gen-bajwa-s-saudi-mission/story-NakBXSpAJc2539VBunUN8H.html

A few days ago, his wife had left with a son and the daughter for her parent’s home in Kota district of Rajasthan .

13-08-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot counters BJP, says will seek trust vote. House meets tomorrow||Bolstered by the return of 19 rebel MLAs, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot countered the BJP’s no-confidence motion move by announcing that his government will seek a trust vote in the House assembly. The session begins tomorrow.Per rules, if the CM moves a confidence motion, it overrides the no-confidence motion moved by any other member. HT had reported on Wednesday that CM Gehlot is likely to seek a trust vote despite the rebel legislators returning to the Congress as the move will give a breather of six months to the party to set its house in order, people familiar with the development said.The party thinks that a floor test is the only way to send across a message of unity after a tumultuous month marked by an intense tussle that triggered political uncertainty in the western state.The decision to seek bring in the trust vote was announced by Gehlot at the Congress legislature party meeting chaired by him.“We would have proved the majority without the 19 dissident MLAs but it would not have made us happy. Apne toh apne hote hai,” the CM said at the meeting, further underscoring the spirit of “forgive and forget”mantra, which he reiterated again today aimed at highlighting his accommodative stance.At the meeting, all MLAs raised their hands to show unity on the CM’s call to stay united.Earlier, Sachin Pilot had led a rebellion against Gehlot, seeking a change in the party’s leadership in Rajasthan. At the CLP meeting held at his residence, Gehlot urged Congress MLAs to forget the acrimony of the past month and move on.After the meeting, KC Venugopal, general secretary, said: “Everything went on well. Now, the Congress is united. We will fight against the BJP’s bad politics. Tomorrow in Vidhan Sabha Congress party will stand united and will fight out.”With 72 MLAs, the BJP does not have the numbers to challenge the Gehlot government on the floor of the House. The BJP, while the Congress’ internal feud was on full public display did not push for any trust vote, seems to have had a change of heart as the rebels returned home. Senior BJP leader and former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje said that the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government won’t last long. The decision to move the no-confidence motion was taken in a BJP legislature party meeting in the afternoon.After the meeting, leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters that the motion of no confidence will be moved in the assembly session beginning Friday. He said the proposal was being finalised. “Coronavirus cases are on the rise and the law and order situation is badly deteriorating. Attempts were made to link those, who were arrested by the SOG (Special Operations Group) over allegations of conspiring to topple the government, with BJP but the government failed in this. We will mention all these issues in the proposal,” Kataria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-counters-bjp-says-will-seek-trust-vote-house-meets-tomorrow/story-Ngnrmnf8uNMpK2xlObGNiO.html

The IMD said a low pressure area has formed over northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha and West Bengal coasts. There is also a monsoon trough plus a convergence of southwesterly winds with moisture from Arabian Sea is likely to continue during the next two days, which will lead to heavy rains over several parts of the country. Fairly widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places are very likely over major parts of north India -- Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan -- during the next two days and decrease thereafter, the IMD said. “Moderate to severe thunderstorm accompanied with lightning very likely at isolated places over Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, east Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh during next 24 hours,” the IMD said.Several parts of western India are also expected to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall. This includes Gujarat, Goa, Konkan, the ghat areas of central Maharashtra, and parts of central India during next 4-5 days, the IMD said. “Isolated extremely heavy falls are also likely over Gujarat state during next 2-3 days and over ghat areas of central Maharashtra during next 24 hours,” the IMD said.Fairly widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy falls are likely over Odisha, Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana during next 2-3 days, the IMD added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/large-parts-of-country-likely-to-receive-heavy-to-very-heavy-rainfall-during-next-2-3-days-imd/story-LHLRbi036ZCngLwaQ5MChI.html

Though a juvenile at the time of the incident, the Nandurbar resident was tried by a sessions court, instead of the juvenile justice board (JJB) as is the norm. On February 14, 2019, an additional sessions judge at Nandurbar had convicted him under section 354A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4 (penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO), Act, 2012. The juvenile was sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for the offence under the POCSO Act, 2012, and to three years jail term for the IPC offence, and was remanded to the Borstal School in Nashik. He had filed an application seeking bail during pendency of his appeal against the conviction, apprehending that he would be shifted to a regular prison after he turns 21. His lawyer pointed out that the juvenile would turn 21 soon, and it was necessary to suspend his sentence and release him on bail because of his tender age.The lawyer expressed apprehension that the juvenile would come in contact with hardened criminals, if he were to be shifted to a regular jail after he ceased to be a juvenile. Justice Kulkarni accepted the argument and ordered the juvenile to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 15,000 and a surety of the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-bail-to-juvenile-sentenced-for-raping-a-minor-on-grounds-that-his-future-might-be-ruined/story-WqdVH3PPp4qukt1cUSGoTM.html
13-08-2020||India||SC declines stay on merger of six BSP MLAs with Congress in Rajasthan||The Supreme Court, on Thursday, declined to stay a September 2019 decision by Rajasthan assembly Speaker, CP Joshi allowing merger of six MLAs elected on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket with the Congress party.A three-judge bench headed by justice Arun Mishra said that the issue regarding the validity of the Speaker’s decision is pending before a single-judge bench of Rajasthan high court and declined to grant interim relief to petitioner BJP MLA Madan Dilawar who sought disqualification of the six BSP MLAs for defection.“We are not inclined to grant any interim relief,” the bench which also comprised justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari said.The top court adjourned the case for Monday after senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Speaker said that the agenda for the Rajasthan assembly will be decided at 10 am on Friday and also submitted that the opposition is free to move a no confidence motion.“They have not moved a no-confidence motion. They can do that anytime,” he said.Senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for Dilawar, asked for a stay on the Speaker’s decision stating that if a no confidence emotion ensues, then BSP and Congress party will issue whips and there will be uncertainty on whose whip will hold good with respect to the six MLAs.“If the Speaker’s decision is later struck down by high court, then the six MLAs, in order to escape disqualification, can claim that the Speaker’s decision was in force at the time when they voted (against the BSP party whip),” Salve said.“Court cannot pass orders based on what may or may not happen in the house,” Sibal responded.Madan Dilawar had moved the Rajasthan high court on July 28 seeking disqualification of the six former BSP MLAS on the ground of defection under 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The six MLAs, Lakhan Singh, Rajender Singh Guda, Deepchand, Joginder Singh Avana, Sandeep Kumar and Wajib Ali were elected to the Rajasthan assembly in December 2018 on BSP ticket. They later submitted a joint application to the Speaker intimating him of their unanimous decision to merge with the Congress party on September 16, 2019. The request was approved by the Speaker on September 18, 2019.This was challenged by Dilawar who filed a plea before Speaker in March 2020 for disqualification of the six MLAs on the ground of defection. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution of India contains provisions relating to disqualification of lawmakers for defection. One of the grounds for disqualification as per paragraph 2 of the 10th Schedule is voluntarily giving up membership of the political party on whose ticket the lawmaker was elected.The Speaker rejected Dilawar’s plea on July 22 after which he approached the high court challenging the decision. A single-judge bench of the high court issued notice to the Speaker on July 30 but declined to stay the decision. A division bench of the high court also declined to grant stay instead requesting the single judge bench to hear and dispose of the matter within one day.Dilawar then approached Supreme Court seeking a stay on the Speaker’s order.“When the Rajasthan high court is hearing the matter, how can we pass an order,” justice Mishra asked Salve.The hearing of the case will continue before the Rajasthan high court on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-declines-stay-on-merger-of-six-bsp-mlas-with-congress-in-rajasthan/story-aI75dxAWvraPv8auDaln5N.html
13-08-2020||India||‘Forget what happened’: Sachin Pilot among audience, Ashok Gehlot hits reset||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, three days after the truce deal with the rebel faction was achieved, came face-to-face with his former deputy Sachin Pilot at the Congress Legislature Party meet on Thursday, underscoring that grievances of the dissident MLAs will be addressed and that the episode should now be buried for good. “We all should forget whatever happened,” people familiar with the developments at the Congress meet told HT, as pictures emerged of the two leaders smiling and shaking hands before the key meet began. The CM further said that he will be seeking a trust vote. However, the BJP, suspecting a short-lived truce, has already announced that it will be moving a no confidence motion against the Gehlot government. “We would have proved the majority without the 19 dissident MLAs but it would not have made us happy. Apne toh apne hote hai,” the CM said, further underscoring the spirit of “forgive and forget”mantra, which he reiterated again today aimed at highlighting his accommodative stance. At the meeting, all MLAs raised their hands to show unity on the CM’s call to stay united. Sachin Pilot, who returned to the state on Wednesday, expressed his gratitude to all for supporting him during his tenure as the state unit head for six years, said people present at the meeting. State party chief Govind singh Dotasra said like the Britishers, the BJP tried to divide and rule but their conspiracy failed.After the meeting, KC Venugopal, general secretary, said: “Everything went on well. Now, the Congress is united. We will fight against the BJP’s bad politics. Tomorrow in Vidhan Sabha Congress party will stand united and will fight out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-welcomes-back-sachin-pilot-18-rebel-mlas-says-should-forget-whatever-happened/story-iwTANOnsXc1HWTWAhpfdAK.html
13-08-2020||India||Last doctor standing: Covid-19 pandemic pushes Indian hospital to brink||Guards armed with rifles escort Dr. Kumar Gaurav as he makes the rounds at his hospital on the banks of the Ganges River.The guards are there to protect him from the relatives of patients, including those suffering from Covid-19. The relatives keep barging into the wards, even the ICU, to stroke and feed their loved ones, often without wearing even the flimsiest of masks as barriers against the novel coronavirus.“If we stop them, they get angry,” he says. “They want to give homemade meals to their patients, and some even want to massage their patients. And they are taking the infections from our ICUs to the other people in the society.”He stops to tell the wife of a patient in the ICU she must leave. She obeys, only to return after a few minutes from another entrance.It’s the monsoon season, and the humidity is reaching unbearable levels. But the few air conditioners in the hospital aren’t working, and some relatives use hand fans to keep their loved ones cool in wards dirty with garbage and discarded protective equipment.It wasn’t supposed to be like this for Kumar.Nine years ago, the 42-year-old psychiatrist moved his family back to his hometown for a quieter life and better pay after three years in the Indian capital, New Delhi. He accepted a job as a medical professor and consultant psychiatrist at the 900-bed Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, named after India’s first prime minister. Life was uneventful but rewarding, spent teaching classes and visiting his psychiatry patients.Now, with some doctors struck down by the coronavirus and others refusing to work, he has been named the top official at the hospital, despite being one of its most junior consultants – and suffering from diabetes and hypertension, two risk factors for severe Covid-19.But he says he felt compelled to volunteer for the job.“A lot of my colleagues refused,” he says. “I had to take up the responsibility.”In April, as the pandemic struck here in the eastern state of Bihar, the hospital was selected as one of just four Covid-dedicated hospitals for a population of 100 million people – at least in theory.In practice, Kumar says the nearest hospital with proper critical-care facilities is around 200 kilometers (120 miles) away. And with proper healthcare in the surrounding rural areas difficult to find, general patients have nowhere else to go but his hospital.In June, Kumar says, the district administration instructed the hospital to treat uninfected patients, too.“In an ideal world, there should not be any non-Covid patients in this hospital,” Kumar says.The healthcare system in Bhagalpur, like many other parts of Bihar, is on the verge of collapse, he says.Interviews with dozens of staff, patients and relatives at the hospital paint a picture of conditions that might shock those accustomed to images of hermetically sealed ICUs during the pandemic, with relatives not even allowed to touch their dying loved ones.They tell of a chronic shortage of manpower and resources such as blood and medicines. All 37 beds in the ICU are occupied; on the floor next to one of the beds, a relative sits on a brightly colored blanket he has brought from home, a water bottle by his side.Kumar says he feels powerless to prevent the lapses in isolation of the Covid patients.“We don’t know who is positive and who is negative,” the psychiatrist says. “We don’t know their status and we cannot wait for them to be tested. They just need the treatment. We are the most vulnerable population.”Spokesmen for India’s federal government and the Bihar government, as well as several bureaucrats and ministers responsible for healthcare at federal and state level, didn’t respond to detailed requests for comment. Pranav Kumar, the top bureaucrat in Bhagalpur district, also didn’t respond to a request for comment.TROUBLED STATEAs infections slow in many other countries, India is still reporting more than 50,000 cases per day. Its total of more than 2 million cases trails only the United States and Brazil, and cases show no signs of slowing. Since the pandemic struck India, more than 46,000 people have died.Although India’s major cities, such as New Delhi and Mumbai – the first to be hit by the virus – have registered a decline in cases, numbers in second-tier cities and rural areas continue to rise.Bihar is India’s third-most-populous state; if it were a country, it would be the 14th-most-populous in the world.The state has a rich history, including the site where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment beneath the shade of a Bodhi tree.But today, Bihar has a reputation as one of India’s problem-plagued states.Based on indicators including infant nutrition, Bihar’s level of development has more in common with sub-Saharan Africa than India’s prosperous southern states. Almost half of children under 5 in the state are stunted from malnutrition, with more than four in 10 underweight for their age, according to federal data.Bihar also has the highest population growth in India, and one of the worst education systems, scoring poorly on indicators including adult literacy, the percentage of children attending school and exam results.The healthcare system was overburdened even before the pandemic struck. Dr. Sunil Kumar, the Bihar secretary of the Indian Medical Association – the main healthcare union in India – said more than half the doctors’ posts in the state are unfilled. That’s because many doctors don’t want to serve in rural areas, according to Bihar’s top court, which urged the state government to do more to fill the roles in a ruling in May.There have been around 87,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state and 465 deaths – relatively small compared to other states. Given the low testing levels in the state, the numbers may be conservative. Still, Bihar’s healthcare system is already close to breaking point, unlike places such as New Delhi, which has had many more cases but enjoys better resources.The state government’s response to the outbreak has prompted public interest litigation asking that India’s federal government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, take over management of the pandemic here.One case, filed by local businessman Aditya Jalan, says “incalculable” lives will be lost if action isn’t taken soon, especially with the pandemic spreading into less developed and more rural areas.His petition cites a “complete breakdown of the public health infrastructure in the state of Bihar, including the lack of Covid-19 hospitals, the lack of hospital beds, the insufficient testing, the unsanitary quarantine centres, the lack of enforcement of social distancing measures, the insufficient medical personnel, [and] the failure to provide PPE to front-line workers.”India’s Supreme Court is due to hear the case Friday.The state’s healthcare problems are particularly stark in rural Bihar, where government infrastructure is even more rudimentary. In Ismailpur, a village an hour’s drive from Bhagalpur, the ongoing annual floods have cut off the main road to the highway. The floodwaters have reached the doorstep of the dilapidated primary health centre there, which caters to more than 52,000 people.There are no beds or oxygen cylinders, and a dog and her litter rest on the discarded PPE kits in the corner of the coronavirus testing hall.“It’s a very backward area,” says one of the two doctors in the center, Dr. Rakesh Ranjan. “People are scared to even get tested. We have to sometimes take police to get people tested.”HOSPITAL CHAOSPsychiatrist Kumar’s hospital backs onto the Ganges River, the holiest in India and swollen by the summer monsoon. Next to water buffalos bathing on the banks, private ambulance operators wash their vehicles with clanking buckets.On the approach road to the hospital, there is a huge pothole, and vehicles carrying patients often get stuck there. Outside the main doors, relatives sit with the bodies of their loved ones waiting for private ambulances to take them for burial or cremation.The workers who push the trolleys carrying incoming patients to the general emergency wards don’t know the history of the new arrivals, most of whom haven’t been tested yet for the virus. Often wearing only gloves as protective gear, the workers wheel them inside, take their oxygen levels and leave them on trolleys in the corridor, where some people are treated until they can find a bed.In the corridor, an exhausted woman rests her head on a wall as her husband’s blood sample is collected while he lies on a stretcher next to her. Inside one of the emergency wards, a woman drags her husband from a stretcher to his bed as their relative holds an IV bottle.Kumar tries to be visible, touring the wards to motivate patients and staff. But it’s a game of constant mental arithmetic. Patients expect to be seen by a senior doctor, but it isn’t always possible.“If I stand in front of a Covid patient for two minutes, and I see 20 patients, I have exposure for 40 minutes,” he says.With so few doctors, that kind of exposure is a risk he can’t often afford to take.Complaints from junior doctors are constant. During one meeting about a lack of medicines, Kumar promises them he will convince the government that more resources are needed. He later admits it will be difficult. Kumar weeps as he describes his worst moment since he took over, when a friend of his father who needs blood transfusions at regular intervals asked for help.“I had to say no, as we don’t have enough blood in the bank. We just have just a minimum for emergencies,” he says. He finds such refusals painful. “I don’t know how to say no to a patient.”COMING HOMEBorn in Bhagalpur, Kumar moved to the northern city of Chandigarh for his medical training, where he met his wife, Mili Jaswal, a psychologist.After marrying, the young couple moved to New Delhi, where they adopted a street dog, Faith.Kumar worked in a private hospital but couldn’t handle the culture.“Their orientation is how much financially you can give back to them,” he says. “It’s difficult for a doctor to work [like] this.”And so in 2011, Kumar, Mili and Faith boarded a train back to Bihar.“Financial security was a big factor, and I had my family here,” Kumar says.His 6-year-old daughter, Iti Swara, was born a few years later. He dotes on her.He recently had his two-bedroom government bungalow painted pink inside and out at her request. But these days, the hugs he gives his daughter each morning before he goes to work have changed. Now he has fear on his mind, not love.Mili worries that the long hours and stress of Kumar’s work are taking him away from their daughter.“When he is home, she wants to speak to him, but he can’t,” she says. “She wants to share her thoughts and play with him, but he is not able to.”Kumar watched cases in the district slowly rise over a number of months, but the call to take over the running of the hospital last month came suddenly. The previous hospital superintendent had tested positive for the virus, and to Kumar’s surprise, he says some of the more senior doctors refused the post. Attempts to get comment from the doctors were unsuccessful, but lower-ranking doctors at the hospital confirmed Kumar’s account, and an official letter from the previous superintendent cited one of the refusals.He thought about his extended family, whom he stopped visiting as the virus began to spread through the district. Who would run the hospital if they were admitted, if not him?“For the people of Bhagalpur and nearby districts, it was my responsibility,” he says. “That is why I raised my hand.”A PATIENT WAITSFear of the virus – and anger at the lack of resources – also haunts the patients and their relatives.One Sunday in July, Parsada Sah, a gaunt, 67-year-old shopkeeper, tested positive for the coronavirus in a village 50 kilometers from Bhagalpur. Sah, along with his wife, Vimla Devi, and son Manoj, reached the hospital in an ambulance that afternoon.Manoj showed his father’s positive test to the doctor on duty. He says he was told there were no beds in COVID wards, and was asked to find himself a bed in an already overcrowded 20-bed general emergency ward.“We were told that this is the only place we can have for now, as there is no space,” Manoj says. “We pleaded with them a lot. They told me that everyone wants a bed.”Even though they know he’s infected, the family goes inside the ward to feed Sah.“The staff just puts the food on the bed; they don’t feed anyone,” Manoj says. “If the patient can’t eat himself, he has to get someone to help.”Kumar says their concerns are genuine.“We don’t have separate staff for taking patients to washrooms or feed them,” he says. “The problem is, we don’t have enough human resources, from bottom to top.”BEARING WEIGHTEventually, almost a day later, a bed is found for Sah in the isolation ward. When he is moved, Sameer, a 22-year-old medical attendant sent to help with the transfer, hurriedly changes into his plastic overalls. Instead of protective goggles, he uses a pair of cheap sunglasses.He gestures to his overalls.“We only get these once we are moving positive patients from the general ward to a COVID ward.” Otherwise, he says, “we are the first people to receive a patient as they enter the gate, but we don’t have any protection.”After collecting an oxygen tank for the transfer, and fiddling with the cylinder for a few minutes inside the ward, Sameer and his colleague discover that it’s faulty. They take a new one, but the rusted trolley they mount it on barely moves. It screeches as the men try to drag it through the hospital corridors.The tube attached to Sah’s oxygen mask strains as Sameer tries to keep pace with the stretcher, with the man’s wife and son trailing behind.Eventually, the wheels of the trolley stop turning altogether. So Sameer hoists the hulking canister onto his shoulders, and bears the weight himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-doctor-standing-covid-19-pandemic-pushes-indian-hospital-to-brink/story-xObKeIJTKF2vkXSc1W2xzO.html
13-08-2020||India||No objection if SC transfers Sushant Singh Rajput’s case to CBI: Rhea Chakraborty||Actor Rhea Chakraborty told the Supreme Court on Thursday that she has no objection if it transfers the investigation into the death of her boyfriend and fellow actor Sushant Singh Rajput to the Central Bureau of Investigation in exercise of its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.However, such transfer at the behest of Bihar police is wholly without jurisdiction, she maintained in her written submissions filed before the top court. Article 142 is a special power vested in the Supreme Court empowering it to pass orders to do complete justice in a case before it.“The petitioner (Rhea Chakraborty) has no objection if the transfer of investigation to CBI is done in exercise of powers conferred upon this court (Supreme Court) under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Otherwise, the present transfer from Bihar Police to CBI as is done is totally without jurisdiction and contrary to law,” she said in her submissions.On August 11, the Supreme Court had reserved its verdict in Chakraborty’s plea seeking transfer of the case registered against her in connection with Rajput’s death, from Patna to Mumbai.Rajput was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14. The Mumbai Police found the cause of death as “asphyxia due to hanging”, and filed an accidental death report (ADR) but is yet to register an FIR in relation to the incident.Rajput’s father, KK Singh approached the Bihar police on July 25 accusing Rhea for abetting his son’s suicide. Chakraborty was in a live-in relationship with Rajput for a year till she shifted to her house on June 8.Patna police registered an FIR on July 25 based on Singh’s complaint for offences relating to abetment of suicide, cheating and criminal intimidation.Chakraborty moved the top court on July 29 challenging the jurisdiction of the Bihar police in the matter saying that the alleged crime took place in Mumbai and power to look into the matter is with Mumbai police.Meanwhile, CBI took over the probe on August 5 based on a request by the Bihar police.“FIR was registered by Bihar police based on an incident which has no connection with Patna. I have apprehension of bias and fear that state interference led to Bihar police registering a case. Patna police has absolutely no jurisdiction to register a case. This case is being used for political gains,” senior counsel Shyam Divan submitted on behalf of Chakraborty during the hearing on August 11.The court, while reserving its verdict, had given parties liberty to submit written submissions by Thursday.Chakraborty, in her written submissions, continued to maintain that Bihar police has no powers to investigate the matter and the transfer of the case to CBI by Bihar police is in violation of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DSPE Act).As per Section 6 of DSPE Act, consent of state government is necessary for CBI to exercise powers and jurisdiction in a case and the proper state government in this case is the Maharashtra government, she submitted.“Thus, the consent by the State of Bihar under Section 6 is bad in law and was given merely to render the present Petition infructuous (pointless),” she submitted.The Bihar government has consistently opposed Chakraborty’s plea stating that it was acting well within its powers because the Mumbai police had not registered any FIR or conducted any probe into the matter.“There is a complete lapse of investigation on part of Mumbai police. Bihar’s FIR is the only FIR in the matter. Allegation is against political class in Maharashtra which has stopped even registering of FIR,” the Bihar government maintained.The CBI and Rajput’s father had also supported the Bihar government’s stance which the Maharashtra government strongly contested stating that the incident happened in Mumbai and jurisdiction to probe the matter is with the Mumbai police.Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Maharashtra government, had contended on August 11 that allowing Bihar police to probe an incident which happened in Mumbai will be in the teeth of principles of federalism as per which law and order falls within the domain of a state where the cause of action arose.“Murder of the CrPc is being attempted in this case where jurisdiction is a casualty. If this is allowed, it will be a fundamental assault on federalism. I have not seen so much sensationalism attached to a transfer petition. And in that, truth and law have become casualties,” Singhvi argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-objection-if-sc-transfers-sushant-singh-rajput-s-case-to-cbi-rhea-chakraborty/story-4Rw5vtH9ihtZSH673G8kTK.html

A day earlier, on Wednesday, Delhi had reported 1,113 new Covid-19 cases with 14 patients succumbing to the viral disease. Consecutive dips in the number of new coronavirus cases reported in the national capital over the past week has led to hopes that the capital may have been able to flatten the coronavirus curve. Delhi had witnessed a huge surge in Covid-19 cases in the months of June and July.On June 23, the national capital had reported the highest single-day spike of 3,947 till date.Logging a record single-day increase of 66,999 cases, India’s Covid-19 tally climbed to 23,96,637 on Thursday, while the number of patients who have recovered from the disease surged to 16,95,982, pushing the recovery rate to 70.77 per cent in the country, according to Union health ministry data.The death toll due to the infectious disease mounted to 47,033 with 942 people succumbing to the infection in the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed.In a positive trend, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the country has declined to 1.96 per cent.There are 6,53,622 active Covid-19 cases in the country presently, which account for 27.27 per cent of the country’s total viral caseload.India crossed the 20-lakh mark in terms of Covid-19 patients on August 7. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a total of 2,68,45,688 samples were tested in the country till August 12, including 8,30,391 on Wednesday, the highest number of tests performed in a day.Of the 942 fresh deaths, 344 were reported from Maharashtra, 119 from Tamil Nadu, 112 from Karnataka, 93 from Andhra Pradesh, 54 each from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, 39 from Punjab, 18 from Gujarat, 15 from Madhya Pradesh, 14 from Delhi and 11 each from Telangana and Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sees-dip-in-covid-19-count-with-956-new-patients-14-deaths/story-VA9H8YN73pPWOlINA7EYBN.html
13-08-2020||India||‘Lies, half-truths’: India rebuts Pak charges on J&K, China’s media blanks it out||A Chinese state-controlled tabloid close to the ruling Communist party has refused to carry the Indian embassy’s response to an interview of Pakistani Ambassador where the diplomat repeated Islamabad’s “lies and half-truths” about J&K.Tweeting about the nationalistic Global Times tabloid refusing to carry the response, the Indian embassy said: “The Global Times @globaltimesnews declined to carry the Indian Embassy’s response to this interview.”The tabloid, which is affiliated to the Communist Party of China’s mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, did not give a reason for not carrying the Indian response to the interview.The Indian embassy had approached the tabloid to share its response on Kashmir but was told the tabloid will not run it; after having asked – and having received – the key points in India’s response.The refusal to carry New Delhi’s version of a sensitive issue in state-controlled media is in contrast to Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong’s wide access to media in India – he has written for mainstream newspapers, including Hindustan Times, and has been interviewed by the Press Trust of India, India’s largest news agency, on the border tension.Beijing and Islamabad are all-weather strategic allies and have close military ties.After being refused, the Indian embassy on Thursday tweeted the response originally meant for the tabloid as a rejoinder to Pakistani envoy Moin ul Haque’s interview.It was published under the headline ““Urgent actions on Jammu, Kashmir needed” last week, two days after August 5, one year of the abrogation of J&K’s special status.Haque, incidentally, was slated to serve as high commissioner to India but never took up the post because of New Delhi-Islamabad’s fraught ties in the past one year.The two-page response called out the unsubstantiated allegations made by Haque and said Pakistan’s Kashmir policy is a “rapacious campaign of cross-border terrorism”.“India’s concerted efforts to bring peace, stability and progress to J&K stand in stark contrast to Pakistan’s strategy, which is little more than a blatant and rapacious campaign of cross-border terrorism aimed at debilitating the region,” the embassy said.“It’s unprovoked ceasefire violations, numbering close to 3000 in the first seven months of 2020 alone, provide support for terrorist infiltration along the India-Pakistan Line of Control (LOC),” the Indian response added.The Indian embassy response pointed out that terrorists recruited, trained and armed by Pakistan have disturbed peace and order in J&K, with over 450 incidents of terrorist orchestrated violence taking place since August 2019, leading to several civilian casualties.“And it is in fact Pakistan that has repeatedly effected administrative and demographic changes in territories that it has occupied illegally and forcibly in J&K and Ladakh.”Terming the claims made by Haque to the Chinese state-controlled media outlet as “lies and half-truths”, the embassy wrote in its response: “Perhaps Ambassador Haque could consider holding up a mirror to his own “regime” and reflect on Pakistan’s own actions in the region before making ludicrous characterisations of the Indian government’s actions.”Besides levelling allegations, Haque told Global Times that Islamabad “…expects the global community to play the role of honest broker in the dispute and take concrete actions to ameliorate the sufferings of the Kashmiri people. We could only hope that the growing international condemnation would dissuade India’s fascist religious-nationalist regime from their illegal acts,” he said.On August 5, Pakistani media based in Beijing had raised the issue of the removal of Article 370 at a regular Chinese foreign ministry briefing.“China closely follows the situation in the Kashmir region. Our position is consistent and clear. This issue is a dispute left over from history between Pakistan and India. That is an objective fact established by UN Charter, security council resolutions and bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India. Any unilateral change to the status quo is illegal and invalid. This issue should be properly resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultation between the parties concerned,” spokesperson, Wang Wenbin had said.Wang had added that peaceful coexistence serves the fundamental interests of both and the common aspiration of the international community.“China hopes that they (India and Pakistan) can properly handle the differences through dialogue, improve relations and jointly safeguard peace, stability and development of both countries and the wider region,” Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-state-media-blanks-out-india-s-response-to-pak-charges-on-kashmir/story-MfKefbfTibB6gWD19e1UVO.html

13-08-2020||India||Air India pilots’ unions write to Hardeep Puri again for meeting over pay cuts||Two pilots’ unions - Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) and the Indian Pilots’ Guild (IPG) – wrote to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday requesting him to convene an urgent meeting over flight safety and working conditions of pilots of Air India, Air India Express and Alliance Air.The letter flagged the pilots’ pay cuts and said that flight safety and the working conditions of the pilots of Air India group companies cannot be seen in isolation in the background of the crash of an Air India Express flight in Kozhikode on August 7.“Pending the findings of the official investigations, may we highlight the fact that flight safety and the working conditions of the pilots of Air India group companies cannot be seen in isolation. The recently imposed policies implemented by the Air India Board imposing steep, disproportionate and retrospective pay cuts specifically targeting pilots across Air India as well as Air India Express and Alliance Air are one such example,” the letter said. It is the third time since July 27 that the pilots have sought a meeting with Puri. The two unions cautioned that burdening frontline workers with massive pay cuts to safeguard the senior management was “undesirable”.“Our pilots are constantly facing the challenges of Covid- 19, monsoon weather, ill designed Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL), several extensions and dispensations given by the DGCA. Trying to burden the frontline workers with massive pay cuts to safeguard the salaries and perks of senior management add an extra undesirable dimension to the equation.”The unions had earlier written to Puri on July 27 and August 1 seeking a meeting to discuss pay cuts which they say are unfair and discriminatory.“Aviation policy makers are creating a caustic work environment without any reproach or consequence. It is paramount that the safety of the travelling public is not compromised. In this you are our singular hope,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilots-unions-write-to-hardeep-puri-again-for-meeting-over-pay-cuts/story-WWzX8nANnGKdw10LdJLlxN.html
13-08-2020||India||PM Modi launches country’s first taxpayers’ charter promised in the budget||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday unveiled country’s first charter of taxpayers’ rights and duties and evoked a national appeal ahead of 74th Independence Day by asking citizens to introspect the fact that only 15 million in a population of 1.3 billion Indians actually pay income-tax.PM said taxation reforms in last six years are centred on three concepts -- seamless, painless and faceless – that have reduced complexities, cut tax rates and decreased number of litigations. It made the system more transparent, better compliant and trusting taxpayers, which helped in raising the number of income-tax return filers by 25 million. Currently, there are about 70 million income-tax returns filers.“This is a big increase. But we cannot ignore the fact that this [growth] is minuscule in a country of 130 crore. In such a large country, out of 130 crore only 1.5 crore friends deposit income-tax,” he said while launching the ‘Transparent Taxation- Honouring the Honest’ platform through video conferencing on Thursday. According to the finance ministry officials, the gap between total number of return filers (70 million) and actual taxpayers (15 million) is mainly because most of the people file zero tax returns.Also read: What is ‘faceless’ tax assessment? All you need to knowHe asked citizens to introspect and appealed those who could afford to pay tax. “Our introspection is necessary for ‘Atmnirbhar Bharat’ [Self-reliant India]... It’s 15 August after two days, remember those martyrs who sacrificed for Independence, then you will realise -- yes, I should also contribute something,” he said in Hindi.Experts said the taxation system is still complicated and intimidating that dissuades people to voluntarily come under its net. “The system of giving targets of revenue collection to officers must change,” said Daksha Bakshi, head of international tax at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.“We are yet to see measures for more tax payers to come forward. Perhaps measures of how people are going to be scrutinised on the basis of various information reports and transactions related data that the department has gathered needs to be made public for people to understand and assess the risk they face if they did not voluntarily come forward. Those who come forward voluntarily need to be pardoned for past lapses and not be persecuted,” she said.Also read: ‘Painless, seamless, faceless’: PM Modi says reforms will change how we pay taxesPM Modi said there is a remarkable change in the approach of the income-tax department, which is increasingly becoming taxpayer-friendly and the platform – ‘Honouring the Honest’ -- is the testimony. “This platform consists of major reforms such as faceless assessment, faceless appeal and taxpayers’ charters. The faceless assessment and the taxpayers’ charter have been implemented from today, while the facility for faceless appeal will be available to the people of the country from 25 September, which is the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji,” he said.While technology-driven faceless assessment system aims to end overreach by officials, the charter defines rights and responsibilities of taxpayers. According to the charter, the income-tax department is committed to provide prompt, courteous and professional assistance to the taxpayer. “The department shall treat every taxpayer as honest unless there is a reason to believe otherwise,” the charter said.According to the charter, the income-tax department shall collect correct amount of tax, respect privacy of the taxpayer, maintain confidentiality, reduce cost of compliance and publish standard for service delivery in a periodic manner. It also expects taxpayers to honestly disclose information, respond in time, pay taxes in a timely manner and keep themselves aware of compliance obligations.In her budget speech on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had mentined about a taxpayer’s charter as part of ‘ease of living’. “We wish to enshrine in the statutes a ‘taxpayer charter’ through this budget. Our government would like to reassure taxpayers that we remain committed to taking measures so that our citizens are free from harassment of any kind,” she had said.The faceless tax assessment system is, however, not new. It was first proposed by the Prime Minister in 2017 and received its mention in the first budget of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 5, 2019. The system was subsequently launched on October 7, 2019. Under the system random selection of tax cases are done through artificial Intelligence and machine learning, with a reduced discretion or no human interface from the income-tax department.The objective of the faceless assessment is to completely eliminate physical contact between the taxpayer and the taxman to make tax administration objective, transparent and corruption free. The system works under National Assessment Center (NeAC) headquartered in Delhi and eight Regional Assessment Centers (ReAC) located in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.PM Modi said, “Now, the tax system is turning faceless, but it promises fairness and fearlessness to the taxpayer.” This will end the era of “jaan pehchan” (familiarity) in getting tax scrutiny and notices settled. He said faceless assessment, faceless appeal and taxpayers’ charter are making the taxation system “people-centric and public friendly”, and the proposed faceless appeal aims at ease of compliance.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president Uday Kotak said, “A policy-driven governance based on digital interface minimises grey areas, eliminates discretion and promotes transparency and certainty. The government’s strong governance agenda instils confidence among Indian industry and will empower the taxpayer, provide a transparent system and honour honest taxpayers.”Experts want the government, particularly to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to focus on immediate issues such as refunds and timely disposal of pending matters. “These [the platform] are significant announcements from an Indian taxation perspective. However, having said this, it is expected that an overhauling of the tax department is also on the way and it is expected that the tax authorities would also ensure their deliveries within time,” SR Patnaik, partner and head of taxation at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said.Sudhir Kapadia, national tax leader at consultancy firm EY India said the launch of the platform will go a long way in ensuring ease of tax compliance’ for law abiding taxpayers. “As an immediate relief, it would be highly desirable if CBDT instructs release of all pending refunds to companies as quite a few companies are left with no choice but to consider approaching courts to expedite their refunds in these pandemic induced stressful business environment.”Bakshi hoped that the charter will be implemented in letter and spirit. “A lot needs to be done to streamline the issues faced by non- residents who invest in India and who are partnering for business in India. They need to have tax certainty. Almost every transaction of large amount ends up in litigation. If India wants to benefit from China plus one policy, taxation of non residents needs to undergo fundamental change,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-country-s-first-taxpayers-charter-promised-in-the-budget/story-2OrX12N5QLdRLIDhG9rC4M.html
13-08-2020||India||Maharashtra govt announces toll-tax waiver for people heading towards Konkan region for annual Ganesh Utsav||The Maharashtra government on Thursday announced a toll-tax waiver, akin to previous years, for the public heading towards the Konkan region during the annual Ganesh Utsav in their private vehicles. Minister for Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) Eknath Shinde announced that the toll-tax waiver would kick in two days prior to the Ganesh Utsav, which would be celebrated from August 22, and the relief would be in place two days after the 10-day festival ends. Shinde held a meeting via video-conference – owing to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak – with the minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai and other state officials to finalise the toll-tax waiver. Motorists will have to go to their local police station and register their details, including name, address, vehicle owners’ name, vehicle registration number, and the date of journey in a bid to avail of the toll-tax waiver that will be granted by the issuance of a sticker. Every year, thousands of people, who belong to Maharashtra’s Konkan region, visit their villages and towns in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts for the Ganpati festival. People heading to Konkan either use the Mumbai-Goa highway (National Highway-66) or go via the Mumbai Pune Expressway, or Pune-Kolhapur highway, which is a toll stretch. The total toll tax from Mumbai to Konkan is estimated to be between Rs 500 and Rs 600, depending on the type of vehicle. Shinde tweeted after the meeting that like previous years the state government has decided to waive off the toll tax. “In light of the Covid-19 outbreak, those travelling to Konkan will need to produce a Covid-19 negative report and an e-pass to travel,” he tweeted. The state government has also pressed into service more Maharashtra State Transport Road Corporation (MRSTC) buses to ferry people to Konkan during the festival. Passengers travelling via MRSTC buses will not need an e-pass, but will mandatorily need to undergo a Covid-19 test 48 hours prior to their journey.Only those whose Covid-19 test results come negative will be allowed to travel, as per the guidelines of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-announces-toll-tax-waiver-for-people-heading-towards-konkan-region-for-annual-ganesh-utsav/story-Md9VMEnBm3bQy5dPurMCgO.html

The video of the man dragging the boy on the street with his limbs tied with a rope and beating him with a stick went viral in the social media and was telecast in local television channels. The incident happened at Malkapur (A) village of Nizamabad Rural block on Wednesday morning. According to Nizamabad (Rural) police inspector Srinivasa Reddy, the 15-year old boy, who was studying Class 8, had been employed by Muddangula Balaiah in stone crushing work during the lockdown period. The boy’s father, a close relative of Balaiah, was also a stone cutter, but he had fallen sick in the recent past and so he had been sending his son for work in Balaiah’s stone crushing unit for the last couple of months. For the last few days, the boy had not showed up for work.“On Wednesday, Balaiah went to the boy’s residence and thrashed him indiscriminately for not coming to work regularly. He tied the boy’s limbs with a rope, dragged him on the streets and later tied him to an iron pole and beat him with a stick indiscriminately even as the boy was crying and pleading that he be let off,” the police inspector said. The boy was later rescued by Malkapur (A) village sarpanch Sekhar Goud and his deputy Venkat Reddy and handed over to his parents. On receiving the information, the police went to the village and took Balaiah into custody for questioning later in the evening. “We have booked a case against him under Section 324 (voluntarily hurting a person by dangerous weapons or means) and Section 341 (wrongful confinement). We shall produce him in the court for judicial remand,” the inspector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stone-crushing-unit-owner-in-telangana-ties-15-year-old-boy-thrashes-him-for-skipping-work/story-Kw9AaZfCEtr38U9oXwbEvM.html

13-08-2020||India||BJP MP to table private members bill on organ donation||New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Varun Gandhi said on Thursday he will introduce a private member’s bill proposing to make it compulsory for adults to be registered as organ donors to promote cadaver donation, though the measure won’t be coercive. People who don’t wish to donate organs will have the right to get themselves off the donors’ register under the Lok Sabha member’s “Donation and Transplantation of Human Organ Bill, 2020”. The bill is aimed at reducing deaths that occur because of a shortage of organ donors. It proposes to make it compulsory for all citizens above 18 years of age to be registered as organ donors unless an objection notice has been filed by a person. “I have come across many people, especially those who are not economically well off, who lost family members because they could not receive an organ donation. There are about 40 odd countries with registers for voluntary donation and we should look at something similar,” Gandhi said. In the proposed bill, which can only be taken up when Parliament resumes functioning for the monsoon session, Gandhi has pointed out India has a shortage of organ donors and there is a huge gap between demand and supply of organs. “There is a need for 200,000 kidneys, 50,000 hearts and 50,000 livers for transplantation every year. Lack of strong policies to make organ donation compulsory leads to the death of over 500,000 people every year in India,” he said. Stressing the voluntary nature of the proposed bill, he said people will have the liberty of taking their names off the register at any given time, and the process and data will be confidential. Gandhi said the measures proposed in the bill could save between 3.5 and 4.5 million lives annually. Apart from life-saving organs, there is a huge demand for corneas for the visually impaired. Citing data from the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation, Gandhi said organ donation in India is largely from living donors and the rate of organ donation from deceased is very low at 0.8 per million population, as compared to more than 30% in other countries. According to the Organ Retrieval Banking Organisation, only 22,500 people have registered for organ donation after death since 2010, and the total number of transplantations for all organs by living donors was 27,259, whereas the figure for cadavers was 1,448. “There will be a need to run an awareness campaign across the country, from the gram panchayat level upwards, so that people who are uninformed or uneducated can understand the idea behind the organ donation register,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-to-table-private-members-bill-on-organ-donation/story-OirnIptHaiE3ZYomFtAyZL.html
13-08-2020||India||Congress revokes suspension of 2 Rajasthan MLAs from Sachin Pilot camp ahead of key meet||Hours after Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot reiterated his “forgive and forget” mantra on Thursday with the rebels back in party fold, the Congress revoked the suspension of two MLAs who were suspended on July 17 following allegations that they were involved in a conspiracy to topple the state government.MLAs Bhanwar Lal Sharma and Vishvendra Singh were part of the rebel camp supporting former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.The suspension followed the leak of audio tapes with conversations allegedly between Bhanwar Lal Sharma, Sanjay Jain, an intermediary, and Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, which hinted at a conspiracy to bring down the government. “After a consultative discussion, the suspension of @INCRajasthan MLA Sh. Bhanwarlal Sharma ji and Sh. @vishvendrabtp ji is hereby revoked,” tweeted Avinahs Pande, Rajasthan Congress in-charge, shortly before the key Congress Legislature Party meet.Congress party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had told the media in July that the two MLAs would remain suspended until the veracity of the clips was ascertained. The move to revoke suspension follows the truce secured by Sachin Pilot with the Congress high command, ending his month-long rebellion against Gehlot. Speaking to HT, Vishvendra Singh, the former Rajasthan minister for tourism, said that the only thing rebels MLAs worried about was “self respect”, adding that they never disputed CM Gehlot’s leadership.“Our leader is Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. At the Centre, it is also Rahul Gandhiji and Priyanka Gandhji. At the state level, it is Mr. Gehlot since he is the CM and the head of the family … we have never disputed his leadership, neither has Mr. Pilot joined issue over it. Else, Mr. Pilot would not have settled for the deputy CM’s portfolio. Whoever the high command chooses is our leader,” said Vishvendra Singh. In another addition to the Rajasthan drama, the BJP announced late afternoon that it will move a no-confidence motion against the Ashok Gehlot government in the special assembly session starting tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-revokes-suspension-of-2-rajasthan-mlas-from-sachin-pilot-camp-ahead-of-crucial-party-meet/story-0ddYxVCOJNmbTQj4k2CZkL.html

13-08-2020||India||Rajasthan HC hearing on BSP MLAs merger to continue on Friday||The hearing in the Rajasthan high court on the merger of six BSP MLAs with the ruling Congress party remained inconclusive on Thursday and will continue on Friday. Two petitions were filed by the BSP and BJP legislator Madan Dilawar seeking disqualification of the six MLAs who merged with the Congress in September 2019. Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for the assembly Speaker said Kapil Sibal argued on behalf of the Speaker.“His contention was that the petitions were premature. Only the Speaker can decide a disqualification application. Only if he rejects it, the courts have the power of judicial review under article 226 of the Constitution,” said Kasliwal.He said that the matter is likely to be decided on Friday.“Arguments could not be completed today so the hearing has been posted to 10.20am on Friday. Kapil Sibal concluded his argument today. He relied upon the point that anybody can file a petition before the Speaker for seeking disqualification of a member of legislative assembly,” Ashish Sharma, counsel for Dilawar, said. He added that advocate Siddarth Luthra who represented one of the BSP MLAs started his argument when the court’s time was over. The court functions for half day on Thursday. “If the court tomorrow gives order in our favour then also whatever is done in the legislative assembly will be subject to outcome and the proceedings will have to be amended accordingly,” Sharma said.On July 29, the BSP had filed a petition seeking disqualification of six MLAs. On July 30, a similar petition was filed by Dilawar, which was tagged with that of the BSP. The six BSP members who had merged with the ruling party are Sandeep Yadav, Tijara MLA, Wajib Ali (Nagar), Deepchand Kheria (Kishangarh Bas), LakhanMeena (Karauli), Joginder Awana (Nadbai) and Rajendra Gudha (Udaipurwati).

13-08-2020||India||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Maharashtra didn’t lodge FIR due to political pressure, Bihar govt tells SC||Maharashtra Police neither registered an FIR on actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide nor did it extend any support to Patna Police for investigating the case on “account of political pressure”, the Bihar government told the Supreme Court on Thursday.The Bihar government and Rhea Chakraborty, against whom an FIR has been filed in Patna for allegedly abetting Rajput’s suicide, have filed their written submissions in the top court on the actress’ plea seeking transfer of the FIR to Mumbai.Chakraborty said that transfer of investigation to the CBI at the behest of Bihar Police was without the state’s jurisdiction in the case. Rajput, 34, was found dead at his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14 and since then Mumbai Police has been probing the case.The Bihar government, in its submission filed through its lawyer Keshav Mohan, said: “It is apparent that it is on account of political pressure in the State of Maharashtra that neither the FIR has been registered by the Mumbai Police nor did they extend any cooperation to Bihar Police in discharging their obligation to conduct investigation expeditiously.” The submission, settled by senior advocate Mainder Singh, said that nothing further is called for in the present Transfer Petition of Rhea and it deserved to be rejected or disposed of.“In the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is humbly submitted that no impediment would deserve to be allowed to come in the way of CBI to undertake and complete the investigation expeditiously,” the Bihar government said.On the other hand, Rhea submitted that Bihar had no jurisdiction to either to lodge an FIR or to transfer it.“It is submitted that the investigations in Bihar are totally illegal and such illegal proceedings cannot be transferred to CBI in the present manner by way of illegal executive orders. The Petitioner has no objection if the transfer of investigation to CBI is done in exercise of powers conferred upon this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. “Otherwise, the present transfer from Bihar Police to CBI as is done is totally without jurisdiction and contrary to law”.The apex court had on August 11 reserved its order on Chakraborty’s plea and asked the parties concerned to file their written submissions by Thursday.Rhea dealt with the legal provisions and said her transfer plea was maintainable.“Even on a reading of the FIR, no part of the offence has taken place in Bihar. Even the FIR alleges that all acts have happened only in Mumbai and as such Patna (Bihar) has only been mentioned owing to the Complainant’s residence being at Patna,” she said.“A plain reading of the subject FIR is clearly indicative of the fact that no such consequence of such alleged act has ensued within the State of Bihar,” she said.The maximum that may be done in such instance, is for the FIR to be registered as a “Zero FIR” and the same may be forwarded to the Police Station having jurisdiction over the matter, she said.The transfer of probe to CBI at the behest of Bihar police is “wholly without jurisdiction”, she said.However, the Bihar government referred to legal provisions and said that it had the jurisdiction as some of the consequences of the offence were there under its jurisdiction.It said: “The Mumbai Police had only been carrying out inquest proceedings u/s 174 / 175 CrPC...The proceedings are only for the purpose of ascertaining the “cause of death.“The proceedings come to an end on ascertaining the ‘cause of death’ and in any case, when the post-mortem report is received. In the present case, on receipt of the post-mortem report by Mumbai Police on June 25, the proceedings...came to a close.” Admittedly, no FIR has been registered by the Mumbai Police and hence it has not been carrying out any legal “investigation” as envisaged in law after receiving the postmortem report, it said.“This court had made observations regarding the said IPS Officer of Bihar police being incapacitated in the name of “quarantine’ – in the hearing... The State of Bihar had expected that the said IPS Officer would get relieved from “quarantine” immediately...” it said.It is a matter of anguish and pain that it had taken a time of almost 3 days for Maharashtra, which decided to relieve him only in the evening on August 7, it said.Rhea had tweeted to the Union Home Minister requesting for investigation by the CBI, the state government said, adding that now the CBI would be filing the report after investigating the case.It termed Rhea’s plea was not maintainable.On August 11, the Bihar government had the Supreme Court that “political clout” has not allowed Mumbai Police to even register an FIR in the Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide cas, even as the Maharashtra government maintained Bihar completely lacks jurisdiction in the matter.The FIR in Patna has been registered against Chakraborty and others for alleged offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 306 (abetment of suicide), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-maharashtra-didn-t-lodge-fir-due-to-political-pressure-bihar-govt-tells-sc/story-mYOwnuUVnf80bZiNQgHyJK.html

According to party leaders, former deputy CM Sachin Pilot and other dissidents MLAs are attending the crucial Congress Legislature Party meeting. A senior leader on condition of anonymity said that the there was no plan to call a CLP meet before the assembly session commenced, but looking at the changed political scenario with the return of dissident MLAs to the fold, the meeting was called on Thursday evening, hours before the assembly session is scheduled to begin on Friday. “Legislative assembly is beginning on August 14, I hope that during the session, we will be able to openly discuss the situation of coronavirus crisis in the state and the financial conditions created after the lockdown.

He repeated the mantra for the second time on Thursday in an attempt to bury the political crisis, which had threatened to topple his government in the state. Gehlot, had been locked in a bitter power struggle with his erstwhile deputy Sachin Pilot for several weeks now.“Whatever misunderstanding occurred in the party in the last one month, we need to forgive and forget in the interest of the country, the state, the people and in the interest of democracy,” Gehlot said in a tweet.ALSO READ | Rajasthan truce sealed, Ashok Gehlot talks ‘peace, brotherhood’ in partyThe Congress crisis in Rajasthan ended with the intervention of the party top brass, chief Sonia Gandhi, senior leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who met rebel leader Sachin Pilot earlier this week.Pilot had openly rebelled against Gehlot last month along with 18 other Congress MLAs. He was then sacked as deputy chief minister and the party’s Rajasthan unit chief.Earlier, the Rajasthan chief minister had also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of trying to poach Congress legislators, in a bid to destabilize his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-jaipur-clp-meeting-to-held-at-cm-gehlot-s-residence-today-ahead-of-assembly-session/story-Ril8jTgjgoKPd1uEw3QmJN.html

The Additional Sessions Court Judge read out to Mulakkal, who was present in the court, the charges under various sections of the IPC including the punishment for offence for rape as it commenced trial proceedings in the sensational case.The accused denied the charges against him.The case was posted for September 16 for the victim’s examination.He has been charged under various sections of IPC including 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 377 (Unnatural Sex), 376 (c)(a) Sexual intercourse by person in authority 376(2)(k) (indulging in sexual intercourse by exhorting authority), and 506 (criminal intimidation). Last week, the Bishop was granted bail by the court with stringent conditions and directed him to be present on the dates of hearing of the case. The Supreme Court had directed Mulakkal to face trial as it dismissed his plea seeking discharge in the rape case lodged against him by the nun belonging to a congregation under Jalandhar diocese, saying there was no merit in his petition. Mulakkal, in his plea had challenged the July 7 Kerala High Court order, dismissing his discharge plea in the rape case filed by the nun. The High Court had asked the deposed Bishop of Jalandhar diocese to stand for trial in the rape case.The senior priest of the Roman Catholic Church had filed the revision petition following the dismissal of his discharge plea by a trial court in March this year.The rape case against the Bishop was registered by police in Kottayam district. In her complaint to the police in June 2018, the nun had alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by the bishop during the period between 2014 and 2016. The bishop was arrested by the Special Investigation team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-court-frames-charges-against-rape-accused-ex-bishop-franco-mulakkal/story-qgBaK9JdY1pCLmthIauOQK.html

The arms and ammunition were recovered from the arrested accused’s possession, they added. “The arrested accused, identified as Shankar Lal Vaishnav, is a Group-D employee, who was posted at Lokayukta office in Raipur. He was arrested from Ghodari chowk on NH (national highway)-53 on Wednesday evening,” said Prafull Thakur, superintendent of police (SP), Mahasamund. Vaishnav, a native of Jodhpur in Rajasthan, stays at Kashiram Nagar, Raipur, the police said. He has been booked under the relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and the Arms Act, 1959, the police said, Vaishnav was allegedly looking for customers to sell the contraband drugs in Mahasamund, when the police arrested him. “Vaishnav was found to be carrying 730 grams of brown sugar on him, when he was arrested,” the SP said. “The brown sugar is suspected to be smuggled from Pakistan via Rajasthan. Another person is likely to be involved in the drug-smuggling racket. Vaishnav, too, has confessed to his Pakistan links,” the SP added. Chhattisgarh Police authorities, who are interrogating Vaishnav, will hand him over to the state’s Anti-terrorist Squad (ATS) for further investigation in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/c-garh-man-held-with-brown-sugar-worth-rs1-46-crore-in-mahasamund/story-KsVFyVozH3LVpQ8ZlxbehN.html
13-08-2020||India||India unveils economic aid package for Maldives, including $500 mn connectivity project and cargo service||India on Thursday unveiled a $500-million package to help the Maldives build a connectivity project linking its capital Male with three islands, and provided $250 million as budgetary support to help the Indian Ocean archipelago cope with the Covid-19 crisis. A new cargo ferry service will be launched between the two countries, and people familiar with developments said this will help India replace other countries to become the Maldives’ top trade partner. An air travel bubble between the two sides will become operational from August 18, and India also renewed quotas for supplying essential commodities to the Maldives during 2020-21. The measures were announced during a virtual meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Maldives counterpart Abdulla Shahid. Responding to a request from the Maldives, Jaishankar announced India’s decision to back the Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP) through a package comprising a grant of $100 million and a new line of credit for $400 million. India’s total financial commitment in the Maldives is more than $2 billion, with all loan and grant projects being announced after President Ibrahim Solih came to power in November 2018 and put in place his “India first” policy, the people cited above said. Thursday’s announcements to help the Maldives came against the backdrop of concerted efforts by India to boost economic aid and connectivity with key neighbours amid the border standoff with China. Last month, India handed over 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh, reflecting a renewed focus on its “neighbourhood first” policy. This came close on the heels of the first cross-border container train reaching Bangladesh with 50 containers of FMCG goods and fabrics and the first shipment of container cargo from Kolkata to Agartala in the landlocked northeastern region via Bangladesh’s Chattogram port. India also announced a $400-million currency swap facility for Sri Lanka under the Saarc framework last month, and Colombo’s request for a bilateral swap facility for $1.1 billion is being considered by New Delhi. India earlier provided $400 million through an extended currency swap arrangement to the Maldives to tide over a liquidity shortage. Jaishankar noted on Thursday that GMCP will be the largest civilian infrastructure project in the Maldives, connecting Male with the islands of Villingili, Gulhifahu, where a port is being built under an Indian line of credit, and Thilafushi, where a new industrial zone is coming up. Male and the islands will be linked by a bridge-and-causeway link spanning 6.7km, and the people said the project will easily overshadow the 1.39-km Maldives-China Friendship Bridge, currently the most visible infrastructure project in Male, and help in demonstrating India’s overarching presence in the region. “Once completed, this landmark project will streamline connectivity between the four islands, thereby boosting economic activity, generating employment and promoting holistic urban development in the Male region,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Jaishankar recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in the Majlis, or Maldivian parliament, in June last year to start a ferry service between the two sides and announced that a direct cargo ferry service will begin shortly to enhance trade and connectivity and boost the economic partnership. The cargo service will “provide predictability in supplies for importers in Maldives and exporters in India” and reduce logistics costs and times, he said. An air travel bubble between India and the Maldives to facilitate the movement of people from both sides for employment, tourism and medical emergencies will also be created, Jaishankar said. “In keeping with our special ties, Maldives is the first neighbouring country with which an air bubble is being operationalised. The air bubble symbolises India’s support to shore up tourism arrivals and revenues in the Maldives,” the statement said. While fulfilling India’s commitment under the bilateral Trade Agreement of 1981, Jaishankar said New Delhi will renew quotas for supplying essential commodities, such as potatoes, onions, rice, wheat, flour, sugar, dal, eggs, and river sand and stone aggregates, to the Maldives for 2020-21. The quotas will assure food security and the supply of essential construction items, and provide certainty and price stability for these goods in the Maldives. Jaishankar said an in-principle decision has also been made to extend urgent financial assistance to the Maldives through a soft loan arrangement. The modalities for this are being finalised by the two sides. Jaishankar and Shahid took stock of bilateral relations and “noted with satisfaction that the Covid-19 pandemic has not been able to slow down the pace of bilateral cooperation”, the statement said. Jaishankar assured the government of Solih that India “stood by its close maritime neighbour and friend in difficult times”. The Maldives has been the largest beneficiary of India’s Covid-19-related assistance among neighbours. When the pandemic disrupted supply chains, India supplied essential food and construction materials to the Maldives, including 580 tonnes of food items gifted in May. Shahid expressed appreciation for the steps taken by India to meet the development priorities of his government. He described GMCP as a new milestone in bilateral ties that will “anchor the economic and industrial transformation of the Maldives”. Solih tweeted: “A landmark moment in Maldives-India cooperation today as we receive Indian assistance of USD250 million as budget support and USD500 million for the Greater Malé Connectivity Project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-unveils-economic-aid-package-for-maldives-including-500-mn-connectivity-project-and-cargo-service/story-akbiRnuSd4hSzdsRHFZt9H.html

Also, no one was coming forward to help the family, suspecting him to be infected by the coronavirus.“After getting to know about it, I was only thinking that how can we let a person suffer like this. I asked two- three party workers to arrange a bike and rushed to a pharmacy and bought the PPE. Then I went to his house in Sijua village on Monday,” Patnaik said.“Barik’s wife and his two children were tense about his condition. His wife repeatedly pleaded to go to the hospital with him. However, I convinced her and took him to the Gopiballavpur Superspeciality Hospital on the bike,” he added.The doctors there examined Barik, prescribed some medicines and asked him to stay at home.Patnaik then took Barik to his home, about 3 km away from the hospital.A video of Patnaik, riding the bike wearing a PPE, and carrying Barik to the hospital has gone viral on social media.“I want to stand with the people amid this pandemic. I have ordered four more personal protective equipment (PPE), in case I need it again,” Patnaik said.Former Lok Sabha member from Jhargram and TMC spokesperson Uma Soren said the party’s youth workers are always ready to help the people.“In case of any need, people should reach out to us and we will be there with them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-wears-ppe-takes-man-with-covid-19-symptoms-to-hospital/story-4ZEH2xaIAULRuXzV9gzxIK.html

Self-reliance in the defence sector is far more crucial than any other field. For the last six days, you have been doing the important work of modernisation of facilities, upgradation of facilities and construction of new infrastructure, continuously moving towards ‘self-reliance’,” Singh said while addressing the participants via video conferencing.“Security is its first priority for the development of any nation. It is known to all of us that the nations, which are able to protect themselves, they have been able to build their strong image at the global level. We cannot depend on foreign governments, foreign suppliers and foreign defence products to meet our defence needs. It is not compatible with the objectives and feelings of a strong and ‘self-reliant India’,” Singh added.Defence minister lauded the efforts of defence public sector undertakings (PSUs) and Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to make India self-reliant.“The impressive list of new indigenous products, which have been launched today, I believe that defence undertakings and OFB will be the prime drivers of the ‘Self-Reliance Campaign’ and will contribute significantly to national security. I am happy to see the recently launched products, of which four products each by OFB and BEML, two by BEL and one each by HAL, BDL, MDL, GRSE and GSL were developed,” he said.“The products and facilities will help not only in defence but also for the betterment of civil society. The Electric Dump Truck launched by BEML and the Super Giant Mining Excavator are both designed and manufactured indigenously. It will also cater to the needs of Electric Dump Truck Mining Industries,” he added.As part of ‘Atmanirbhrata Saptah’ celebrations, various defence PSUs and OFB are also organising a series of webinars covering all relevant topics, including various stakeholders like industry experts, vendors and academia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-reliance-in-defence-sector-is-far-more-crucial-than-any-other-field-rajnath-singh/story-UtBWXtjeMTtQJjnXiDCc7K.html

Now, all three cubs are in good spirits,” he added. Established in 1957 and spread over 175 hectares in the middle of Guwahati in the Hengrabari reserve forest, Assam state zoo, which has 1,040 wild animals and birds of 112 species, is the biggest zoological park in the north-east region. “The lion cub, which was born to Vicky and Rani, has been named Simba after the character in the movie Walt Disney musical drama, The Lion King. The tiger cubs were born to Dhanush and Kazi,” said Mariswamy. “The male tiger cub is named Sultan. However, we are yet to decide on Sultan’s sister’s name. We are looking for a name that children could relate to. All suggestions from the public are welcome,” he added. Though the zoo is a big attraction among the public in Guwahati and others across the north-east, it has been closed since March due to the viral outbreak. “We have been kept busy, even though the zoo is off-limits for the public. A male golden langur, a rare species, was also born during the lockdown period,” said Mariswamy. There is no immediate plan to reopen the zoo anytime soon, despite the fact that lockdown restrictions have been largely eased across the most-populous and Covid-19 worst-hit state in the north-east.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-assam-state-zoo-welcomes-simba-sultan-and-his-sister/story-mMECfJY4xhFx5yGAfiH1YN.html
13-08-2020||India||CM Ashok Gehlot repeats ‘forgive and forget’ mantra, twice in 2 days||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who now faces the arduous task to welcoming his sacked deputy Sachin Pilot, channelled the “forget and forgive” spirit on Thursday - for the second time in as many days - adding it is time to “move forward” and put a lid on the unsavoury rebellion in the state unit that threatened the survival of his government.Sachin Pilot, who secured a truce deal with Congress high command that also promised a panel to look into his grievances, is expected to meet CM Gehlot at a Congress Legislature Party meeting scheduled later today. “The struggle of Congress party is to SaveDemocracy under leadership of Smt SoniaGandhi ji & RahulGandhi ji. Whatever misunderstanding occurred in the party in last one month, we need to forgive & forget in the interest of country, state, ppl & in the interest of democracy. We have to put all our energies in this fight to save democracy with the spirit of forgive & forget and move forward,” tweeted CM Gehlot today. The tweet does indicate a softening of stance, as the CM had used particularly harsh words against his deputy, calling Pilot “nikkamma, nakkara” as the feud between the two intensified over the period of one month. On the other hand, Sachin Pilot only raised questions on the CM’s working style, and never got personal. Directly accused by the CM of being hand-in-glove with the BJP to topple his government, Pilot underscored that he is with the Congress and such statements are being made to tarnish his image. Pilot, who returned to Jaipur on Tuesday after ending his month-long rebellion, said he has not demanded any post from the party. Asked to comment on the jibes used by the CM, Pilot, in an interview to HT, said he was “deeply hurt by some of the language used against me”. On his meeting with CM, the 42-year-old leader said has nothing but only kind words to offer, adding there is no animosity, no ill-will, no negative sentiment towards CM Gehlot.On Wednesday, Gehlot said the resentment among the Congress lawmakers is natural about the rehabilitation of the 19 dissident party legislators, but he managed to placate the legislators as he explained to them that it was a bid to save democracy in the desert state. He asked them to forgive, forget and move on.Gehlot impressed upon the legislators that sometimes politicians have to take the rough with the smooth in the interests of the public and democracy.“Forget and forgive and move on in the interest of the country, the state, the people of the state and democracy. Democracy in under threat. This was a fight to save democracy, in which our MLAS gave their support,” Gehlot had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-ashok-gehlot-repeats-forgive-and-forget-mantra-twice-in-2-days/story-aohZDtS282nx22F0UdP2IO.html

The company’s accounts was ordered to be frozen by the ED on July 13. The order further said that no withdrawals will be allowed without the permission of the agency.Aggarwal argued before the high court that the business of the company has been affected due to ED’s action and it is not able to perform its day-to-day business, both as regards to payments to be made and the orders to be performed.He further argued that the action has been taken when it is not even known whether a scheduled offence has been registered or not and that ED has not supplied to the company “reasons to believe” to freeze the bank account.The ED said that the action has been taken on request of Brazil and India is under obligation to act as there is a reciprocal agreement between the two countries. Brazilian authorities had requested India to freeze these 67 accounts in which funds linked to a provincial governor have been transferred.The agency claimed that Brazil provincial governor (whose name has been withheld by the ED) was involved in embezzlement of funds to over 50 countries, including India.Apart from Hamilton Housewares, accounts of eight more companies, namely JK Tyre, KP Sanghvi & Sons, Nancy Crafts Pvt Ltd, Bharat Fashion and Apparels, Eastman Industries Ltd, Orbit Exports Ltd, Shrenuj & Co and RSWM Ltd were frozen by the ED last month in Brazil probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/67-indian-bank-accounts-under-scanner-over-embezzlement-fraud-in-brazil-frozen-by-ed/story-tYzhpGVBWJWnGechqAzBeI.html

The Union health ministry said in a statement on Thursday that its main role for containing Covid-19 has been in strengthening health infrastructure to fight the pandemic and its effective management. “Along with augmenting Covid-19 facilities, the Union Government has been providing medical supplies free of cost to the State/UT governments to supplement their efforts. Most of the products supplied by Government of India were not being manufactured in the country in the beginning. The rising global demand due to the pandemic resulted in their scarce availability in the foreign markets,” it said.

The Centre is also ensuring their installation and commissioning,” the statement said. At least 108 million hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets were distributed as the anti-malaria drug is being given as a prophylactic to prevent infections, and also for treating early cases of Covid-19 that are mildly or pre-symptomatic. “From a handful of companies initially, the country now has at least about 50-odd domestic manufacturers who are into producing these essential supplies; and we are so comfortable placed in terms of meeting country’s demands that the supplies can now also be exported to other countries. Some automobile manufacturers have also shared their production lines in this hour of need to manufacture ventilators to manage seriously ill Covid-19 patients,” a senior health ministry official in the know of things said on condition of anonymity.

But since there are cases pending before your lordship entangled with this matter, we will approach at a later stage,” Rajeev Dhavan told a three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.The Supreme Court agreed but on the condition that the petitioners will not approach the Supreme Court at a later stage raising the same issue. The bench said that they could move the High Court later. Dhavan agreed and the court allowed him to withdraw the case.Ram, Bhushan and Shourie had challenged section 2(1)(c) of Contempt of Courts Act which criminalises publication of any matter that could scandalise or lower authority of courts. They contended that the provision is violative of freedom of speech under Article 19 of the Constitution. The listing of the case had caused a major controversy because of pendency of two criminal contempt cases against one of the petitioners, Prashant Bhushan before a bench of Justice Arun Mishra. The petition by Ram, Shourie and Bhushan was, however, initially listed before a bench of justice DY Chandrachud.The Supreme Court then sought an explanation from registry officials on the ground that the fresh petition should have also been posted before Justice Arun Mishra since the three petitioners had sought a stay on proceedings against Bhushan in other contempt cases. Eventually, the matter was deleted from the bench of Justice Chandrachud and posted before Justice Arun Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-prashant-bhushan-arun-shourie-n-ram-to-withdraw-plea-on-contempt-law/story-GMs6TftDA4iYO6iUMvNhRN.html

Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted that it was the outcome of over 1.43 lakh tests done across the state on Wednesday with a positivity rate of 3.2%. “We have been continuously stepping up our Covid-19 testing.

The state has recorded 68,999 Covid-19 cases until Thursday morning, including 47,209 recoveries and 161 deaths.

13-08-2020||India||BJP boosts membership drive in poll-bound Bengal as TMC welcomes deserters||The Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday gave a fresh boost to its membership drive using new slogans and photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media while the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) focused on the return of turncoats who switched over to the saffron camp in the rural belts. Fifteen BJP leaders, including Union ministers of state (MoS) Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, several Lok Sabha members and national joint-general secretary Shivprakash, who is in charge of West Bengal, tweeted on Wednesday, highlighting different issues and asking people to join the BJP. The flurry of activity did not appear to be a routine one, political observers said. Following TMC chief Mamata Banerjee’s July 21 call to deserters to return home, the TMC, in the last two weeks, managed to ensure defections in some pockets where the BJP has risen significantly since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which it won 18 of the state’s 42 seats. Also read: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee gets 2nd office as precaution amid Covid concernsThe BJP grew exponentially in north Bengal and won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019 while the Congress, despite its limited presence, bagged one seat. The BJP has also grown in the western districts of Purulia, Bankura and Midnapore where its popularity among tribal people, who comprise a big chunk of voters, pose a challenge to the TMC before the crucial 2021 assembly polls. The TMC lost the Purulia Lok Sabha seat to the BJP in 2019. The panchayat polls in Purulia were also marked by violence in 2018. The TMC also lost the Midnapore and Bishnupur (in Bankura district) Lok Sabha seats. The TMC on Wednesday announced that in Purulia district, the BJP’s former president and vice president of the Baghmundi unit joined the ruling party. Baghmundi is a tribal area. On August 9, Baliram Ekka, who unsuccessfully contested the Mal assembly seat for the BJP in north Bengal’s Jalpaiguri district, returned to the TMC along with his followers. “I was unhappy with the BJP ever since I joined it. Didi (Mamata Banerjee) did a lot for the welfare of local tea garden workers. I decided to return,” Ekka said. On the same day, Jaidev Purkait, a former CPI (M) leader from Canning in the South 24 Parganas district, joined the TMC along with some booth-level workers of the BJP. On August 3, Sandip Ekka, a BJP leader from Kalchini in north Bengal’s Alipurduar district joined the TMC along with the heads of six gram panchayats and eight BJP office-bearers. On July 31, Biswarup Ghosh, president of BJP’s Berhampore town unit in Murshidabad district and two local leaders from South Dinajpur district in north Bengal joined the TMC. The TMC announced these defections on social media, giving credit to the “able leadership” of the chief minister. The BJP state leadership says it is not giving any importance to these incidents. “TMC is desperate to project before the media that erosion has started in the BJP before the elections. The fact is that none of these people are heavyweight leaders. Moreover, if 50 people are returning to the TMC, 500 are joining the BJP to replace them. Our numbers are growing by leaps and bounds,” said Rahul Sinha, BJP national secretary. “None of these people returned to the TMC willingly. They faced threats and intimidation,” Sinha added. TMC veteran and minister of state (MoS) for parliamentary affairs Tapas Roy alleged that the BJP central leadership’s “stepfather-like attitude” towards people of West Bengal disillusioned the turncoats. “Those who came back could not tolerate the BJP’s culture anymore. The defections have nothing to do with the coming elections. They would have left the BJP even if there was no election,” said Roy. Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay observed that the TMC has used the Covid-19 lockdown to engineer the exodus since the BJP leaders cannot work on the ground. “During a pandemic, a state’s ruling party will always enjoy some advantage. It is easier for TMC leaders and workers to work on the field. BJP leaders should be working at the grassroots level to stop this exodus but their movement is restricted,” said Bandopadhyay. TMC leaders said Banerjee is especially keen on getting youths and tribal people back from the BJP camp. On 9 August, chief minister Banerjee tweeted, “Today is #InternationalAdivasiDay. #Bengal Govt launched Jai Johar scheme to help our brothers & sisters belonging to scheduled tribes. We have also given recognition to Ol Chiki script & Santhali language as medium. We are committed to welfare of all sections of society.Jai Johar.” On Wednesday, she tweeted, “Today is #InternationalYouthDay. #GoWB is committed to empowering the youth. A new scheme ‘Karma Sathi Prakalpa’ was launched by #Bengal Govt. One lakh unemployed youth will be provided soft loans and subsidies to make them self-reliant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-boosts-membership-drive-in-poll-bound-bengal-as-tmc-welcomes-deserters/story-CY9TBZVJrk26RXM4aKEX4L.html

HC made the observation while disposing of a bail application of Krushna Pada Mandal, who is accused in a Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, case. Justice SK Panigrahi observed that the physician community at large must walk an extra mile and make conscious efforts to write prescriptions in good handwriting, preferably in capital letters. “While there could be some good justifications for sloppy handwriting (by doctors) due to heavy work pressure, long working hours, writer’s cramp and due to adverse the patient-doctor ratio in the country at large and also in Odisha, the medical professionals should protect themselves by exercising this basic care and caution from the looming threat of allegations of medical negligence. Perhaps, the capital letters could ensure proper visibility to the prescriptions and will remove the guesswork and related inconveniences. The digital era could also throw open several options to make prescriptions and the diagnosis more patient-friendly,” Justice Panigrahi said while granting bail to the accused in the NDPS case. Mandal, who is lodged in a jail in Berhampur, had filed a bail application seeking release to take care of his wife, who is suffering from gynecological, cardio-vascular and haematological complications. Mandal had applied for an interim bail to get her treated, as she lives alone in Berhampur town in Ganjam district. However, during the verification of the medical documents of Mandal’s wife, the court found the handwriting of a doctor’s prescription to be illegible. “The documents were far beyond the comprehension of any common man or even for the court. Such illegible handwriting in medical records has the propensity to have adverse medico-legal implications,” the order said. HC also referred to the circular, issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) in September 2016, which had said every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names and preferably in capital letters and ordered the chief secretary of Odisha to examine the feasibility of issuing appropriate circulars to implement the Council’s circular. “The objective of such notification is that writing names of medicine in capital letters ensures that doctors, who have poor running handwriting, can compensate for their deficiency by writing in capital letters. Appropriate steps may be taken to create awareness among the medical professionals, involved in medico-legal cases, to record their observations and comments in a legible manner,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/write-names-of-drugs-and-dosages-in-capital-letters-orissa-hc-advises-doctors/story-eoKHgfYGnZO74WBuhuQnfI.html
13-08-2020||India||Covid-19: Crucial test in Mumbai slums brings focus on debate around herd immunity||As Mumbai’s civic body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, gets ready to conduct the second round of serological survey, experts are divided over whether the residents of the city’s slums are approaching herd immunity for coronavirus disease, Covid-19. In the first sero survey conducted in July, BMC found that a total of 57% individuals from the city’s slums and 16% from other residential areas in three wards were exposed to Sars-CoV-2 and recovered silently owing to the antibodies produced. Individuals in both these groups were asymptomatic. In the second survey, authorities will check if the presence of antibodies has declined or increased in the same set of people that were part of the first survey.According to experts, the march of an infectious disease such as Covid-19 can be halted only when there is a large enough proportion of the population that is immune to it – a threshold known as herd immunity. Besides a vaccine, the only way people become immune is if they have had the disease and recovered.Jayaprakash Muliyil, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of National Institute of Epidemiology, believes that Mumbai’s slums may have acquired herd immunity. “Mumbai’s slums may have reached herd immunity,” said Muliyil according to a Bloomberg report quoted in a CNN article. “If people in Mumbai want a safe place to avoid infection, they should probably go there.”However, some other scientists are more cautious. The CNN article quoted David Dowdy, an associate professor in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, as saying it was possible that the researchers had used a test that created false positives.The article also quoted Om Shrivastav, a Mumbai-based infectious diseases expert, as saying that with less than eight months into the virus’ existence in society, it was too early to make any “decisive and conclusive statements”India’s health ministry has also said that herd immunity is “far away” for the Indian population. “In a country with the size of the population like India, herd immunity cannot be a strategic choice or option. It can only be an outcome, and that too at a very high cost as it means lakhs of people would have to be infected, get hospitalised and many would die in the process,” Rajesh Bhushan, the officer on special duty, health ministry, said last month.David Dowdy, too, says that millions of people will die in the process of developing herd immunity in a population.“We could very rapidly develop a population immunity to the coronavirus simply by exposing every single person in the population to the disease ... it’s just that millions and millions of people are going to die in the process,” Dowdy was quoted as saying in the CNN article. Meanwhile, Mumbai recorded 1,132 new infections, taking the city’s tally to 126,356. Mumbai also recorded 50 new fatalities, pushing the toll to 6,943, while also crossing the 1 lakh mark in recoveries on Wednesday. Now, the city has 19,047 active cases.India saw its Covid-19 tally jump by 66,999 new cases - highest single-day spike - on Thursday which pushed the number of cases to nearly 2.4 million.The country recorded 942 fresh fatalities in the last 24 hours, which pushed the death toll due to the disease to 47,033.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-mumbai-slums-residents-found-covid-19-positive-experts-divided-on-herd-immunity/story-IzFXUx8mYapbIUeiuDrDXO.html

Around 24 cows and calves were being carried in a container truck on a national highway when it was intercepted at Hoshangabad, 70 kilometres south of Bhopal, on Tuesday night. In the other incident, six cows, locked in a room for more than 3 days, were found dead in a village in Shivpuri district, 312 kilometres north of Bhopal, on Tuesday evening, according to police. The container truck was on its way from Nagpur side when it stopped at Sulia fatak in Hoshangabad city on Tuesday night.

Its affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch has been at the forefront of a campaign to boycott Chinese products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmanirbhar-rashtriya-swayamsevak-sangh-rss-bjp-make-in-india-rajnath-singh-swadeshi-does-not-necessarily-mean-boycotting-all-foreign-products-bhagwat/story-IRsvY8oH41T9kQyQHsdCNP.html
13-08-2020||India||With announcement, Kamala Harris’ India views now in focus||With the Democratic Party criticising the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the situation in Kashmir and the communal violence in New Delhi earlier this year, India’s foreign policy mandarins will be keeping a close eye on presumptive vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ views on these issues.Harris, who has roots in India on her mother’s side and in Jamaica on her father’s side, is the first woman of Indian and African descent to run for the post of vice president. Like most other key leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties, she has batted for stronger India-US relations.As her maternal uncle Gopalan Balachandran pointed out on Wednesday, Harris hasn’t let her Indian roots come in the way of criticising India on human rights issues. She was, he said, “more worried about the broader implications” and “the philosophy behind” such issues.During her unsuccessful campaign to become the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate last year, Harris had said that the US was watching the situation in Kashmir after the scrapping of the erstwhile state’s special status and that she would strive to lead while upholding the values the US is known for, including speaking out against “human rights abuses”.Asked about the possible role the US could play following last year’s lockdown in Kashmir and the human rights situation there, she replied: “It is about reminding people that they are not alone, that we are all watching.” After external affairs minister S Jaishankar declined to attend a meeting last year with the House Foreign Affairs Committee because of the presence of Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who had moved a resolution in the House of Representatives on the situation in Kashmir, Harris extended strong support to the lawmaker who, like her, has roots in Tamil Nadu. Harris tweeted: “It’s wrong for any foreign government to tell Congress what members are allowed in meetings on Capitol Hill. I stand with @RepJayapal, and I’m glad her colleagues in the House did too.” Harris has also been critical of US President Donald Trump’s handling of China, with which India is currently locked in border standoff. Before she called off her campaign for the presidential candidacy last year, Harris had said “China’s abysmal human rights record must feature prominently in our policy toward the country”. “We can’t ignore China’s mass detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims in ‘re-education camps’ in the Xinjiang region, or its widespread abuse of surveillance for political and religious repression,” she had said. “We can’t ignore Beijing’s failure to respect the rights and autonomy of Hong Kong’s people and the Hong Kong government’s excessive use of force against peaceful protestors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-announcement-kamala-harris-india-views-now-in-focus/story-0l91o7ASFd907JjcmBBxIN.html
13-08-2020||India||Shah Faesal reached out to NSA before he quit party; open to IAS return||Bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal, who left the party he himself founded, quit only after making contact with top officials in the Union government. Faesal had a talk with National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval before informing his party colleagues in the Jammu & Kashmir People’s Movement (JKPM) that he was leaving, HT has learnt.Faesal, 37, who hits the headlines in 2009, when he became the first person from Kashmir to top the Indian Administrative Services exam, acknowledged that he has been in touch with officials in New Delhi, although he declined to specify details.“There has been a lot of speculation about the conversations I’m having with people in the government. I have been a member of IAS, and it’s nothing strange if I’m meeting people in the government,” he said. “I have to live and work here and this is perfectly normal,” he added. The NSA was not available for comment.Faesal suggested that he is not opposed to rejoining the service, and there is talk that he could be reinstated.Faesal, who once promised to be the voice of Kashmir’s young people has come a long way. His views, too, have changed. “I think we need to understand that in 1949 national consensus was about incorporating Article 370 and the 2019 national consensus is about scrapping it. We have to understand the mood of the nation and come to terms with the reality.”Early in 2019, Faesal announced his resignation from the IAS and became a vocal critic of the government. Jammu & Kashmir was stripped of its special status in August last year, and at the time, he tweeted: “Kashmir will need a long, sustained non-violent political mass movement for the restoration of political rights. Abolition of Art 370 has finished the mainstream. Constitutionalists are gone. So you can either be a stooge or a separatist now. No shades of grey.”He has now deleted all his tweets. Asked to explain the stooge-and-separatist comment , he said: “I was talking about the political grey zone in which electoral politics operated. I said that once the grey zone is over now people will call you stooge or separatist. [And] I said I’m neither of the two.”He added: “I’m a proud citizen of this country who wants to make a difference in the lives of people. I don’t recognise these labels at all.”In a signed article for this paper in January last year, Faesal enunciated the reasons he quit the IAS. He said then that Kashmir was in a crisis and that as an insider, he had decided to ring the alarm bell.After being in touch with top officials in the government, Faesal now says he accepts the new reality. “We are face to face with a new political reality in Kashmir. Since August 5, the facts on the ground have changed. I want to articulate my understanding of the situation without the need to be politically correct. Kashmir has suffered a lot in the past. I don’t want to bank on the old illusions, take Kashmiris down a garden path, and build my career on that. I’m quitting with all humility and telling people that I can’t promise something that I can’t deliver.”He now seems hopeful that the legislative route will provide answers. “In a democracy, this consensus is dynamic and we should not lose hope. The same Parliament has provided answers in the past and I’m sure the same Parliament will provide answers in the future also,” he said.Faesal’s resignation from the IAS is still pending and he may be reinstated, though the timeline for that is not clear. “The rules can be tweaked to accommodate him,” an official said.Faesal is not averse to returning to the bureaucratic fold. “I am not averse to working with the government. Public administration is my domain of expertise. That’s where I belong,” he said.Officials in Delhi and Srinagar who asked not to be named said he could be rejoining soon, and could also be reinstated in an advisory role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-faesal-reached-out-to-nsa-before-he-quit-party-open-to-ias-return/story-gzjuYwwztB5lNTg8tu141O.html
13-08-2020||India||ISI, JeM planned Pulwama strike, trained attacker: NIA||Islamabad was involved in planning, training the perpetrators and executing the February 2019 Pulwama attack that left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel dead and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, said two officials aware of the details of the charge sheet the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has readied in the case.The charge sheet, which is expected to be filed at the end of this month, concludes Pakistan’s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and its proxy, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), planned and executed the state-sponsored attack, for which highly-trained terrorists were sent to India. It says Pakistan used Adil Ahmad Dar, a local resident who rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, as a suicide bomber to project the attack as a result of a home-grown militancy against “India’s occupation of Kashmir”, one of the officers cited above said.“However, strong technical, documentary and material evidence have been collected apart from experts’ reports and evidence shared by foreign agencies, which prove that the Pakistani government was directly involved in the attack, aimed to create unrest in India,” said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Maulana Masood Azhar, who founded JeM in 2000 after he was freed from an Indian prison in exchange for 155 passengers of a hijacked aircraft, and his younger brother, Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, have been named as primary accused in the charge sheet. Seven alleged JeM operatives arrested from Kashmir since February, Shakir Bashir Magrey, Mohammad Abbas Rather, Mohammad Iqbal Rather, Waiz-ul-Islam, Insha Jan, Tariq Ahmad Shah, and Bilal Ahmed Kuchey, have been named for “conducting reconnaissance, providing logistics and assisting in planning the attack”.The names of Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq, who was sent to India to execute the attack, Kamran, JeM’s area commander, Mudassir Khan, and Adil Ahmad Dar also figure in charge sheet but not as accused as they have been killed. Farooq, Kamran, and Mudassir Khan were killed in March 2019 in separate exchanges of fire with security forces.A second officer said the Union home ministry has given the go-ahead to file the charge sheet against Azhar and others under anti-terror laws.Azhar was among those India designated as individual terrorists in 2019. The move came following an amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists. The US has similar laws for such designations and the 2019 move opened an added avenue for joint action against terrorists.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has denied his country’s role in the Pulwama attack and even offered to prosecute the culprits if India provided evidence. Islamabad has not, however, taken any substantive action against global terrorists operating from its soil, including Azhar even as it has been under pressure from the international community.Pakistan has been on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s “grey list” of “monitored jurisdictions” since June 2018 for failing to counter-terror financing, especially by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, JeM, Taliban, al-Qaeda and Haqqani Network. A FATF plenary meeting in February warned Pakistan that it had failed to meet all deadlines for a 27-point action plan, and gave the country four more months to implement it.HT in March reported the Pulwama attack was originally set to be carried out in the first week of February 2019. But weather conditions forced a suspension of the security convoy movements. The ISI and JeM had to wait until next the CRPF convoy travelled along the Jammu-Srinagar highway.NIA’s probe has concluded the explosive material for the attack was collected over a period of time from mining blocks and locations used by cement factories for blasting rocks in Khrew (Pulwama), Khunmoh (Srinagar), Tral, Awantipora, and Lethpora.The NIA charge sheet also details the email, text, and social media communications of key players in the bombing, including Azhar’s brother, the second official cited above said. The Pulwama attack threatened to spark a full-blown conflict between India and Pakistan. JeM claimed responsibility for the attack and prompted India to carry out an airstrike on a terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot. Pakistan retaliated a day later and triggered a brief dogfight involving warplanes of the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isi-jem-planned-pulwama-strike-trained-attacker-nia/story-iOgoXjVhpbF6FdNwNSslAP.html
13-08-2020||India||VD Savarkar features prominently in tourism ministry webinar||The tourism ministry, as part of its ongoing intiative Dekho Apna Desh hosted a webinar on Wednesday that chronicled the life of freedom fighters such as Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Batukeshwar Dutt while they were imprisoned in the Kaala Paani prison or Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar islands . Dekho Apna Desh is the ministry’s flagship initiative in which series of webinars highlighting the country’s main tourism attractions are conducted. The ministry has conducted over 40 webinars till date, five of which have been specially organised around the theme of Independence Day, 15 August. According to the officials, the topics of the webinars are chosen to highlight the unique features of any given location. “One can not have a conversation about Tourism in Andaman and Nicobar Islands without mentioning the Cellular Jail,” said a ministry official. In the webinar on Kaala Paani or Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands where the British met out cruelest treatment to political prisoners, is right-wing icon Savarkar who features most prominently. “Savarkar was arrested by the British on the suspicion of being involved in a protest organised by his elder brother against the Indian Council Act, or the Minto Morley Reforms,” the ministry states in the webinar. According to historian Ramachandra Guha, while Savarkar’s views on Hindutva are ‘reprehensible’, one cannot forget that he was ‘a heroic and brave freedom fighter’. “It is not easy to find a historical figure who is either completely good or completely bad,” said Guha. Other freedom fighters to find mention include Bhagat Singh’s accomplice Battukeshwar Dutt, Barindra Kumar Ghosh and Subhash Chandra Bose, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vd-savarkar-features-prominently-in-tourism-ministry-webinar/story-jFP536zakZUTZIaCS0Aq7K.html
13-08-2020||India||Union minister Shripad Naik tests positive for Covid-19||Union minister of State for defence Shripad Naik has tested positive for Covid-19, he revealed in a post on Twitter. “I underwent Covid-19 test today and it has turned out asymptomatically positive. My vitals are within normal limits and I have opted for home isolation. Those who have come in contact with me in the last few days are advised to get tested for themselves and take required precautions,” Naik said in a post via Twitter. Barely two days ago, the minister had felicitated kar sevaks who had participated in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya at a function at Priol in Ponda tehsil of Goa. The function was organised by the Priol BJP Mandal at Madananteshwar Temple in Savoi-Verem Karsevak’s from Priol constituency who had participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation in Ayodhya in 1990 and 1992. On the same day at another event the minister had launched a booklet and devotional CD ahead of the upcoming Ganesh Chaturthi festival. The minister was also involved in examining flood affected areas in North Goa, a constituency he represents as a Lok Sabha MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-shripad-naik-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-zdrNQaU31D2ryD2cnru4hL.html
13-08-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Russia’s announcement on August 11 – important enough for President Vladimir Putin to make it himself – that it has approved a coronavirus disease vaccine (the world’s first) may encourage other countries engaged in similar research, the US and India included, to think of doing the same. This writer has one word of advice for them: DON’T.Russia’s move, more political gamesmanship than scientific achievement, is, at best, stupid and an example of science being led by politics, and, at worst, downright unethical – because an untested vaccine could do untold harm. The vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, has not undergone Phase 3 trials – and is probably the world’s first vaccine to be launched without these trials. In all, it has so far been tested on 76 people – and the results of those tests, usually published and reviewed, have not been. Sure, the vaccine’s registration (it happened on Tuesday) mentions that the people who received one or two shots of the vaccine produced antibodies that act against the Sars-CoV-2 virus’s spike protein, but the production of an immune reaction is different from immunity – one reason why extensive Phase 3 trials are carried out. Indeed, the six vaccine candidates in Phase 3 or combined Phase 2-3 trials all produced similar immune reactions.On Tuesday, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, said that it would help conduct Phase 3 trials in countries including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and India, and also start mass production “in partnership with local sovereign wealth funds” in India, South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Cuba. It added that at least 20 countries have shown interest in buying the vaccine, called Sputnik V, perhaps a deliberate play on the Sputnik 1, which showed the world (especially the US) that Russia was ahead in the space race. (The word has passed into popular lingo as the Sputnik moment -- when a country realises it is far behind another country in an area of science).The problem is that vaccine development is not a race, although it is being treated as one by at least some countries, including the US, where the Trump administration has pumped billions of dollars into Operation Warp Speed to hasten the development of a vaccine. Nor should it be considered a Sputnik moment, although, unfortunately, some leaders are likely to see it as one.The science behind Sputnik 5 is straightforward. It is an adenoviral vector vaccine (like the ones being tested by Oxford-AstraZeneca and CanSino Biologics, and the one being developed by Johnson & Johnson). These are essentially genetically engineered viruses that cause the common cold (CanSino is using a human cold virus; Oxford, one that causes cold in chimpanzees), and they work by transporting a gene from Sars-CoV-2 into the body using this virus, and making it believe that it has been infected, thereby provoking an immune reaction. The technology is decades old, but, in an indication of just how long it takes for a new vaccine technology to be developed, the first adenovirus vector vaccine for any disease (Ebola in this case) was approved only in June. Until then, it was promising, if unproven, technology. This columnist has previously written that data and science should guide every country’s response to Covid-19 and all aspects of managing the disease. Vaccine development and testing is a unique marriage of both data and science. Unfortunately, Russia is an old hand at politicising both, although other countries have also mastered this.The best thing that can happen, from the saving-the-world-now point of view is for the Russian vaccine to actually work (although scientists believe the chances of that are remote). The worst thing that can happen, from the perspective of science, scientific thinking, and scientific process, is, again, for the Russian vaccine to actually work.That will encourage more countries to short-circuit the process – and that way lies the road to perdition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-FggJom6rWNn1vZIWSNgq9L.html
13-08-2020||India||Sharad Pawar backs Mumbai cops in Sushant Singh Rajput case||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar was irked with his grandnephew Parth for demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and publicly ridiculed him. Parth is the son of his nephew and state deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.Describing Parth as “immature”, Pawar said he doesn’t give importance to what the latter says. Significantly, Pawar said that he is not opposed to CBI probe, which has been demanded by BJP leaders. CBI has filed a case against Rhea Chakraborty and her family after the Centre approved its probe. Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai apartment on June 14. He allegedly died by suicide. Responding to media queries on Wednesday, Pawar said farmers also die by suicide but media does not take note of that. “The suicide by the actor is unfortunate, but the way it is being discussed in the media is surprising. In my district, 20 farmers have died by suicide but no media has taken note of it,” he said.Pawar said he has been watching the Mumbai Police for five decades and is confident that they would handle the probe well. “Maharashtra and Mumbai Police are capable and I have 100% faith in them. If someone still wants a probe by CBI or any other agency, then there is no reason to oppose it,” he said, taking a cautious stand.On July 27, Parth had met state home minister Anil Deshmukh and demanded a CBI investigation in the actor’s death. Parth’s demand was contrary to the stand taken by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition government, in which NCP is one of the partners along with the Shiv Sena and the Congress. The state government has been in favour of a probe by the Mumbai Police. Pawar’s statement has sparked speculations about differences within his clan which had seen an open revolt by Ajit and a few other NCP MLAs last November..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-backs-mumbai-cops-in-sushant-case/story-eskwR06kUvSRHHKucOstsI.html
13-08-2020||India||Programme for micro-enterprises: No set targets, flagship scheme losing steam||A flagship programme of the Union government to help set up new micro-enterprises is crippled by structural issues and high rate of non-performing assets (NPA), its latest review has underlined.Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), under which banks offer subsidies worth up to Rs 25 lakh to start new micro-enterprises, is run by the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) ministry with the help of the Union finance ministry.The programme is available for any individual above 18, who have passed at least class 8 examination. While only new projects are considered for sanction of loans under PMEGP, self-help groups that have not availed benefits under any other public scheme, societies, production co-operative societies, and charitable trusts are also eligible. It allows entrepreneurs to set up factories or units by depositing a small part (margin money) of the total project cost with banks, which would fund the units. After a factory runs successfully for three years, the bank would return a lion’s share of the margin money.From 2015-16 to 2019-20, public sector banks sanctioned 2,07,639 accounts and assistance of Rs 10,169 crore was allotted, according to official data. Out of these, 82,398 accounts in the manufacturing sector were given Rs 5,139 crore and 1,25,241 accounts in service sector got the assistance of Rs 5,030 crore.But at a recent official meeting on audit, MSME secretary AK Sharma and Pankaj Jain, additional secretary (banking) said out of the allotment, Rs 1,537 crore has turned out to be NPA. The officials also pointed out that more than 15% NPA in the MSME business is much higher than the global average of 11% for the sector.Officials observed that a deficiency in skills, lack of market study, low demand and stiff competition were the key reasons for such a large number of NPAs.Out of the 1,537 NPA firms, 738.14 are in manufacturing and 799.39 are in the services sector, which is otherwise a robust area in the Indian economy.Officials also pointed out that while normally all central schemes are given definite annual targets, this scheme was not driven by any such target. As both the states and the banks worked without the aim of completing the annual target of disbursement of loans, the programme lost the drive.It has been also observed that earlier the banks had set up a long-drawn process to fund projects and most of the projects took a long time to get approvals.To revive the project, the government is now planning to introduce a single window, online clearance for entrepreneurs so that they can get the money easily. The Centre also plans to conduct an intensive training programme to help potential entrepreneurs focus on the right market and right products, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/programme-for-micro-enterprises-no-set-targets-flagship-scheme-losing-steam/story-SMAJCtQthA1SamzUHIhIqO.html
13-08-2020||India||Two HAL-built light combat copters deployed in Ladakh||: Two light combat helicopters (LCH), produced by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), have been deployed in the Ladakh sector to support the Indian Air Force (IAF) at short notice amid the border row with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), HAL said in a statement on Wednesday.“It is the lightest attack helicopter in the world designed and developed by HAL to meet the specific and unique requirements of Indian armed forces reflecting the crucial role of HAL in Atma Nirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India campaign],” said HAL chairman R Madhavan. LCHs figure on the government’s negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems, and ammunition over the next five years.HAL, the state-run plane maker, is expecting an order for 15 LCHs by the year-end--10 for IAF and five for the army. IAF and the army together need 160 LCHs.The deployment of the twin-engine LCH in the Ladakh sector is symbolic in nature and an acknowledgment of the potential that the platform holds but it is yet to be fully weaponised to meet the air force’s requirements, people familiar with the LCH programme said.“The LCH holds a lot of promise but is not really capable of carrying out missions in its current configuration. It lacks anti-armour and air-to-air weapons. That is work in progress,” an official said on condition of anonymity. The LCH is equipped with 70mm rockets and a chin-mounted cannon.“The LCH may not be carrying its full weapons load as of today but when the weapon integration is complete, it will prove its worth,” said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director-general, Centre for Air Power Studies.During a visit to the Ladakh sector last week, IAF vice chief Air Marshal Harjit Singh Arora flew in one of the two LCHs from the Daulat Beg Oldie airbase near the contested LAC.Arora took off from a high-altitude location to a forward area for a simulated attack on a high altitude target, the HAL statement said. “This was followed by a landing at one of the most treacherous helipads in the region. The LCH successfully demonstrated its quick deployment prowess to forward locations in extreme temperatures,” the statement said.LCH is a potent platform because of its state-of-the-art systems and highly accurate weapons (it will eventually carry) that are capable of hitting any type of target by day or night, it added. The two LCHs deployed in Ladakh are prototypes and the ones that will be supplied to the IAF will come with the desired weapons capability, said an HAL official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.On the upcoming order for 15 LCHs, the HAL said, “Technical evaluation and the price negotiations have been concluded and the order is expected shortly. However, as a proactive measure, HAL has launched limited series production in anticipation of orders at its Bengaluru facility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-hal-built-light-combat-copters-deployed-in-ladakh/story-wzFLsVsr7tQZOUZn4lvInN.html
13-08-2020||India||Logistics, tourism generated most jobs in Covid-19 aftermath||Logistics, followed by tourism and hospitality, construction, information technology and telecom, have emerged as the top five employment-generating sectors in India in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease, according to an assessment by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC).The five most popular job roles that have emerged on the basis of demand are courier delivery executive, housekeeping attendant, customer care executive, warehouse associate and machine operator, the NSCDC assessment shows. The assessment, based on the data collated on ASEEM, or the Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping portal that was launched earlier in July, shows that between July 15 and August 7, about 64,689 jobs were offered to skilled workers who were either jobless or left without a job because of the economic slowdown and businesses shutting down after the coronavirus outbreak.The pandemic and the ensuing 68-day lockdown triggered job losses across sectors and prompted an exodus of workers, mainly dage-wage earners, from the cities to their homes in the countryside of states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha.  While a little over 6,000 people had already joined work in different sectors, the NSDC is collating data on whether the remaining jobs that were offered have been taken up.ASEEM was launched as a platform for assessment and hiring of the available skilled workforce and to bridge the gap between demand and supply of workforce.According to a person aware of the details, based on the postings on ASEEM, jobs were offered in over 14 states that include Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Telegana and Jharkhand.“In many states people have already taken up the jobs, while others are yet to take up the offers. That data is also being collated,” said the person, requesting anonymity.The highest number of openings were in the logistics sector, which includes services such as courier delivery, warehouse executives and packers.Jobs in the logistics industry are most in demand with over 83,736 applicants seeking work in the sector, followed by tourism and hospitality, which attracted 42,310 applicants, telecom (28,088), banking and financial services (8,871) and healthcare (8,273).These five sectors put together contributed 76.1% of total jobs posted on the ASEEM portal, said the person quoted above.“Services industry is in demand with courier delivery executive, housekeeping attendant, customer care executive, warehouse associate and food and beverages steward making for the top five job roles. All of these job roles combined makes for 48.7% of total jobs posted in the current scenario,” the person cited above said.States which had the most number of candidates registering for jobs were Uttar Pradesh with 13.7% of the total applications made till July 30, followed by Haryana (7.1%), Tamil Nadu (6.6%), Maharashtra (6.2%) and West Bengal (4.7%)Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Mahendra Nath Pandey said the ministry was using ASEEM to prepare a database of skilled workers, which will offer details oft their skills.“Our youth will be able to play an important role in accelerating the development journey of India.To accelerate the self-reliant India and Skill India Mission of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to connect the youth in the country with new employment opportunities; this portal will surely give impetus to our continuous efforts to bridge the supply and demand,” Pandey said.Last week, a delegation of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh met Union ministers including Pandey who are part of the Group of Ministers (GOM) on employment and skill development chaired by minister of social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot and urged the union government to draft schemes to protect existing jobs in sectors such as agriculture and handlooms. The BMS also demanded avenues for employment by designing migrant worker-centric plans that take into account specific sectors such as construction workers, street vendors and hospitality workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/logistics-tourism-generated-most-jobs-in-covid-aftermath/story-4PLytLGTwISNQyULxvyGuN.html
13-08-2020||India||Relieved now, I never wanted to die as a traitor: Nambi Narayanan||Sitting alone on the porch of his house in Thiruvananthapuram, Nambi Narayanan (79), former scientist of the Indian Space Research Organization, is not elated but he says he is satisfied with the outcome of his 26-year-old legal fight. But he said he will be fully satisfied only after the erring officials who implicated him in the botched spy case were punished. He spoke to HT after accepting the final tranche of compensation Rs 1.30 crore from the state government. Edited excerpts:Can we say it is a happy ending?I am satisfied but I will be fully satisfied only after erring officials who implicated me in the case are punished. I was not interested in hefty compensation, I told this in the Supreme Court also. I had to keep my fight alive. In fact, I kept myself alive only to tell my story. After 26-year fight I am tired now. But I hope the Jain Commission appointed by the apex court will fix responsibility on the erring officials the court exactly said the commission will find out ways and means of officials involved in the case and fix responsibility. I am happy everyone accepted that I am innocent. I never wanted to die as a traitor.In such long fights many innocent give up and surrender to destiny?I don’t want to talk about the case again. But many people including a section of the media erred. They churned out juicy stories. Our cryogenic engine project was delayed. Well, my conviction was right from the day one when two constables came to my house and took me to the police station. But I feel each agency should be aware of its duties and responsibilities. In my case co-ordination between different agencies was almost zero and that compounded my woes. In this country, even a constable or inspector can arrest a project director and torture. I feel system should be more transparent and professional. People who are innocent should fight, eventually, you will get justice while it may be delayed. I was the happiest when I was honoured with the Padma Bhushan last year.There are many questions remain unanswered?Yes, many questions remain. Who really conspired in the case and how they made use of some petty officials, all will have to come out. I am too old for another fight. What next?It is a philosophical question. I am believer. It is for the God to decide my destiny. If anything is left in me I will devote it to my country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relieved-now-i-never-wanted-to-die-as-a-traitor-nambi-narayanan/story-NuRX0aOlysIoTElaKjOrXN.html
13-08-2020||India||Highest single day recoveries; rate improves to 70%||India recorded its highest single-day coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recoveries, in excess of 56,000, taking the overall recovery rate to 70%, which one expert said was the result of the knowledge and experience gained by health professionals in the battle against the virus.“The record highest single-day recoveries at 56,110 registered in the last 24 hours are the result of the successful implementation of effective containment strategy, aggressive and comprehensive testing coupled with standardized clinical management of the critical patients based on holistic Standard of Care approach,” the ministry said in a statement.India’s Covid-19 average daily recoveries have been constantly increasing, with the first week of July recording 15,000 daily average recovered cases, which leapt to at least 50,000 in the first week of August. Previous highest single day recoveries were recorded on August 10, when 54,859 patients had recovered. With more patients recovering and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation, the total recoveries have crossed the 1.6 million mark to reach 1,639,599.“The actual case load of the country is the active cases (643,948) which is only 27.64% of the total positive cases. They are under active medical supervision. With a consistent and sustained increase in recoveries, the gap between recovered patients and active Covid-19 cases has reached nearly 10 lakh (1 million),” the statement said.Doctors treating Covid-19 patients say fewer patients are dying of the disease because of the lessons learnt and experience gained in clinically managing cases.“We have more drugs and support therapies as compared to what we had a few months ago. There is better knowledge of what works and what does not to improve the condition of a Covid-19 patient,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant in department of medicine at Moolchand Hospital.Apart from improved clinical skills, focus on providing timely ambulance service for ferrying patients needing hospitalization so that the treatment starts on time, especially in remote areas has also been instrumental in increased recovery rate and reduced mortality rate.The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has also been low when compared to the global average. It is currently 1.98%.“The target before us is to ensure case fatality rate drops to below 1%, and the government is making all possible efforts to make sure this happens fast. Early detection of cases, timely referral is the key and we are coordinating with states and union territories to ensure all gaps are plugged to be able to achieve this target,” said a senior health ministry official who requested anonymity.India’s testing capacity is also steadily increasing, and on Tuesday, a record number of single-day tests-- 7,33,449-- were conducted in 1,421 labs approved to perform Covid-19 testing across the country, including both public (944) and private (477) laboratories. The country has conducted at least 26 million cumulative Covid-19 tests since January 22 this year.“Efforts are being made to achieve the target of performing at least one million tests by month end in a single day,” said an official from the Indian Council of Medical Research that is spearheading India’s Covid-19 testing initiative.“More labs are being added on a daily basis and it has been a calibrated approach wherein those areas where testing facilities were lacking were given top priority to establish new or upgrade smaller labs to start Covid-19 testing facility there,” the official added, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-single-day-recoveries-rate-improves-to-70/story-o1WmE2PXt8PNMojAMZZmVJ.html
13-08-2020||India||Harassment charges left out of FIR in UP scholar’s death case||Two days after 19-year-old Sudeeksha Bhati was killed in an accident, the Bulandshahr police on Wednesday registered an FIR against two unknown persons for rash driving and death due to negligence, but did not include harassment in the list of charges though her family alleged that she was being followed by two people on a motorcycle at the time of the accident.The death of Bhati, a tea seller’s daughter who shot into limelight in 2018 by scoring 98% in her Class 12 board examinations and was pursuing a graduate degree in the prestigious Babson College in the United States, has sparked outrage in the county, and senior leaders across parties have criticised it as another example of the poor law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh.“The Bulandshahr police have been taking the case lightly. They have not registered the case under relevant sections of harassment. We are very pained over the death of our beloved daughter. The local police and administration are turning this murder and harassment to accidental death. We will harm ourselves if the justice is not delivered,” Sudeeksha’s father Jitendra Bhati said.In his complaint, Jitendra Bhati wrote that, on August 10, Sudeeksha left her home in Dadri with her uncle Satyendra and cousin for Bulandshahr at around 8am. “When they reached Chirora village, Syana Road in Bulandshahr, two persons riding a black Royal Enfield motorcycle overtook Sudeeksha’s motorcycle twice, and suddenly and deliberately applied brakes. My brother Satyendra lost balance of his motorcycle and hit another motorcycle. Sudeeksha fell on the road and was critically injured in the head. She was sent to a hospital where doctors declared her dead. My daughter was a bright student and she studied in US. I urge you to take strict action against the accused and deliver justice,” he wrote in the complaint in Hindi, on the basis of which the FIR was filed.A case was registered under Sections 279 (rash driving), 304 A (death due to negligence), and three other sections of the Motor Vehicle Act. The senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh on Wednesday said Circle Officer Diksha Singh will lead the special team of two inspectors and a station house officer (SHO) that will investigate the case. “We don’t have the complete registration number of the motorcycle. We are trying to scan all Royal Enfield motorcycles in the area with available portion of the number. We are seeking help of the regional transport office,” he said. The SSP said that the accident took place at 8:50am. “We have found an eyewitness Hemant Sharma who told the police that the Bullet-borne youths applied emergency brake to protect themselves from a milk tanker coming from the opposite side. Sudeeksha’s brother, who was driving the motorbike, lost control over and the vehicle into the Bullet motorcycle ahead,” he said. The police contended that the victim’s cousin, in his initial statement, did not talk about harassment. The SSP refuted the family’s claim that Sudeeksha’s uncle Satyendra was driving the bike. “We analysed Satyendra’s mobile number and found that he was in Dadri area at 9.17am while the accident took place at 8.50am. Two hours later, at 10.49am, he reached Bulandshahr, and we have his route map,” he said, adding that the investigation so far does not lead to a harassment case.Satyendra Bhati on Tuesday detailed the alleged harassment. “Two persons on a Royal Enfield bike tried to overtake us multiple times. I applied brakes and slowed down my bike. But they continued doing stunts on the road. They suddenly came in front of us and applied brakes immediately. Our bike collided against the Enfield...I fell on one side. Sudeeksha fell on her back, received critical injuries on her head and died,” he said.Sudeeksha, who topped Bulandshahr district in the humanities stream two years ago and won a Rs 3.8-crore scholarship, returned from the US in June in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. On August 20, she was set to return to Massachusetts, where she was pursuing a graduation course in entrepreneurship at Babson College.Local political leaders, who flocked to Bhati’s house in solidarity, demanded the criminal’s arrests and asked for Rs 1 crore compensation to the victim’s family, and an academic institution to be opened in the name of Sudeeksha. Atul Pradhan of the Samajwadi Party (SP) said he does not believe the SIT probe will be fair. “The top officials in Bulandshahr police have already said this is not a case of harassment. How will a DSP rank official heading SIT go against their boss. We demand a judicial probe into the matter,” Pradhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harassment-charges-left-out-of-fir-in-up-scholar-s-death-case/story-1e7NMGZXVdSXqq2RJ6DKsK.html
13-08-2020||India||NEP will help children learn effectively, 2023 our target for textbooks: NCERT chief||The new National Education Policy (NEP), with its focus on imparting a strong foundation to students, can go a long way in ensuring lesser dropouts, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) director Hrushikesh Senapaty has said. In an interview, Senapaty also spoke about NCERT’s future plans. Edited excerpts:How do you view NEP 2020?There is more focus on the multi-disciplinary approach. Another significant thing is the foundation...from the beginning, we can prepare our children. Like the literacy, numeracy mission, the government is focusing on this. It will help our children to learn effectively. Our foundation is often not strong and children, when they go to higher classes, drop out. If you are careful in the beginning, there will be no drop-outs. That will bring a significant change in the educational scenario. This will be a game-changer. There is also a focus on vocational education.You are required to set up a new national curriculum framework. Will you set up a committee for this?It is in the process. A committee will be constituted. We have already sent the file to the [education] ministry. The ministry will finalise the names for the steering committee. We may notify, but it will be approved by the ministry. [Education] minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank is NCERT president.NEP focuses on multilingualism, including the mother tongue. How will NCERT work towards this?Normally, as per the previous practice, we bring textbooks in Hindi, English, and Urdu. These books are then translated into different languages by the state governments. In Hindi-speaking states, there is no problem but in other regions, they are translated. It is not binding on states that they should use but most of them do. As per the new policy, the local flavour should also be there.Will NCERT develop the curriculum but also rely on states to impart local flavour?Definitely. The curriculum framework will be common. We will come out with a curriculum based on a process approved by the CABE [Central Advisory Board of Education that has] all state education ministers as members. The common core, constitutional values, and other things will all be there. But we should also take into account the local things particularly in social sciences so that the children of a particular area know about local history, local geography, etc.What are the new subjects students will be studying in schools?We are working on it. We will come out with a working paper on what are the emerging areas that should be included in our curriculum. The policy has also given some directions. Coding, other emerging areas, will be there. The policy mentions areas like computational thinking.Have you set a timeline for bringing in new textbooks? We have already prepared a timeline. We will try to complete the NCF before March 2021 because that will help us to develop syllabus and monitoring committees. One set of books will be ready by April 2022 and another by April 2023. So 2023 is our target so that we come out with all the new textbooks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nep-will-help-children-learn-effectively-2023-our-target-for-textbooks-ncert-chief/story-EXxT7cd1UqjO7Avjx0MBuO.html
13-08-2020||India||Clause 6 of Assam Accord will be enforced, says govt||The Assam government on Wednesday reiterated it is committed to the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord’s Clause 6, which pledges safeguards for the preservation and promotion of Assamese identity and heritage.The assurance came a day after All Assam Students Union (AASU) made public a high-level committee’s confidential report on the implementation of the accord. The report seeks reservation for Assamese in parliament, state assembly, local bodies, and regulation of entry of people from other states into Assam. AASU, whose three members were part of the committee, said they were forced to release the report because of the government’s inaction on it.“We have resolved to implement Clause 6 and are on track. By releasing the report, AASU has created complications. The committee’s report will be tabled in assembly at a future date and it will define and ratify definition of the Assamese people,” said Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “It is only after the assembly passes a resolution, the matter will go to the Centre and implementation process of Clause 6 will begin.”AASU’s chief advisor, Samujjal Bhattacharya, on Tuesday said the report was submitted over five months back, and with the government remaining quiet on its contents and implementation, the group decided to make it public . “There is no clarity as well on whether the Assam government has handed it over to the Centre yet.”Sarma referred to AASU’s unhappiness over the inaction and pointed out that the committee’s report says the recommendations are to be implemented within two years after careful scrutiny by a panel headed by a retired Supreme Court judge as it involves constitutional provisions.“Since our government is at the end of our tenure and the assembly elections are due in a few months, it might be better if the new elected assembly takes up the issue of ratifying definition of Assamese people.”The tripartite accord involving AASU, the state government and the Centre was signed in 1985 after a six-year agitation against illegal immigrants.The justice (Retd) Biplab Kumar Sarma-led 13-member committee submitted the report to Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in February. None of the three AASU members in the committee were present when the report was submitted. AASU was upset that the report was not handed over directly to Union home ministry.The report proposes January 1951 as the cut-off date for any Indian citizen residing in Assam to be defined as an Assamese for the purpose of implementing Clause 6. The report also seeks quotas in government jobs, talks about issues related to land and land rights, linguistic, cultural and social rights, and protection of the state’s resources and biodiversity.Clarity on who can be called an Assamese was one of the committee’s main tasks as the accord did not clearly define this.The passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in December triggered protests in Assam amid concerns that it could encourage a fresh wave of infiltration from Bangladesh and threaten the livelihoods of indigenous people. CAA seeks to fast-track citizenship to non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.The protests against the law in Assam came amidst fears that it could dilute the 1985 accord, under which the government agreed to identify and deport all refugees and migrants who have entered the northeastern state after March 25, 1971. The CAA extends the deadline until December 31, 2014.Implementation of Clause 6 remained on the backburner for over three decades till the Centre formed a panel in January last year to suggest how to do it. All members of the panel resigned in protest against the CAA.A new 13-member committee was constituted in July last year. It was given a month’s extension after its six-month tenure expired in January.“The committee’s report was submitted towards the end of February and the lockdown prompted by COVID-19 pandemic started the next month. AASU should realise that though Clause 6 is an issue, but COVID is a larger issue and priorities of the government changed because of that,” said Noni Gopal Mahanta, professor of political science at Gauhati University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clause-6-of-assam-accord-will-be-enforced-says-govt/story-HpAL4LCVVvN9DLXIdIx3RP.html
13-08-2020||India||Aarogya Setu vulnerable? Drama over data firm’s contention||A cyber security firm said on Wednesday that it stumbled upon large parts of the government’s contact tracing app Aarogya Setu’s code and back-end components that could jeopardise the privacy of 150 million users after a government website appeared to have inadvertently uploaded log-in credentials used by the developers, triggering a war of words with the government before both sides retracted their claims. On Wednesday afternoon, threat intelligence firm Shadow Map said in a blog post published on its website that it found the log-in credentials used by developers of Aarogya Setu sitting, possibly by accident, on a government website, allowing them to gain access to large parts of the code and other software infrastructure that, if accessed by hackers, could expose location, contact, and health data of the users. The blog post refers to events that happened in late June, and added that the issue was fixed a day after Shadow Map pointed it out to the relevant authorities. In a widely circulated statement on Wednesday evening, the government called the claims “malicious, nefarious and unsubstantiated” and assured users that no data has been compromised due to the alleged vulnerabilities. It also said it would pursue legal action against the company. Shortly after, Shadow Map took down the blog post, and the government retracted its statement. “We assure users no data was compromised and we will look into this incident in entirety and take action as per the law,” said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov, the government agency spearheading the project. Singh added that the statement was being retracted since the blog had been pulled down. Aarogya Setu is a mobile phone-based contact-tracing application meant to identify people with Covid-19, but has been criticised by privacy experts for collecting excessive amounts of data, while cyber security analysts have also flagged endemic issues in India’s cyber hygiene that could expose such data to malicious actors, including state-backed hackers. In the now-retracted blog post , Shadow Map gave what appeared to be details with screenshots of how it found “the source code for the Aarogya Setu platform including its back-end infrastructure being exposed on the public internet”, citing in particular the discovery of log-in credentials used by the developers on GitHub. GitHub is a code-sharing platform that is often used by programmers to work on software they are building.The discovery was part of internal research to scan government websites for publicly accessible data, the researchers said, adding: “On the 23rd of June, while analysing the data from this GOV.in scan, we noticed that one of the Aarogya Setu servers had been recently updated and one of its developers had accidentally published their Git folder into the public webroot, along with the plain-text user name and password details for the official Aarogya Setu GitHub account.” This, the researchers went on to say, allowed them to access the code stored on GitHub, which in turn gave previously undisclosed details about how the platform is designed, including the role of private operators, and access to “authentication keys” that could potentially enable access to user data. “A malicious user that gets access to GitHub or their cloud platforms could easily introduce malware into the app that would then be served to all 150 million users,” Yash Kadakia, founder of Shadow Map, told HT over phone in the afternoon. To these claims, Singh said the disclosures “were very unethical and unprofessional act of a firm that was involved in security audit of the app”. In the statement issued by the ministry of electronics and IT, before it was retracted, the government accused Security Brigade – the parent company of Shadow Map -- of violating its terms of engagement on the Aarogya Setu project. “Security Brigade, a CERT-In empanelled agency, was one of the reviewers of Aarogya Setu code and confidential information relating to the code was shared with the firm. In all such reviews and audits, the expectation is that they will conduct the review professionally and will maintain confidentiality. Now publishing an article on issues that they came to know as part of the code review violates the basic principles of ethics and propriety,” it said.Security Brigade rejected the allegation and reiterated the information was based on code accessed as a result of the leak of the GitHub credentials on a government website.“Aarogya Setu reached out to six organisations and shared their Android source code for review prior to their press conference announcing the bug bounty program. Of course, this Android source code was then made publicly available for all on Github and has absolutely nothing to do with the article we have published. The code we discovered and responsibly reported to NIC was related to other internal components which have not yet been made public. These were accidentally exposed due to their security lapses in the Aarogya Setu infrastructure,” Shadow Map’s parent company Security Brigade said in response to the government’s statement.In the blog post, Shadow Map cited the data available on GitHub and the source code showed “several private organisations are heavily involved in the development and management of the Aarogya Setu platform”. This, they said, raised concerns around how much access individuals or private organisations had to the massive amounts of personal data.All of these details, the researchers added in the blog post as well as their subsequent statement, were “responsibly shared with senior members of the NIC, CERT and key stakeholders from the Aarogya Setu team”. They added: “However, we did not receive any acknowledgement or response from them. The issue was silently fixed the next day.”Other cybersecurity and technology policy experts said the findings reported by Shadow Map, if true, were worrying. “The initial error, exposing the Github credentials, is a very big mistake from the Aarogya Setu devs (developers),” said Baptiste Robert, a programmer who has previously reported vulnerabilities in the Aarogya Setu app as well as government websites that leaked sensitive user data. Robert said a particular technical aspect of the purported finding would be significant if true. This was in reference to Shadow Map finding an “authentication key” that could enable access to the database of Aarogya Setu. “This is pretty huge because with this key, they can read/write the content of the database.”Shadow Map in its blog post said it did not use the key to access the database and a spokesperson said the company was not aware if any hackers had carried out such a breach. “To my understanding, Shadow Map indicated that through private keys hardcoded in repositories, it is possible to generate access tokens that can in turn be used to read, write, update and delete data stored in the Firebase (the service hosting the database). This is extremely worrying, as this would open up the possibility of malicious actors being able to tamper with the app’s data, which clearly includes sensitive personal information (such as phone numbers, travel history, information about personal health) of millions of people using the app,” said Gunjan Chawla, programme manager, technology and national security at National Law University, Delhi’s Centre for Communication Governance.She added that if true, the incident also reflects poorly on cyber hygiene practices in India. “It is meaningless to encrypt databases if the decryption key is visible to any person viewing the source code. Other than passive profiling of citizens by adversarial countries, a malicious actor could even simply change a high risk case to a low risk, or vice versa to sabotage government attempts at containing the pandemic. Given these risks, it is surprising the app is not being treated as Critical Information Infrastructure,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-vulnerable-drama-over-data-firm-s-contention/story-um9orvMYJxUDgPsNCCg4pN.html
13-08-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot could call for floor test despite the return of Sachin Pilot camp||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot is likely to opt for a floor test in the upcoming assembly session despite a truce announced by 19 dissident Congress legislators, whose rebellion threatened the government’s stability over the past month, at least three party leaders aware of the development said on Wednesday.Even though the 19 MLAs, including now-dismissed deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, have returned to the Congress fold, the party thinks that a floor test is the only way to send across a message of unity after a tumultuous month marked by an intense tussle that triggered political uncertainty in the western state.It will also give some time to Gehlot to put his house in order since a floor test cannot be repeated during a session, one of the leaders cited above said. He said the practice is that if a government survives a trust vote, nothing is likely to change in the next six months.“The rule is that once you move a motion in a particular session, you cannot bring in that subject again in the same session. You can do so in the next session,” constitutional expert PDT Achary explained.In an interview with HT, published on Wednesday, chief minister Gehlot did not rule out a floor test, saying a decision will be taken once the assembly session begins on August 14.“No doubt, a floor test is the only solution and we can go for it any opportune time. We will prove our majority on the floor of the House,” the first Congress leader said, requesting anonymity.“We will get a breather...to address all the issues raised by party leaders and legislators from both sides,” he added, referring to the Gehlot and Pilot camps.A three-member All India Congress Committee (AICC) panel formed to look into grievances of Pilot and the rebel legislators is likely to submit its report by then.The Rajasthan crisis appeared to have come to an end after a meeting between Pilot and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday. Later that night, the party announced the setting up of the panel to look into issues raised by the 42-year-old Pilot and the 18 rebel legislators, who questioned Gehlot’s style of functioning. Three independents MLAs, too, backed Pilot.With Pilot’s return, the Congress alone has 107 legislators in the 200-member assembly, where the simple majority is 101. It also appears to have the support of all 13 independents, with the three from the Pilot camp pledging their support to Gehlot, and of five MLAs from different parties. The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats.A second Congress functionary, who is monitoring the developments in Rajasthan, said the government can move the trust vote any time in the assembly. The leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the strategy for the session will be finalised on Thursday.A third Congress leader said a floor test was important to prove a point. “The entire political crisis was witnessed by the public. A message is needed to be sent that the government is safe and promises made will be fulfilled,” he said. He reiterated the Congress’s allegations that the BJP was trying to destabilise the state government.The BJP said taking a call on a floor test was an “internal issue” of the Congress. “The BJP neither asked and nor will ask for floor test. Let them do whatever they want to do,” BJP legislator and spokesperson Ram Lal Sharma said.Political analyst Narayan Bareth said the Congress did not want to take any risk. “The ruling party is still keeping an eye on the rebels...They would also want to convey to the rebels that they aren’t dependent on them,” Bareth said.Despite the truce, there are indications of resentment among a section in the Congress.Legislators backing Gehlot displayed their anger at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting in Jaisalmer over the return of Pilot and his supporters.A large section of legislators were vocal against Pilot, and questioned how the Congress could take the dissidents back after their rebellion threatened the government, a party leader present in the meeting said.On Wednesday, Gehlot said it was natural for legislators backing him to be upset. “The way this episode happened, they had to stay in hotels. But I told them that in the interest of the country, state, its people and for saving democracy, sometimes we have to bear,” he said.The MLAs supporting Gehlot, meanwhile, returned to a hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur on Wednesday. On July 13, they were taken there. And on July 31, they were shifted to a resort in Jaisalmer.They are expected to stay at Fairmont Hotel near Jaipur till the session begins. The rebel lawmakers — all of them have returned to the state — did not visit the hotel on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-could-call-for-floor-test-despite-the-return-of-pilot-camp/story-66AuJ4uslMaruNUY49XA5I.html
13-08-2020||India||Physical hearings in top court likely next week||The Supreme Court may start holding physical hearings in at least two or three of its 15 courts as early as next week, as demanded by the Bar association, even as the top court wants additional safety measures before it starts doing so.The move comes almost five months after the court stopped physical hearings on account of the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the Coronavirus disease, and almost two -and-half months after the lockdown was removed, although some restrictions continue. A seven-judge committee evaluating the court’s opening told leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) on Tuesday that at least three courts may start holding physical hearings on a trial basis. This will be in addition to the virtual court hearings already in place, they said. Members of the bar are keen on an opening, even a phased one, from next week, but a final word on the matter is awaited: the judges committee is expected to submit its report to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in a day or two for passing necessary directions. The meeting between the seven-judge committee and the bar leaders was held on Tuesday through videoconferencing. The lawyers were represented by SCBA President Dushyant Dave and SCAORA President Shivaji Jadhav. In a statement issued on Wednesday, SCBA President Dave wrote about the meeting. “We suggested that for the time being only four or five Courts may restart physically while continuing and expanding/improving the virtual courts hearings.” Speaking to HT, SCAORA President and senior advocate Shivaji Jadhav said: “The committee presided by Justice NV Ramana is seriously considering starting at least two-three physical courts from the next week and in the meantime, the registry has been asked to take necessary steps to prepare the courts for physical functioning.” The registry is expected to put up glass partition between the judges and lawyers and install other facilities to sanitize entry points, he added.Since the national lockdown began on March 25, the top court has been shut but limited hearing of urgent cases is taking place through videoconferencing platform VIDYO. Over a period of time, more courts have become functional through videoconferencing. The SC Registry even provides videoconferencing Rooms for lawyers at the new Supreme Court block adjacent to the old court complex. This facility can be availed by lawyers and litigants even at the seven district courts in the Capital. Both the Delhi high court and district courts in the Capital are currently holding hearings through videoconferencing and it is expected that they will follow the Supreme Court’s lead when it comes to restarting physical hearings. The seven judges on the committee are : Justice Ramana, justices Arun Mishra, RF Nariman, UU Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and LN Rao. The committee shared its concerns with the bar leaders informing them about the medical advice received by them from experts who said physical court hearings could wait for another two weeks.Speaking to HT, Dave said consistency is needed: “ How can the experts who are advising the government to lift the lockdown tell the Supreme Court to remain closed. It is unfortunate that justice is suffering, lawyers and their clerks are suffering.” Both Dave and Jadhav were of the view that all necessary measures must be taken to ensure health and well-being of the judges, registry staff and lawyers but that physical court hearing should begin from August 18. Two weeks ago, the seven-judge committee held its first meeting with SCBA and SCAORA to study the feasibility of opening courts. This followed representations received from lawyer bodies. Meanwhile, a section of lawyers have shot off a representation to SCBA and SCAORA openly dissenting with the idea of opening courts. This representation, signed by 24 lawyers has insisted on continuation of virtual court hearings. “Even If physical court hearings begin, only those matters will be listed which are old, regular matters from the Final Hearing List published before the lockdown,” Jadhav said.If the courts reopen for physical hearing, it will come against the backdrop of a general improvement of the Covid-19 situation in Delhi, with more tests, a lower positivity rate, and fewer people seeking hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/physical-hearings-in-top-court-likely-next-week/story-hUJmhOOiiyndpsz873JfTI.html
13-08-2020||India||Pranab Mukherjee ’s condition critical, remains on ventilator support||Former President Pranab Mukherjee’s health condition continues to be critical and he remains on ventilator support at the Army (R&R) Hospital, authorities announced on Wednesday. “Shri. Pranab Mukherjee’s health condition continues to remain critical. Presently he is haemodynamically stable and on a ventilator,” a statement from the hospital said.Mukherjee was admitted on Monday for a brain surgery to remove a clot. “Last year 8 August was one of the happiest days for me as my dad received Bharat Ratna. Exactly a year later on 10 Aug he fell critically ill. May God do whatever is best for him & give me strength to accept both joys & sorrows of life with equanimity. I sincerely thank all for their concerns,” his daughter Sharmistha, a Congress leader, tweeted on Wednesday. The 84-year-old former president announced on Twitter on Monday that he tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) while undergoing a routine check-up. Mukherjee, who was the India’s president between 2012 and 2017 and awarded the Bharat Ratna last year, kept his public interactions at a minimum after the pandemic hit India earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pranab-s-condition-critical-remains-on-ventilator-support/story-obe9JBk4R18ko8gX12ioBJ.html
13-08-2020||India||Vaccine procurement to be done centrally: Govt panel||An expert panel tasked with drafting a roadmap for procuring, financing and distributing a potential coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine for mass immunisation decided on Wednesday that all procurement will be done centrally and that each consignment will be tracked realtime until delivery to ensure it reaches those who need it most.The first meeting of the panel, headed by Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul, also discussed the maintenance of a cold chain during distribution and storage to ensure vaccine viability, inventory, resource mobilisation, and ensuring equitable access.Details of the first meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 were released on Wednesday by the Union health ministry, which also announced the setting up a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to track last-mile delivery of the vaccine and stock position on a realtime basis.  “The Committee also advised all the States not to chart separate pathways of procurement. The expert group deliberated on conceptualization and implementation mechanisms for creation of a digital infrastructure for inventory management and delivery mechanism of the vaccine including tracking of vaccination process with particular focus on last-mile delivery,” the health ministry said in a statement.The members decided that India would support its key neighbours and development partner countries for Covid-19 vaccines. It will leverage domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity and engage with international entities for early delivery of a vaccine not only within the country, but also in low and middle income countries as and when it is ready for mass use.Unlike other countries India hasn’t yet struck pre-approval deals with vaccine makers (the US and the UK have deals with multiple ones) . It is, however, a member of the Covax platform of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, WHO and CEPI, and is eligible to receive vaccines covering 20% of its population through this mechanism by the end of 2021. It is also widely believed that at some point, the government will sign a deal with the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, which will be making several of the Covid-19 vaccines under licence. “There is going to be intense global competition for Covid-19 vaccine procurement, so it’s not a bad time to start planning; even though we can’t be sure which vaccine candidate will win or probably none would. It’s like a game of chess, and you need to plan a lot even though you can’t be sure how the game will eventually play out. Having said that, you do need to get your logistics in place,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Russia on Tuesday launched a Covid-19 vaccine called Sputnik, described by President Vladimir Putin as the world’s first. According to WHO, there are six vaccine candidates in Phase 3 or Phase2-3 combined trials around the world and roughly another 120 in various stages of clinical testing. The expert group has referred the matter of selection of the right vaccine candidate for use in the country to the Standing Technical Sub-Committee of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI). NTAGI is an advisory committee comprising multidisciplinary groups of experts advising the government on vaccine and immunization policy based on available evidence.The expert group has sought inputs on vaccine candidates, both indigenously and internationally manufactured, from NTAGI. “…They discussed on broad parameters guiding the selection of Covid-19 vaccine candidates for the country and sought inputs from NTAGI. The group delved on the procurement mechanisms for Covid-19 vaccine, including both indigenous and international manufactured, along with guiding principles for prioritization of population groups for vaccination,” the ministry’s statement added.The Covid-19 vaccine can be delivered using any of the already existing delivery platforms as India already has a robust national immunisation programme running, offering protection against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases. The committee also considered other issues related to logistics such as cold-chain infrastructure , and how to address equitable access to the vaccine.“Issues related to vaccine safety and surveillance were taken up and strategy for community involvement through transparent information and awareness creation were discussed,” said the ministry statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-procurement-to-be-done-centrally-govt-panel/story-LTqYpptXM5P29oZSH8Ac4M.html
13-08-2020||India||India blocks Pak’s scheme for Kashmiris, says medical degrees in PoK not recognised||India will not recognise degrees awarded by medical colleges in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the Medical Council of India has declared in a public notice, a move designed to firmly, even if partially, block Prime Minister Imran Khan’s scholarship scheme for 1,600 students from Kashmiris every year.The MCI announcement comes months after the Jammu and Kashmir high court asked the MCI and external affairs ministry to review its stand to see if students who study medicine in these territories could be allowed to practice.The trigger for the court’s December 2019 order was a petition from a young Kashmiri woman who had studied medicine in PoK but was disallowed from sitting for the exam meant for people who studied abroad. This exercise was still in motion when the Pakistan government, in February, announced the scheme to extend generous scholarships for 1,600 Kashmiri students.Security agencies red-flagged the Imran Khan government’s outreach to Kashmiri students soon after. Pakistan had been offering cheaper education options to Kashmiri students for years, mostly on the recommendation of Kashmiri separatist leaders. There had been several instances where Kashmiris had gone to Pakistan and its occupied territories through legal channels to study but returned via the Line of Control after being trained at terror camps.Those who did stick to studies returned more radicalised than they were when they left, said a counter-terror operative.Monday’s MCI order deals with one part of what security agencies described as a big challenge.“This is to inform all concerned that entire territories of UT of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh are an integral part of India. Pakistan is in illegal and forcible occupation of a part of the territory. Accordingly, any medical institution in Pakistan occupied Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh (POJKL) requires permission/recognition under the Indian Medical Council Act 1956. Such permission has not been granted to any medical college in PoJKL. Therefore, any qualification obtained from medical colleges within these illegally occupied areas of India shall not entitle a person for grant of registration under Indian Medical Council Act 1956 to practice modern medicine in India,” the MCI said.This implied that students who pass out from professional colleges in PoK cannot sit for the exam meant for foreigners because the occupied territories are an integral part of India.Security officials told Hindustan Times that the MCI order only deals with one part of the challenge. It does not deal with students who receive their degrees from universities in Pakistan. “Unless this is stopped, it would remain a key area of concern,” one of them said.But there has been no consensus at the meetings that have been held to discuss the security concerns from PM Khan’s scholarship offer. An official said there were questions around the powers of the government to bar citizens from studying in certain institutions in the absence of enabling legal provisions.“This is still work in progress,” he said, adding that security agencies were working out a plan that would withstand legal scrutiny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-blocks-pak-s-scheme-for-kashmiris-says-medical-degrees-in-pok-not-recognised/story-22Hq1cUsFQHERKKAJhCgPP.html
13-08-2020||India||Centre zeroes in on three firms for new Parliament||The government has narrowed the list of choices for building a new Parliament complex to three Mumbai-based construction companies -- Larsen & Toubro Limited, Tata Projects Limited and Shapoorji Pallonji & Company Private Limited -- after disqualifying four other entities that bid for the contract, bringing it a step closer to tendering out the project.The three bidders have qualified for the submission of financial bids. According to documents reviewed by HT, Mumbai-based construction and civil engineering company ITD Cementation India Limited, Hyderabad-headquartered NCC Limited , PSP Projects Limited of Ahmedabad, and Uttar Pradesh state government’s UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited were disqualified from the project by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD).CPWD invited pre-qualification bids in a two-bid system to construct the triangular shaped building on a built-up area of around 60,000 square metres on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate, adjacent to the current Parliament building. Seven companies evinced interest in the construction of the new parliament building as part of the Narendra Modi government’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, HT reported on July 15.“The bid documents as submitted by the agencies on-line were processed and scrutinized as per initial eligibility criteria as laid down in the subject pre-qualification document. After obtaining clarifications from bidders and their clients as mentioned in their bid documents, evaluation has been done for all the bidders wherever feasible on the basis as prescribed in the said pre-qualification document,” a circular issued by CPWD on Tuesday.The bid document estimated the cost of the project at roughly Rs 889 crore. It laid out strict eligibility criteria based on a firm’s past work — such as having constructed an assembly hall with a minimum capacity of 1,000 people and a building with a basement — as well as ongoing projects, average monthly turnover, and net worth, among other factors.Construction of the new Parliament building, which will comprise halls with a bigger seating capacity for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, offices for members of Parliament, as well as a courtyard, dining facilities and a lounge for lawmakers, is likely to begin after Parliament’s winter session and is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. CPWD has specified that the existing Parliament building shall continue to function during the execution of this project.Bidders had to specify similar work completed in the past seven years, ongoing projects, as well as tentative plans to meet their manpower requirement, source of construction materials, and establishment of facilities such as those meant for fabrication.Based on an evaluation, CPWD disqualified four companies for reasons including non-fulfilment of the criteria mentioned in the bid document.“Out of total seven works submitted by the agency, the criteria for satisfactory completion of similar work of required magnitude as per minimum eligibility criteria prescribed in…bid document is not fulfilled,” it noted as the reason for disqualification of ITD Cementation.On PSP Projects, CPWD said: “the agency has submitted details of only one work, which has not been completed and is still in progress. Thus, the agency has not satisfactorily completed similar work of required magnitude as per minimum eligibility criteria.”The proposed work is of very prestigious nature and is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the highest standards of quality and workmanship, the bid document said. The bid document also specified that 50% of the workers will need to be skilled for work of stone masonry, carving, fresco, furniture, and adequate health and safety measures would need to be taken in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.“…agencies are to be qualified on the basis of individual marks secured in various parameters including aggregate total. Further minimum eligibility criteria require satisfactory completion of similar work of required magnitude in one agreement… the agency has also failed to secure minimum qualifying marks i.e. 24 marks under criteria of ‘Quality after inspection of work carried out by the nominated Joint Committee,” CPWD said in the case of UP Rajkiya Nirman NigamOn NCC Limited, CPWD remarked that it “ failed to secure minimum qualifying marks i.e. 12 in criteria of Time Over Run’ in any of the work and also failed to secure aggregate qualifying marks i.e. 75.”The new Parliament complex will be among the first projects to be finalised and tendered out as part of the Central Vista redevelopment, which includes plans to turn North and South Block, situated opposite each other on Raisina Hill and which house top central government ministries, into a museum and the construction of new administrative offices with an underground metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-zeroes-in-on-three-firms-for-new-parliament/story-Wksh7KSZlMrLa6YfhUD9zM.html
13-08-2020||Editorials||EIA: Citizens engage with environment policy | HT Editorial||The Union environment ministry received 1.7 million comments, suggestions, and objections to the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2020 till August 1. While the Centre claimed that the new EIA draft reinforces transparency, environmental experts, politicians, and civil society have argued that it neglects the balance between development and environment protection.Three issues made the process of consultations challenging. First, the Centre rushed through the critical public consultation process when the pandemic put restrictions on meetings (the Delhi High Court extended the last date for filing objections). Second, the government was seen as attempting to muzzle the voices of young environmentalists. And third, the draft was not translated into regional languages which could have allowed more citizens to participate. (The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the environment ministry to publish EIA in regional languages.)Despite these obstacles, the deliberations on the draft EIA saw an overwhelming involvement of the citizens. This is positive because a robust consultation process can push the government to look into the issue comprehensively and raise environmental awareness. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, controlled by the Centre, will now review the suggestions. The final draft will be placed before a committee, headed by a former director of the organisation. To ensure the final draft is balanced, the second leg of the process must be transparent, public, and include independent experts. Aim for a robust EIA, for environmental safeguards cannot be sacrificed at the altar of immediate political and economic considerations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/eia-citizens-engage-with-environment-policy/story-SMhWbvzPcDc5LAPSkdwvbK.html
13-08-2020||Editorials||Bengaluru’s dark night | HT Editorial||In Bengaluru, on Tuesday night, a Muslim mob, after taking offence to a social media post, attacked two police stations, vandalised the residence of a Congress legislator (the post was from his nephew’s account), damaged vehicles, smashed an ATM machine, and created a climate of fear in the northeastern part of the city. The police — after repeated attempts to calm the crowd, through persuasion and mediation by community elders, failed — resorted to lathi-charge and finally opened gunfire. Three protesters were killed. 100 people, including 60 police personnel, were also injured.The incident was unacceptable at many levels. Even if the post was offensive — and there is a discussion to be had on free speech and how, under the garb of community sentiments, free speech in India has often got curtailed — there was a legal process that was being followed. A complaint had been filed, an FIR registered, and the law would have taken its own course. But members of the mob, many of them allegedly from radical outfits such as the Popular Front of India and Social Democratic Party of India, decided to coerce the police and take the law into their own hands. The fact that they attacked symbols of the State, caused the destruction of public and private property, and their actions eventually led to the loss of lives and injuries merits the strongest condemnation. All those who participated in the vandalism and violence must be punished. If there was a larger conspiracy — as indicated by sections of the government — state authorities must get to the bottom of it.The episode also points to a larger crisis. One, religious extremism, by its very nature, is often undemocratic, causes social tensions, and promotes vigilantism in defiance of the rule of law. There is, undoubtedly, majoritarian extremism — and this has been visible over the past few years. But just as this is dangerous, so is the extremism of minority groups. And just as the Hindu community, at large, must resist extremism, the Muslim community, at large, must treat Bengaluru as a wake-up call and battle any such extremism within. Two, the episode shows how fragile the rule of law is in India. An overwhelming majority of India’s citizens — both Hindus and Muslims — want to live in peace and harmony; they abide by the Constitution, respect each other’s sensitivities, and follow the law. But Bengaluru is a sign that fringe segments of society can, if they wish, upset this equilibrium with ease. The State must assert its authority and not let this happen again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/bengaluru-s-dark-night/story-8roAjF99C811A1ljqbCgXL.html
