While the US, India and Brazil still have the highest numbers of new cases in the world, the downward trend is encouraging.“It’s profoundly hopeful news,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who credits the American public’s growing understanding of how the virus spreads, more mask-wearing and, possibly, an increasing level of immunity.“Hopefully all those factors are coming into play to get this virus under control in this country that’s really been battered by the pandemic,” she said.The virus is blamed for more than 5.7 million confirmed infections and about 178,000 deaths in the US Worldwide, the death toll is put at more than 810,000, with about 23.7 million cases.Jeffrey Shaman, a public health expert at Columbia University, said he is skeptical enough people are immune to significantly slow the spread. But he agreed that changes in Americans’ behavior could well be making a difference, recalling the impact that people’s actions had in containing Ebola in West Africa several years ago.“Ebola stopped for reasons we didn’t anticipate at the time. It was so horrifying that people stopped touching each other,” Shaman said. Something similar may be happening with the coronavirus, he said.“I know I don’t have nearly the number of contacts that I used to,” Shaman said. “But if we relax that, if we get complacent, will we just see another outbreak?”The decline in newly reported cases in the US comes even as deaths from the virus remain alarmingly high. Over the past two weeks, officials have reported an average of 965 deaths a day from Covid-19, down from 1,051 a day in early August.Deaths from the coronavirus are a lagging indicator — they trail new infections because of the time it takes for people to get sick and succumb to the disease.The percentage of tests coming back positive for the disease has also declined over the past two weeks, from 7.3% to 6.1%. But that comes as the total number of tests administered has fallen from its August peak of more than 820,000 a day, leveling off in recent weeks at about 690,000 a day.The situation has improved dramatically in several states that struggled with high caseloads earlier this summer.In Arizona, for example, officials reported 859 new cases Tuesday, down from a peak of 5,500 in late June. More than 2,000 people arrived at the state’s hospitals showing symptoms of the virus on a single day in early July. This week, that number has been less than 1,000.In Florida, where more than 10,000 people have died, the state reported 2,600 new virus cases Tuesday. Earlier in the summer, it was regularly reporting more than 10,000 new cases.Malinda Coler, 37, of San Francisco, said she has been diligent about mask wearing and other preventive measures, less to protect herself than a best friend who has a compromised immune system, with severe arthritis psoriasis.“So I wear a damned mask and get infuriated when others don’t,” she said.It’s not clear what will happen to case numbers as more school districts bring students back to classrooms and colleges reopen their campuses. In recent weeks, schools including the University of North Carolina, Michigan State and Notre Dame have moved instruction online after outbreaks on their campuses.Officials at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville said Monday that four students are facing disciplinary proceedings after three hosted off-campus parties with no mask or other distancing and another left isolation to meet with others despite testing positive for the virus.“If the facts reported to the university are accurate, these students will face at least suspension from the university, and potentially greater penalties,” Chancellor Donde Plowman wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-cases-decline-in-the-us-and-experts-credit-masks/story-BNmkzpE05noN4A2YPlUUII.html
25-08-2020||World||In first foreign trip since pandemic, China’s foreign minister visits Italy||Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said he emphasized during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday that Italy would be monitoring closely the implications of new Chinese security measures in Hong Kong.“I reiterated that, together with all our European partners, we have emphasized that Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity, based on the one country, two systems principle, are essential,” Di Maio told reporters in a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.It is equally essential to ‘’preserve the high degree of autonomy and the fundamental rights and freedoms’‘ guaranteed to Hong Kong citizens, he said.Rome is the first stop of Wang’s five-nation European tour, which includes France, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway. It is Wang’s first foreign trip since the coronavirus outbreak in China that turned into a global pandemic.Wang emphasized China’s support for close ties with Italy, with which it formed diplomatic relations 50 years ago.The ministers were scheduled for a private lunch after their press statements.The visiting diplomat’s top agenda item in Europe was expected to be pushing Europeans to guarantee market access to telecom giant Huawei, and broader efforts to keep European countries quiet on Hong Kong and to take Beijing’s side in its tariff war with Washington.Before the meeting, prominent Hong Kong democracy activist Nathan Law delivered a letter to the foreign ministry asking Di Maio to address ‘’the Hong Kong problems and human rights violations’’ during the meeting.China’s contentious national security law for Hong Kong is seen by many as Beijing’s boldest move yet to remove the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory of Hong Kong and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.’’We need to work together to form a strong alliance to go against the authoritarian nature of China″ Law said.Italy last year was the first major democracy to sign an agreement to join China’s “Belt and Road” initiative. The program includes major infrastructure investments to create a conduit for trade and China’s construction industry. Both the United States and Italy’s European partners see it as a threat as China seeks to project its power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-first-foreign-trip-since-pandemic-china-s-foreign-minister-visits-italy/story-5cS6lwqYd3V5P0skTbJtlI.html
25-08-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson urged to rethink face mask advice in schools||The British government came under renewed pressure Tuesday to change tack and encourage high school students in England to wear face masks when they return to class next week, at least in communal areas such as hallways.A day after the World Health Organization tweaked its guidance over mask-wearing by children, Scotland changed its advice, a move that’s piled pressure on the other nations of the U.K. to follow suit.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government, which oversees schools in England, would back a change “in some contexts” if the medical evidence shows face masks help in the battle to contain the coronavirus.“If we need to change the advice, then of course we will,” he told reporters while on a visit to a shipyard in Devon in southwest England.The main opposition Labour Party said there is a “growing body of evidence” to show that face masks in communal areas in secondary schools help protect students and staff. And a union representing school principals said it would be “prudent” for the government to review its guidelines in light of the change in Scotland and the new WHO advice, and that any change should be announced “sooner rather than later” given the imminent reopening of schools.The debate has intensified after the WHO changed its guidance to recommend that children between the ages of 12 to 18 should wear masks when they can’t socially distance and in areas of high transmission.The advice of the British government is that face masks aren’t necessary. It points to a recent report from Public Health England that showed very few virus infections during the partial reopening of schools for younger students in June.The merits of face masks comes as the government tries to reassure nervous parents that their children will be safe when they return to school. Schools across the UK closed in March as part of the lockdown, meaning that many students haven’t seen the inside of a classroom for nearly six months.“I think that the schools, the teachers, they’ve all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children’s health, the risk to children’s well-being from not being in school, is far greater than the risk from COVID,” Johnson said.The evidence from around the world is that children face less severe virus symptoms than do adults. However, they can be sources of transmission and governments around the world are grappling about how school reopenings will affect the virus’ spread within families and in the wider community.“In the absence of clarity, given the known detrimental impact of school closures, we must err on the side of caution in order to ensure that when schools reopen, they remain open,” said Dr. David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter.England’s nearly 25,000 schools are due to reopen over the coming couple of weeks, and Johnson’s Conservative government is focused on making sure the return goes smoothly following the recent exam grades fiasco. The furor, which eventually saw the government ditch a controversial algorithm used to determine results after exams were cancelled as a result of the pandemic, claimed its first casualty Tuesday with the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulator Ofqual.Within the UK, which has the highest virus-related death toll at nearly 42,000, Scottish schools reopened first, followed by those in Northern Ireland. Schools in England are Wales are due to reopen in September.Two weeks on from the reopening of schools in Scotland, one school in the city of Dundee has already had to close following an outbreak, a development that appears to have been at the heart of the change in face mask advice.Following on from the change in WHO guidelines, the Scottish government confirmed Tuesday it was giving “obligatory guidance” to high school students to wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday.“It is right we reflect that in our guidance,” Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.Scotland has often led the way within the UK during the pandemic on the wider use of face coverings. It, for example, mandated their use in shops after they reopened a couple of weeks before England. The Welsh government also said that it was considering a change of policy for high schools in Wales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-urged-to-rethink-face-mask-advice-in-schools/story-pIAygC67yAzeTSDViAsq1N.html

Flávio Bolsonaro is the fourth member of President Jair Bolsonaro’s direct family to be infected by the new coronavirus, including the president himself, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro and Jair Renan Bolsonaro, another son.The Brazilian president has downplayed the virus’ severity, arguing against restrictions on economic activity he claims will prove far more damaging than the disease. His approach to the pandemic runs counter to most health experts’ recommendations.Flávio Bolsonaro said he has being treated with azithromycin and chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that was touted both by Brazil’s president and by U.S. President Donald Trump despite clinical trials that found it ineffective or even dangerous.Brazil so far has registered over 3.6 million cases and more than 115,000 deaths, second in the world only to the United States.Several members of Bolsonaro’s staff also have tested positive for Covid-19, among them eight Cabinet members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-jair-bolsonaro-s-eldest-son-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-XVtVheZzpCiM5nvTBcqo7I.html

25-08-2020||World||US-Canada border closure hurts Washington state town||The border closure between Canada and the United States has severely hurt Point Roberts, Washington, which is isolated from the rest of the country.The extended coronavirus-induced border closure shut down two border crossings for the town of about 1,300 people, who must commute 25 miles through Canada to get to the rest of Washington state.“We really need that border open to survive,” said Tamra Hansen, who owns the Saltwater Cafe in Point Roberts.The economy still depends on the flow of people and resources to and from the border, which closed in March and will remain closed through at least Sept. 21, KING-TV reports.“I rely on approximately 90% of my business from the Canadians, that come from the seasonal people,” Hansen said. “And we make our money in the summer to get through the winter.”There is no regular ferry or air service to Point Roberts. There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases reported in the town.In 2019, 1.4 million people crossed the border into Point Roberts. So far this year, there have been just 217,000 visitors.Gov. Jay Inslee penned a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last Friday addressing these concerns. Inslee cited in his letter the need for a “practical solution to this issue” and emphasized “unique hardships” faced by Point Roberts residents.It followed a similar letter to the US Ambassador to Canada co-written by the state’s Senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and two other Washington state congresspeople.The city was created because of a quirk in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries agreed to settle their border dispute by dividing their territories in the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel. But, that left the small area of Point Roberts on the southern tip of the Tsawwassen peninsula in American control.Darryl Marquette, an employee at TSB Shipping in Point Roberts, says the shipping company has had boxes meant for Canada backlogged for months because of the border closures.Residents like Brian Calder, a longtime resident who worked as a city councilor in Vancouver, have advocated for relief, saying that citizens of Point Roberts should be given an exemption to cross the border.“Businesses here are down 80% -- down 80%!” said Calder. “They can’t survive through this winter. Like, it’s not possible. I’m really pessimistic about the recovery here.”Canada recently ironed out a plan to allow those in Alaska to cross the border at five specific ports using car placards to identify themselves.Hansen worries, though, that the efforts of its citizens and lawmakers will be futile.“All the other restaurants have closed down, the golf course is closed,” Hansen said. “Quite honestly, I probably should have just closed.”The number of coronavirus infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-canada-border-closure-hurts-washington-state-town/story-VcDS3WFoKXvmzH6tAjctWK.html

Experts paint a grim picture||Kim Jong Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong could rule North Korea with an iron fist, experts have said amid reports that the country’s leader is in coma.Since the reports on Kim’s deteriorating health started emerging, global experts have been discussing North Korea’s future and what could the regime change there mean for the world. The reports from South Korean intelligence agencies that Kim has handed over power to his sister have many of them worried.“Given the reputation and history of the family, she would rule with an iron fist,” retired US Army Colonel David Maxwell told New York Post.Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told The Post though Kim Jo Yong appears to be feminine, “the nature of the regime demands she be ruthless, especially in the first few years.”Also read: What happens if Kim Jong Un is dead? Explaining North Korea’s succession planThe Hermit Kingdom is already known for implementing tough measures, and the violators are dealt with harshly.A former BBC journalist, however, has suggested that Kim Jong Un may already be dead.“I honestly believe he’s dead but you just can’t tell with that country. I could be in Pyongyang now and be none the wiser,” Roy Calley said in an interview to Express.co.uk.Calley’s comments came after The Korean Herald quoted a former aide of South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung as saying, “I assess him (Kim Jong-un) to be in a coma, but his life has not ended.”Seoul’s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting about a ruling system that Kim seemed to have set up following which he shall share authority and responsibility with his most trusted aides, the South Korean daily reported. The National Intelligence Agency, however, said that the new system is not associated with any serious health issue, according to The Korean Herald.Meanwhile, a Korean website Shinmoongo rubbished the reports as absurd and reminded of the time when Chang was “greatly embarrassed” after he raised the rumour of Kim’s death on April 23.Following the reports, Calley said North Korea’s vague statements on Kim Jong-un point towards some major changes being brought in. “The fact that there is so much information/misinformation being released suggests there is something happening,” Express.co.uk quoted him as saying.The last official reports from North Korea stated that Kim Jong Un has issued a dire warning for the country’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-will-kim-jong-un-s-sister-rule-north-korea-experts-paint-a-grim-picture/story-ppCug8GqpuIBeevNxy4K9O.html
25-08-2020||World||Gaza locks down after detecting local transmission of coronavirus||Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers imposed a territory-wide curfew on Tuesday after authorities detected the first local cases of the coronavirus, raising fears of a wider outbreak in the blockaded territory that is home to some 2 million Palestinians.Gaza has registered more than 100 cases and a fatality since the start of the pandemic, but until now all the infections were linked to quarantine facilities for returning travelers. Most lockdown restrictions were lifted months ago, with even wedding halls operating normally.The four cases detected in central Gaza indicate the coronavirus has breached the territory’s defenses, and a wider outbreak could overwhelm a health care system battered by years of war and isolation, with only a few dozen ventilators for the entire population.Gaza has also seen rising tensions in recent weeks between Israel and Hamas, as militants have launched incendiary balloons and rockets into Israel while demanding the easing of the blockade imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007. Israel has responded by tightening restrictions further and launching airstrikes against militant targets.Hamas announced a 48-hour curfew after the four cases were announced late Monday. Schools, businesses, markets and mosques were ordered to close, and police patrols stopped and inspected the few cars passing through checkpoints.The four patients are related and live in the al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. On Tuesday, Hamas-run police roamed the empty streets to enforce the lockdown.Hundreds of people nevertheless took part in the funeral of four militants from the Islamic Jihad group who were killed in a mysterious blast late Monday in Gaza City.The mourners, few of whom wore masks, marched shoulder to shoulder through the city’s crowded Shajaiyeh neighborhood despite calls from the group to take precautions and limit attendance to relatives of the slain militants.All Gazans returning home through Israel or Egypt have been required to remain isolated at designated centers for 21 days. Authorities have detected 110 cases in the quarantine facilities since March, and 72 of them have recovered. A woman with underlying health problems died from the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus.Abdelnasser Soboh, director of the World Health Organization’s Gaza office, said cases of local transmission were expected. “This was not surprising to us,” he said.He added that authorities are following the correct procedures to track the source of the infection and people who were in contact with the patients.The health ministry said a woman from Gaza who was allowed to travel to Jerusalem for medical treatment had tested positive after arriving there. Health workers back in Gaza then tested her family members, revealing the four cases. The woman is still in Jerusalem.Hamas seized control of Gaza from rival Palestinian forces 13 years ago. In response, Egypt and Israel imposed a crippling blockade on the territory. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from importing and manufacturing arms. Hamas and Israel have fought three wars and countless skirmishes.There have been no deaths or serious injuries from the recent exchanges of fire, and neither side is believed to be seeking war. But any fatalities could spark an escalation.The attacks were coordinated by Hamas to pressure Israel to ease the blockade. Instead, Israel has closed Gaza’s sole commercial crossing and its fishing zone. The territory’s only power plant was forced to shut down a week ago for lack of fuel, leaving most Gazans with just four hours of electricity per day.Gaza’s heath infrastructure has been hollowed out by years of conflict, and would be ill-equipped to cope with a major outbreak. Gaza’s health facilities only have around 100 ventilators, more than half of which are already being used.The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said it is “extremely concerned” by the closure of the power plant and its impact on Gaza residents.“We are calling on all concerned parties to maintain a supply of electricity that is sufficient to meet the basic needs of the civilian population,” said Matthias Schmale, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza.Soboh of the WHO said that his organization managed to bring in 10 new ventilators for a special field hospital for coronavirus patients in Gaza, raising the number of these machines at that hospital to 50.“We can deal with hundreds of patients, but not thousands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-locks-down-after-detecting-local-transmission-of-coronavirus/story-DJE7cljqDDifGvhBZNuMYN.html

The vaccine has not been tested in phase 3 or larger clinical trials. There has been scepticism in some quarters about limited data related to the efficacy of the vaccine.“The Russian government has reached out to the Indian government seeking a collaboration for manufacturing their COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, and conducting its phase 3 trial here,” a source in the government said.“The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) along with the Department of Health Research has been asked to lead and look into the matter. They (Russian government officials) have shared some information and data on Sputnik V, while more data related to the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is awaited,” the source said.When asked if the Russian government has placed any formal request for the manufacture of its Covid-19 vaccine in India, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference, “As far as Sputnik V vaccine is concerned, both India and Russia are in communication. Some initial information has been shared while some detailed information is awaited.” According to sources, Russian Ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev has approached the office of Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan as well as secretaries of the departments of biotechnology and health research in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeks-collaboration-with-india-for-manufacturing-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-reports/story-lm4wZoQgU3mp0IwhK70ddM.html
25-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Blood cancer patients most vulnerable to effects of viral infection||A new study published on Tuesday by researchers at the University of Oxford and Birmingham has found that compared to other cancers, patients with blood cancer are more vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.The study, published in Lancet Oncology by the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP), found that blood cancer patients were particularly at risk with 57% higher odds of severe disease if they contract Covid-19. Those with breast cancer have the lowest risk overall. Cancer patients over the age of 80 have been found to have the highest frequency of fatality, a release by the University of Oxford said.As the virus spread globally in early 2020, cancer patients were identified as a sub-group who were potentially at an increased risk of infection and of potentially suffering more serious disease consequences. Since March, more than 60 cancer centres across the UK entered data into the UKCCMP database with information on adult cancer patients who contracted the virus.Using demographic data such as age, gender and tumour type, researchers were able to determine that patients with haematological cancers, particularly older patients and those with leukaemia, had a more severe Covid-19 trajectory compared to patients with solid organ tumours.Rachel Kerr of Oxford said: “Using these new data we are working fast to identify trends and correlations, which will enable us to create a tiered risk assessment tool so we can more precisely define the risk to a given cancer patient and move away from a blanket ‘vulnerable’ policy for all cancer patients, in the event of a second wave of Covid-19.”Gary Middleton of the University of Birmingham added: “Patients are turning to oncologists and wanting to know exactly what is their risk from Covid-19. This is particularly important as the number of cases in Europe and the UK is still labile”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-blood-cancer-patients-most-vulnerable-to-effects-of-viral-infection/story-N4dlgv5Wb742WINWj3ueAO.html
25-08-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: British Museum founder’s bust removed||The hitherto prominently displayed bust of British Museum’s founder, Hans Sloane, has been removed in the context of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign and his links to slave trade before he died in 1753 aged 92.Sloane Square in central London is one of several public places named after the physician, who was known as an avid collector of books, manuscripts and specimens, including many linked to the East India Company ranging from medicine, natural history to religious tracts, among others.His collection of over 45,000 printed items formed the foundation of the British Museum, from which the British Library and the Natural History Museum were later born, but the BLM campaign has prompted a reconsideration of his place in the widely visited museum.Hartwig Fischer, the museum’s director, told the media that the likeness of the Anglo-Irish Sloane (1660-1753) has been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts explaining his work in the context of the British empire.He said: “We have pushed him off the pedestal. We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge. Dedication to truthfulness, when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects, which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history,” Fischer told the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.Sloane’s marginalisation in the museum is part of recent attempts to re-visit Britain’s history of slave trade and colonialism, sparked by George Floyd’s death in the United States of America (USA) in May. There have since been demands to remove statues and re-name public spaces in the United Kingdom (UK).The statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol in June. However, the demand to remove colonialist Robert Clive’s statue in Shropshire was turned down by the local council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-british-museum-founder-s-bust-removed/story-S5uIoegvRdPjQ9pEVVt90L.html

Commercial and government buildings were set ablaze, along with vehicles in car dealership lots.Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs to disperse the crowd, which grew to several hundred, according to protester Porche Bennett, 31, of Kenosha.Fires destroyed much of the Black business district, Bennett said, adding that the instigators she saw were white.“It’s people from out of town doing this. We’ve been shopping there since we were kids and they set it on fire,” Bennett said.Social media images showed both white and Black agitators. Black men swinging baseball bats broke traffic signals and street lamps. White and Black men with bats bashed in the headlights and windshields of a row of cars.One white man riding a skateboard doused a government truck with an accelerant and set it on fire. Heavily armed white civilians stood guard in front of one business to protect it from vandals.Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people, is nearly 12 percent Black and about 67 percent white, according to U.S. Census data.One large group of protesters skirmished in front of the courthouse with sheriff’s deputies firing tear gas and pepper balls into the crowd. Demonstrators hurled water bottles and firecrackers at the police.At least one man was injured, shown on social media bleeding from the head as civilians administered aid.The first night of clashes on Sunday prompted Governor Tony Evers to order in National Guard troops to help maintain order.Evers has condemned excessive use of police force and called for a special legislative session next week to consider police reforms, saying: “We must offer our empathy. We must see the trauma, fear and exhaustion of being Black in our state and our country.”Video of the shooting taken by an onlooker showed Blake walking toward the driver’s side of a gray SUV followed by two officers with their guns drawn at his back. Seven gunshots are heard as Blake, who appears unarmed, opens the car door, one officer tugging at his shirt.It was not known whether officers saw something inside the vehicle that prompted them to shoot.His three young sons were inside the car, family attorney Ben Crump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arsonists-set-fires-in-us-wisconsin-as-police-shoot-jacob-blake-a-black-man/story-PcIr1UrzMODLRd4oesXWQL.html
25-08-2020||World||Covid pandemic pace slows worldwide except for southeast Asia, eastern Mediterranean, says WHO||The Covid-19 pandemic is still expanding, but the rise in cases and deaths has slowed globally, except for southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean regions, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.In its latest epidemiological update, issued on Monday night, it said that the Americas remains the hardest-hit region, accounting for half of newly reported cases and 62% of the 39,240 deaths worldwide in the past week. More than 23.65 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and 811,895​ have died, according to a Reuters tally on Tuesday.“Over 1.7 million new Covid-19 cases and 39,000 new deaths were reported to WHO for the week ending 23 August, a 4% decrease in the number of cases and (a 12% decrease) in the number of deaths compared to the previous week,” the WHO said.Southeast Asia, the second most affected region, reported a jump accounting for 28% of new cases and 15% of deaths, it said. India continues to report the majority of cases, but the virus is also spreading rapidly in Nepal.In WHO’s eastern Mediterranean region, the number of reported cases rose by 4%, but the number of reported deaths has consistently dropped over the last six weeks, the WHO said. Lebanon, Tunisia and Jordan reported the highest increase in cases compared to the previous week.The number of cases and deaths reported across Africa decreased by 8% and 11% respectively in the past week, “primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in Algeria, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal and South Africa”, it said.“In the European region, the number of cases reported has consistently increased over the last three weeks,” it said. “However, only a slight decrease (1%) was reported in the most recent week, and the number of deaths have continued to decrease across the region.”In WHO’s western Pacific region, the number of new cases dropped by 5%, driven by less spread in Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and Vietnam. South Korea reported an 180% jump in cases, “mainly due to an increase in cases associated with religious gatherings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-pandemic-pace-slows-worldwide-except-for-southeast-asia-eastern-mediterranean-says-who/story-3hvxaWiFb0XtKzgDcPhRHM.html
25-08-2020||World||Covid-19 epicentre Wuhan opens colleges for first time since January||Thousands of domestic university students are returning to Wuhan, China, where the Covid-19 pandemic originated, as campuses have been reopened there with strict social distancing norms in place around seven months after physical classes were suspended.Also read: Oxford coronavirus vaccine data could go to regulators this yearInternational students, including hundreds from India, are still not allowed to return to Wuhan, the capital of the central Chinese Hubei province, because of the grim pandemic situation outside China. On-campus classes are expected to begin in a week.Universities and schools were shut indefinitely in Wuhan after the city was locked down on January 23 to contain the Covid-19 spread. The disease first emerged at a seafood and meat market in this central Chinese city before spreading to the rest of China, and then the world, infecting millions and battering the global economy.Schools were reopened in a staggered manner as the outbreak slowed in China even as university campuses remained shut mainly because of the infection risks associated with student dormitories.Returning students will need to carry their updated health cards, showing them as negative for the virus.As of Monday, over 9,000 students had returned to the Wuhan University from different parts of China, official news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday. Another 20,000 students were expected to return in batches.Students currently outside the Chinese mainland are still not allowed to return to their universities, Li Qin, deputy minister of the university’s student affairs department, told tabloid Global Times.Several hundred Indian students are enrolled at medical universities in Hubei. They will be unable to resume on-campus classes until the Chinese government allows international students to return.For Wuhan, it has been a gradual return to normalcy since the lockdown was lifted in early April. Mass testing of residents followed the lifting of strict curbs on movement.A video recently of a pool party at the Wuhan Maya Beach Water Park, showing half-submerged, tightly-packed partygoers without masks and with DJs blaring music went viral online.Chinese state media defended the gathering. “Wuhan, once badly hit by the coronavirus epidemic and then locked down for 76 days since late January, now has the epidemic under control, with no new local Covid-19 cases reported for months,” official English news channel CGTN reported.Mainland China reported 84,981 Covid-19 cases and 4,634 deaths as of Monday. Hubei has reported 68,139 cases, mostly in Wuhan, and 63,626 have been cured and discharged from hospitals. The disease has claimed 4,512 lives in the province, a majority of them in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-epicentre-wuhan-opens-colleges-for-first-time-since-january/story-wg2AR20p1arB0fRqybjNMN.html
25-08-2020||World||AstraZeneca starts trial of Covid-19 antibody treatment||British drugmaker AstraZeneca has begun testing an antibody-based cocktail for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19, adding to recent signs of progress on possible medical solutions to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The London-listed firm, already among the leading players in the global race to develop a successful vaccine, said the study would evaluate if AZD7442, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), was safe and tolerable in up to 48 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years.If the UK-based early-stage trial, which has dosed its participants, shows AZD7442 is safe, AstraZeneca said it would proceed to test it as both a preventative treatment for Covid-19 and a medicine for patients who have it, in larger, mid-to-late-stage studies.AstraZeneca shares were up about 1% at 87 pounds ($114) in early trading.Development of mAbs to target the virus, an approach already being tested by Regeneron, ELi Lilly, Roche and Molecular Partners, has been endorsed by leading scientists.mAbs mimic natural antibodies generated in the body to fight off infection and can be synthesised in the laboratory to treat diseases in patients. Current uses include treatment of some types of cancers.U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci has called them “almost a sure bet” against Covid-19, and AstraZeneca in June received $23.7 million in funding from U.S. government agencies to advance development of antibody-based treatments for Covid-19. “This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance,” said Astra’s executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D Mene Pangalos.Though vaccines are at the heart of the long-term fight against the pandemic, alternative treatments are also being advanced, and the United States on Sunday authorized use of recovered COVID-19 patients’ plasma to treat those who are ill.The Financial Times reported at the weekend that President Donald Trump’s administration was considering a fast-tracked approval of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine before November’s elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-starts-trial-of-covid-19-antibody-treatment/story-lAXBP3dV8If60mXusel6DM.html
25-08-2020||World||Germany’s new coronavirus infections close to four-month high||Germany’s new coronavirus cases increased at a pace close to Saturday’s four-month high, while the infection rate fell below a key benchmark of 1.0.There were 1,628 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, taking the total to 236,122. The daily gain compared with 633 on Monday and 1,737 on Saturday, which was the most since late April. There was one fatality, lifting the overall number of deaths to 9,276.Click here for full Covid -19 coverageGerman cases have ticked up in recent weeks, mirroring a trend across Europe, with health officials blaming the increase on social gatherings and travelers returning from abroad.Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder warned Tuesday that Germany risks a return to the peak levels of daily new cases close to 7,000 seen at the end of March and beginning of April. He ruled out easing restrictions on movement and social gatherings.“The numbers are worrying and it’s clear that the situation isn’t going to get easier,” Soeder said in a video message posted on Twitter. “Right now it’s not about loosening the reins but tightening them. There is no reason to panic but there is to be greatly concerned.”Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks with Soeder and his regional counterparts on Thursday to discuss Germany’s strategy to contain the virus.On Monday, federal and regional health officials said they plan to scrap a requirement for people returning to Germany from high-risk areas to be tested for the coronavirus as capacity is stretched.Travelers will still be subject to a two-week quarantine, which can be ended after five days if a test result shows they don’t have the virus. The changes will likely take effect in mid-September or early October.Germany’s reproduction factor -- the average number of people infected by one person with the virus -- fell to 0.98 on Monday from 1.08 the day before, according to the latest estimate from the Robert Koch Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-s-new-coronavirus-infections-close-to-four-month-high/story-23oSI4UFnkjpoK07vufpzH.html
25-08-2020||World||China banks hire tens of thousands in latest rescue mission||China’s mega banks are ramping up their recruitment of fresh graduates as a record number enter the labor market, joining other state-owned firms in boosting employment even as lenders deal with plunging earnings and ballooning bad debt.The four biggest state banks, led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., this month kicked off their autumn campus hiring, instead of in November as in previous years. ICBC plans to hire 18,000 graduates this year while China Construction Bank Corp. is adding 16,000, up from 13,000 last year. Bank of China Co. will increase its hiring by 15% to more than 10,000, according to their advertisements. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. already hired 4,500 people during the spring round.“This is in direct response to the government’s call to protect jobs,” said Tang Jianwei, a Shanghai-based analyst at Bank of Communications Co.’s research institute. “Even though the big banks are facing pressure on their own earnings, they still need people to develop the business. Also it’s important for them to assume social responsibility.”China’s largest banks have already been leaned on by Beijing to prop up the economy. They’ve been told to pump cash out to small and medium-sized businesses and forgo profits by lowering interest rates and providing relief on trillions of yuan of troubled loans. Most recently, the government doubled down on pressure to get the major state-owned financial groups to cut salaries.Together, the four biggest banks employ 1.6 million people and Construction Bank’s hiring plans alone approach the combined staff additions made by the largest US and European banks in this year’s first half. Chinese lenders are mostly looking to hire for customer service, wealth management, and information technology, according to job ads on their websites.Representatives for ICBC, AgBank, Construction Bank and Bank of China declined to comment.Yet the tens of thousands of new jobs are but a drop in the bucket. The record 8.7 million of fresh graduates face the bleakest job prospects in decades as the global pandemic has pummeled domestic demand and exports. While inching down recently, surveyed urban unemployment hit a record at the height of China’s virus outbreak in February. Unemployment for those of prime graduate age, 20 to 24, hovered at about 20% in July, according to the country’s statistics bureau.A report by Zhaopin.com, one of China’s biggest recruiting websites, showed that more than a quarter of recent graduates were still looking for a job as of June after hunting for one year, a period during which most would have typically landed jobs in the past.The government has repeatedly pledged support for jobs and rolled out measures such as increasing recruitment of post-grads, strengthening support for more flexible forms of work for graduates and promoting entrepreneurship among young people. The country’s other state-owned firms have vowed to provide at least a million jobs for the most vulnerable groups, including the newly graduated.That has done little to help Crystal Wu, who graduated in July from one of the nation’s top universities with a degree in journalism. In her search, she found herself competing against people who already had work experience and at places receiving thousands of resumes rather than the normal few hundred. At the same time, with the travel ban, many students have dropped plans for study overseas, further tightening the jobs market.“I knew it would be a tough market but this is even worse than I expected,” she said. Wu has opted for doing an internship at a non-profit in Beijing, but has also spent about 20 yuan joining a WeChat group run by a recruitment agency sharing tips on how to get a job at a bank. She prefers a policy lender such Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or China Development Bank.Finance is a coveted job. The average annual salary for non-private financial industry employees stood at about 131,000 yuan ($19,000), the third highest among 19 sectors tracked by the statistics bureau and more than 40% higher than the overall level.Combined earnings at China’s more than 1,000 commercial banks slumped the most in at least a decade in the second quarter as bad loans hit a record 2.7 trillion yuan. The banking regulator said over the weekend that Covid-19 is a centennial catastrophe and that financial industry will need to step up further to get the economy fully back on track.Globally, the biggest US and European banks added 19,000 people to their payrolls in the first half of the year as demand for loans and other services surged during the pandemic and planned staff cuts were largely put on hold. Eight of the top 15 firms increased headcount this year through June, while only four reduced it with HSBC Holdings Plc having the biggest reduction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-banks-hire-tens-of-thousands-in-latest-rescue-mission/story-G9rIe080Urm7d6DtjG3oeP.html
25-08-2020||World||Hong Kong to relax social distancing rules as Covid-19 cases drop||Hong Kong will relax social distancing rules from Friday, allowing evening dining at restaurants and the removal of masks during outdoor exercise, as Covid-19 cases in the city dwindle.Hong Kong will also reopen movie theaters, beauty parlors and some outdoor sports venues, officials said at a briefing on Tuesday. Current social distancing measures -- the strictest in the financial hub to date -- will be extended to Aug. 27.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe exemption on masks during exercise will last for seven days, Chan said, adding that many people had stopped exercising due to the requirement.Despite the easing, restaurant seating will remain limited to two people per table. No food or drinks will be allowed in cinemas, which will provide socially distanced seating for moviegoers. Masks will be required at beauty parlors, with certain exceptions.“Under this new normal, it is hard to expect there will be no confirmed cases in the long term,” Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan said. “We have to accept the possibility of having some specific cases and clusters.”“The government cannot wait until there are no cases in the community to relax social distancing rules,” she said.‘Reassuring’ dropChief Executive Carrie Lam said at a morning briefing that there had been a “reassuring” downward trend in cases. But she added that it was still hard to avoid some small community outbreaks, and that the government would continue monitoring and regularly test workers at the city’s port.Hong Kong reported just seven new locally transmitted infections on Monday.Hong Kong is among regional spots battling a fresh wave of cases after seeing initial success containing the virus, including Vietnam, South Korea and Australia. The government has urged citizens to take part in a voluntary free two-week drive to test the entire population for Covid-19 starting Sept. 1, aided by Chinese experts and labs.Pressure Grows on Hong Kong to Re-Open Economy as Cases DropLam repeated that the testing campaign was fully supported by Beijing and urged participation.“I would appeal to the public to actively participate in the universal testing scheme in order to find silent carriers as soon as possible,” she said. “The reason why Hong Kong at this moment has a capacity to undertake such a large scale universal community testing is because of the assistance rendered by the central people’s government.”More pressureAs Hong Kong’s third wave of virus cases tails off, her government has been under immense pressure from restaurants and other small businesses to relax distancing measures. Smaller businesses have been especially hard hit, with protests last year knocking Hong Kong into a recession even before the pandemic hit.Hong Kong’s Legislative Council will hold a special meeting to discuss the government’s coronavirus efforts on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-relax-social-distancing-rules-as-covid-19-cases-drop/story-WBFCAiiyEDK8ucFQ4YZ21K.html
25-08-2020||World||Starbucks cafe’s Covid outbreak spared employees who wore masks||After a woman with the coronavirus visited a Starbucks cafe north of Seoul this month, more than two dozen patrons tested positive days later. But the four face mask-wearing employees escaped infection.The August 8 outbreak in the South Korean city of Paju is another example of how rapidly the SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread in confined, indoor spaces -- as well as ways to minimize transmission. With health authorities around the world still debating the evidence around face masks, the 27-person cluster linked to the air-conditioned coffee outlet adds more support for their mandatory use to help limit the spread of the Covid-19-causing virus.“This speaks volumes about the role masks can play,” said Ma Sang Hyuk, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Changwon Fatima Hospital in South Korea. “Masks may not provide 100% protection, but there’s nothing out there that’s as effective.”Guidance on face masks is being issued from Australia to Venezuela to help stem the pandemic, which has infected more than 23 million people and killed at least 810,000 worldwide. Face coverings will become mandatory in New Zealand for residents using public transport and inside ride-sharing vehicles, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday. Last week, the World Health Organization issued advice on their use in children.Americans’ Aversion to Mask-Wearing Is Holding Back the EconomyBut resistance to mask-wearing remains in some countries like the U.S., where some people object to being compelled to wear masks when entering shops or restaurants. Misinformation over their effectiveness and safety has also spread.Officials assume that most patrons didn’t consistently wear masks as they were drinking and eating while in the Starbucks Corp. outlet in South Korea, according to Gang Young-do, a spokesperson for the Paju government. A ceiling-mounted air-conditioning was helping to cool the second-floor outlet, he said.“The virus may spread where people can’t wear masks while eating or drinking tea, as witnessed at the Starbucks in Paju,” Jung Eun-kyeong, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, told reporters in Seoul on Sunday.The Starbucks case is one of “the most important opportunities to study risk factors among a more or less controlled cohort of people,” said Arnold Bosman, director at Transmissible BV, a Netherlands-based developer of training materials for outbreak control. “This Starbucks event will be a very valuable training exercise for future generations of epidemiologists.”The Starbucks infections later led to about three dozen more cases outside the coffee shop as of August 24. They add to the more than 3,000 this month that have prompted the South Korean government to consider imposing the highest level of physical distancing rules -- a blow to an economy that’s managed to avert a steep recession so far.Korea Virus Wave Disrupts Recovery as Stronger Measures EyedThe Seoul metropolitan area has emerged as a virus hot spot, and local government authorities made it mandatory this week for all citizens to wear masks both indoors and outdoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/starbucks-cafe-s-covid-outbreak-spared-employees-who-wore-masks/story-FIFypM3OsVLmc2zEf8suGN.html
25-08-2020||World||Nikki Haley invokes her Indian roots, says America is not racist||Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Monday (local time) invoked her Indian roots, saying she was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants and asserted that America is not a racist country.As she took the stage on the first night of the Republican National Convention, Haley said although her parents faced discrimination and hardship, they never gave in to “grievance and hate”, CNN reported.“This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a saree. I was a brown girl in a black and white world,” said the Republican politician, who is the only Indian-American listed to be speaking at the convention.“We faced discrimination and hardship. But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor,” Haley added.The former UN envoy said that America is a story that is a work in progress. “Now is the time to build on that progress, and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone,” she was quoted as saying by CNN.“In much of the Democratic Party, it is now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country.” she said.Haley remarked, “The American people know we can do better. And of course, we know that every single black life is valuable.”“The black cops who have been shot in the line of duty -- they matter. The black small business owners who have watched their life’s work go up in flames -- they matter. The black kids who have been gunned down on the playground -- their lives matter too. Their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets,” she said.Haley’s remarks assume significance as protests across the US broke out earlier this year, after George Floyd, an African-American man, died when an officer named Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd to the ground. Chauvin had kneeled on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.“It does not have to be like this. It was not like this in South Carolina five years ago. Our state came face-to-face with evil. A white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel Church during Bible Study. Twelve African Americans pulled up a chair and prayed with him for an hour. Then he began to shoot,” Haley said.She added that everyone irrespective of their colour and from different political parties came together to remove “a divisive symbol peacefully and respectfully”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nikki-haley-invokes-her-indian-roots-says-america-is-not-racist/story-jrNFZryck8YPaOldxnMwhK.html
25-08-2020||World||Takeaways from first night of the Republican National Convention||The Republican Party kicked off its convention to re-elect US President Donald Trump with an unsubstantiated daytime warning from Trump himself that he may face a “rigged election,” full-throated praise for Trump during the evening events, and warnings that America would crumble without his leadership. Unsubstantiated claims about voter fraudIn an unscheduled speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump repeated his allegation on Monday that voting by mail, a long-standing feature of American elections that is expected to be far more common during the coronavirus pandemic, could lead to an increase in fraud. Independent election security experts say voter fraud is quite rare in the United States.Warnings of a disappearing America Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who led off the evening speeches, called the presidential election nothing less than a decision between “preserving America as we know it and eliminating everything that we love.”The goal, as Trump advisers have said, is not necessarily persuading swing voters to like the president but to contend that voting for Democratic nominee Joe Biden is the bigger risk.Heightened praise for Trump Any presidential party convention is a coronation of the party’s nominee. Last week’s Democratic National Convention featured a full spectrum of people speaking about Biden’s character, from career politicians to an elevator operator. Some speakers’ praise for Trump during the first day of the Republican convention went further. “He started a movement to reclaim our government from the rotten cartel of insiders that have been destroying our country,” Kirk said. “We may not realize it at the time. But Trump is the bodyguard of Western civilization.”A push for Black voters Kim Klacik, an African-American congressional candidate from Baltimore, is a long shot to win her race, but she scored a prime speaking slot on the Republican convention’s first night. Klacik was part of an effort on the first night of the convention to showcase Black supporters of Trump following a Democratic convention that highlighted that party’s diversity. Trump received just 8 percent of the African-American vote in 2016. His opponent’s running mate, Kamala Harris, seeks to become the first Black woman vice president. Trump has regularly criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. “The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave their mental plantation,” Georgia state Representative Vernon Jones said. “We’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations. But I have news for Joe Biden. We are free.

But Trump, who has frequently expressed anger at China over the coronavirus pandemic, said last week he had postponed talks with China because “I don’t want to deal with them now.”“Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,” USTR said.China’s commerce ministry, in a separate statement, confirmed that the two countries had a ‘constructive dialog’ and agreed to continue pushing forward the implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal. The USTR statement said the two sides “addressed steps that China has taken to effectuate structural changes called for by the agreement that will ensure greater protection for intellectual property rights, remove impediments to American companies in the areas of financial services and agriculture, and eliminate forced technology transfer.”“The parties also discussed the significant increases in purchases of US products by China as well as future actions needed to implement the agreement,” it said.Chinese purchases of US goods are running well behind the pace needed to meet a first year increase of $77 billion specified in the deal, according to official data. But China has increased the pace of farm product purchases in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-chinese-officials-optimistic-on-phase-1-trade-deal-after-phone-call/story-6nZZrrKhChr2O6l0IdUo1M.html
25-08-2020||World||‘Five big lies of Pakistan exposed’, says Indian Mission at UN||India on Monday (local time) hit out at Pakistan over lies peddled by its mission at UN. In a strong statement, the Indian Mission said that Pakistan has put out a false statement claiming that their envoy Munir Akram spoke at the United Nations Security Council while the session was not open to non-members.“We have seen a statement put out by the Pakistan Mission to the UN, claiming that these remarks were made by the Permanent Representative of Pakistan at the UN Security Council. We fail to comprehend where exactly did the Permanent Representative of Pakistan make his statement since the Security Council Session today was not open to non-members of the Security Council”, Indian mission at UN said in a statement.The statement further says that the detailed statement exposed the ‘five big lies’ being peddled and pushed by Pakistan.Dismissing assertions that Pakistan has been a target of cross-border terrorism for decades, the Indian Mission in its statement said: “A lie repeated a hundred times will not become truth. The biggest sponsor of cross-border terrorism against India now tries to masquerade itself as a victim of terrorism by India!”“Pakistan is home to the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations. Many of the sanctioned terrorists and entities continue to operate with impunity inside Pakistan. Prime Minister of Pakistan admitted at the UN General Assembly in 2019, the presence of 40,000-50,000 terrorists inside Pakistan,” it added.It further rejected the claim that Pakistan has decimated Al Qaeda from the region.“The claim that Pakistan has decimated Al Qaeda from the region. Perhaps, the Permanent Representative of Pakistan is not aware that Osama Bin Laden was hiding in their own country in plain sight, and it is the US forces which got him inside Pakistan. Nor have they heard their Prime Minister refer to Osama Bin Laden as a “martyr”,” the statement read.Indian Mission at UN said Pakistan makes the “laughable claim that India has hired terrorist as mercenaries to hit them.”“Coming from a country which is a known sponsor of cross-border terrorism, which has made the world suffer due to its actions, this claim is nothing short of being preposterous!” it said.The statement also rejected claims of Indians being in 1267 sanctions list. “The 1267 Sanctions list is public, and the world can see none of these individuals are in it. The 1267 Committee works on the basis of evidence, and not random accusations thrown in to divert their time and attention,” read the statement.Further, it slammed Pakistan for making “ridiculous assertions” about internal affairs of India.“Pakistan makes ridiculous assertions about internal affairs of India. This is a country whose minority population has dropped drastically from 1947 to what it is today which is just about 3 per cent, which is nothing short of systemic cleansing,” it said.“This is in addition to false allegations about India’s sovereign actions in the Union Territory of J&K, which are for the welfare of the people. The world has seen through their lies yet again,” the statement added.This comes after Pakistan’s Permanent Representative Munir Akram put out a random statement today masquerading it as if the statement was made by him to the United Nations Security Council.But for their purpose, the statement was picked up by Pakistani media and was portraying it as Munir Akram’s statement at the Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-big-lies-of-pakistan-exposed-says-indian-mission-at-un/story-cMnt2cWIjekcAhGierbz2L.html
25-08-2020||World||In ‘megafire era,’ California battles record wildfires, pristine redwoods burn||More dry-lightning storms hit California on Monday after sparking 625 fires last week as authorities warned the state was trapped in a “megafire era” triggered by climate change. The worst of the wildfires, including the second and third largest in California history, burned in the San Francisco Bay Area with roughly 240,000 people under evacuation orders or warnings across the state.Much of Northern California, including the Sierra Nevada Mountains and coast, was under a “red flag” alert for dry lightning and high winds, but the Bay Area got a reprieve as storms skipped the region of around 8 million, the National Weather Service reported. Close to 300 lightning strikes sparked 10 blazes overnight and more “sleeper fires” were likely burning undiscovered in areas shrouded by dense smoke, Governor Gavin Newsom said.Also read: In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in CaliforniaOne huge blaze blackened ancient coastal redwood forests south of San Francisco that have never seen fire due to usually high relative humidity levels, Newsom said. “We are in a different climate and we are dealing with different climate conditions that are precipitating fires the likes of which we have not seen in modern recorded history,” Newsom told a news briefing.The wildfires, ignited by over 13,000 lightning strikes from dry thunderstorms across Northern and Central California since Aug. 15, have killed at least seven people and destroyed over 1,200 homes and other structures. “We are essentially living in a megafire era,” said Cal Fire Santa Clara Unit Chief Jake Hess after California suffered four of the five largest wildfires in its history during the last three years. Evacuees returned to homes and vineyards torched by the LNU Lightning Complex wildfire, the second largest in state history, raging across Napa, Sonoma, Lake, Yolo and Solano counties.“Nothing’s left, but we’re safe,” said a man, who did not give his name in an online video showing everything but his patio furniture destroyed at his house near Vacaville. Smoke from fires that have burned over 1.2 million acres (485,620 hectares), an area more than three times larger than Los Angeles, created unhealthy conditions for much of Northern California and drifted as far as Kansas.Firefighters gained 22% containment of the LNU fire, but to the south, the SCU Lightning Complex fire was nearly as large and only 10% contained. Firefighters threw most of their resources at its west flank burning less than 10 miles from downtown San Jose. “This fire is by far a long ways away from being done,” said Cal Fire incident commander Jeff Ike of the blaze affecting seven counties.With lower temperatures, clouds gathered over coastal forest east of San Jose, helping firefighters achieve 13% containment on the CZU Lightning Complex fire. Some Santa Clara county residents saw the sun after 10 days of dense smoke.“Omg!!! The sun!!! The sun!!! The sun!!! Clouds and our shadows too. Oh how we’ve missed you in California,” tweeted Shana Anderson-Nute, a marketing agent from Sunnyvale.Over 14,000 firefighters were on the wildfires, with 91 fire crews traveling from seven states and National Guard troops arriving from four states, Newsom said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-megafire-era-california-battles-record-wildfires-pristine-redwoods-burn/story-Mu8zRSJ6VXyM0gQyo9O2EN.html

The witnesses asked not to be named for fear of repercussions.The fighting in Bugarama district in Rumonge province began on Sunday and continued into Monday and people were hiding in the bush, a resident who escaped the attack told Reuters.“The gunmen kidnapped everyone they met and killed them before engaging in fighting with the army on Sunday morning,” the man said. He asked for anonymity to avoid reprisals.A senior government official said the attack, which occurred as the country was holding local elections, was not unexpected and potentially linked to the imminent repatriation of refugees from Rwanda.“The government anticipated that armed groups opposed to the government will attempt to carry out attacks ahead of the first repatriation of refugees from Rwanda,” the official said.Rwanda hosts thousands of refugees from neighbouring Burundi who fled violence in 2015.A message posted on Twitter claiming to be from Red Tabara, a Burundian rebel group that says it is based in Congo’s South Kivu region, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had “neutralized” nine policemen and about 20 militants. The veracity of the account or the message could not be verified.The statement on Twitter said presidential elections in May, won by the ruling party’s candidate Evariste Ndayishimiye, were “a farce” and called for a new vote.The statement also called for the disarmament of several militia groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a group founded by Hutu officials who fled Rwanda after orchestrating the 1994 genocide, which it claims has infiltrated security forces in Burundi.The army did not respond to requests for comment on the fighting.Burundi has an ethnic Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, the same split as in Rwanda.It has been plagued by decades of ethnic and political violence, including a bloody civil war which lasted 12 years in which 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed.

25-08-2020||World||Virus closures send Atlantic City casinos to $112M Q2 loss||The coronavirus outbreak sent Atlantic City’s casinos plunging to a $112 million second quarter gross operating loss as the gambling houses remained closed for the entire three-month period, according to figures released Monday by state gambling regulators.That compares with an operating profit of nearly $160 million in the second quarter of last year.Only one of the nine casinos — the Golden Nugget — reported an operating profit for the quarter, and that was helped by the market-leading internet gambling operation. The casino made $3.1 million, down nearly 69% from a year earlier when it made over $10 million.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy ordered the casinos closed on March 16, and did not allow them to begin reopening until July 2. That more than covers the entire second quarter, the months of April, May and June.The casinos offered online gambling and sports betting during the quarter, which provided them some revenue during the period their physical buildings were shuttered. The nine casinos collectively reported $121.4 million in net revenue, down nearly 85% from the second quarter of 2019.The individual casinos, as well as gambling regulators, dismissed the numbers as not comparable to last year, when the industry was in full swing. Rather, they concentrated on efforts to convince customers the reopened casinos are clean and safe.“During this period, the casinos undertook an amazing effort and expense to prepare a safe environment for the return of employees and guests,” said James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. “That critical investment enabled the casinos to begin welcoming back visitors with appropriate limits in July, and started Atlantic City on the road to recovery.”“This closure was a setback to Ocean’s momentum gained through February 2020,” said Terry Glebocki, CEO of the Ocean Casino Resort. “We want to thank our employees who worked tirelessly to prepare us for reopening and are happy to have two-thirds of our workforce back in the building.”Ocean had an $11.8 million loss, compared to a $1.2 million loss in the second quarter of last year.The Borgata had the biggest loss at more than $40 million for the quarter, compared to a $55 million profit in the second quarter of last year.Hard Rock had a loss of $18.2 million, compared to a profit of $11.2 million a year ago; Harrah’s had a $15.1 million loss, compared to a $23 million profit a year ago; Resorts had a $12.6 million loss, compared to a $5.3 million profit a year ago; and Tropicana had an $11.8 million loss, compared to a $22.6 million profit last year.Caesars had a $9.9 million loss, compared to a profit of $16.3 million a year ago, and Bally’s had a $8.7 million loss, compared to a $9.3 million profit a year ago.The shutdown of the physical casinos provided an opportunity for online gambling operations, including the state’s two internet-only entities. Caesars Interactive NJ earned $7.7 million in the second quarter, up more than 54% from a year earlier, and Resorts Digital posted a profit of $5.7 million, up more than 194% from a year earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-closures-send-atlantic-city-casinos-to-112m-q2-loss/story-HfSxuFfyPERFKvGjOFqbyI.html

In 2016, around 40 detainees broke out from a high-security prison in Toliary in southern Madagascar.The police and army were called in on Sunday after almost 100 prisoners turned against guards with rocks and a stolen gun.The ministry said the weapon had been recovered and has vowed to boost security at penitentiaries across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-escapees-back-in-jail-after-madagascar-prison-break/story-jFqJPjyTNaQCXw9EWCMKrL.html
25-08-2020||World||Even fastest man alive may not be able to outrun coronavirus||World-record sprinter and eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt said on Monday he was self isolating while waiting to hear back from the health ministry after taking a coronavirus test this weekend.Jamaican radio station Nationwide News had reported earlier on Monday that Bolt, who holds world records in the 100m and 200m distance, had contracted the virus.In a video message posted to Instagram, which Bolt appears to have taped himself while lying in bed, he said he saw the report when he woke up and scrolled through social media.Instead of explicitly confirming it, he said he took a test on Saturday because he had to fly for work, but did not have any symptoms.“I am going to quarantine myself and wait on the confirmation to see what is the protocol,” said the only sprinter to win the 100m and 200m golds at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016).“Just to be safe I quarantined myself and just taking it easy.”Days earlier, on Aug. 21, Bolt celebrated his 34th birthday with a big bash where many partygoers were mask-free, dancing to the hit “Lockdown” by Jamaican reggae singer Koffee, videos posted on social media showed.“Best birthday ever,” Bolt wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself holding his baby girl Olympia who was born this May.Daily confirmed cases have risen in the Caribbean island nation of around 3 million, to more than 50 over the past four days from less than 10 just a few weeks ago.Jamaica now has had 1,529 confirmed cases, with 622 active cases, 16 deaths from coronavirus.Officials put the uptick in cases down to the reopening of international borders as well as celebrations over a long weekend in August marking Independence Day and Emancipation Day.They also put the blame at the feet of people who refuse to wear masks and practice social distancing.The pickup has raised concerns over national elections that Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called for in September, six months ahead of schedule.Holness on Sunday suspended all his own campaigning activities includes motorcades, home visits and rallies and asked other parties to do the same.Authorities have also delayed the reopening of schools for one month, several communities are under quarantine, and citizens are under a national curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.The Commissioner of Police, Major Antony Anderson, has tested positive for the virus, and several government offices and major businesses have shut down as positive cases have emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-fastest-man-alive-may-not-be-able-to-outrun-coronavirus/story-zZUHthLpRDbjGChrlnn85N.html

Pakistan had proposed the upgrade for submarines in its inventory and the Yuan class submarines being manufactured under joint China-Pakistan project in China.The AIP system would have enhanced the combat capabilities of its submarines by allowing the diesel engines to run without atmospheric air for a week or more.Conventional submarines have to surface almost every second day to run their air-breathing diesel engines, running the risk of detection.An Indian official said Germany’s refusal to help Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government with this technology would “adversely impact its lethality and vulnerability”.India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation is indigenously developing the system for the navy’s submarines. Last year, the effort crossed several milestones when it successfully tested a land-based prototype that New Delhi had then declared would have a “force multiplier effect on lethality of a diesel electric submarine”.Pakistan watchers in Delhi said the primary reason for Germany to take a hard stance on Pakistan’s request was being attributed to its role in promoting terror, particularly Pakistan’s failure to cooperate in identifying the perpetrators of the truck bomb attack on the Germany Embassy in Kabul in May 2017.Nearly 150 people were killed in the bombing that devastated a central area of Kabul near the embassy. The bombing, counted among the deadliest terror strikes in recent years, was linked to the Haqqani Network that is known in counter-terror circuits to be supported and directed by Pakistan deep state.The Afghan National Directorate of Security had then gone on record to blame the Haqqani network based in neighbouring Pakistan for the terror strike and accused Pakistan’s spy agency ISI of helping in planning the attack. German officials have noted that Islamabad hadn’t pursued the investigations at its end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-dashes-imran-khan-hopes-to-make-pak-subs-more-lethal-says-won-t-help/story-YaFM0q6WyBvChqmXoYOZNN.html

25-08-2020||World||FDA chief apologizes for overstating plasma effect on virus||Responding to an outcry from medical experts, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Tuesday apologized for overstating the life-saving benefits of treating Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma.Scientists and medical experts have been pushing back against the claims about the treatment since President Donald Trump’s announcement on Sunday that the FDA had decided to issue emergency authorization for convalescent plasma, taken from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus and rich in disease-fighting antibodies.Trump hailed the decision as a historic breakthrough even though the treatment’s value has not been established. The announcement on the eve of Trump’s Republican National Convention raised suspicions that it was politically motivated to offset critics of the president’s handling of the pandemic.Hahn had echoed Trump in saying that 35 more people out of 100 would survive the coronavirus if they were treated with the plasma. That claim vastly overstated preliminary findings of Mayo Clinic observations.Hahn’s mea culpa comes at a critical moment for the FDA which, under intense pressure from the White House, is responsible for deciding whether upcoming vaccines are safe and effective in preventing Covid-19.The 35% figure drew condemnation from other scientists and some former FDA officials, who called on Hahn to correct the record.“I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified. What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction,” Hahn tweeted.The FDA made the decision based on data the Mayo Clinic collected from hospitals around the country that were using plasma on patients in wildly varying ways -- and there was no comparison group of untreated patients, meaning no conclusions can be drawn about overall survival. People who received plasma with the highest levels of antibodies fared better than those given plasma with fewer antibodies, and those treated sooner after diagnosis fared better than those treated later.Hahn and other Trump administration officials presented the difference as an absolute survival benefit, rather than a relative difference between two treatment groups. Former FDA officials said the misstatement was inexcusable, particularly for a cancer specialist like Hahn.“It’s extraordinary to me that a person involved in clinical trials could make that mistake,” said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official under the Obama administration who now leads the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest. “It’s mind-boggling.”The 35% benefit was repeated by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at Sunday’s briefing and promoted on Twitter by the FDA’s communication staff. The number did not appear in FDA’s official letter justifying the emergency authorization.Hahn has been working to bolster confidence in the agency’s scientific process, stating in interviews and articles that the FDA will only approve a vaccine that meets preset standards for safety and efficacy.Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University said Hahn’s performance Sunday undermined those efforts.“I think the integrity of the FDA took a hit, if I were Stephen Hahn I would not have appeared at such a political show,” said Gostin, a public health attorney.Hahn pushed back Tuesday morning against suggestions that the plasma announcement was timed to boost Trump ahead of the Republican convention.“The professionals and the scientists at FDA independently made this decision, and I completely support them,” Hahn said, appearing on “CBS This Morning.”Trump has recently accused some FDA staff, without evidence, of deliberately holding up new treatments “for political reasons.” And Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said over the weekend that FDA scientists “need to feel the heat.”The administration has sunk vast resources into the race for a vaccine, and Trump aides have been hoping that swift progress could help the president ahead of November’s election.At Sunday’s briefing Hahn did not correct Trump’s description of the regulatory move as a “breakthrough.” He also did not contradict Trump’s unsupported claim of a “deep state” effort at the agency working to slow down approvals.Former FDA officials said the political pressure and attacks against the FDA carry enormous risk of undermining trust in the agency just when it’s needed most. A vaccine will only be effective against the virus if it is widely taken by the U.S. population.“I think the constant pressure, the name-calling, the perception that decisions are made under pressure is damaging,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, who previously served as FDA’s chief scientist. “We need the American people to have full confidence that medicines and vaccines are safe.”Convalescent plasma is a century-old approach to treating the flu, measles and other viruses. But the evidence so far has not been conclusive about whether it works, when to administer it and what dose is needed.The FDA emergency authorization is expected to increase its availability to additional hospitals. But more than 70,000 Americans have already received the therapy under FDA’s “expanded access” program. That program tracks patients’ response, but cannot prove whether the plasma played a role in their recovery.Some scientists worry the broadened FDA access to the treatment will make it harder to complete studies of whether the treatment actually works. Those studies require randomizing patients to either receive plasma or a dummy infusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-chief-apologizes-for-overstating-plasma-effect-on-virus/story-dI1TG38p5u78SVdeqGfcZK.html

However, Xi stressed that this is not about “isolated domestic circulation,” but rather an open structure that will involve greater connection with the global system.China should actively cooperate with “all nations, regions and enterprises who are willing to work with us, including U.S. states, local areas and companies,” the president said.Separately, Sing Tao Daily reported Monday that Xi may visit the innovation hub of Shenzhen in September to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong.If it happens, the visit would be closely watched for any indication on China’s stance on economic opening up and also relations with the U.S., which have continued to worsen due to the coronavirus and other issues including technology and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-stresses-china-needs-independent-innovation-as-world-changes/story-1CWST3oxvUeclvjlOTbmpJ.html
