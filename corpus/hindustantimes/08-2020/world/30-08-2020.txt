Nationally, metrics on new cases, deaths, hospitalizations and the positivity rates of tests are all declining but there are emerging hotspots in the Midwest. Many of the new cases in Iowa are in the counties that are home to the University of Iowa and Iowa State University, which are holding some in-person classes. Colleges and universities around the country have seen outbreaks after students returned to campus, forcing some to switch to online-only learning. Infections have also risen after an annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota drew more than 365,000 people from across the country from Aug. 7 to 16. The South Dakota health department said 88 cases have been traced to the rally. More than eight months into the pandemic, the United States continues to struggle with testing, seeing the number of people tested fall in recent weeks.Many health officials and at least 33 states have rejected the new Covid-19 testing guidance issued by the Trump administration last week that said those exposed to the virus and without symptoms may not need testing. Public health officials believe the United States needs to test more frequently to find asymptomatic Covid-19 carriers to slow the spread of the disease. While the United States has the most recorded infections in the world, it ranks tenth based on cases per capita, with Brazil, Peru and Chile having higher rates of infection, according to a Reuters tally.The United States also has the most deaths in the world at over 182,000 and ranks 11th for deaths per capita, exceeded by Sweden, Brazil, Italy, Chile, Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Peru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-cases-approach-6-million-as-midwest-schools-face-outbreaks/story-CV6xVaLvuOtfKlLG7R8OqJ.html
30-08-2020||World||Close UK campuses to prevent second Covid-19 wave, warn British academics||UK universities beginning the next academic year from September should not open campuses to prevent a major public health crisis, a leading union of lecturers warned on Sunday, given the risk to students moving across homes and campuses throughout the country amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic.The warning comes within days of official statistics showing that more than double the number of student visas were issued to Indians in the year ending June 2020 compared to the previous year. Visa rules have been revised to allow for online learning, but universities have been bracing for a fall in non-EU students turning up next month.The University and College Union (UCU) said the movement of over a million students across the UK to universities far from homes to begin courses “risks doing untold damage to people’s health and exacerbating the worst health crisis of our lifetimes”. It wants all teaching to move online in the first term as recommended by experts in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The union, which represents over 120,000 academics, lecturers, trainers, instructors, researchers, managers and other staff, alleged that there is no functioning track and trace system in place, nor any UK-wide plans to regularly test students or staff.Claiming that the push to get students back on campus was being driven by what it called “a dangerous desire” to get back to business as usual, before it was safe to do so, the UCU said instead of allowing universities to reopen, the government should step in and underwrite any lost funding for the higher education sector.The union said universities that rely on tuition and accommodation fees feared lost income and the government had to make it clear now that they will not suffer financially for doing the right thing in terms of public health.UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: “Moving a million plus students around the country is a recipe for disaster and risks leaving ill-prepared universities as the care homes of a second wave. It is time for the government to finally take some decisive and responsible action in this crisis and tell universities to abandon plans for face-to-face teaching.”“Refusing to act now will only store up problems further down the line as courses are forced to move online and students forced into lockdown. It is no good blaming students later on for a problem that could have been avoided by government action,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/close-uk-campuses-to-prevent-second-covid-19-wave-warn-british-academics/story-xZE5CEQbWBe34NKcr3h5cM.html

30-08-2020||World||What’s next as Japan PM Abe quits, potential successors||The abrupt resignation of Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, triggered an election in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as its president, followed by a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister.Abe and his cabinet will run the government until a new premier is elected but will not be able to adopt new policies. The winner of the party election will hold the post until the end of Abe’s LDP term in September 2021.The new party president is virtually assured the premiership, since the LDP has a majority in parliament’s lower house.Usually, the party must announce the election for its leader a month in advance, and its members of parliament vote along with grassroots members. But with Abe’s sudden departure, the LDP will hold a slimmed-down election to avoid a political vacuum, aiming for a vote around Sept. 13-15, public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday.Here are details on some likely contenders.YOSHIHIDE SUGA, 71Suga, a self-made politician, plans to join the race, media said on Sunday.A loyal lieutenant since Abe’s troubled 2006-2007 first term, Suga was among the allies who pushed Abe to run again in 2012. Back in office, Abe tapped him as chief cabinet secretary, a pivotal role that includes acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.LDP secretary-general Toshihiro Nikai’s faction will likely support Suga if he runs, Takeo Kawamura, a senior faction official, said on Sunday.Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the imperial era name “Reiwa” for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito.Suga’s clout was dented by scandals that toppled two cabinet ministers close to him last October.SHIGERU ISHIBA, 63A hawkish former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe, Ishiba regularly tops surveys of lawmakers whom voters want to see as the next premier but is less popular with the party’s lawmakers.The scaled-down LDP race could disadvantage Ishiba, a soft-spoken security maven who has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.He defeated Abe in the first round of a party election in 2012, thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. In a 2018 party leadership poll, Ishiba lost heavily to Abe.He has criticised the Bank of Japan’s ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.FUMIO KISHIDA, 63Kishida was Abe’s foreign minister from 2012 to 2017, but diplomacy remained mainly in the prime minister’s grip.The low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Abe’s preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys. He has told supporters he is in the race.Kishida hails from one of the party’s more dovish factions and is seen as less keen on revising the pacifist postwar constitution than Abe, for whom it was a cherished goal.The BOJ’s hyper-easy monetary policy “cannot go on forever,” Kishida has said.TARO KONO, 56Defence Minister Kono has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.He won the backing, should he choose to run, of Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the high-profile son of a popular former prime minister, who ruled himself out of the race on Sunday.Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, Kono is a former foreign minister and minister for administrative reform.He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to “comfort women”, a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan’s wartime military brothels.TOSHIMITSU MOTEGI, 64Abe’s foreign minister was previously economy minister, facing off with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in tough negotiations.Motegi was also trade minister under Abe when he returned to power in 2012, tackling talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact.Educated at the University of Tokyo and Harvard, Motegi was first elected to the lower house in 1993 from the then-opposition Japan New Party. He joined the LDP in 1995.SEIKO NODA, TOMOMI INADANoda, 59, has made no secret of her desire to become Japan’s first female premier. An Abe critic, the former internal affairs minister, who also held the portfolio for women’s empowerment, fell short of the backing to join the 2918 LDP race.Inada, 61, a fiscally hawkish former defence minister and LDP policy chief, has expressed interest in joining the race to become the country’s first female premier. She is known as conservative Abe supporter.KATSUNOBU KATO, YASUTOSHI NISHIMURAAs health minister, Kato, 64, was in the limelight in the early days of Japan’s coronavirus outbreak, but Economy Minister Nishimura, 57, a former trade official, has since emerged as point person on virus policy.In 2015, Kato, a father of four, was handed the portfolio for boosting Japan’s rock-bottom birth rate, a task that has had little success. He is a former finance ministry official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-s-next-as-japan-pm-abe-quits-potential-successors/story-s8jXCdtF3mKnKOwQadZ92H.html

While there has been “no local evidence” that these groups are at a higher risk of being infected, they will be offered tests “given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with the members of the public”, the MOH said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The costs of the tests will be fully borne by the government, it said on Saturday, adding that authorities will reach out to the groups progressively.The ministry on Sunday reported 54 new Covid-19 cases. The new cases included eight cases from the community and seven imported. The rest were migrant workers. To date, Singapore has 56,771 confirmed Covid-19 cases. With 110 more patients discharged from hospitals, 55,447 have fully recovered from the infection. Meanwhile, the MOH has also reiterated that makeshift face coverings such as bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters should not be used, as per the recommendations of the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Noting that there have been recent queries on the efficacy of such makeshift coverings in preventing disease transmission, the MOH said that they may not perform as well as purpose-built masks as they may not have a good fit around the wearer’s nose and mouth and are made from materials that are not specific for disease prevention. “A mask should be worn such that it closely and completely covers the wearer’s nose and mouth, without leaving a gap between the mask and the face,” the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-offer-free-covid-19-tests-to-taxi-drivers-food-delivery-workers-hawkers/story-VtvmG6WdmNFAL7e2eSjZ0N.html

It was not immediately clear if some had since been found.The Aug. 4 explosion left 300,000 people homeless and caused $15 billion in direct damage, said the report issued on Sunday by the presidency of the council of ministers. It said 50,000 houses, nine major hospitals and 178 schools had been damaged.The outgoing government quit over the blast. The presidency will talk to parliamentary blocs on Monday to designate a new prime minister, a day before French President Emmanuel Macron visits to press leaders to act to save the country from a deep financial crisis rooted in endemic corruption and mismanagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-port-blast-death-toll-rises-to-190/story-40WwmcblsIazBkCaxq67tI.html

Jeff Harrigian, US Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa commander, in the statement.“While the Russian aircraft were operating in international airspace, they jeopardised the safety of flight of the aircraft involved. We expect them to operate within international standards set to ensure safety and prevent accidents,” he was quoted as saying.Earlier on Friday, the B-52s flew over 30 NATO countries “to demonstrate NATO solidarity, enhance readiness and provide training opportunities aimed at enhancing interoperability for all participating aircrews from the US and NATO allies,” read a statement from US European Command, according to CNN.This comes amid tensions between the US and Russia and questions over Washington’s commitment to the alliance in the wake of a recent decision to cut US troop levels in Europe.US President Donald Trump had earlier criticised NATO member countries for not meeting the alliance target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence. Trump then asked the Pentagon to reduce the number of American troops in Germany, citing Berlin’s failure of committing to spend 2 per cent of its GDP on defence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unnecessary-potential-for-midair-collisions-2-russian-aircraft-intercept-us-air-force-bomber-over-black-sea/story-XiEpJ9MaduCqf2uFiQHsCK.html
30-08-2020||World||Lebanon’s powerhouse Hezbollah hit by backlash after August 4 blast||Sara Jaafar joined a group of political activists gathered on August 4 to discuss strategies to challenge Lebanon’s entrenched rulers when their building was shaken and the windows blasted out by the giant explosion that rocked Beirut.She took cover from the flying debris, thoughts rushing through her head of past political assassinations in Lebanon. Her immediate reaction was that Hezbollah, the militant group that dominates power here, was targeting the dissidents’ meeting.The blast was in fact at the port of Beirut, caused by a stockpile of ammonium nitrate stored there for years. So far, it appears to be a result of longtime government mismanagement. No direct connection to Hezbollah has emerged in the explosion that wreaked destruction across the city and killed at least 180 people. Theories abound about what triggered the explosion, including even a possible Israeli strike against Hezbollah.Jaafar’s initial reaction reflected the fear Hezbollah has instilled among many Lebanese and the power it has succeeded in projecting over the past decade.For many, the Iran-backed Hezbollah now stands at the top of Lebanon’s sectarian-based system of power — and so is complicit in the corruption many blame for the port disaster and for driving the country into near bankruptcy.“Who controls most of everything?” asked Jaafar, a secular Shiite. Hezbollah and its ally, President Michel Aoun, “are the people in charge. ... They bear the responsibility.”In the wake of the blast, Hezbollah has come under unprecedented public criticism and its role in Lebanese politics under intense scrutiny.Cardboard effigies of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and other politicians were hanged on nooses at a rally after the blast. Some accused Hezbollah of storing weapons at the port, a claim it denies. Hezbollah’s political rivals seized the opportunity to fan hostilities against it and its allies.Social media posts mocked Nasrallah’s speeches. One noted how the US killing of Iranian commander Qassim Soleimani in Iraq in January prompted Nasrallah to weep and threaten revenge — while in his first speech following the blast, he was smiling and calm.“There is a paradox there with Hezbollah. They have never been more powerful politically and militarily. But they have never faced such an array of challenges as well,” said Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based Hezbollah expert.The season of discontent against Hezbollah comes as Lebanese suffer under an economic crash that has driven nearly half of the population into poverty. Rather than push for reform, critics say, Hezbollah has stood by its political allies who resist change. It also denied support to nationwide protests that erupted in October demanding the end of the dysfunctional political structure. US sanctions against Iran and Hezbollah made things harder.For years, Hezbollah maintained a clean reputation and distance from Lebanon’s political elite.It developed its power and resources as a resistance movement against Israel and became virtually a state within a state, heading a powerful military force and a welfare network for its Shiite supporters.Hezbollah remains Lebanon’s only armed force outside the military. It controls the borders and plays a crucial role in Iranian-backed wars in the region, like Syria’s.In 2005, an explosion killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and changed Lebanon’s political course. The bombing, blamed on Hezbollah, sent nearly a million people into the streets, forcing Hezbollah’s ally Syria to end its occupation of Lebanon.After that, Hezbollah began seeping into the system — from having a handful of Parliament members to becoming Lebanon’s most powerful political faction.Hezbollah and its allies formed the last Cabinet. Its failures came to be seen as Hezbollah’s, Blanford said.And they were many: The government failed to enact reforms, stem the financial meltdown or reach a rescue package with the International Monetary Fund. It finally resigned after the explosion.Hezbollah plays a significant role in forming the new government.To deflect criticism, Nasrallah addressed supporters several times, denying Hezbollah had anything to do with the port explosion.He made thinly veiled warnings to critics. In an Aug. 14 speech, Nasrallah warned repeatedly against pushing Lebanon toward civil war. He urged supporters to “hold onto their anger” over criticism, hinting it would be unleashed against opponents.In Hezbollah’s stronghold in the Beirut suburb Dahiyeh, supporters saw the explosion as a conspiracy to weaken Lebanon and the group.“We had two places to bring money and assistance from: the port and the airport. Something had to happen somewhere so that the siege (on Lebanon) is tightened and so that these people rise against their rulers,” said Issam Kaeen, a 42-year-old coffee shop owner.Mohammed Abi Shakra, who owns a women’s wear shop, said an Israeli attack on the port can’t be ruled out. “This is a conspiracy against the Lebanese people to make them poor, to incite civil war,” he said.Meanwhile, social tensions are on the rise. Opponents of Hezbollah clashed twice with the group’s supporters, including a gunfight on Thursday that killed two bystanders and wounded several. Gunmen reportedly opened fire over religious banners raised by Hezbollah supporters.“There is no god but God, and Nasrallah is the enemy of God,” mourners chanted at a funeral of one of the killed.Following the explosion, Hezbollah made some internal changes, part of a shift inward after the nationwide protests and its receding role in Syria’s war, an official with the group said. The group’s security chief was given a bigger portfolio and the head of an agency that coordinates with allies was replaced. Media operations are also changing, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to confirm media reports.After the blast, Jaafar and other victims demanded an international investigation. “We lost our homes, our kids, our fathers and our city. We lost everything,” she said in an angry speech at a gathering near the port.“All of them means all of them,” the small crowd chanted, naming Nasrallah among other leaders they want out of power.Her apartment in a landmark building nearby was devastated by the blast. An architect, Jaafar is considering leaving the destruction as a reminder of how it all went wrong.Active since the October protests, Jaafar is frustrated by the small turnout in rallies since the blast but recognizes an outpouring of public anger is only one requisite for change. She, like many in Lebanon, sees her country’s political crisis as a product of rivalry between Hezbollah’s patron, Iran, and the US and Gulf states. Only a resolution to that conflict will force change, she said.“I understand why they exist. They filled the gap where the state failed,” said Jaafar. But “we want a real nation, a real country,” she said. “This is a jungle.”Jaafar said protest activists are realizing they must work with allies within the system for change — push for early elections and challenge Hezbollah and its allies in Parliament.“We won’t get rid of them in one election,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-s-powerhouse-hezbollah-hit-by-backlash-after-august-4-blast/story-xZ0RYtTzbdXJAuTjPqW11L.html

LDP policy chief and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba have also indicated their intention to participate in the election.Also read| Abenomics, stable rule and defence spending: A look at Shinzo Abe’s 3-decade careerThe Prime Minister has directed Nikai to make decisions regarding the party leadership race.Suga, who has been serving as the government’s top spokesperson since Abe assumed power in 2012, is one of the Prime Minister’s closest aides and was considered a potential contender.He had earlier ruled out succeeding Abe, saying he “never thought about it,” according to Kyodo News Agency.Abe, the longest-serving Japanese Prime Minister, is stepping down due to ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease which earlier forced him to resign from the post of the premiership in 2007.The 65-year-old leader said on Friday that he will continue to carry out his duties until the LDP elects its new leader, who will subsequently become the new prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-chief-cabinet-secretary-to-join-race-for-succeeding-shinzo-abe/story-XCDb2CXU9kLESp1d01qPhL.html
30-08-2020||World||Anger after French magazine depicts Black lawmaker as slave||A French magazine apologized Saturday after portraying a Black lawmaker as a slave, as France’s government and officials across the political spectrum decried the publication.The legislator, Danielle Obono from the far-left party Defiant France, said the publication flies in the face of those who complain that free speech is threatened by the fight against racism and sexism.“You can still write racist s—- in a rag illustrated with a Black French parliament member repainted as a slave,” she tweeted. “The extreme right — odious, stupid and cruel.”The magazine, Valeurs Actuelles, which caters to readers on the right and far right, apologized in a statement Saturday. Deputy editor Tagdual Denis told BFM television that the image wasn’t designed to wound Obono and denied that it was an attention-getting ploy. But he added: “What I regret is that we are always accused of racism ... we are politically incorrect, it’s in our DNA.”Anti-racism activists said the publication reflected a creeping acceptance of extremist views, fueled by social media.Prime Minister Jean Castex from the conservative Republicans party tweeted: “This revolting publication calls for unambiguous condemnation. ... The fight against racism will always transcend our differences.”The junior minister for equality and the only Black member of the French government, Elisabeth Moreno, tweeted that “I don’t share Danielle Obono’s ideas, but today I offer her all my support.” A similar refrain came from politicians from multiple parties, including the treasurer of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party.Obono, who was born in the former French colony of Gabon, said later on BFM that “I hurt for my republic, I hurt for my France.” She called the publication a political attack on her and others who fight against “the racism, stigmatization that millions of our compatriots are subjected to.”France saw multiple protests in June and July against racial injustice and police brutality inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd’s death at the knee of a policeman in the United States.French President Emmanuel Macron, a centrist who raised eyebrows when he gave an interview to Valeurs Actuelles last year, has pledged to root out racism. But he also insisted that France will not take down statues of figures linked to the colonial era or the slave trade, as has happened in other countries in recent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anger-after-french-magazine-depicts-black-lawmaker-as-slave/story-1BVODHuZeAYm7LuDtHRQCN.html
30-08-2020||World||US election 2020- Donald Trump vs Joe Biden: A look at Republican and Democratic parties’ vision for America||In less than 10 weeks from now, the United States will vote to elect a new government for the next four years or re-elect the Trump administration for a second term. Former vice president and Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Joe Biden and current US president and Republican opponent Donald Trump have raised the stakes as the nation goes to polls on November 3. While the president’s party concluded the scaled-down Republican National Convention on Thursday, the Democratic Party wrapped up its event last week by officially nominating Biden for the post of president and Kamala Harris for vice president. Also read: With the conventions now over, what’s next in campaign 2020?Here’s what the two candidates battling to become the president of the world’s largest economy have done or have offered to do on winning 2020 polls and how it’ll impact the worldEmployment President Donald Trump has vowed to “prohibit” American companies from replacing local workers with lower-cost foreign workers, a key fallout of outsourcing, and continue his hardline position on immigration. “We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country,” he said. His “Fighting for You” agenda also promises to “end reliance” on China by encouraging American firms to bring back operations and continue the “America First” foreign policy. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has promised to reform the temporary visa system to bring high-skilled employees and establish a wage-based allocation process and establish enforcement mechanisms to ensure they are aligned with the labour market and not used to undermine wages.In his nomination acceptance speech, Biden said, “Just judge this president on the facts. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year. More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in 6 small businesses has closed this year.” Since he’s “done it before,” Biden says he will rebuild the economy like he did when it was on the verge of collapse in 2009. In an outreach video, the Democratic Party said, back then Biden led the largest stimulus in a generation and saved millions of jobs.I know how to lead this nation through a crisis because I've done it before. I won't waste any time getting this virus under control and building our country back better. pic.twitter.com/HgBdR6VxUOCovid-19 responseWhile Biden says he would shut down the country in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, if experts and scientists suggested so, Trump has ordered reopening in phases to bring the economy back on track. “Rebuilding our economy starts with fighting the virus, increasing testing, getting more protective gear for health care workers and calling for mask mandates nationwide,” the Democratic Party said in a campaign video shared through the former vice president’s Twitter handle. The video comes at the time when there are 5,961,581 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country and the toll stands at 182,779, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s tally. As the cases continued to grow at a rapid pace, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), facing pressure from the Trump administration, last week gave emergency approval for use of plasma therapy to treat seriously affected patients. The announcement came on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where Trump was nominated to lead his party for four more years, raising suspicions that the move was politically motivated to offset critics of the president’s handling of the pandemic.The FDA chief Stephen Hahn, however, later apologised for overstating the life-saving benefits of treating Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma.Also, while many countries have made it compulsory for citizens to use face masks as a precautionary measure against the virus, the president has neither mandated nor is he himself seen using one on most occasions. Ties with WHO Alleging the World Health Organization’s (WHO) mismanagement of the Covid-19 crisis and its role in “a conspiracy to cover up for China”, US president Donald Trump has halted the nation’s contributions to the UN health body. Though the administration had earlier said it was considering numerous proposals, there is no final word yet on restoring full or partial funding to the WHO. Biden has so far not announced his action plan on the future ties with the WHO. However, he has been pushing for the guidelines provided by the UN body like wearing face masks to prevent coronavirus from spreading. US-India relations There are nearly 1.2 million Indian-American voters in the US. Recently, the Trump campaign released a video titled ‘Four More Years’ featuring clips showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Texas last year and the US President ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad this February.“America enjoys a great relationship with India and our campaign enjoys great support from Indian Americans!,” the tweet alongside the video read.  America enjoys a great relationship with India and our campaign enjoys great support from Indian Americans! 👍🏻🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/bkjh6HODevDuring a bilateral meeting with ‘friend’ PM Modi earlier this year, President Trump also assured of a trade deal very soon. Biden too has pledged closer ties with India and a better deal for Indian-Americans saying he will stand with New Delhi in confronting “new threats its faces in its own region and along its own border.”He has also promised to end the temporary suspension of H-1B visas to ensure American have the first crack at jobs. The visa programme, of which Indians are the largest beneficiaries, has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s immigration hawks.Also, Democrat Kamala Harris is the first Indian American and Black woman — actually, the first woman of colour — to be fielded for the second highest political office in the US by a major political party.US-China tensions Since Trump took office, relations between the US and China have spiraled down. Despite reaching an agreement on Phase 1 of a trade deal, the difference between the two countries has only widened. The president’s criticism for China has only increased after the first case of coronavirus was reported from Wuhan in December last year and has now taken over the world. Since then, Trump has time and again categorically blamed the “Chinese virus” and omissions by China’s regime for its spread.Also, after India banned 59 Chinese apps over security concerns, China’s TikTok also came on Trump’s radar following which he has ordered the video app’s parent company to sell its US operations to an American company within 90 days if the application isn’t banned. Though Biden has not made his stand clear on how he will lead ties with China if elected president, several Democrats have backed Trump’s move to ban Chinese apps. Biden has also promised to work with India in the Indo-Pacific to ensure no country, including China, “is able to threaten its neighbours with impunity” and will have “no tolerance” for cross-border terrorism in South Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-donald-trump-vs-joe-biden-a-look-at-republican-and-democratic-party-s-vision-for-america/story-fcIoqYn3KM2H8wgjfvjSFP.html

A total of 57 people were brought out alive, the ministry said.There was no immediate word on what caused the collapse or on the fate of the birthday guest and other celebrants.Hundreds of rescue workers using sniffer dogs, cranes and high-tech sensors had searched the rubble, lifting slabs of concrete in hopes of freeing survivors.The official China Daily newspaper said the building collapsed at 9:40 a.m. on Saturday. It said the Cabinet’s Work Safety Commission would oversee the investigation into the accident’s cause.While China has seen major improvements in industrial safety, building standards are sometimes ignored, particularly in rural areas such as Shanxi province’s Xiangfen county, about 630 kilometers (400 miles) southwest of Beijing, where the restaurant was located.The region lies in the heart of China’s coal country, where thousands of miners have died in explosions, collapses and floods over past years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-restaurant-collapses-during-birthday-party-killing-29/story-VNt18VVmWMJd6Z2uYxErMJ.html

This engine, or algorithm, powers TikTok’s “For You” page, which recommends the next video to watch based on an analysis of your behaviour.Cui noted that ByteDance’s development overseas had relied on its domestic technology that provided the core algorithm and said the company may need to transfer software codes or usage rights to the new owner of TikTok from China to overseas.“Therefore, it is recommended that ByteDance seriously studies the adjusted catalogue and carefully considers whether it is necessary to suspend” negotiations on a sale, he added.ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.China’s foreign ministry has said that it opposes the executive orders Trump has placed on TikTok and that Beijing will defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-new-tech-export-controls-could-give-beijing-a-say-in-tiktok-sale/story-zEVB1VQDxlcu7St5UoSh4H.html
30-08-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases surpass 25 million, toll over 840,000||Global coronavirus cases surged past 25 million on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally, as India marked a worldwide record for daily new cases in the Covid-19 pandemic.The data showed steady global growth as the disease’s epicentre shifts again, with India taking centre stage from the United States and Latin America.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here India’s single-day tally of 78,761 new coronavirus infections on Sunday exceeded the one-day increase of 77,299 reported by the United States in mid-July. The south Asian country’s surge took the global caseload to 25,074,751.The official number of global coronavirus cases is now at least five times the number of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to World Health Organization data.Around the world, there have been more than 840,000 deaths, considered a lagging indicator given the two-week incubation period of the virus. That has exceeded the upper range of 290,000 to 650,000 annual deaths linked to influenza. Also read: With nearly 79,000 new cases of Covid-19, India sets grim world recordIndia, the world’s second-most populous country, is third behind, the United States and Brazil, in total caseload, but has consistently outpaced both in new daily cases since Aug. 7, according to the Reuters tally.Despite the surging case numbers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been pushing for a return to normalcy to lessen the economic pain of the pandemic, having imposed a strict early lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people in March.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe government announced on Saturday that it will reopen underground train networks - a lifeline for millions in the capital city of New Delhi - and allow sports and religious events in a limited manner from next month.Latin America is the region with the most infections in the world, although some countries in the region are beginning to show a slight decline in infections.In the United States, metrics on new cases, deaths, hospitalizations and test positivity rates are all declining, but there are emerging hotspots in the Midwest.The global pace of new infections has steadied a little. It has taken about three weeks for the caseload to jump by 5 million cases to 25 million. That compared with the 19, 24 and 39 days it took, respectively, to add 5 million cases to the 20 million, 15 million and 10 million marks.The rate of new daily cases has slowed to around 1.2% over August so far. That compared with 1.7% in July, 1.8% in June, 2.1% in May, 4.6% in April and 7.7% in March.Health experts stress that official data almost certainly underreports both infections and deaths, particularly in countries with limited testing capacity.While Covid-19’s trajectory still falls far short of the 1918 Spanish flu, which infected an estimated 500 million people, killing at least 10% of patients, experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-surpass-25-million-toll-over-840-000/story-nCXnkD4MAnydQnikiFPWBN.html
30-08-2020||World||Weeks without power or water ahead as Laura cleanup begins||The destructive storm surge has receded, and the cleanup has begun from Hurricane Laura, but officials along this shattered stretch of southwestern Louisiana are warning returning residents they will face weeks without power or water amid the hot, stifling days of late summer.The US toll from the Category 4 hurricane rose to 16 deaths Saturday, with more than half of those killed by carbon monoxide poisoning from the unsafe operation of generators. The latest deaths included an 80-year-old woman and an 84-year-old man who died from just such a poisoning.Also read: As Hurricane Laura batters US cities, NOAA plane flies through it to capture rare images from insidePresident Donald Trump plans to tour the damage in Louisiana and neighboring Texas on Saturday and is expected to receive briefings on relief efforts.White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was traveling “to be with those who have been impacted by Hurricane Laura.”Across southwestern Louisiana, people were cleaning up from the hurricane that roared ashore early Thursday, packing 150 mph (240 kph) winds. Many were deciding whether they wanted to return home to miserable conditions or wait until basic services are finally restored.Along the coast in Cameron Parish, the receding storm surge left behind sediment and debris. Roads appeared still impassable. At South Cameron High School in Creole, parts of the roof of one building were ripped off, and debris was strewn everywhere. A barge appeared tilted on its side along the water.At First United Methodist Church in Lake Charles, a work crew was battling water that continued to pour into the church building as it rained Friday.Also read: Trump surveys Hurricane Laura damage in post-convention trip“This roof blew off. There’s some of it over there,” said Michael Putman, owner of Putman Restoration, pointing to part of the roof resting near the side of the building. A pile of black garbage bags sat outside the church, filled with insulation and ceiling tile.Putman lives in Shreveport, which also got damage from the storm. But he said he drove down to Lake Charles to help the minister, who was his high school pastor.“We slept in our truck in the parking lot last night,” he said.Simply driving was a feat in Lake Charles, a city of 80,000 residents hit head on. Power lines and trees blocked paths or created one-lane roads, leaving drivers to negotiate with oncoming traffic. Street signs were snapped off their posts or dangling. No stoplights worked, making it an exercise in trust to share the road with other motorists.Mayor Nic Hunter cautioned that there was no timetable for restoring electricity and that water-treatment plants “took a beating,” leaving barely a trickle of water coming out of most faucets. “If you come back to Lake Charles to stay, make sure you understand the above reality and are prepared to live in it for many days, probably weeks,” Hunter wrote on Facebook.The Louisiana Department of Health estimated that more than 220,000 people were without water. Restoration of those services could take weeks or months, and full rebuilding could take years.Forty nursing homes were relying on generators, and assessments were underway to determine if more than 860 residents in 11 facilities that had been evacuated could return.Several hospitals in Calcasieu Parish and one in Cameron Parish evacuated critical patients to other facilities because of water and power issues, the state health department said. Other hospitals are operating on intermittent generator power.Nineteen babies who weathered the hurricane at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital were brought to other hospitals across around the state. The babies, some on respirators or eating via feeding tubes, were at the neonatal intensive care unit of another hospital and had to be moved Wednesday hours before the hurricane arrived out of concerns that storm surge would swamp the one-story building. Hospital officials said they then decided to move them out of Lake Charles when it became apparent that it could be weeks before water was restored.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards called Laura the most powerful hurricane to strike the state, meaning it surpassed even Katrina, which was a Category 3 storm when it hit in 2005. He said Friday that officials now believe the surge was as high as 15 feet (4.5 meters).Saturday marks the 15th anniversary of Katrina.Hurricane Laura also killed nearly two dozen people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic en route to the US Gulf Coast.In Lake Charles, chainsaws buzzed and heavy machinery hauled tree limbs in the front lawn of Stanley and Dominique Hazelton, who rode out the storm on a bathroom floor. A tree punctured the roof not far from where the couple was taking cover.They regretted staying.“There’s people without homes,” Stanley Hazelton said. “So it was dumb. We’ll never do it again. We’ll never stay through another hurricane again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weeks-without-power-or-water-ahead-as-laura-cleanup-begins/story-XCX9grQyZbSXsgBhDdkjEP.html

Sufyaan Khalifa claimed the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca is ‘haram’ - meaning forbidden.Khalifa has posted a video on his YouTube channel in which he blasted the methodology adopted by AstraZeneca, which said it is making the vaccine using foetal cells of an aborted baby in the 1970s and developed in a laboratory.“Shame on some Muslim bodies justifying the use of the vaccine. Shame on any imam who did sign this fatwah,” Khalifa said in the video. His is the growing voice of religious figures who are against Australia’s vaccine deal with AstraZeneca. A senior Catholic archbishop had recently warned he is “deeply troubled” by the deal, saying the potential vaccine uses a fetal cell line that creates an “ethical quandary” for Christians.Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher wrote a letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison outlining concerns of some Christians over the vaccine’s apparent use of a cell line derived from an elective abortion performed decades ago. The letter was signed by Anglican and Greek Orthodox religious leaders.It also urged Morrison to pursue other “ethical” vaccine candidates to ensure religious objectors have a choice.Referring to the objection raised by the Catholic bodies, Imam Khalifa lashed out at Muslim bodies in Australia. “The Catholics have stood up against this clearly because they know it’s haram, it’s unlawful. But you stand with the government instead,” the Perth-based imam said. Australia earlier this month announced a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture the “promising” vaccine if it is proven safe and effective, with plans to offer it for free to the entire population.Some of the officials in Australia have said that they respect the sentiments of religioous communities. An Australian government spokerperson had said that they are “investing in research and technology that we hope will produce a range of vaccines that will be suitable for as many Australians as possible”.Among those is the University of Queensland’s vaccine candidate, which the official said does not contain fetal cell lines and has received Aus $5 million in government funding.It is currently in Phase 1 efficacy trials, while the Oxford vaccine is among a handful globally that have reached Phase 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/controversy-around-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-in-australia-some-clerics-raise-concerns/story-Ds7aSQ7y7CjedvJ0p2ns1K.html

However, they did not immediately link the shooting death to the protests.“A Homicide Investigation is underway in downtown Portland after a shooting Saturday evening,” a Portland police spokesman said in an emailed statement.Sounds of gunfire were heard in the area of Southeast 3rd Avenue and Southwest Alder Street, according to the statement.“(Police) responded and located a victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. Medical responded and determined that the victim was deceased,” the statement said.The police said they were not currently releasing suspect information.When asked by Reuters if the shooting in downtown Portland was related to the clashes between rival protesters in the same are, the spokesman said “it is too early in the investigation to draw those kinds of conclusions”.A New York Times report cited two unidentified witnesses saying a small group of people got into an argument with other people in a vehicle and someone opened fire.The man who was shot and killed was wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a far-right group based in Portland that has clashed with protesters in the past, according to the newspaper. Reuters could not independently verify this.Separately, Portland police earlier said in a tweet that a “political rally is caravanning throughout downtown Portland” and that there had been “some instances of violence between demonstrators and counter-demonstrators.”Police had intervened and made some arrests, the tweet said.Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death in May of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Tensions between rival protest groups have roiled downtown Portland every night for nearly three months following Floyd’s death.President Donald Trump’s administration in July deployed federal forces to Portland to crack down on the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-shot-dead-as-rival-protesters-clash-in-portland/story-jwL3th3QtewQMIoDUX7MMJ.html

30-08-2020||World||Trump surveys Hurricane Laura damage in post-convention trip||President Donald Trump got a firsthand look Saturday at the damage from Hurricane Laura on a post-Republican National Convention trip that allowed him to use the trappings of his office to try to project empathy and leadership.His stops, first in Louisiana and later in Texas, came two days after the Category 4 storm slammed the Gulf Coast, leaving at least 16 dead and wreaking havoc with severe winds and flooding. While the storm surge has receded and the cleanup effort has begun, hundreds of thousands remain without power or water, and they could for weeks or months as the hot summer stretches on.Also read: As Hurricane Laura batters US cities, NOAA plane flies through it to capture rare images from inside“I’m here to support the great people of Louisiana. It’s been a great state for me,” he said in Lake Charles. “It was a tremendously powerful storm.” He said he knows one thing about the state: “They rebuild it fast.”During the slightly more than two hours he spent in the city, Trump met with officials and relief workers but not with any of the residents whose homes had been ripped apart in the storm.He did, however, get a good look at the extensive damage and the debris strewn across the city of 80,000 people, beginning with the bird’s eye view from Air Force One as it came in for landing.His first stop was a warehouse being used as a staging area for the Cajun Navy, a group of Louisiana volunteers who help with search and rescue after hurricanes and floods. “Good job,” Trump told them.Trump then toured a neighborhood with Gov. John Bel Edwards and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, making his way down a street blocked by felled trees and where houses were battered by the storm, one with its entire roof torn off.Also read: Hurricane Laura thrashes Louisiana, but damage is less than predictedEdwards has said Laura was the most powerful hurricane ever to strike his state, surpassing even Hurricane Katrina, which was a Category 3 when it hit almost exactly 15 years ago.“Whether you come from Louisiana or 5th Avenue In New York, you know about Katrina,” Trump said.The president then flew by helicopter to Orange, Texas, which was the worst-hit area in the state. Several hundred supporters greeted his arrival with Trump 2020 flags, banners and signs. Among the officials on hand were Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and US Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Before a flyover to view damaged areas, Trump and other officials visited the emergency operations center in Orange County to discuss storm damage and the government response. He was flying back to Washington Saturday evening.Trump has sometimes struggled with his role as consoler in chief, failing to project empathy when visiting places hard hit by tragedy and disaster. That includes in Puerto Rico, where Trump was photographed tossing rolls of paper towel into the crowd, which some saw as inappropriately playful, given the circumstances. During a trip to the Carolinas in 2018, Trump marveled at a yacht floodwaters had washed onto a family’s property, telling them, “At least you got a nice boat out of the deal.” And he was caught on camera telling a person he’d handed out food to “have a good time.”Also read: Hurricane Laura moves toward landfall in southwestern LouisianaOther times, Trump has been a source of comfort. After a tornado ripped through Alabama last year, killing nearly two dozen people, Trump spent time with families who’d lost loved ones, listening to their stories and hugging them.Showing empathy has come more naturally for his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, who issued a statement Saturday saying he and his wife were praying for those hurt by the storm and promising that “we will be there to help you build back better.”In a possible subtle dig at the incumbent, Biden praised the response of families in the hurricane-hit states and thanked them for “reminding Americans that no disaster, no single person, no injustice can match the humble, personal, courageous ways that Americans choose decency every single day.”Laura, which packed 150-mph (240-kph) winds and a storm surge as high as 15 feet (4.5 meters), toppled trees and damaged buildings as far north as central Arkansas. More than 580,000 coastal residents evacuated in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.More than half of those who died succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning from the unsafe operation of generators. The hurricane also killed nearly two dozen people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic as it barreled toward the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-surveys-hurricane-laura-damage-in-post-convention-trip/story-lpZIj0FxOJJEP3d8BvqGUO.html
30-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s intel chief ends election security briefings on Capitol Hill||The nation’s top intelligence official has informed Congress that his office will no longer give in-person election security briefings on Capitol Hill, a move that raised concern among lawmakers Saturday about the public’s right to know about foreign interference in the upcoming presidential election.President Donald Trump said National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe made the decision because the administration “got tired” of intelligence about election security leaking from Congress.“They leaked the information ... and what’s even worse, they leaked the wrong information and we got tired of it,” Trump told reporters while attending a briefing on Hurricane Laura in Orange, Texas. He didn’t offer details to support his statement.Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said the idea that the national intelligence director’s office would stop briefing Congress on foreign threats to the US election is “an outrage” and that written updates were “flatly insufficient.”“America’s election — indeed, our foundation of democracy itself — is under threat as we face weaponized disinformation from global foes around the planet,” King, a member of the Senate’s intelligence committee, said in a lengthy statement. “To stifle and limit the American peoples’ awareness of this fact cannot be explained — or allowed.”Ratcliffe, who oversees the nation’s intelligence agencies, sent formal notification letters Saturday to the Senate and House leadership and the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers’ intelligence committees.In the letter, Ratcliffe wrote: “I believe this approach helps ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that the information ODNI provides the Congress in support of your oversight responsibilities on elections security, foreign malign influence, and election interference is not misunderstood nor politicized.”White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who was with Trump in Texas, said lawmakers will still be sent full written readouts. Meadows said Ratcliffe is going to make sure there are “proper tools for their oversight.”Earlier this month, the nation’s counterintelligence chief, William Evanina, issued a statement saying US intelligence officials believe Russia is using various methods to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and that people linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin are boosting Trump’s reelection bid. US officials also believe China does not want Trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the White House, Evanina wrote.On Saturday, Democratic lawmakers criticized Ratcliffe’s decision.“This intelligence belongs to the American people, not the agencies which are its custodian,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democrat who chairs the House’s intelligence committee, said in a joint statement. “The American people have both the right and the need to know that another nation, Russia, is trying to help decide who their president should be.”Pelosi and Schiff called the decision a “betrayal of the public’s right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy.”An official with the House intelligence committee said the decision was unexpected because Ratcliffe’s office earlier had reached out to schedule an in-person briefing to the committee on Sept. 17. A room on Capitol Hill had already been reserved, according to the official, who did not have permission to speak about the issue publicly and requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-intel-chief-ends-election-security-briefings-on-capitol-hill/story-jAMLT5qpNCKURRIJjWBJhJ.html

30-08-2020||World||‘How dare we not vote?’ Black voters organize after DC march||Tears streamed down Brooke Moreland’s face as she watched tens of thousands gather on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to decry systemic racism and demand racial justice in the wake of several police killings of Black Americans.But for the Indianapolis mother of three, the fiery speeches delivered Friday at the commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom also gave way to one central message: Vote and demand change at the ballot box in November.“As Black people, a lot of the people who look like us died for us to be able to sit in public, to vote, to go to school and to be able to walk around freely and live our lives,” the 31-year-old Moreland said. “Every election is an opportunity, so how dare we not vote after our ancestors fought for us to be here?”That determination could prove critical in a presidential election where race is emerging as a flashpoint. President Donald Trump, at this past week’s Republican National Convention, emphasized a “law and order” message aimed at his largely white base of supporters. His Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has expressed empathy with Black victims of police brutality and is counting on strong turnout from African Americans to win critical states such as North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan.As the campaign enters its latter stages, there’s an intensifying effort among African Americans to transform frustration over police brutality, systemic racism and the disproportionate toll of the coronavirus into political power. Organizers and participants said Friday’s march delivered a much needed rallying cry to mobilize.“If we do not vote in numbers that we’ve never ever seen before and allow this administration to continue what it is doing, we are headed on a course for serious destruction,” Martin Luther King III told The Associated Press before his rousing remarks, delivered 57 years after his father’s famous “I Have A Dream” speech. “I’m going to do all that I can to encourage, promote, to mobilize and what’s at stake is the future of our nation, our planet. What’s at stake is the future of our children.”As speakers implored attendees to “vote as if our lives depend on it,” the march came on the heels of yet another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man – 29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Sunday — sparking demonstrations and violence that left two dead.“We need a new conversation … you act like it’s no trouble to shoot us in the back,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said. “Our vote is dipped in blood. We’re going to vote for a nation that stops the George Floyds, that stops the Breonna Taylors.”Navy veteran Alonzo Jones- Goss, who traveled to Washington from Boston, said he plans to vote for Biden because the nation has seen far too many tragic events that have claimed the lives of Black Americans and other people of color.“I supported and defended the Constitution and I support the members that continue to do it today, but the injustice and the people that are losing their lives, that needs to end,” Jones-Goss, 28, said. “It’s been 57 years since Dr. King stood over there and delivered his speech. But what is unfortunate is what was happening 57 years ago is still happening today.”Drawing comparisons to the original 1963 march, where participants then were protesting many of the same issues that have endured, National Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial said it’s clear why this year’s election will be pivotal for Black Americans.“We are about reminding people and educating people on how important it is to translate the power of protest into the power of politics and public policy change,” said Morial, who spoke Friday. “So we want to be deliberate about making the connection between protesting and voting.”Nadia Brown, a Purdue University political science professor, agreed there are similarities between the situation in 1963 and the issues that resonate among Black Americans today. She said the political pressure that was applied then led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other powerful pieces of legislation that transformed the lives of African Americans. She’s hopeful this could happen again in November and beyond.“There’s already a host of organizations that are mobilizing in the face of daunting things,” Brown said. “Bur these same groups that are most marginalized are saying it’s not enough to just vote, it’s not enough for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party to ask me for my vote. I’m going to hold these elected officials that are in office now accountable and I’m going to vote in November and hold those same people accountable. And for me, that is the most uplifting and rewarding part — to see those kind of similarities.”But Brown noted that while Friday’s march resonated with many, it’s unclear whether it will translate into action among younger voters, whose lack of enthusiasm could become a vulnerability for Biden.“I think there is already a momentum among younger folks who are saying not in my America, that this is not the place where they want to live, but will this turn into electoral gains? That I’m less clear on because a lot of the polling numbers show that pretty overwhelmingly, younger people, millennials and Gen Z’s are more progressive and that they are reluctantly turning to this pragmatic side of politics,” Brown said.That was clear as the Movement for Black Lives also marked its own historic event Friday — a virtual Black National Convention that featured several speakers discussing pressing issues such as climate change, economic empowerment and the need for electoral justice.“I don’t necessarily see elections as achieving justice per se because I view the existing system itself as being fundamentally unjust in many ways and it is the existing system that we are trying to fundamentally transform,” said Bree Newsome Bass, an activist and civil rights organizer, during the convention’s panel about electoral justice. “I do think voting and recognizing what an election should be is a way to kind of exercise that muscle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-dare-we-not-vote-black-voters-organize-after-dc-march/story-HEkB8TxJyZ2vAS4tNoSsMK.html
30-08-2020||World||Joe Biden, aiming at Donald Trump, says he won’t use military as ‘prop’||Joe Biden said on Saturday that as president, he would never use the military “as a prop or private militia” and accused President Donald Trump of employing US forces to settle “personal vendettas” and violate citizens’ rights.The Democratic presidential nominee, in a virtual address to the National Guard Association of the United States’ general conference, said Trump recommended “that you should be deployed to quote, ‘dominate,’ your fellow citizens for exercising their right to peacefully protest.”“We’re so much better than this,” Biden said. “You deserve so much better.”His comments came a day after Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that the armed forces will have no role in carrying out the election process or resolving a disputed vote.It was a sign of rising tensions on both sides as the president has declared without evidence that the expected surge in mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic will make the vote “inaccurate and fraudulent.” Trump has also suggested he might not accept the election results if he loses.Biden has said he’s “absolutely convinced” the military would escort Trump from the White House if the incumbent lost but refused to leave.Biden didn’t repeat the assertion while addressing the conference, but promised to restore the separation between civilian and military powers which he called “the bedrock principal of our republic.”“It’s been tested lately, but I promise you, as president, I’ll never put you in the middle of politics or personal vendettas,” the former vice president. “I’ll never use the military as a prop or as a private militia to violate rights of fellow citizens. That’s not law and order.”That was a reference to Trump’s recent efforts to expand federal intervention into some cities as he makes “law and order” a centerpiece of his reelection bid, against the backdrop of protests against institutional racism and police brutality that have swept the country. In July, the president deployed federal forces to Chicago and Albuquerque, New Mexico, after earlier sending Homeland Security agents to Portland, Oregon.Trump also announced this week that federal troops were being sent to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where unrest erupted after last weekend’s police shooting in the back of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man. Biden has said he’s considered traveling to Wisconsin to try and calm the situation, but only if it could be done “safely” and without inflaming circumstances “on the ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-aiming-at-donald-trump-says-he-won-t-use-military-as-prop/story-hrldxXtyzUOeWyn4Gmw7vM.html

The statue was also decapitated and defaced with graffiti.According to the national broadcaster CBC, a leaflet found at the site read, in part, “Sir John A. Macdonald was a white supremacist who orchestrated the genocide of Indigenous peoples with the creation of the brutal residential schools system, as well as promoting other measures that attacked Indigenous peoples and traditions.”Also read: What’s next as Japan PM Abe quits, potential successorsStatues of MacDonald have been attacked in various parts of the country in the past but this was the first time one was brought down. Canada witnessed demonstrations in several cities, including Toronto, Calgary and Montreal, on Saturday.The act of anonymous activists came in for criticism from leaders. Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante condemned the vandalism leading to the tearing down of the statue and said such acts “cannot be accepted nor tolerated.” She added, “I understand and share the motivation of citizens who want to live in a more just and inclusive society. The discussion and the actions that are required must be done in a peaceful manner, without ever resorting to vandalism.”The Premier of Quebec Francoise Legault described the act as “unacceptable” and added, “We must fight racism, but destroying parts of our history is not the solution. Vandalism has no place in our democracy and the statue must be restored.” The vandalism also faced growing criticism from national and provincial leaders across the country. Plante said Montreal’s public art office will secure the perimeter of the area where the statue stood and coordinate its “conservation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unidentified-activists-bring-down-statue-of-canada-s-first-pm-in-montreal/story-xLAGWWhDWJX22Qf5820i8M.html
