(hereafter referred to as Dongfeng) has caused the death of Chinese soldiers during the China-India border clash,” the write-up published in eng.chinamil.com.cn said.Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a brutal brawl at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which India lost 20 soldiers during the hand-to-hand clash. China is yet to reveal the number of casualties it suffered in the fight.“On August 3, after learning via the Internet that online-user Zhou had posted rumours on his “WeChat moments” by claiming that internal corruption of the Dongfeng Company had led to the poor quality of the its military vehicles, which resulted in the casualties of Chinese soldiers on the China-India border, the Dongfeng Company immediately reported to the local police and established a special working group to investigate and verify the case,” the website reported.“At about 18:00 on August 4, Zhou was arrested by local police. He confessed to his crime of rumour-mongering, showed remorse, and wrote a sincere apology letter.”The website also published the confession letter written by Zhou in Chinese along with the story.In the confession letter, Zhou wrote that he “fabricated” the story on the evening of August 2 after drinking.Zhou wrote that he made up that poor quality of vehicles caused the death of Chinese soldiers and 500 vehicles of the Dongfeng company had to be recalled.The social media update was then forwarded by friends and family, he wrote.Zhou then “deeply” apologises netizens and the Dongfeng company in the letter, and said he was “…willing to accept the treatment from relevant departments”.“I hope that the majority of netizens can learn from me, (and) do not make rumours, do not believe rumours, do not spread rumours…,” he wrote.“The Dongfeng company has been engaged in the R&D and manufacturing of high-mobility off-road vehicles for military operations for a long time, being considered as China’s top military vehicles manufacturer,” the write-up said.The website eng.chinamil.com.cn is the only official English language military news website of the PLA.“Authorised by the Central Military Commission of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and sponsored by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) News Media Center, China Military Online is the only official English-language military news website of the Chinese Armed Forces and an important platform for building up the online international communication capacity of the Chinese military,” the website says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-arrests-citizen-for-claiming-chinese-soldiers-died-in-clash-with-india-because-of-corruption/story-nl0RdNbNB0FRUekTlDOkUL.html

But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP).A bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP since the last few weeks after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” The opponents of Oli are also against his autocratic style of functioning.“Our main concern is not about gaining power, what we want is to follow the proper procedure while running the NCP. We are not focusing on gaining any position, but our fight is against the wrong trend developing in the party,” Prachanda told a select group of journalists during a special briefing on Wednesday.He held the press conference along with three senior party leaders Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal and party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha, according to Nagarik daily.The dissident group accused Oli of trying to damage the image of other senior leaders of the party, the daily reported.Prachanda and Nepal have claimed that the majority of the powerful Central Working Committee members have supported them while raising voice against Oli. Prachanda also alleged that while the Standing Committee meeting was in progress, at the initiative of Prime Minister Oli a new party was registered under the name of a lesser-known person at the Election Commission with the intention to split the ruling party.“If one chairman (PM Oli) does not follow the proper procedure of the party then how can the unity of the party remain intact,” he wondered.Prachanda claimed that he and other senior leaders of the party were trying to save the party by creating a favourable situation.“We are trying for the best outcome but the communists of this country should also be prepared for the worst thing to happen,” Prachanda told media persons, indicating a possible split in the ruling party.“I had agreed to make Oli Prime Minister for a full 5 years term and enjoy the executive chairman’s position in the party for creating a better environment within the party,” said Prachanda. “Oli has dragged the party towards anarchism by calling separate gatherings,” Prachanda said.During the press briefing, the senior leaders also accused Prime Minister Oli of making political appointments on his own choice without consulting with the party.Madhav Nepal accused Oli of working in the vested interest of a certain group and encouraging corrupt people while making appointments.Party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha said that Oli is running the government on his personal whim.Does the government belong to the party or a person? He asked.Meanwhile, PM Oli’s chief advisor Bishnu Rimal has slammed Shrestha.“Don’t encourage groupism in the party at a time when the country is passing through a crisis. Enough is enough,” he wrote on Twitter.On July 28, Prime Minister Oli postponed the crucial Standing Committee meeting for the ninth time.While Oli wants to call the Secretariat meeting to resolve the differences, Prachanda says it would be inappropriate to call the Secretariat meeting as the Standing Committee meeting that was put off on July 28 is yet to be over.Prime Minister Oli wants the Secretariat meeting to resolve the key issues of an intra-party dispute as he now commands a majority in the nine-member body.Prachanda, who is backed by senior party leader and former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, believes that the Standing Committee could take decisions favourable to him as their faction commands a comfortable majority, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/locked-in-power-tussle-with-nepal-pm-oli-prachanda-tells-party-workers-to-prepare-for-worst/story-unlsbxNcOMwWvHci28RqYP.html

There is a possibility of external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act,” President Michel Aoun said in comments carried by local media and confirmed by his office.He said the probe into Tuesday’s blast at a warehouse housing highly-explosive material was being conducted on three levels. “First, how the explosive material entered and was stored ... second whether the explosion was a result of negligence or an accident ... and third the possibility that there was external interference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-rocket-or-bomb-or-other-act-lebanese-president-on-external-interference-in-beirut-blast/story-azdFF7jses6zd85JvHmXKI.html

The coronavirus pandemic had kept 44-year-old Jihad in Nigeria, where he worked far from his family in Beirut. Once travel restrictions eased, he flew home with a new sense of urgency: His 6-year old had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.Together, Jihad and Soha spent 13 days with their daughter, Gemma, as she received treatment. “We only had one more day left in the hospital,” Soha said.When smoke billowed outside the hospital window Tuesday, the couple lamented Beirut’s pollution and disorder. Soha began to film it on her phone, then went out to check with nurses if there was reason to worry.As she opened the door, “the world exploded.”In an instant, she had to make a wrenching decision — focus on her daughter, who suddenly was watching blood gush from her stunned father’s head, or leave the girl with others and try to save the life of the man she loved.Soha carried her burly husband down nine floors, walking barefoot on broken glass. The hospital was no longer functioning. She had to find another.Strangers appeared and helped her down the stairs. Her brother arrived to help. Soha reached a doctor friend on the phone who talked her through basic first aid.“Jihado, answer me, don’t go,” she pleaded with her husband.But it was too late. Other hospitals, overwhelmed, turned the couple away. Soha’s husband died in her arms. He never said a word.“He didn’t even open his eyes. I saw his soul (leaving his body),” Soha said.She only removed the broken glass from her feet three days later.She doesn’t know how to ever remove the pain.Tuesday’s blast killed nearly 150 people. Search teams are still looking for bodies as some families don’t know whether to mourn.“You are not supposed to die in a hospital. This is what is killing me,” Soha said.The couple’s love had survived so much. Jihad, a hotel manager, grew up in Nigeria but never severed ties with Lebanon. He was known for his generosity and for being a family man, his wife said.They married in 2009 but Soha had to return home from Nigeria when the West African country was shaken by an Ebola virus outbreak a few years ago and she had a baby. Violence in Lebanon then thwarted their plans to live together there.In their long-distance conversations “he would tell me every day, ‘Don’t worry, my love. Don’t have a concern,’” Soha recalled. “If I wanted the moon, he would bring it to me. He would never make me angry. ... He would never make anyone angry.”The couple met every two months until, again, a virus outbreak disrupted their plans. And then their daughter received her diagnosis.Finally, when Jihad could travel, he came bearing gifts. After days in the hospital by his family’s side, he visited their 9-year-old son, Karl, for a weekend. He returned two days before the explosion, bearing new pajamas for his wife and a plate of tabbouleh for his daughter, who had craved it.“His biggest concern was his family. He was carrying a big load. Everyone was counting on him,” Soha said.“He used to give me peace of mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-world-exploded-beirut-blast-takes-a-husband-father/story-OrCG09Q9rdXTYokBkVdhkL.html
07-08-2020||World||What we know about the explosion in Beirut||Three days after a massive explosion rocked Beirut, killing at least 149 people and causing widespread devastation, rescuers are still searching for survivors and the government is investigating what caused the disaster.Here’s what we know at this point:A CATASTROPHIC TOLLTuesday’s blast killed at least 149 people and wounded more than 5,000. It struck with the force of an earthquake, blowing out windows and doors across the capital and leaving several city blocks littered with broken glass, rubble and demolished vehicles. It was the biggest explosion ever seen in the city, which was split in half during the 1975-1990 civil war and has a long history of bombings and terror attacks. Authorities estimate that 300,000 people were initially left homeless — about 12% of the city’s population — and that the city will need $10 billion to $15 billion to rebuild. The blast also obliterated the main port of a tiny country that relies on imports, and shredded a towering silo that had held an estimated 85% of Lebanon’s grain.___A WAREHOUSE FULL OF EXPLOSIVESThe blast appears to have been caused by the ignition of a stockpile of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in fertilizers and explosives, that had been stored at the port since it was seized from an impounded cargo ship in 2013. Video footage shows a fire at the port, with what appear to be fireworks going off, before a massive explosion rocks the city and sends a mushroom cloud into the sky. It’s unclear what caused the fire, but there is so far no evidence of an attack.___AN ONGOING INVESTIGATIONThe government has launched an investigation that appears to be focused on port and customs officials, with at least 16 employees detained and others brought in for questioning. Officials at the port have sought to shift blame, saying they warned senior officials of the dangers posed by storing a huge amount of ammonium nitrate in a civilian port but that no action was taken. Many Lebanese place the blame squarely on the political class that rose to power during the civil war, which is widely seen as corrupt and incompetent. Scattered protests have broken out, with some people chanting “revolution,” and more unrest seems likely as the full extent of the tragedy sinks in.___A COUNTRY ALREADY ON THE BRINKLebanon was already in the grip of a severe economic crisis rooted in decades of misrule that spawned mass protests last autumn. The currency has plunged in recent months, leading to a painful spike in the prices of basic goods and wiping out many people’s life savings. The explosion sent thousands flooding into hospitals that were already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, potentially worsening the country’s outbreak. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to move in with friends or relatives, which could also accelerate the spread of the virus. One major hospital was forced to close after it was severely damaged.___AID APPEARS ELUSIVESeveral countries have dispatched emergency aid and search-and-rescue crews to Beirut. But foreign donors are unlikely to provide the sustained, large-scale assistance Lebanon needs without substantial reforms by the country’s long-entrenched political leadership. The government, which defaulted on its sovereign debt in March, has been negotiating an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund for months, but the talks faltered over Lebanese infighting and resistance to demands for reform. On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron promised aid but also called for a “new political order.” As he toured one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods, an angry crowd vented its fury at Lebanon’s leaders. But while the blast shattered Lebanon’s capital in an instant, its dysfunctional political system remains stubbornly intact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-we-know-about-the-explosion-in-beirut/story-wgYkskWbfMdRU04DWqVgFJ.html
07-08-2020||World||‘No way we can rebuild’: Lebanese count huge losses after Beirut blast||Beirut residents began trying to rebuild their shattered lives on Friday after the biggest blast in the Lebanese capital’s history tore into the city, killing at least 154 and leaving the heavily indebted nation with another huge reconstruction bill.The search for those missing since Tuesday’s blast intensified overnight, as rescuers sifted rubble in a frantic race to find anyone still alive after the explosion smashed a swathe of the city and sent shockwaves around the region.Security forces fired teargas at a furious crowd late on Thursday, as anger boiled over at the government and a political elite, who have presided over a nation that was facing economic collapse even before the deadly port blast injured 5,000 people.The small crowd, some hurling stones, marked a return to the kind of protests that had become a feature of life in Beirut, as Lebanese watched their savings evaporate and currency disintegrate, while government decision-making floundered.“There is no way we can rebuild this house. Where is the state?” Tony Abdou, an unemployed 60-year-old, sitting in the family home in Gemmayze, a district that lies a few hundred metres from the port warehouses where highly explosive material was stored for years, a ticking time bomb next to a densely populated area.As Abdou spoke, a domestic water boiler fell through the ceiling of his cracked home, while volunteers from the neighbourhood turned out on the street to sweep up debris.“Do we actually have a government here?” said taxi driver Nassim Abiaad, 66, whose cab was crushed by falling building wreckage just as he was about to get into the vehicle.“There is no way to make money anymore,” he said.The government has promised a full investigation and put several port employees under house arrest. State news agency NNA said 16 people were taken into custody. But for many Lebanese, the explosion was symptomatic of the years of neglect by the authorities while state corruption thrived.SHOCKWAVESOfficials have said the blast, whose seismic impact was recorded hundreds of miles (kilometres) away, might have caused losses amounting to $15 billion - a bill the country cannot pay when it has already defaulted on its mountain of national debt, exceeding 150% of economic output, and talks about a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund have stalled.Hospitals, many heavily damaged as shockwaves ripped out windows and pulled down ceilings, have been overwhelmed by the number of casualties. Many were struggling to find enough foreign exchange to buy supplies before the explosion.In the port area, rescue teams set up arc lights to work through the night in a dash to find those still missing, as families waited tensely, slowly losing hope of ever seeing loved ones again. Some victims were hurled into the sea because of the explosive force.The weeping mother of one of the missing called a prime time TV programme on Thursday night to plead with the authorities to find her son, Joe. He was found - dead - hours later.Lebanese Red Cross Secretary General George Kettaneh told local radio VDL that three more bodies had been found in the search, while the health minister said on Friday the death toll had climbed to 154. Dozens are still unaccounted for.Charbel Abreeni, who trained port employees, showed Reuters pictures on his phone of killed colleagues. He was sitting in a church where the head from the statue of the Virgin Mary had been blown off.“I know 30 port employees who died, two of them are my close friends and a third is missing,” said the 62-year-old, whose home was wrecked in the blast. His shin was bandaged.“I have nowhere to go except my wife’s family,” he said. “How can you survive here, the economy is zero?”Offers of immediate medical and food aid have poured in from Arab states, Western nations and beyond. But none, so far, address the bigger challenges facing a bankrupt nation.French President Emmanuel Macron came to the city on Thursday with a cargo from France. He promised to explain some “home truths” to the government, telling them they needed to root out corruption and deliver economic reforms.He was greeted on the street by many Lebanese who asked for help in ensuring “regime” change, so a new set of politicians could rebuild Beirut and set the nation on a new course.Beirut still bore scars from heavy shelling in the 1975-1990 civil war before the blast. After the explosion, chunks of the city once again look like a war zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-way-we-can-rebuild-lebanese-count-huge-losses-after-beirut-blast/story-UK0WtGJxwy9luv1UKTtVpJ.html

In a statement, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asserted that they (the Chinese apps) were ‘stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.”Reacting to the US decision, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said Washington should provide non-discriminatory business environment to all countries.“China urges the US to correct its wrongdoings, stop politicising economic issues and cracking down on related firms, and provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for normal operations and investment by businesses from all countries,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Friday.Also read: Firmly oppose US orders against TikTok and WeChat, says China“The US will eventually taste the bitter fruit of choosing self-interest over market principles, international rules, which will only lead to the decline of morality, national image, and international trust,” Wang said.Calling it a “shameless act of hegemony”, Wang said the US frequently uses national security as an excuse to abuse state power and groundlessly clamp down on related firms.On Thursday, Trump said that the spread in the US of “…mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People’s Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”Trump’s orders on Chinese follows the tit-for-tat closing of consulates – in Houston and Chengdu – while the two countries remain at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms-sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hegemonic-us-will-taste-bitter-fruit-of-self-interest-says-china-after-tiktok-wechat-targeted-by-washington/story-UEh40xyAc8JjASPSxj5QhM.html

07-08-2020||World||BCG vaccine safe, does not lead to increased risk of Covid-19 symptoms, scientists say||Scientists have compared volunteers who had received the BCG vaccine -- originally made against tuberculosis -- with those who did not, and have found that the immunised individuals “did not get sick more often, or become more seriously ill” during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, evaluated a group of healthy volunteers who received the BCG vaccine in the five years before the ongoing pandemic, and compared their immune system function to that of healthy volunteers who were not administered the shots. According to the scientists, including those from Radboud University in the Netherlands, the Bacille Calmette-Guerin or BCG vaccine was originally intended to treat tuberculosis, but was later proven to provide a long-lasting, general boost to the immune system. The current study determined if there was an effect of this vaccine on the symptoms attributable to infection with the novel coronavirus. It showed that those who received the vaccine did not have more symptoms, did not get sick more often, or become more seriously ill, during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. “What the comparison between the groups shows is that at least those who received the vaccine did not get sick more often or become more seriously ill. It therefore does not hurt to vaccinate people with BCG,” the scientists noted in a statement. The researchers noted that the country reported a lower number of sick people in the period March-May 2020 among the BCG-vaccinated group, with lower incidence of extreme fatigue among the vaccinated individuals. However, they also cautioned that the study had limitations which prevent conclusions from being drawn regarding the benefit of the BCG vaccine against Covid-19. “It is very important to confirm that someone who has been vaccinated with BCG does not experience any increased symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we see less sickness in the people who have had the BCG vaccination, only the ongoing prospective BCG vaccination studies can determine whether this vaccination can help against Covid-19”, said study co-author Mihai Netea from Radbound University. The scientists believe clinical randomised trials evaluating the BCG vaccine’s effects against Covid-19 -- currently underway in several parts of the world -- can answer this question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bcg-vaccine-safe-does-not-lead-to-increased-risk-of-covid-19-symptoms-scientists-say/story-GRASROfKHcAal5DjCMHlIO.html
07-08-2020||World||Nearly half of Canadians want fresh polls if PM Trudeau found guilty in WE charity probe||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s woes related to the grant of a nearly billion dollar contract to a charity with links to himself and his family, are growing with almost half of Canadians polled in a new survey saying new elections should be held if he were to be found guilty of violating Federal ethics norms.The scandal over the CA $ 912 million contract to WE Charity has already lead to Trudeau being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, as well as being probed by two Parliamentary panels. Trudeau has also apologised for not recusing himself from a Cabinet decision for granting the contract to the organisation. The contract was later cancelled after the controversy erupted with revelations that his mother, brother and wife had been paid for appearances by the organisationIt appears, however, that Trudeau’s apology has not cut any ice with Canadians. A new survey from the polling agency Leger in collaboration with the Association for Canadian Studies shows that 49 per cent of Canadians want Trudeau to quit and call fresh elections if he is found guilty of ethics violations. The PM was found of guilty of similar violations twice during his first term.But that’s not the only data point working against Trudeau: 49 per cent also said their opinion of Trudeau had worsened due to the WE scandal and 42 per cent said their view of his Liberal Party had suffered adversely. The news agency Canadian Press quoted Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque as saying that “these are numbers that will certainly worry or concern the Liberals at this moment.” Trudeau’s Liberal Party is running a minority government and had enjoyed an upswing in support due to the perception of efficient handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the new controversy has taken a heavy political toll on the ruling party as it has dropped six points in two weeks and it seems to be in a statistical tie with the principal opposition Conservatives at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-half-of-canadians-want-fresh-polls-if-pm-trudeau-found-guilty-in-we-charity-probe/story-FKROREAQGMWrh3Mgn42u9L.html

That’s just a hegemonic practice. China is firmly opposed to that,” he said.The US executive orders, which will be effective in 45 days, come after the Trump administration announced its efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from US digital networks and called WeChat, controlled by Tencent Holdings Ltd, and ByteDance’s TikTok “significant threats.”Wang said that the United States was sacrificing the interests of users and companies and engaging in political manipulation and oppression, adding that it “will only lose its moral high ground with a damaged image and a deficit of trust”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firmly-oppose-us-orders-against-tiktok-and-wechat-says-china/story-XZgaGDQ8KdREZhGnJ06NVK.html

Heavy rain across the Korean peninsula has brought flooding to both North and South Korea in recent days, and concern is growing about damage to North Korean crops.“It is of priority importance to quickly supply sleeping materials, daily commodities, medicines and other necessities to the flood-affected people to stabilize their living,” Kim said in comments carried by KCNA.Kim made the remarks while inspecting a flood-hit part of North Hwanghae Province, on the border of South Korea, as he “clarified tasks” for recovery work with officials there.Torrential rain for several days has inundated more than 730 single-story houses, destroying 179 of them, and flooded rice-growing land, KCNA said.There were no reports of casualties.Kim would also mobilise the army for rehabilitation, in particular work on homes and roads, and he called on architects to build 800 model houses in a badly hit farming village in Unpha County, KCNA said.The rain during the harvest season in the rice-growing area is raising concern about North Korea’s food security.North Korea’s ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, cited a study that said rice and corn would suffer if the crops were under water for just two or three days.“The fate of this year’s farming depends on how to protect farmland and crops from the flood,” the newspaper said.South Korea on Thursday donated $10 million to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) for its efforts to help North Korean children and women. Parts of South Korea have seen more than 40 consecutive days of rain, the longest monsoon since 2013, and more is expected across the peninsula.

Trudeau made his reaction public in a tweet: “In response to the American tariffs announced today, Canada will impose countermeasures that will include dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs.” He did not specify what shape and which sectors the countermeasures will impact. But his stand was also that of Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who made the same point in a statement released by her office and added, “Canadian aluminium does not undermine US national security. Canadian aluminium strengthens US national security and has done so for decades through unparalleled co-operation between our two countries.”The tariff war between the neighbouring nations comes as a repeat of events in 2018 when Canada had also retaliated by imposing $ 16.6 billion worth of tariffs on American products entering the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-imposes-dollar-to-dollar-retaliatory-measures-after-us-slaps-new-tariffs/story-37hCUTa7MlYSQu5se8n3AK.html

It has been conducting follow-up visits with ‘100 recovered patients’ since April.The findings of the research have been startling. Peng’s team said that the recovered patients could only walk for 400 metres in six minutes, unlike their healthy peers who could cover a distance of 500 metres in the same time. This is based on the walking test with the patients.Also Read: US will end reliance on China, other nations for pharmaceuticalsThe first phase of this one-year programme finished in July.

Asad Umar, minister for planning, announced on Thursday restrictions on the hospitality and recreational sectors would be lifted from August 10. “Restaurants and cafes, outdoor and indoor, will be allowed to open from Monday, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be finalised in the next two to three days,” Umar said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe recreational sector, which includes public and amusement parks, theatres, cinemas and arcades will also be allowed to open from Monday along with business and expo centres and salons. Marriage halls can open from September 15 and hotels can host wedding ceremonies, he said.Permission was also being given for organising tournaments and matches involving non-contact sports without the presence of an audience from Monday, in addition to allowing indoor gymnasiums and sports clubs to open.Educational institutions will open from September 15, but a final review of the situation will be carried out on September 7.Umar added that restrictions on transport, specifically railways and airlines, were also being lifted. “But restrictions on the number of people that can be present on trains and planes, and the condition to seat passengers with a gap, will remain in place till September.”He explained that these would also be lifted by October if the situation allowed. Restrictions on road travel were also being lifted on Monday but permission will not be given for standing and travelling on buses.Permission was also being given for opening shrines. However, in case of a large gathering, citizens will be bound to follow the guidelines issued by the government.“The threat has not gone away. The situation has improved because the government formulated a clear strategy which was implemented by the administrative machinery,” the minister said.Seen as a brave move by the Imran Khan government to return the country to normalcy, many have cautioned that Pakistan is moving too quickly.

Here’s everything you need to know about them||Researchers and pharmaceutical companies around the globe are racing to find a vaccine for the coronavirus disease. While some companies are still focussing on the initial round of clinical trials for their vaccine candidate, others have raced ahead to third and final phase of testing.In fact, US President Donald Trump, whose government is pouring in billions for a Covid-19 vaccine, said on Thursday it was possible that the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine before the November 3 election.However, top US infectious diseases official Anthony Fauci, a leading voice in the healthcare fraternity, had given a more conservative outlook. He had said on Wednesday that drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year. Fauci said there could be a billion vaccine doses available by the end of 2021, and that the world could get past the pandemic by then.Also Read: Who should be the first in line for Covid-19 vaccine? Experts debateThe companies which are the front runners in the race to find a Covid-19 vaccine are Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax.Here is a look at how these companies are preparing their vaccine candidates and where do they stand:Moderna is developing the mRNA-1273 vaccine to fight the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19. The company announced last week that it has started phase 3 clinical trials in the United States. The trial is being conducted at nearly 100 research sites in the US. Moderna had conducted the second phase of clinical trial in May, but the results are available only for the first phase. Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine generated an immune system response, but many volunteers participating in the company’s drug trial reported side effects like fatigue, chills, headache and muscle pain.Pfizer has more than one vaccine candidate and CNN reported that it has started combined Phase 2/3 trial with one of them, BNT162b2. The vaccine is being developed jointly with German company BioNTech. CNN further reported that the trials are being conducted at about 120 sites worldwide. Pfizer is expected to apply for regulatory approvals as early as October. In its initial trial, the vaccine produced antibodies and also generated immune response. Pfizer claimed that the vaccine created a tolerability profile and led to mild side effects like fever, fatigue and chills.Novavax will start the Phase 3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 next month. The first phase of the trial showed it generated antibodies to fight the coronavirus disease, the company said in a release. It further claimed that the level of antibodies the vaccine generated was four times those developed by the people who recovered from the coronavirus disease. Talking about the side effects, Novavax said that the volunteers experienced muscle pain, nausea and joint pain, and at least of them had mild fever. The US-based company said that it has entered a supply and license agreement with Serum Institute of India for the development and commercialisation of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The deal was signed on July 30, according to an SEC filing by Novavax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-set-to-enter-final-stage-of-trial-here-s-everything-you-need-to-know-about-them/story-c6WiI6BpU5w14ik7gm6zlM.html

The researchers from National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Russia noted that the structural elements of the novel coronavirus that are less subject to mutation during its evolution should be chosen as a target for the potential treatment. Otherwise, a medication effective against one strain would no longer be effective against another, they said. The best candidates for this are conservative proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus main protease M pro, according to the study published in the Mendeleev Communications journal. In addition to being resistant to mutations, M pro plays a major role in coronavirus replication, which means that its inhibition is able to slow down or even completely stop its reproduction inside the body, the researchers said. The potential drugs were taken from the database of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The modelling data demonstrated that sulphur-containing drugs show unusually high ligand efficiency at the active centre of SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro, but only disulfiram 4 retains stable interactions. Most commonly used for treating alcoholism, disulfiram fights SARS-CoV-2 in two ways, the researchers said. First, as previously demonstrated in vitro with SARS and MERS coronaviruses, it is a covalent inhibitor, they said. It fights Covid-19 symptoms such as the significant decrease in reduced glutathione, which is an important antioxidant, according to the researchers. This deficiency may lead to severe manifestations of the disease, they said. The Russian chemists said they were also the first to predict the potential efficiency of neratinib, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, against SARS-CoV-2. According to the researchers, the tests that were performed on July 27, 2020, demonstrated that disulfiram really inhibits M pro in 100 nm concentration, which confirmed the results of the modelling. The second substance -- neratinib -- demonstrated activity on M pro, but it was insufficient for clinical use, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alcoholism-drug-may-help-in-fight-against-covid-19-study-says/story-suvtkWAxNU7Lnc5zOic7yJ.html
07-08-2020||World||US will end reliance on China, other nations for pharmaceuticals, says Donald Trump||The US will end its reliance on China and other foreign nations for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, President Donald Trump has said, asserting that Beijing would have to pay the price for the wound it has inflected on America and the world by spreading the deadly coronavirus.President Trump and leaders of several countries have accused China of not being transparent in reporting the deadly disease, leading to huge human casualties and economic crisis across the world. China, however, has denied US’ accusation of covering up the extent of its coronavirus outbreak and accused America of attempting to divert public attention by insinuating that the virus originated from a virology laboratory in Wuhan. “What China did is a terrible thing. Whether it was incompetence or on purpose, it was a terrible thing that they did … not only to the United States, but to the world. A terrible thing,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday before flying to Ohio to visit a Whirlpool manufacturing plant.What China did to the rest of the world and the US is a disgrace, said the president, asserting that Beijing would have to pay the price for the wound it has inflected on America and the world by spreading the deadly coronavirus.Hours later addressing workers at the manufacturing plant in Ohio, Trump alleged that the previous Obama-Biden administration was perfectly happy to let China win. “Over the course of the next four years, we will bring our pharmaceutical and medical supply chains home and we will end reliance on China and other foreign nations,” Trump said as he laid out his vision to bring millions more jobs and thousands more factories back to American shores. “Today, to define our path forward, I am making our incredible workers six more promises that I will keep over the next four years. First and foremost, we will defeat the China virus,” he said, adding that the strategy shelters those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to get safely back to work and school. Instead of a never-ending blanket lockdown, causing severe long-term public health consequences, “we have a targeted and data-driven approach”, he said.“Today, using the Defense Production Act, we are engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilisation since World War II. Over the last six months, we have witnessed one manufacturing miracle after another,” he said. Trump said he had signed a new executive order to ensure that when it comes to essential medicines, the US buys American. This executive order will require that the US government agencies purchase all the essential medicines it needs from American sources. “My fifth promise to American workers is to bring back American jobs and factories using every tool at my disposal—including tariffs, countervailing duties, and new trade deals based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity,” he said. “As long as I am President of the United States, I will fight for you with every ounce of energy and strength that I have. I will be your voice. I will defend your jobs. I will stand up to foreign trade cheaters and violators,” Trump said. As seen in this pandemic, the United States must produce essential equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals for itself, he said. “We cannot rely on China and other nations across the globe that could one day deny us products in a time of need. We can’t do it. We can’t do it. We have to be smart,” he said.“And speaking of pharmaceuticals, we instituted four moves, rebates, favourite nations, and other things buying from other nations where they have the product, the same exact pills, identical, made in the same factory for a fraction, just a small fraction of the cost. We buy from other countries as opposed to buying through this ridiculous quagmire of political scam that we’ve been going through for many years,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-end-reliance-on-china-other-nations-for-pharmaceuticals-says-donald-trump/story-dAcJNEjPlKaRpyJzufUN9I.html

The official results declared showed that the Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) alone had won 145 seats and with its allies have 150 seats, a two thirds majority in the 225-member parliament. The party led by the prime minister won all but 4 of the 22 electoral districts on offer. The victory margins in the South, dominated by the majority Sinhala community, were in the high 60 per cent mark in most areas. The party polled 6.8 million votes at 59.9 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first world leaders to congratulate Rajapaksa on the outcome of the elections and said the two sides will work together to further advance all areas of bilateral cooperation and to take their special ties to ever newer heights.“Thank you PM @narendramodi for your congratulatory phone call. With the strong support of the people of #SriLanka, I look forward to working with you closely to further enhance the long-standing cooperation between our two countries. Sri Lanka & India are friends & relations,” Rajapaksa tweeted.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who won the November presidential election on the SLPP ticket, had called a snap election six months ahead of the schedule. In the parliamentary election, he was seeking 150 seats mandatory to execute constitutional changes in the main to repeal the 19th amendment to the Constitution which had curbed presidential powers while strengthening the role of parliament. The biggest casualty from the result was the United National Party (UNP) of former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The UNP managed to win only one seat and that too came thanks to the cumulative votes polled nationally. The country’s grandest political party failed to win a single seat from any of the 22 districts. Its leader and a four-time prime minister was unseated for the first time since he entered parliament in 1977. Wickremesinghe failed to win from Colombo district as his party finished fourth in most constituencies. The UNP only polled 249,435 votes or just 2 per cent of the vote and was relegated to the fifth position nationally. Wickremesinghe’s former deputy and the presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa, who had broken away from the UNP to form his own party SJB, has done well by winning 55 seats with its main Muslim party ally bagging it the solitary district win in the eastern port district of Trincomalee. The SJB polled 2.7 million or 23 per cent and has emerged the second largest party., according to the results. The main Tamil party TNA did not fare too well as their parliamentary representation saw a reduction for a total of 10 seats from the 16 it had won the last time. The party managed to win three districts in the Tamil-dominated North and polled 327,168 votes or 2.82 per cent, the results showed. The Marxist JVP despite winning only 3 seats from their 6 in the previous election retained its position as the third force in the country by pushing the former ruling party UNP to the fourth and in many areas to even fifth and sixth places. They polled 445,958 or 3.84 per cent of the total vote. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 2 dissolved parliament, six months ahead of the schedule, and called for snap polls on April 25. However, the election commission in mid-April postponed the elections by nearly two months to June 20 due to the coronavirus outbreak in the island nation. In June, the commission informed the apex court that the polls cannot be held on June 20 because of the coronavirus pandemic and the new date was decided following a unanimous decision reached between the members of the commission. The election commission held several mock polls to put into practice health guidelines and even extended the poll time by one hour in view of the pandemic. There are over 16 million eligible voters in the country. The August 5 poll will elect a 225-member parliament for a five-year term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahinda-rajapaksa-led-slpp-registers-landslide-victory-in-sri-lanka-s-parliamentary-polls/story-oIfCmwPQlInfKRCeU3ETUO.html

Mike Horning, an associate professor of multimedia journalism in the Virginia Tech School of Communication, said the growth of TikTok has raised concerns among security experts because it uses a powerful algorithm that customises content to users based on a number of user characteristics. His remarks came days after technology giant Microsoft said it will continue talks to purchase TikTok’s American business following a conversation between its India-born CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald Trump. The statement from the Redmond-headquartered Microsoft came after Trump said that he could use the emergency economic powers or an executive order to ban TikTok in the US over national security issues. “The app has gained attention because it uses a powerful algorithm that customises content to users based on a number of user characteristics. This algorithm collects such sophisticated data about users that the data is attractive to both corporations and governments,”Horning said. “However, the company has not been very transparent about who it sells your data to. Analyses of their data capturing methods have shown that personal data could be shared with hundreds of other companies,” he said.Also read: Donald Trump says TikTok must sell US operations by September 15 or close Horning said that because the app is located in China, its data sharing practices are susceptible to Chinese law which requires that data be made available to Chinese officials, raising security concerns. “The sale of the app to an American-based company could alleviate concerns that American data is being shared with foreign powers that are not always working in our mutual interests. An acquisition by Microsoft would provide another asset to the company which has been making investments in some social networks such as LinkedIn. It would also have the potential for lawmakers to provide certain restrictions on data sharing and collection practices in the future,” said Horning, director of social informatics research in the Center for Human Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. His research examines how communication technologies impact social attitudes and behaviours, with a current focus on the impact of “fake news” and misinformation in democratic processes.Also read: What US ban on Chinese app TikTok would mean India has banned as many as 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, a move welcomed by both the Trump administration and the US lawmakers. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently said TikTok cannot stay in the current format in the US as it “risks sending back information on 100 million Americans”. In recent weeks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused TikTok of collecting personal information of Americans. TikTok has previously stressed that its US user data is already stored on US-based servers and backed up in Singapore, and is therefore not subject to Chinese law as some US officials have feared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-s-sale-to-us-firm-may-alleviate-security-concerns-expert/story-d8IucWOGtLFFUtNsXcu5iI.html

These are big pieces of ice,” said Luke Copland, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa who was part of the research team studying the Milne Ice Shelf.The shelf’s area shrank by about 80 square kilometers. By comparison, the island of Manhattan in New York covers roughly 60 square kilometers.“This was the largest remaining intact ice shelf, and it’s disintegrated, basically,” Copland said.The Arctic has been warming at twice the global rate for the last 30 years, due to a process known as Arctic amplification. But this year, temperatures in the polar region have been intense. The polar sea ice hit its lowest extent for July in 40 years. Record heat and wildfires have scorched Siberian Russia.Summer in the Canadian Arctic this year in particular has been 5 degrees Celsius above the 30-year average, Copland said.That has threatened smaller ice caps, which can melt quickly because they do not have the bulk that larger glaciers have to stay cold. As a glacier disappears, more bedrock is exposed, which then heats up and accelerates the melting process.“The very small ones, we’re losing them dramatically,” he said, citing researchers’ reviews of satellite imagery. “You feel like you’re on a sinking island chasing these features, and these are large features. It’s not as if it’s a little tiny patch of ice you find in your garden.”The ice shelf collapse on Ellesmere Island also meant the loss of the northern hemisphere’s last known epishelf lake, a geographic feature in which a body of freshwater is dammed by the ice shelf and floats atop ocean water.A research camp, including instruments for measuring water flow through the ice shelf, was lost when the shelf collapsed. “It is lucky we were not on the ice shelf when this happened,” said researcher Derek Mueller of Carleton University in Ottawa, in an Aug. 2 blog post.Ellesmere also lost its two St. Patrick Bay ice caps this summer.“We saw them going, like someone with terminal cancer. It was only a matter of time,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado.Serreze and other NSIDC scientists had published a 2017 study predicting the ice caps were likely to disappear within five years. The ice caps were believed to have formed several centuries ago.The vanishing was confirmed last month, when NASA satellite shots of the region revealed a complete lack of snow and ice, said Serreze, who studied the caps as a graduate student on his first trip to the Arctic years ago. At the time, he said, the caps had seemed like immovable parts of the geography.“When I was there in the 1980s I knew every square inch of those ice caps,” he said. “You have the memories. It’s like your first girlfriend.”Meanwhile, another two ice caps on Ellesmere - called Murray and Simmons - are also diminishing and are likely to disappear within 10 years, Serreze said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-last-fully-intact-arctic-ice-shelf-collapses/story-sIcnbxddqNCXcmbwJrmBFK.html
07-08-2020||World||Global Covid-19 cases top 19 million as Europe tightens curbs||Coronavirus cases worldwide passed 19 million Thursday, as European nations imposed new travel restrictions and containment measures with fears growing over a second wave of infections.The global figure, compiled by AFP from official sources at 2300 GMT, was driven by surges in Latin America and India -- and a new milestone in Africa as the continent hit one million cases.Global deaths from the pandemic have topped 700,000, and Europe remains the hardest-hit region worldwide with more than 200,000 fatalities since the virus first emerged in China late last year.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayMore than half of Africa’s cases are in South Africa, which has the fifth highest number of infections in the world, after the US, Brazil, India and Russia.Nevertheless the African continent remains one of the least affected, according to the official figures, with only Oceania registering fewer Covid-19 cases.As governments across the globe struggle to salvage economies ravaged by months of lockdown, many have been forced to look at new measures to curb outbreaks of Covid-19 since they lifted initial containment orders.In Australia, the second-largest city Melbourne entered the country’s toughest lockdown yet on Thursday, closing non-essential businesses and requiring hundreds of thousands more people to stay home.Also read| Covid-19: India posts its second million in just 21 daysThe pandemic has killed at least 712,315 people worldwide with the United States recording the most deaths with almost 160,000, followed by Brazil with nearly 100,000. Globally, 40 percent of all cases have been recorded in the two countries.Germany is the latest to introduce mandatory tests for travellers returning from designated risk zones, starting on Saturday, as fears grow over rising case numbers blamed on summer holidays and local outbreaks.Germany’s list of “risk zones” currently includes most non-EU countries, as well as certain provinces in Belgium and Spain. Neighbouring Austria on Thursday announced it would issue a travel warning for mainland Spain, becoming the latest country to do so amid a rise in new coronavirus cases in the fellow EU member.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Finland also introduced new controls on arrivals from some EU countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands and Andorra, putting a stop to tourists arriving from there and imposing a 14-day quarantine on other returnees.“The situation is extremely delicate,” the health ministry’s strategic director Liisa-Maria Voipio-Pulkki said, adding that “some sort of second stage has begun.”“Whether we can expect a smaller wave or a larger wave depends on how we respond.”Britain has reimposed quarantine for travellers from Belgium, Andorra and the Bahamas.Norway announced Thursday that France would be considered a red zone due to the resurgence of coronavirus cases there, meaning all travellers arriving from France face a mandatory ten-day quarantine. Switzerland, Monaco and the Czech Republic were also hit with similar restrictions, as well as two Swedish regions, the Norwegian foreign affairs ministry said.“The infectious situation can change quickly, as can the restrictions,” Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide said.The United States bucked the trend despite its own soaring death toll, lifting a blanket warning against all foreign travel.“Health and safety conditions (are) improving in some countries and potentially deteriorating in others,” the State Department said in a statement.Business struggles Many nations are seeing new outbreaks, forcing local or citywide lockdowns and other quarantine measures.Poland will re-impose compulsory face masks in all public spaces in nine districts amid a new high in infections.The restrictions will come into force from Saturday and will also affect sports and cultural events in those areas, mainly in the south and east.Greece’s government on Wednesday announced a “wake-up week” on COVID-19, tightening restrictions after the steady rise in mostly domestic infections.Officials have blamed the increase on overcrowding in clubs and social events.The new virus outbreaks are forcing officials into an uncomfortable trade-off between public health and the need to bring economies back to life.German airline Lufthansa on Thursday became the latest to reveal the fallout from the pandemic, announcing forced layoffs and a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) loss in the second quarter. Announcing its worst quarter in the company’s history, Lufthansa said in the three months to June its passenger numbers had collapsed by 96 percent compared to last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-cases-top-19-million-as-europe-tightens-curbs/story-hG8I5IsYwXab2pa4aY3MKO.html
07-08-2020||World||Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God||President Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president’s faith in God.Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump’s remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.“He’s following the radical left agenda, take away your guns, destroy your 2nd Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy, our kind of energy. I don’t think he’s going to do too well in Ohio,” Trump said.Biden’s campaign responded that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s faith is “at the core of who he is.”Trump also used his trip to Ohio to talk trade, telling workers at a Whirlpool plant, “I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country.”Barely one month after a new North America trade agreement went into effect, Trump announced his intention to reimpose 10% tariffs on aluminum imported from Canada, saying that United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has advised him the step was necessary to defend the US aluminum industry. However, the move also sets up the possibility of retaliation against US companies and producers.“Canada was taking advantage of us as usual,” Trump said.The administration said the president had exempted Canada last year from tariffs he had imposed as long as imports of steel and aluminum from Canada remained at historical levels. But there has been a surge that has intensified in recent months despite a contraction in US demand.Trump also sought to remind voters of the economic prosperity that much of the nation enjoyed before the coronavirus pandemic and said that he is best suited to rebuild a crippled economy. But his handling of the outbreak has weakened his bid for a second term, causing Trump to spend time and resources in a state he won easily in 2016 but now could be in danger of slipping away.The virus already altered the trip even before Trump landed, with word that GOP Gov. Mike DeWine had tested positive for the coronavirus. DeWine had planned to meet with Trump and join the president on a visit to the Whirlpool Corp. plant in northwest Ohio. DeWine’s office said the 73-year-old governor had no symptoms and was returning to Columbus.Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded to Trump’s comments by saying, “Joe Biden’s faith is at the core of who he is; he’s lived it with dignity his entire life, and it’s been a source of strength and comfort in times of extreme hardship.”Bates also accused Trump of using a Bible “for his own cynical optics as he sought to tear our nation apart at a moment of crisis and pain,” a reference to when federal law enforcement officers drove protesters out of Lafayette Square shortly before a photo opportunity in which Trump held a Bible.For Trump, the Ohio trip kicked off a long weekend of fundraising that comes as Biden has chipped away at Trump’s financial advantage with the race entering its final three months.The virus upended Trump’s plan to run on the back of a strong economy, and Biden has charged that the president has pushed to reopen states too soon in hopes of jump-starting the markets and lifting his standing in the polls. But several states have had to slow down the pace of their reopening, and officials are warily watching a rise in coronavirus cases in the Midwest, including Ohio.When Trump swept through the region in 2016, his economic populism argument was one of the factors that led him to narrowly capture Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. He handily won Ohio, which had been a swing state for decades, by eight percentage points.He promised a manufacturing renaissance, but that has failed to materialize. Manufacturers added jobs during the first two years of his presidency, but the gains effectively stalled in 2019 as industrial Midwestern states such as Michigan and Ohio began to shed factory workers.The import taxes charged by his administration hampered manufacturing companies’ supply lines and created uncertainty. The economy had roughly 12.85 million factory jobs at the start of the election year, compared with the 14 million before the 2008 financial crisis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The pandemic only compounded the pain. Manufacturers cut 1.36 million jobs between February and April as the economy went on lockdown. Hiring in May and June has pointed to a slight recovery. But even if factories add 267,500 jobs expected in the July employment report being released Friday, the sector would still have 500,000 fewer jobs than it did before the outbreak.Trump now finds himself severely tested in battleground states, and campaign aides have privately all but written off Michigan. The president now has been forced to spend time in states that his campaign once thought he had locked up. The Ohio trip comes a week after he visited once deeply Republican Texas.“We’re going to win Ohio by even more this time,” Trump claimed.In Ohio, Trump signed an executive order requiring that the federal government purchase certain drugs from US manufacturers rather than from foreign companies. The order would instruct the government to develop a list of “essential” medicines and then buy them and other medical supplies solely from US manufacturers.The administration has long looked to reduce US dependency on drugs made overseas, particularly in China. The new order invokes the Defense Production Act to procure essential medicines and other equipment from the United States, but does not stipulate precisely which drugs would fall under the requirements.Trump has said he wants to prepare for future pandemics by replenishing the national stockpile and bringing manufacturing of critical supplies and equipment back to the US His critics have suggested that his administration was woefully unprepared for coronavirus, which has killed more than 157,000 Americans, and that Trump has faltered in mobilizing the nation’s resources to battle the virus.After his trip to Ohio, Trump plans a long weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with a high-dollar fundraiser in the Hamptons on New York’s Long Island and a second near the Jersey shore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/playing-electoral-defense-trump-claims-biden-opposes-god/story-uREdpPARIalqrMtaV5A6BM.html
07-08-2020||World||Trump targets Canada, reimposing tariffs on aluminum||President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States is reinstating a 10% import tax on Canadian aluminum, raising tensions with an American ally just weeks after his trade pact with Canada and Mexico took effect.Canada quickly vowed to respond in kind.Trump originally imposed the tariffs on aluminum imports in 2018. He then lifted them last year on Canadian and Mexican metals to smooth the way for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. The USMCA took effect July 1 and was expected to bring stability to North American trade.Instead, Trump declared Thursday that he is reimposing the tariffs on Canada. Speaking at a Whirlpool plant in Ohio, the president said that Canada had promised that “its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all of our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they did.’’Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called the tariffs “unwarranted and unacceptable” and said Canada intends to swiftly impose dollar-for-dollar countermeasures.“In the time of a global pandemic and an economic crisis, the last thing Canadian and American workers need is new tariffs that will raise costs for manufacturers and consumers, impede the free flow of trade, and hurt provincial and state economies,” Freeland said in a statement.Trade lawyer Daniel Ujczo with Dickinson Wright PLLC in Columbus, Ohio, predicted that Canada will retaliate with tariffs of its own — unless US and Canadian negotiators can reach a truce before the tit-for-tat import taxes begin.Ujczo said the tariffs appear designed to win Trump election year support from voters in Ohio, an industrial state. But the tactic, he said, might not work during an economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.“Voters here in Ohio were willing to give the president a long leash on tariffs when the economy was strong’’ and Trump was using the sanctions as leverage to get a North American trade deal, Ujczo said. But “the dealmaker in chief already got his win with Canada and Mexico. These folks will see it as nothing more than a political tool in a time of economic hardship.’’Aluminum imports from Canada rose sharply from February to March but have since leveled off and actually dropped 2.6% from May to June, according to the Aluminum Association trade group.“Claims of a ‘surge’ of primary aluminum imports from Canada are simply not accurate,’’ said Tom Dobbins, the association’s president. He added: “Especially now, the US should be focused on getting the manufacturing economy going again in the region – not picking battles with USMCA trading partners.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-targets-canada-reimposing-tariffs-on-aluminum/story-w4rbvHYEvdQ7pe2uhRMjkM.html

There have been no reported casualties amongst the Indian community there. There have been five minor injuries which have been reported,” Srivastava said. “Our embassy is in touch with the community associations and it is extending all necessary assistance,” he said.Tuesday’s blast, which killed more than 130 people, wounded thousands and left tens of thousands homeless, is believed to have been caused when a fire touched off a stockpile of 2,750 tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate that authorities left sitting in a warehouse for years, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-explosion-5-indians-suffered-minor-injuries-says-mea/story-NS7YwwTviAlp9faxa4ka7H.html

Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted also took the coronavirus test and tested negative, DeWine’s statement said.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said alternate arrangements were being made for greeting Trump and there would be no major changes to the president’s itinerary in Ohio. “The President wishes Governor DeWine a speedy and full recovery and commends the job he’s doing for the great state of Ohio,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere.At the Whirlpool plant in Clyde, Ohio, Trump will tout the tariffs his administration imposed on imported washing machines in 2018, which have helped increase employment at the facility while contributing to price increases for the appliances.Trump also plans to sign a long-awaited executive order aimed at boosting US production of drugs and medical equipment, including through a “Buy America” provision requiring the government to buy from domestic firms and other measures..Later on Thursday, Trump is due to attend fundraising events at a Cleveland-area yacht club and at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ohio-governor-mike-dewine-tests-positive-for-covid-19-cancels-plans-to-greet-prez-trump-in-cleveland/story-vnntw4yrEfeAtsHykQuHRO.html
07-08-2020||World||Donald Trump imposes US ban on WeChat, TikTok in 45 days||US President Donald Trump announced Thursday sweeping bans on US transactions with China’s ByteDance, owner of video-sharing app TikTok, and Tencent, operator of the WeChat app, starting in 45 days, in a major escalation of tensions with Beijing.The executive orders come as the Trump administration said this week it was stepping up efforts to purge “untrusted” Chinese apps from US digital networks and called the Chinese-owned short-video app TikTok and messenger app WeChat “significant threats.”Tiktok, the hugely popular video-sharing app, has come under fire from US lawmakers and the administration over national security concerning data collection, amid intensified tension between Washington and Beijing.Trump issued the orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the administration sweeping power to bar US firms or citizens from trading or conducting financial transactions with sanctioned parties.Also read: China accuses US of ‘outright bullying’ over TikTokUS secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Wednesday expanded efforts on a program it calls “Clean Network” would focus on five areas and include steps to prevent various Chinese apps, as well as Chinese telecoms companies, from accessing sensitive information on American citizens and businesses.The latest move comes soon after the US ordered China to vacate its consulate in Houston, Texas followed by China’s order requiring the US to vacate its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross will identify transactions covered by the prohibition after the order takes effect in mid-September. The order leaves key unanswered questions about the restrictions.James Lewis, a technology expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the moves appeared coordinated with Pompeo’s Wednesday announcement.Also read: Trump seeks TikTok payment to US, despite no clear authority“This is the rupture in the digital world between the U.S. and China,” he said. “Absolutely, China will retaliate.”Lewis said there are only about 3 million WeChat users in the United States and they are mostly Chinese.“It’s much more a collection risk than TikTok. On the other hand, it is collecting on Chinese,” Lewis said.Tencent shares fell 4% on the news.Trump said this week he would support the sale of TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft Corp if the US government got a “substantial portion” of the sales price but nevertheless said he will ban the service in the United States on Sept. 15.There are 100 million TikTok users in the United States and Republicans have raised concerns about the political fallout of banning the popular app in the United States.Also read: Donald Trump says he does not mind if Microsoft buys TikTokThe TikTok app may be used for disinformation campaigns that benefit the Chinese Communist Party, and the United States “must take aggressive action against the owners of TikTok to protect our national security,” Trump said in one order.In the other, Trump said WeChat “automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information.”The order would effectively ban WeChat in the United States in 45 days by barring “to the extent permitted under applicable law, any transaction that is related to WeChat by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with Tencent Holdings Ltd.”Tencent and ByteDance declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-issues-order-to-ban-transactions-with-tiktok-s-chinese-owner/story-pMRqliPOUqCh2LIGE0FlNK.html
