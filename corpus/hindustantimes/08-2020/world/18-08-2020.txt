Overtime work will “continue to be” approved as needed, he said.The announcement follows concerns from Democrats and others over apparent mail slowdowns. They also pointed out that DeJoy was a campaign donor before taking office in June.Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the House back on Saturday to vote on legislation to halt post office cutbacks and give the agency $25 billion in additional funding.“The post office in these times of coronavirus is really election central,” Pelosi said during an event with Politico Tuesday. “Well, he should,” she said, when suddenly handed a note about a news report on DeJoy’s announcement he is suspending changes.Meanwhile, the attorneys general for Washington and Pennsylvania were briefing reporters on Tuesday on plans for separate, multistate lawsuits that would seek to halt operational changes at the Postal Service. More than a dozen other states had signed onto the effort, including California, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Nevada. No Republican attorneys general had signed onto the suits.“By interfering with the Postal Service, President Trump is putting both our democracy and people’s health at risk,” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement Tuesday. “We are suing to ensure the integrity of our electoral process and to make sure each and every vote is counted during this election.”Recent media reports have pointed to the removal of mail sorting machines in various cities, as well as the taking of mailboxes off the streets. Post office operating hours have been reduced and overtime work cut. The agency’s inspector general is investigating those moves.DeJoy said Tuesday that the Postal Service “is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall.”“Even with the challenges of keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy as they operate amid a pandemic, we will deliver the nation’s election mail on time and within our well-established service standards,” he said in the statement. “The American public should know that this is our number one priority between now and election day.”Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said Trump and DeJoy had recklessly made changes in a way that was illegal.“There is a process for changes like this one that requires going before the postal regulatory commission and holding public hearings,” Shapiro told reporters. “DeJoy opted to do just what he and Trump wanted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-postal-service-suspends-usps-change-until-after-2020-election/story-3subv5bVpq4eSkm1FZnXkJ.html

At the current pace, fires could approach the all-time record for any month since records began in 1998.“It is extremely difficult to combat, control and combat again a fire with the dimensions that we have seen here in the Pantanal,” said Paulo Barroso, president of the local firefighting committee.Firefighters in the area worked to douse smoldering earth that was charred black as clouds of smoke billowed hundreds of feet into the air.Roughly 8,500 square kilometers, or nearly 6% of the Pantanal, has already burned in January to July, according to government data.The Pantanal is 10 times the size of the Everglades wetlands in the U.S. state of Florida. The region is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet with more than 4,700 plant and animal species, including threatened ones like the jaguar, according to advocacy group WWF.Most of the largest sanctuary for the blue Hyacinthine Macaw parrots has gone up in flames this year, Brazil’s Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported.The region has been suffering from below-average rainfall and higher-than-average temperatures in the past 30 days, according to data provider Refinitiv.The blazes in the Pantanal come amid rising concerns about fires in the Amazon, its much larger neighbor to the north. Fires spiked in the first few days of August in the Amazon, but were down by 17% for Aug. 1-15, compared with the same period a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surging-fires-threaten-world-s-largest-wetland-in-brazil/story-ZSLJc4HlhoECh6bhfIQwuL.html
18-08-2020||World||Belarus president remains defiant as strikes widen||More workers in Belarus joined a widening strike Tuesday as they press for the resignation of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has extended his 26-year rule in an election the opposition says was rigged.Lukashenko has bluntly rejected the demands to step down following a harsh police crackdown on peaceful protesters in the days after the Aug. 9 vote. In a move intended to secure the loyalty of law enforcement agencies amid the swelling demonstrations and strikes, he signed a decree honoring over 300 police officers for their service.The opposition denounced the awards as a national insult following the suppression of protests with rubber bullets, stun grenades and clubs. Nearly 7,000 people were detained, hundreds were injured and at least two people died.The Interior Ministry that oversees police insisted the awards weren’t linked to the crackdown that has galvanized public anger and drawn international criticism.Lukashenko’s actions prompted thousands — including workers at state-controlled factories and plants, actors and broadcasters — to walk off the job.The prospect of a massive nationwide shutdown was an unprecedented challenge to Lukashenko, who has relied on blue-collar workers as the core of his supporters. During Monday’s visit to a factory in Minsk he was heckled and jeered by workers shouting “Go away!”“The authorities should understand that they are losing control,” head of an independent miners’ union Yuri Zakharov told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “Only Lukashenko’s resignation and punishment of those in charge of rigging and beatings can calm us down. “The strike will continue and grow until he steps down.”The labor action that began Monday quickly grew to several major industrial plants, including a huge factory that accounts for a fifth of the world’s potash fertilizer output.In the city of Soligorsk, home to the giant Belaruskali potash factory, strike organizer Anatoly Bokun said workers at all potash mines have halted work. The factory, which employs 16,000, is Belarus’ major cash earner.“They are putting pressure on us and threatening us with mass dismissals, but we will not return to work until Lukashenko steps down,” Bokun said as thousands of workers joined a protest rally.“They have stolen our choice,” said one striking worker, 32-year-old Gleb Sandros. “What else can we do to stop the authorities’ arbitrary and lawless action?”Belarus’ ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya, became the first government official to challenge Lukashenko on Saturday when he posted a video in support of the protests before handing in his resignation.He was joined Tuesday by Belarus’ ambassador to Spain, Pavel Pustavy. In a statement posted on Facebook, he urged authorities to recount the vote and prosecute those who beat peaceful protesters.Workers at state-controlled television and the nation’s most prominent theater also have joined protests.Nearly 1,000 people gathered in front of the Janka Kupala National Theater in Minsk to support members of its troupe who gave notice en masse after its director, Pavel Latushko, was fired for siding with the protesters.Culture Minister Yuri Bondar visited the theater to try to assuage concerns. The actors demanded he reinstate Latushko, a former diplomat and a former culture minister himself, but Bondar refused. He left after being heckled and jeered by the performers, who threw a stack of resignation letters at his feet.“It’s important to speak out, important not to stay silent,” prominent actor Kristina Drobysh told supporters outside the theater. “We’ve overcome our fear, our society has overcome its fear. Belarusians have changed — which means Belarus will change, too.”Several hundred demonstrators also gathered in front of a detention center in Minsk where the husband of Lukashenko’s top challenger in the vote, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was being held to cheer him on his 42nd birthday. Tsikhanouskaya joined the race after the jailing of her husband, Sergei, a popular opposition blogger who had wanted to run for president.Last week, Tsikhanouskaya left the country for Lithuania in a move her campaign said was made under duress. On Monday she declared her readiness to act as a national leader to facilitate a new election. Her top associate, Maria Kolesnikova, said that members of an opposition “coordination council” being formed to negotiate the transition of power would meet Tuesday.“Our goal is to unite society, all of Belarus, so that the Belarusian society has a legitimate institution to negotiate and make demands,” Kolesnikova told the AP.Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former state farm director who has been in office since 1994, described the opposition council’s meeting as an attempt to grab power and warned that the government will take “adequate” steps to “cool those hotheads.”Western officials refused to recognize the election as free or fair and criticized the violent crackdown.The U.N. Security Council scheduled a closed-door discussion of Belarus on Tuesday, and European Union leaders are to discuss it on Wednesday.The EU has anxiously watched a response from Russia, which has a union agreement with Belarus envisaging close political, economic and military ties. Lukashenko spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin twice over the weekend and said that the Russian leader promised him security assistance if Belarus needs it.Russia has remained tight-lipped and said nothing about possible security assistance. Putin on Tuesday had phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Council President Charles Michel to discuss developments in Belarus.Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said she “underlined that the Belarusian government must refrain from violence against peaceful protesters, immediately release political prisoners and enter into a national dialogue with the opposition and (civil) society to overcome the crisis.”According to Macron’s office, he underscored the EU’s “determination to play a constructive role at the side of Belarus people so that the violence toward the population stops immediately” and try to help expedite a political solution.Terse readouts from the Kremlin said Putin underlined the need to refrain from foreign interference in Belarus’ affairs.Asked about developments in the country, President Donald Trump said “it doesn’t seem like there’s too much democracy there in Belarus.”“But we are speaking to lots of people and we’ll be speaking at the appropriate time to Russia and we’ll be speaking to other people that are involved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-president-remains-defiant-as-strikes-widen/story-LLrSs1892O6AgKFzvMBfoM.html
18-08-2020||World||Donald Trump floats idea that fraud could lead to re-do of November election||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a massive shift to mail-in voting in the November presidential election could cause so many problems officials might have to re-do the vote.Trump has said repeatedly and without evidence that a shift to universal mail-in voting - something most states have not proposed doing - will lead to fraud in the Nov. 3 election, when he faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden who currently holds a substantial lead in public opinion polls.Trump does not have the authority to reschedule an election. A national election “re-do” has never occurred in the more than 200 years the U.S. has held elections, including during the Civil War, the Great Depression and two world wars.“It will end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “They’ll have to do it again, and nobody wants that.”As much as half the ballots in the November election could be cast by mail due to America’s coronavirus crisis, election experts say. That is up from about one in four ballots that were cast by mail in 2016.Trump himself votes by mail.As with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare. But Trump on Tuesday repeated an allegation he has made in recent months that mail-in voting will lead to massive ballot fraud.U.S. states run presidential elections and most only plan to mail absentee ballots for November’s election to voters who request them.A handful of states regularly hold elections with what is known as universal mail-in voting, in which every voter receives a ballot by mail. A few other states, including California and Nevada, plan to mail ballots to all voters for the November election due to the health crisis.“Absentee is great but universal is going to be a disaster,” Trump said.Trump late last month floated the idea of delaying the election, a notion that was immediately dismissed by both Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-floats-idea-that-fraud-could-lead-to-re-do-of-november-election/story-ZcYeyWbYzTMTWSgPTeTqAN.html
18-08-2020||World||Officials say Israel, Sudan close to peace agreement||Israel and Sudan on Tuesday said they are close to reaching a peace agreement — setting the stage for a second dramatic diplomatic breakthrough for Israel with its Arab neighbors in a matter of days.A Sudanese Foreign Ministry official announced that his government is “looking forward to concluding a peace agreement with Israel,” drawing a promise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “do all that’s needed” to wrap up a deal.The announcements came days after Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced an agreement to establish formal diplomatic ties.While Sudan does not have the resources and influence of the UAE, it has a far more hostile history toward Israel.Sudan hosted the landmark Arab conference after the 1967 Mideast war where eight Arab countries approved the “three no’s: no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations.In 1993, the U.S. designated Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism for its support of a number of anti-Israel militant groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah.But in recent years those hostilities have softened, and both countries have expressed readiness to normalize relations.Sky News Arabia quoted a Sudanese Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying his government looked forward to a peace agreement “based on equality and Sudanese interests.”“There is no reason to continue hostility between Sudan and Israel,” the spokesman, Haidar Badawi, was quoted as saying.“We don’t deny that there are communications” with Israel, he added, saying both countries would gain much from a deal.In a statement, Netanyahu said Israel, Sudan and the entire region will benefit. “We will do all that’s needed to turn this vision into a reality,” he said.After Thursday’s announcement with the UAE, Netanyahu predicted that other Arab countries would soon follow suit.In February, Netanyahu met Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional government, during a trip to Uganda where they pledged to pursue normalization. The meeting was held secretly and only announced after the fact.An Israeli deal with Sudan would mark a new setback for the Palestinians, who have long counted on the Arab world to press Israel to make concessions to them as a condition for normalization. They have condemned the Emirati decision as treason.But with Mideast peace efforts frozen for over a decade and with encouragement from the Trump administration, Arab countries have increasingly put their own interests first.Sudan is desperate to lift sanctions linked to its listing by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terror — a key step toward ending its isolation and rebuilding its economy after the popular uprising that toppled longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir last year.A Sudanese official had acknowledged in February that the meeting with Netanyahu was orchestrated by the United Arab Emirates and aimed at helping to remove the terror listing, which dates back to the 1990s, when Sudan briefly hosted Osama bin Laden and other wanted militants.Under al-Bashir, Sudan was also believed to have served as a pipeline for Iran to supply weapons to Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel was believed to have been behind airstrikes in Sudan that destroyed a convoy in 2009 and a weapons factory in 2012.Last week’s announcement made the UAE the third Arab country to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel.Egypt was the first, in 1979, followed by Jordan in 1994. Unofficial ties with Gulf Arab nations have also grown in recent years, fueled by shared enmity toward Iran.A deal with Sudan could also give Netanyahu a boost at home.Netanyahu has seen his personal popularity drop due to the coronavirus crisis, which has ravaged the Israeli economy. He also faces widespread criticism while on trial for charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.Israel has long courted African support. In exchange for its expertise in security and other fields, Israel wants African states to side with it at the U.N. General Assembly and other international bodies that have long favored the Palestinians.Israel renewed diplomatic relations with Guinea in 2016. After Netanyahu visited Chad for a renewal of ties in 2019, it was reported that Israel was working to formalize ties with Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-say-israel-sudan-close-to-peace-agreement/story-XdV6LzS2w3oJVYQJfJDX2O.html
18-08-2020||World||France mandating masks at all workplaces as virus reawakens||France is now mandating masks in all workplaces, from the Paris business district to factories in the provinces, as it tries to contain growing virus infections but avoid shutting down the economy.Tuesday’s announcement by the Labor Ministry makes France one of relatively few countries in the world that’s universally requiring workers to wear masks on the job, though they’re routinely worn in many Asian countries and increasingly required in public places beyond.The move came after France’s daily infection count jumped past 3,000 over the weekend, for the first time since May, and as the number of virus patients in hospitals, intensive care units and nursing homes is starting to inch up again. France currently has among the highest infection rates in Europe, and already requires masks in public indoor spaces like restaurants and in many areas outdoors.As of Sept. 1, masks will also be required in all shared, enclosed work spaces, including open-plan or shared offices, corridors, meeting rooms, and changing rooms, according to the new government rules. They can only be removed when someone is alone in an individual office.“The latest scientific knowledge about the possible risk of transmission of the virus via aerosols leads us to adopt a general principle of the systematic wearing of masks in indoor, shared workspaces,” said Laurent Pietraszewski, secretary of state for worker health.About a quarter of the 1,013 virus clusters that have emerged since France ended its strict virus lockdown in May were traced to workplaces, according to the national health agency. Family vacation gatherings, dance parties and other summer events have also led to outbreaks, raising new concern in a country that has already seen more than 30,000 virus-related deaths.Labor Minister Elisabeth Borne said the new measures are needed to ensure “the protection of workers’ health and the continuity of our economic activity.” She and Pietraszewski met with unions Tuesday before announcing the rules.Unions have pushed for more virus protections, and workers at the Louvre Museum, Amazon France and other sites walked off the job earlier this year out of concern that their employers weren’t doing enough to protect them.The requirements will come into effect Sept. 1, when workers around France come back from summer holidays, after details of how to impose and enforce them are worked out with unions and the High Council on Public Health.Some workers are reluctant to wear a mask all day, particularly in professions that require heavy physical activity or phone discussions where masks can make it complicated to communicate. And employers worry about how to enforce eventual mask requirements and provide enough masks.Already France has seen scattered incidents of violence by people refusing to don masks, and the government sent riot police to the Marseille region Tuesday to enforce new outdoor mask requirements at farmers’ markets and several neighborhoods.The French government is also recommending — but not requiring — that employees work from home if they can, and advises that individual lodging be used for itinerant workers instead of collective housing.Many governments encourage masks at work but don’t require them everywhere. Among the few countries that mandate them are India and the Philippines, but enforcement varies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-mandating-masks-at-all-workplaces-as-virus-reawakens/story-jlw3dQUx3AATvyuS4z0rUL.html
18-08-2020||World||Apple expands independent repair shop program to Mac computers||Apple Inc said on Monday it had expanded a program that provides parts and training to independent repair shops to cover its Mac computers.Apple initially launched the program last year, but it only covered iPhones, the company’s biggest-selling product. Mac users previously either had to use Apple or an authorized warranty service provider to get fixes with parts directly from Apple.Apple last month reported an uptick of 21.6% in quarterly Mac sales to $7 billion, as many employees shifted to working from home. Its market share grew to 7.3% in the second quarter from 6.3% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC.“When a device needs repairs, we want people to have access to a safe and reliable solution — this latest expansion joins the thousands of repair locations we’ve added over the past year,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to bringing that convenient and trustworthy repair experience to our Mac users.”Apple’s shift in repair practices came after years of calls from right-to-repair groups who had criticized the company for, among other things, only providing genuine parts and training manuals to firms such as Best Buy Inc

Helpline calls have risen in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, but the real extent of domestic violence during the Covid-19 pandemic is likely under-estimated, as survivors are stuck at home and outreach services are interrupted, Etienne said. “With reduced contact to friends and family or barriers in access to services and shelters, we are leaving survivors with nowhere to go,” she warned. Coronavirus cases in the Americas have reached almost 11.5 million and more than 400,000 people have died as a result of the pandemic, the WHO regional director said.The region continues to carry the highest burden of the disease, with 64% of officially reported global deaths despite having 13% of the world’s population. The biggest drivers of the case counts are the United States and Brazil, she said. But there are increasing cases in the Caribbean, and new infections are rising in Peru, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-causing-mental-health-crisis-at-a-never-seen-before-scale-in-america-who/story-t4d7SHtxYCvQUcPaNnXq6N.html

But not all scientists are convinced, and it’s hard to say how strong any such effect might be.The D614G mutation, which appeared quite early in the pandemic, has since become so common that most outbreaks are caused by strains that carry it.It’s normal for viruses to mutate over time, but most genetic changes don’t affect their behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/has-the-coronavirus-mutated-in-any-significant-way/story-ZI8YesVXreldnzGnYFxGUJ.html

Anthony, a women’s suffrage leader arrested for voting in 1872 in violation of laws permitting only men to vote.Trump’s support has been eroding among suburban white women in battleground states since his last campaign, in part because of his harsh rhetoric.Trump held a White House event to announce the pardon and sign a proclamation declaring August 2020 as National Suffrage Month. But he and the women assembled for the event quickly pivoted to the upcoming election and the outcry over Postal Service disruptions that Democrats say endanger the voting rights of millions of Americans who would vote by mail in November during the coronavirus pandemic.“Win, lose or draw, we have to get it right,” Trump said of the November vote count, leveling a fresh offensive against mail-in voting.“You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,” Trump said.In fact, voter fraud has proved exceedingly rare. The Brennan Center for Justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.Only nine states currently have plans for “universal” mail-in voting, where ballots are sent automatically to registered voters. Five of those states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.Trump said he would sign “a full and complete pardon” for Anthony later Tuesday, the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women the right to vote. It’s also known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.In recent weeks, Trump has been trying to build support within the pivotal female voter constituency and has stepped up his events aimed at women. His campaign has launched a “women for Trump” bus tour and the president has embraced a “law and order” message with renewed vigor.Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.The 19th Amendment states that “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” Congress passed it in 1919, and the amendment was ratified 100 years ago on Aug. 18, 1920.Visiting Anthony’s grave site in Rochester on Election Day has become a popular ritual in recent years. Thousands turned out in 2016 for the presidential match-up between Trump and Hillary Clinton. In 2018, voters showed up by the dozens to put their “I Voted” stickers on her headstone.Not everyone was enthusiastic about the pardon.Democratic New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul demanded that Trump rescind it. “She was proud of her arrest to draw attention to the cause for women’s rights, and never paid her fine,” Hochul tweeted. “Let her Rest In Peace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-pardon-women-s-suffrage-leader-susan-anthony/story-tczy2BwEEbugn184QcpyIO.html

He pointed at 10 instances in which Trump may have attempted to impede his investigation but did not say whether this amounted to obstruction of justice. Trump and his supporters have consistently bristled at suggestions foreign interference helped his upset 2016 victory and sought to discredit the intelligence agencies’ findings as the politically charged work of a “deep state.” Founded by Julian Assange, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails hacked from Clinton’s campaign and a top campaign aide in the weeks before the 2016 election, yielding a drum beat of negative coverage about the Democrat.“WikiLeaks actively sought, and played, a key role in the Russian campaign and very likely knew it was assisting a Russian intelligence influence effort, the report said, saying the panel found “significant indications that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have benefited from Russian government support.”As Russian military intelligence and WikiLeaks released the hacked documents, the report said Trump’s campaign sought advance notice, devised messaging strategies to amplify them “and encouraged further theft of information and ... leaks.”“The Trump campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia and was indifferent to whether it and WikiLeaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort,” the report added.The committee could not establish the extent to which Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone had real inside access to WikiLeaks materials, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-used-manafort-wikileaks-to-boost-donald-trump-in-2016-us-senate/story-VobnOOBWQUwBZxYMaHSZYK.html

18-08-2020||World||National Zoo awaits birth of pandemic panda cub||Zookeepers at Washington’s National Zoo are on furry black-and-white baby watch after concluding that venerable giant panda matriarch Mei Xiang is pregnant and could give birth this week. It’s a welcome bit of good news amid a pandemic that kept the zoo shuttered for months.“We need this! We totally need this joy,” said zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson. “We are all in desperate need of these feel-goods.”Although so-called “phantom pregnancies” are common with pandas and other large bears, Baker-Masson said an ultrasound scan revealed a “really strong-looking, fantastic fetus” that could be delivered this week.“The image was great. She is absolutely pregnant. But things could still happen, just like in a human pregnancy,” Baker-Masson said.The zoo posted a video from the ultrasound on Instagram. “Keep your paws crossed!” the zoo posted, reporting that the fetus was “kicking and swimming in the amniotic fluid.”The announcement of the pregnancy has already touched off a fresh round of panda-mania for one of the zoo’s feature attractions. Viewership on the zoo’s panda-cam has increased 800%.The zoo reopened on a limited basis July 24, with restrictions in place to keep the crowds down. However, all indoor exhibits, including the extremely popular panda house, have remained closed. Visitors can still view the outdoor panda enclosure, but Mei has mostly been staying indoors, creating a nest out of branches. She can still be viewed on the panda cam.Panda births are inherently tricky, with stillbirths and miscarriages happening frequently. There is also a phenomenon called “resorption” whereby the fetus is unexpectedly absorbed back into the mother’s body. Baker-Masson said that is rare with a fetus this well-developed.Another potential complication is the age of the mother. Mei, at 22, would be the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the United States. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23.“Reproductively speaking, she is an older bear,” Baker-Masson said. “But she has been a great mother in the past.”Mei Xiang has successfully given birth to three cubs: Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei. All were transported to China at age 4, under terms of the zoo’s agreement with the Chinese government.Mei was impregnated via artificial insemination, a process which was heavily affected by precautions over the COVID-19 pandemic. The procedure was conducted shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14.Normally, zookeepers would have used a combination of stored frozen sperm and fresh semen extracted from male panda Tian Tian. In order to minimize the number of close-quarters medical procedures conducted, zoo staff decided to skip the extraction and inseminate Mei only with thawed out semen from 2016. If successful, it would be the first of its kind in the U.S. using only frozen sperm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-zoo-awaits-birth-of-pandemic-panda-cub/story-DLtTHFZhnoWmnuHwJ577uN.html

The reductions represent about 9% of the company’s workforce.Marks & Spencer said group revenue fell 13.2% in the quarter ended August 8, driven by a 38% drop in in-store sales of clothing and housewares.Like other retailers, the company has seen a surge in online sales as customers avoid in-store shopping the pandemic. Marks & Spencer said 68% of its orders were delivered to customers’ homes during the quarter, compared with 29% in the previous year.The company said “there remains substantial uncertainty about market conditions and the duration of social-distancing measures, and we are retaining a cautious approach to planning for the balance of the year.″||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-retailer-marks-spencer-cuts-7-000-jobs-due-to-pandemic/story-3Bt0BU5uQkV1l97lgkP8CL.html
18-08-2020||World||China considers imposing tariffs on Australian wine||China on Tuesday began investigating whether Australia is dumping wine in a trade dispute that further strains relations between the countries and could shut the biggest export market for Australian wine.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the anti-dumping investigation involved wine in containers of 2 liters (68 fluid ounces) or smaller imported from Australia from Tuesday.The Australian government denied subsidizing exporters.“We do find this deeply troubling, concerning and perplexing given Australia’s wine industry is not subsidized to export and it’s certainly not dumping product on the world market,” Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said. “Now it’s for China and Beijing to explain the rationale behind these actions and why they have moved to that stage of an investigation.”China’s only other anti-dumping investigation of Australian products effectively closed the China market to Australian barley in May through crippling tariffs. Australia is appealing that decision.The investigation of Australian wine exports, which made 1.1 billion Australian dollars ($795 million) from the Chinese market last year, could take between a year and 18 months.Birmingham said he hopes China will not impose interim trade measures during the investigation.China’s decision to shut out Australian barley a week after it banned beef exports from Australia’s four largest abattoirs over labeling issues has been linked to Australian calls for an independent investigation into the source of the coronavirus as well as responses to the pandemic.Chinese Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned in an Australian newspaper interview in April that Australian wine could be targeted in a Chinese consumer boycott if the government persisted with its call for a coronavirus inquiry.Asked if the wine investigation was a political tactic, Birmingham told reporters, “That’s really a question for China.”“Our hope and expectation is that these matters should be considered and addressed on their merits and that means that Beijing and Chinese authorities should look at the evidence,” Birmingham said.Graeme Shaw, owner of Shaw Wines outside Canberra, said Chinese tariffs would have a considerable effect on large Australian wine producers.“I think the industry should have been expecting something from the comments from the Chinese ambassador,” Shaw told Nine Network television news.Weihuan Zhou, a University of New South Wales international trade expert, suspected the wine probe was part of separate, decadelong trade dispute between the countries over anti-dumping rules, particularly over Australia’s allegations of Chinese dumping of steel products.Bilateral relations had shown improvement since the pandemic after Australia distanced itself from U.S. security concerns over popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat, Zhou said.“I don’t think it’s part of the previous political fight between Australia and China” over the coronavirus, Zhou said. “There have been positive signs of political improvement of the bilateral relationship.”Shares in Australian wine exporter Treasury Wine Estates plunged as much as 17% on the Australian stock market on Tuesday on news of the Chinese investigation.The Melbourne-based company reported to the Australian Securities Exchange in 2018 that it was one of several Australian wine exporters experiencing delays in getting wine through Chinese customs.The company said in a statement to the exchange on Tuesday that it will “cooperate with any requests that we receive for information from Chinese or Australian authorities.”Birmingham said Australian wine was the most expensive on the Chinese market after New Zealand wine. He said he had been unable to speak to his Chinese counterpart about the mounting trade disputes since last year.“Australia is certainly not engaging in any type of war,” he said.Australia has had a free-trade deal with China, its biggest export market, since 2015. Australia is regarded by some as the Western country most susceptible to Chinese economic pressure because of their close economic ties.Zhou said he had long doubted that China would target Australian wine in its diplomatic dispute with Australia because Chinese investors would be harmed.“The Chinese investors are trying to secure a production base in Australia so that they can provide sufficient supply back to the Chinese market,” Zhou said.“That means that if China’s government decides to impose anti-dumping duties against Australian wine, that will hurt the Chinese investors as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-considers-imposing-tariffs-on-australian-wine/story-LJEe8sdHGASbvPWETohTyN.html
18-08-2020||World||Lebanese customs chief arrested over Beirut blast||The head of Lebanon’s customs authority was formally arrested on Monday after being questioned over the massive explosion in Beirut earlier this month, the state-run National News Agency reported. The investigation is focused on why nearly 3,000 tons of explosive ammonium nitrate was being stored at the city’s port. The ignition of the stockpile caused an explosion that tore through the capital, killing at least 180 people and wounding 6,000. Thirty people are still missing after the August 4 blast, which caused an estimated USD 10 billion to USD 15 billion in damage. More than 70,000 workers are believed to be unemployed due to the explosions, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday, on top of 220,000 people estimated to have lost their jobs as a result of the ﬁnancial crisis that began last October last year and those left jobless by the Covid-19 pandemic. Dujarric said some 40,000 buildings were damaged, with 3,000 residential structures severely damaged, and at least 2,000 doctors were either injured or had their clinics destroyed. Documents that surfaced after the blast, the single most destructive in Lebanon’s history, showed that officials have known for years that 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate were stored in a warehouse at the port and knew about the dangers. Judge Fadi Sawwan questioned customs chief Badri Daher, who was detained days after the blast, for 4 1/2 hours in the presence of his two lawyers before issuing the arrest warrant, the agency said. Daher will remain in custody as the investigation continues. NNA said that after questioning Daher, Sawwan headed to the scene of the blast to survey the damage and will later return to question Hassan Koraytem, who was the top port official until the day of the blast. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the probe into the devastating blast is “very complex” and would not be finished quickly. Aoun said the probe is divided into three parts. The first aims to determine the circumstances surrounding the cargo, the second where it came from and who shipped it, and the third to find who was responsible for handling and securing it. Aoun said the FBI and French investigators were helping because “they, more than us, have the capability and ability to find out the details of what got the ship here, what is the source and who owns it.” A nine-member team of FBI investigators landed in Beirut on Sunday, according to a Lebanese aviation official, and were believed to have joined the investigation. French investigators have been active for days at the port. Popular anger has swelled over the ruling elite’s corruption and mismanagement. Lebanon’s government, which is supported by the militant Hezbollah group and its allies, resigned on Aug. 10 and continues to serve in a caretaker capacity. There are no formal consultations underway on who will replace Hassan Diab as prime minister and no likely candidate has emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-customs-chief-arrested-over-beirut-blast/story-7l6xQLbBHZ8xa7yJWAVPBK.html
18-08-2020||World||Belarus gives the EU a chance to show geopolitical relevance||The massive protests in Belarus are a chance for the European Union to try and flex its rarely used foreign-policy muscle in what could be a defining historical moment.The bloc’s 27 leaders will hold an emergency conference call on Wednesday to discuss the violent aftermath of Belarus’s presidential election, which the EU said was neither “free nor fair.” And while options are limited, timely action could sway the outcome while also redefining the EU’s international role.Since emerging from a decade of internal crises -- from euro-area debt chaos to the UK becoming the first country to leave the bloc -- the EU has found itself caught in a struggle between the US and China, and with its old foe Russia still causing trouble. No longer able, and in some cases willing, to piggyback onto American power, the EU wants to strike out on its own.“What we have witnessed in Belarus is not acceptable,” European Council President Charles Michel, who will chair the video conference, said in a letter to the leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.But aside from symbolism, there’s a ceiling to what they can do and toughening the rhetoric remains their main arsenal. The bloc’s foreign ministers have already agreed to start working on sanctions -- though leaders may push to expedite them.Russia’s RoleThe EU’s leadership believes the response to the situation has been too muted, in particular on the role that Russian President Vladimir Putin might play in shoring up Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to an EU official in Brussels. “There should be no outside interference,” Michel made a point of saying in his letter.Eastern European countries geographically close to Belarus such as Poland and the Baltic states pushed for the call, arranged for noon Brussels time on Wednesday, but Michel needed little persuasion, EU officials said.He and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen started their mandates at the end of last year with teams that reflected a new-found focus on international issues and although the coronavirus pandemic has stymied their plans, that vision hasn’t altered. And the EU’s foreign-policy chief, Spain’s Josep Borrell, has shown a willingness in the past to speak his mind even though he has limited powers.“These peaceful demonstrations had clear demands: the release of all unlawfully detained people, the prosecution of those responsible for police brutality, and holding of new presidential elections,” Borrell said in a statement on Monday. “The sheer numbers clearly show that the Belarusian population wants change, and wants it now. The EU stands by them.”The call will be as much about showing how the EU can act when it believes a line has been crossed, one EU official said, and its willingness to directly take on Putin.Another added that while the outcome needs to be more than a mere statement, there’s a balancing act between taking measures that sends a strong signal and steps that are counter-productive and make a negotiated solution harder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-gives-the-eu-a-chance-to-show-geopolitical-relevance/story-pUQUHzdxFLjN5BsuiVJ7tO.html

18-08-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine turns into a shot at redemption for Britain||At the Global Vaccine Summit he hosted in June, Boris Johnson was keen to remind the audience that it was a British doctor, Edward Jenner, who pioneered vaccinations. Now it’s the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford that’s leading the drive for an inoculation against coronavirus.The pandemic has blown every leader off course, but Johnson has been among the hardest hit. The UK recorded the worst death toll in Europe and the biggest economic meltdown mere months after leaving the European Union. Johnson concedes there will have to be an inquiry into his handling of it.That’s why the UK coming up with the first universally recognized barrier against Covid-19 is the ultimate prize for a government that after another humiliating policy U-turn needs to redeem itself somehow. Brexit, after all, was about showing the world the UK was better off alone even during a crisis.Johnson is the eternal optimist, Covid-19 vaccine is the modern-day Holy Grail and the UK finds itself the knight leading the quest for a globally accepted inoculation. The reason why, despite missteps over procuring personal protective equipment for health workers and testing for the virus, is because of its history of medical research.It explains why ministers moved quickly to take control of the push, according to conversations with scientists, company officials, and government advisers.“The UK is looking for a place in the world as an independent entity and has an opportunity to show real leadership in the vaccine space,” said John Bell, professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, who is working with the government on its vaccine program.Given the government’s track record during the pandemic, the risks are high. There has been little sign of public backslapping since the team at Oxford—the alma mater of Johnson and his two Tory predecessors—became a clear frontrunner in July, a month after the prime minister’s reminder of the UK’s scientific pedigree.Read More: Covid Vaccine Front-Runner Is Months Ahead of Her CompetitionThe Jenner Institute was well positioned to start work on a shot after years of work on a related coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.So when Johnson’s government found the university was talking with U.S. pharmaceutical companies about manufacturing the potential vaccine they balked at the idea and began to plot a strategy to keep it British.GlaxoSmithKline Plc and AstraZeneca Plc were the obvious onshore manufacturers. Glaxo was conflicted, but a partnership with Astra was quickly agreed over one weekend in April. By the end of that month, the UK drugmaker and Oxford announced a deal that would see Astra take on the manufacturing and large-scale distribution. The government reviewed all the paperwork before it was signed.But betting the house on one vaccine against a virus that has killed over 775,000 people and sickened more than 21 million wouldn’t be enough if the UK was going to ensure it had access to a successful jab.Health Secretary Matt Hancock called Kate Bingham, a venture capitalist in the health industry who had been helping the government look for new drugs and vaccines, to see if she would lead the effort.Bingham was largely on board with chairing an official UK Vaccine Taskforce, but wanted one thing made clear: it doesn’t matter how many deals the UK does, there still might not be a vaccine at the end of it. In a call with Johnson on the afternoon of May 6, Bingham agreed to take up the gig.“I really wanted him to understand that this was a heroic uphill struggle,” Bingham said in an interview. “Even pathogens we know lots about—HIV and malaria—we still don’t have vaccines for. So I had to make sure that there weren’t unrealistic expectations of how doable it would be.”There are broadly four main approaches being taken to producing a Covid-19 vaccine. The UK strategy is to ensure Britain has enough potential doses from each bucket in the hope that one will be successful, but not to hoard supplies. On the contrary, part of the “Global Britain” brand is to share its success with the world.So far, Bingham’s taskforce has bought a medley of 340 million doses from the four groups after two more deals on Friday.Britain’s desire to respond to the pandemic on its own terms has been clear from the start. The country opted out of joint EU procurement programs for PPE and ventilators, which led to outcries from National Health Service workers. Ministers have repeatedly said the EU programs yielded little benefit to participants.In a call with health ministers from Germany, France and Italy in early June, Hancock made clear the UK wasn’t interested in joining the group’s alliance to procure shots either, with the Netherlands taking its place. A few weeks later, the UK also ruled out joining the EU’s 2 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) vaccine program, because it would have prevented Britain from having a direct hand in negotiating deals.In Brussels, the move was seen in keeping with the UK’s belief it could perform better than the EU when acting alone, according to two EU officials with knowledge of discussions between the two sides.“It seems we’re putting ourselves in danger of continuing to do the same thing and getting the same result: not what we wanted,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Maybe you get lucky and they just happen to get all the aces turning up.”If the Oxford-Astra vaccine is approved before other credible alternatives, it will give Britain a much-needed shot in the arm to its reputation. With no guarantees, the best the UK can do is be prepared should things go wrong, said Bingham.Indeed, Johnson promised in his New Year message a month before Brexit that the UK would be the “the best place on Earth” for “quality education and cutting-edge science.” Much is riding on that second pledge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-turns-into-a-shot-at-redemption-for-britain/story-VuuMiWA7REPOfd1yCnJm6M.html
18-08-2020||World||Roger Stone drops appeal of conviction for lying to Congress||Roger Stone is no longer appealing his conviction, weeks after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence.In a five-page court filing late Monday, Stone asked to withdraw his appeal, ending a case that had stirred controversy from the start, with his televised arrest. The Republican operative and backer of Trump was convicted in November of lying to Congress during a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 US election.Stone gave no reason for his decision to drop the appeal.All the prosecutors withdrew from the Stone case after the Justice Department reduced its original sentencing recommendation. The judge eventually sentenced him to more than three years in a federal prison in Georgia. Last month, the president commuted the sentence, meaning Stone wouldn’t be incarcerated but would remain a convicted felon, unless he successfully appealed.Stone, 67, had said he was eager to clear his name and overturn a conviction that he says was the result of a politically biased judge and jury -- claims frequently echoed by Trump. “A pardon includes acceptance of guilt and ends the appeals process. The commutation allows me to go forward with the appeals,” Stone said in a July text message.“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly. Roger Stone was brought into this witch hunt, this whole political witch hunt, the Mueller scam,” Trump said on July 11. “I’m very happy with what I did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roger-stone-drops-appeal-of-conviction-for-lying-to-congress/story-rxqkOkuwDudvm2nl0E0frJ.html

The US Justice Department has sought to dismiss the case against Flynn following pressure from Trump and his allies.Last month, Trump used his presidential power to commute the sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-will-pardon-a-very-important-person-on-tuesday/story-1M94AFTCcogk4aBTuX8j1H.html
18-08-2020||World||Properly handling border dispute with India part of Xi Jinping doctrine: China||Properly handling the boundary dispute with India but safeguarding China’s territorial integrity is part of President Xi Jinping’s blueprint for Beijing’s “major country” diplomacy, the Chinese foreign ministry has said.In an analysis of “Xi Jinping on Governance and Politics”, the ministry indicated that maintaining peace and tranquility along the boundary with India is as important as stabilising the “maritime situation” in the South China Sea (SCS) where Beijing is entangled in disputes with multiple littoral states over the ownership of islands, reefs and the surrounding seas.The analysis by the ministry also hailed the “new model” of informal meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi.There was no mention of the ongoing friction with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to the worst low in decades. The ministry, quoting Xi, said China will “resolutely” safeguard China’s “...sovereignty, territorial integrity, and maritime rights and interests, steadily advance the consultation process of the ‘Code of Conduct in the South China Sea’, stabilise the maritime situation, properly handle border disputes between China and India, and maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.”Published by the Chinese foreign ministry’s Communist party committee in Mandarin in the party mouthpiece, People’s Daily, the analysis claimed that China’s relation with “regional powers” like India has improved.“Relations with neighbouring countries continue to improve. For regional powers, the leaders of China and India have created a new model of bilateral exchanges at annual informal meetings, leading the two countries to deepen strategic mutual trust, properly manage differences, and stably develop bilateral relations,” the analysis said.It was referring to the two informal summits between Modi and Xi held in Wuhan in 2018 and in Chennai in 2019.The Chinese government analysis avoided referring to the ongoing discussions between India and China to resolve stalemate in the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh.India had rejected China’s contention that disengagement has been completed at most locations along their disputed border, and called on Beijing to work sincerely for complete de-escalation and full restoration of peace along the LAC.The new analysis comes a week after the foreign ministry had said in a statement that maintaining peace along the disputed boundary and deepening strategic trust with India is one of China’s diplomatic priorities.“For the China-India relationship, the two sides should jointly safeguard peace and security in the border areas and maintain a steady and sound development of bilateral ties,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said.Responding to a query about China’s future diplomatic priorities as the Covid-19 pandemic impacts the world, Zhao was briefly outlining Beijing’s plans for the way ahead in bilateral ties with the US, Russia, EU, Japan, and India.The current analysis also looked at Beijing’s ties with the US, Russia, the European Union, Japan, South Korea besides Latin America, Africa and Central Asian countries.The ministry said that since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in October 2017, Xi had travelled for 2,15,000 km and visited 27 countries.“In the direction of Northeast Asia, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a historic visit to North Korea. The top leaders of China and North Korea met 5 times,” it said.In context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, China, under Xi’s guidance as per the ministry, provided or is providing medical material assistance to more than 150 countries and international and regional organisations, and has sent 32 medical expert teams to 30 countries.Last month, the Chinese foreign ministry had inaugurated the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy research centre, which aims to coordinate resources to conduct “comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth study, interpretation, and promotion of Xi’s thinking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/properly-handling-border-dispute-with-india-part-of-xi-jinping-doctrine-says-chinese-foreign-ministry/story-l6Cdk9m6rmn5ccZqIVJNtK.html

It has entered a late-stage human test in the United Arab Emirates to gather proof of efficacy for final regulatory approvals.“It will not be priced very high. It is expected to cost a few hundred yuan for a shot, and for two shots it should be less than 1,000 yuan,” Liu told the Guangming Daily newspaper.Governments and drugmakers around the world are in a frenetic race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. More than 200 candidates are in development, including more than 20 in human clinical trials.Moderna Inc said earlier this month that smaller volumes of its experimental vaccine have been priced at $32-$37 per dose.Last month, the U.S. government struck a deal for an experimental vaccine being developed by Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE that secures enough to innoculate 50 million Americans for about $40 a person.Sinopharm’s Liu did not mention whether China’s state-backed nationwide insurance program would cover some of the vaccine costs for consumers, or whether it could be included in the country’s free vaccination scheme.China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a Sinopharm unit, has moved two vaccine strains using the same method into human trials. Its plants in Wuhan and Beijing combined could make over two million doses of the drug annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sinopharm-chief-rules-out-high-price-for-coronavirus-vaccine/story-5Prn8E9WAXw8pXvP41T45M.html

She read out from a scathing obituary blaming failed leadership for his death.“My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life,” Urquiza said.“One of the last things that my father said to me was that he felt betrayed by the likes of Donald Trump. And so when I cast my vote for Joe Biden, I will do it for my dad,” she added.In her brief three-minute appearance, Urquiza, who lives in San Francisco, said that Trump may not have caused the coronavirus, but his dishonesty and irresponsible actions made the tragedy worse.She also accused the US president of being disconnected with the reality.Urquiza gained national attention in July when an obituary she wrote for her father, Mark Anthony, blamed “the carelessness of the politicians” who did not acknowledge the severity of the virus.There are 78 days until the presidential election in the United States and the Democrats used the opportunity on Monday to attack Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, racial justice and the shattered economy.Former rival Bernie Sanders and prominent Republican John Kasich also joined forces at the event in a display of unity for Biden.The convention will continue till Thursday at the end of which Biden will accept his party’s presidential nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/his-only-pre-existing-condition-was-trusting-donald-trump-woman-who-lost-father-to-covid-19-says-at-democratic-convention/story-77rynlCFqb59teEMeU8yJP.html
18-08-2020||World||Coronavirus forces Malaysian palm industry to rethink reliance on foreign labour||Malaysia’s palm oil producers are embarking on a rare recruitment drive to hire locals and accelerating industry mechanisation as they grapple with a severe shortage of foreign labour due to the coronavirus pandemic.As the September-November peak production season approaches, companies are erecting banners near plantations and posting online job advertisements boasting free housing, free water and other perks of estate life in a bid to lure workers to do everything from driving tractors to harvesting. Already, travel and movement restrictions have left the world’s second-largest palm oil producer grappling with a shortage of 37,000 workers, nearly 10% of the total workforce. The Malaysian Palm Oil Association (MPOA) believes this could blow out to 70,000 workers once borders reopen.“This is the first time we are making such a big effort to hire Malaysians, but it is also the first time we are facing Covid-19,” Imran, an estate manager with Sime Darby Plantation, told Reuters after interviewing potential applicants at a recruitment day near Kuala Lumpur.The industry fears the labour crunch will hurt palm oil production this year by delaying the harvest of perishable fruit, giving an edge to bigger rival Indonesia which has no such labour problems. Malaysia’s average cost of production is already slightly higher at about $406-$480 a tonne, according to analysts, compared with Indonesia at $400-$450 a tonne. Countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh provide nearly 85% of plantation workers for palm companies such as Sime Darby, IOI Corp and United Plantations.While employing more Malaysians could save on recruitment fees and levies needed to fly in foreign workers, planters worry that local workers, who typically shun plantation work as dirty and dangerous, won’t commit to the industry or take on the most difficult jobs.“It’s possible that recruiting more locals could bring down the cost of production, but provided these locals are also as productive as them (migrant workers),” said MPOA chief executive Nageeb Wahab. “That is a big question mark.”Despite a rising unemployment rate, Imran said most of the interest at the recruitment day was for general duties, such as driver or mechanic, rather than the taxing and crucial task of harvesting.With more foreign workers leaving, some severely understaffed smaller firms, which are less able to retain migrant labour, have resorted to poaching workers from competitors. “It is bad, but I need to do this to survive,” said an official of a mid-sized estate in Sarawak who declined to be named.ADVANCING MECHANISATIONThe labour shortfall is adding urgency to long-standing plans for industry mechanisation.Sime, the world’s biggest palm oil company by land size, told Reuters it is quickening development and trials to deploy “light machines” that will aid in field upkeep, removing harvested crops and applying fertiliser.It’s also turning to remote sensing and artificial intelligence to drive “precision farming”, making the most efficient use of farm inputs and field workers.IOI said it has a “revitalised mechanisation plan”, and aims to mechanise fertilising and pesticide spraying as well as automating mill operations, while FGV Holdings plans to mechanise an extra 30,000 hectares over the next three years.Malaysia on average allots one worker for every 8 hectares, but the MPOA wants a “quantum leap” in technology that would double the land area for each worker to 16 hectares. This would reduce reliance on labour, which accounts for around 30% of production costs.“Imagine inventing a drone that can fly under the canopy of palm trees, with a scanner to detect ripe fruit bunches and a laser attached to cut the bunch,” said M.R. Chandran, a veteran industry official turned consultant.“By totally modernising plantations with drones, artificial intelligence and robotics, we can also make plantation work more attractive for locals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-forces-malaysian-palm-industry-to-rethink-reliance-on-foreign-labour/story-9wTx1OBowG1wkr5durHCDN.html

If they are not willing to play that role, then I will ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to go ahead with or without Saudi Arabia.”Saudi Arabia was not the only country Qureshi was upset with. He also expressed his consternation with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for not having supported Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir.As a retaliation, Saudi Arabia issued a statement that loans or oil supply will no longer be given to Pakistan.Islamabad was also made to pay back $1 billion to Riyadh, which was part of a $6.2 billion package announced by Saudi in November 2018, which included a total of $3 billion in loans and an oil credit facility amounting to $3.2 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-army-chief-meets-saudi-counterpart-in-attempt-to-smoothen-strained-ties/story-TbJ6m5RgfUxlTz1GW1zUgI.html
18-08-2020||World||29 wildfires raging across California amid heatwave, world temperature record||One of the hottest air temperatures recorded anywhere on the planet in at least a century, and possibly ever, was reached on Sunday afternoon at Death Valley in California’s Mojave Desert where it soared to 130 Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius).The temperature was recorded in the Valley’s sparsely populated Furnace Creek.It was a dry heat: Humidity fell to 7%. But it felt “insanely hot” all the same, according to meteorologists.Tourists on Monday took selfies by an outdoor thermometer at the Death Valley visitor centre while avoiding touching metal surfaces with bare skin.The US state is also witnessing wildfires, 29 of them, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The department has been posting maps of places which are affected by the fires and evacuations operations being carried out. UPDATE: 8/17/20 AT 4:10PM:NEW EVACUATIONS ORDERS for the North Side of Newtown Rd to include:• Lois Lane• Monte Vista• Jones Bar• Empress Cross• Personeni• ElizabethThe wildfires have already blackened more than 1,20,000 acres of land, according to authorities. And excessive heat warning is also in place till Wednesday in may parts.And then there is a risk of 10 million people being plunged into darkness as California’s grid operator works to keep the region’s power system from collapsing under the strain of one of the worst heat waves in generations.The California Independent System Operator has imposed rolling blackouts to manage overwhelming energy demands caused by an extreme heatwave.Officials estimate that peak electricity consumption on Monday would likely exceed available supply statewide by as much as 4,400 megawatts. A lapse of that magnitude would mark the most severe shortfall to strike California’s grid since 2001, the last time utilities in the state essentially rationed energy in the form of rolling blackouts.The controlled power disruptions, with alternating blocks of utility customers losing electricity for one or two hours at a time, are designed to prevent excess demand from triggering a more widespread collapse of the grid that could last days.The current heat wave, which has roasted parts of Southern California in triple-digit temperatures since Friday, was attributed to an enormous high-pressure system over much of the Western United States, and was expected last through Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/29-wildfires-raging-across-california-amid-heatwave-world-temperature-record/story-9QP1mZSyXKHGCwP4wVR1II.html

18-08-2020||World||North Korea calls party meeting to discuss ‘crucial’ issue||North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party will discuss a “crucial” matter at a meeting on Wednesday that comes as the state is battling catastrophic flooding and trying to head off a coronavirus crisis.Top party leaders will meet to “to discuss and decide on an issue of crucial significance in developing the Korean revolution and increasing the fighting efficiency of the Party,” the state’s Korean Central News Agency said in a Tuesday report, without providing further details.Leader Kim Jong Un last week sacked the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, removed the southern border city of Kaesong from a virus lockdown and said his state would not accept foreign food aid because of the coronavirus risk.The announcement on state media comes on the same day that the US and South Korea began a set of joint military drills. Even though the exercises have been scaled down due to the coronavirus, North Korea has previously denounced joint drills as a prelude to nuclear war.North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month, as torrential rains threaten to wipe out farmland and the economy heads for what might be its biggest contraction in more than two decades. The flooding has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by officials in the US and Japan. The pandemic brings large risks to the impoverished state because its antiquated medical systems could be overwhelmed if the virus arrived with force.Agricultural production is a key element of North Korea’s economy and flooding in its summer months has led to diminished harvest, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the state for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”The premier serves in a role as a steward of economic policy, and Kim’s decision to oust Kim Jae Ryong from the post could help deflect blame for any hardships coming from a poor harvest.In addition to damage to farmland, Kim Jong Un’s decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade the state has, and could send the economy this year into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-calls-party-meeting-to-discuss-crucial-issue/story-Z4MdmNBRAm6QytryqfvStO.html

It’s also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.A magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people in the northern Philippines in 1990.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-5-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-central-philippines-some-damage-seen/story-9I5SpBmo3NWhan5MDPF6BP.html
18-08-2020||World||Ten million Californians risk going dark in massive blackout||As many as 10 million people across California may take turns being plunged into darkness on Monday evening as the state’s grid operator works to keep the region’s power system from collapsing under the strain of one of the worst heat waves in generations.The outages, which were expected to hit as soon as 4 p.m. in California, would mark the third time in four days that the state’s utilities deliberately cut power to protect a grid that’s been pushed to the brink of failure as people blast their air conditioners and fans to keep cool. The state is facing an electricity shortfall on Monday of about 4.4 gigawatts, according to California Governor Gavin Newsom. That’s the equivalent of about four nuclear power plants.“Let me just make this crystal clear: We failed to predict and plan these shortages -- and that’s simply unacceptable,” said Newsom, who called for an investigation into why officials failed to anticipate the need for blackouts.Shortly after 3:30 p.m, the state’s grid operator declare a stage-two grid emergency -- one step away from a blackout order.Since Friday, millions of Californians have been abruptly plunged into darkness with little notice, reminiscent of the mass blackouts that the state’s utilities carried out less than a year ago to keep their electrical lines from sparking fires during unusually strong windstorms -- all extreme weather events made more frequent by climate change. But even last year’s outages pale in comparison to the one planned for Monday. Rarely if ever have 3.3 million homes and businesses across California, or roughly 10 million people based on the average size of a household, been affected by a planned shutdown of this kind.And it couldn’t be hitting California at a more vulnerable time, with the pandemic forcing people into lockdown, leaving them with little choice but to endure the heat indoors.The rotating blackouts will last for about an hour each, according to the state’s grid operator. This month is the first time California has resorted to rotating outages since the 2001 energy crisis, when hundreds of thousands of customers lost power, electricity prices surged to record levels and the state’s largest electric utility went bankrupt. (It went bankrupt a second time last year in the face of crippling wildfire liabilities.)Part of the problem is California’s rapid shift away from natural gas. About 9 gigawatts of gas generation, enough to power 6.8 million homes, have been retired over the past five years as the state turns increasingly to renewables, according to BloombergNEF. That leaves fewer options when the sun sets and solar production wanes.Normally, California can import enough power from neighboring states when supplies are tight. But the sprawling heat wave blanketing the U.S. West is pushing power plants to the hilt across the region.“California is in a tight spot,” BNEF analyst Brian Bartholomew said. “It’s retired a lot of gas. And the storage that’s supposed to help hasn’t yet come online.”Tonight could be the grid’s biggest test yet, with temperatures expected to soar as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in some parts of the state. Heat in some parts of the region has already broken records.“We don’t have enough resources,” John Phipps, director of real time operations at the California Independent System Operator, said on a conference call. “We’re going to have to” call for blackouts.Newsom, a Democrat, signed an order that will temporarily allow users and utilities to use backup generators to ease the need for blackouts.By 3 p.m. local time, it was already 102 degrees in Sacramento. With temperatures climbing, demand for power in the state is expected to reach more than 49,700 megawatts Monday afternoon, just shy of the all-time record set in 2006. Power prices more than doubled, to the highest in five months.The relentless heat is starting to take a physical toll on California’s power system. Transformers -- the metal cylinders sitting atop power poles -- can malfunction and catch fire if they don’t cool off at night. And temperatures in some parts of Southern California are expected to remain in the low 80’s overnight. During a deadly, 10-day heatwave in 2006, the state’s utilities lost more than 1,500 of these devices, with each knocking out service to one neighborhood in the process.The heat wave gripping the West Coast stems from a stubborn, high-pressure system that has parked itself across the Great Basin spanning Nevada and other western states. It essentially acts as a lid trapping hot air, and there aren’t any indications it’s going to budge soon.Such phenomenons, sometimes called heat domes, are getting worse because the Earth’s climate is changing. As the planet warms, the contrast between the heat at the equator and the cold at the pole decreases. That saps the strength of the jet stream, which otherwise would be able to shove the ridges out of the way. It explains in part why extreme heat has blanketed regions around the world in recent weeks.Extreme weather has taken a profound toll on electrical grids in recent weeks. Earlier this month, millions of people lost power across the US Midwest after a wall of lightning, hail and deadly winds tore a path of ruin from central Iowa to Chicago. Days earlier, Tropical Storm Isaias darkened millions of homes from the Carolinas to Connecticut.Soaring temperatures have already shattered records across California. According to the National Weather Service, Los Angeles International Airport hit a daily record of 93 degrees, breaking a previous high of 85 set in 1994. Death Valley reached 130 degrees for the first time since 1913. If validated, the weather service said, it will go down as the hottest August temperature there ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ten-million-californians-risk-going-dark-in-massive-blackout/story-7r5bsMGU1ihYdPvxpRouBM.html
18-08-2020||World||Canadian foreign minister resigns over differences with Trudeau||Canada’s finance Minister Bill Morneau has resigned amid a series of reports of differences between him and the country’s prime minister Justin Trudeau over the handling of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Morneau formally announced he was leaving the post as well as the House of Commons as he told reporters during a press conference that “the right time for a new Finance Minister to deliver” on a “plan” towards recovery from the havoc caused by the impact of the coronavirus crisis. According to multiple reports, Morneau had been deeply unhappy over the deficit the Government was running in and believed that policies announced by Trudeau were not carefully considered.Morneau met Trudeau in Ottawa on Monday morning before the announcement was made later in the evening. A statement issued by Trudeau’s office said he had accepted Morneau’s resignation. The statement was laudatory about Morneau’s contribution to the Government and ignored any explanation as to why the finance Minister’s departure was precipitated.However, it did mention that Morneau “will put forward his name as a candidate to be the next secretary general of the OECD” and that “Canada will vigorously support his bid to lead this important global institution.”Speculation over Morneau ouster grew in recent days as former governor of Bank of Canada and Bank of England Mark Carney returned to Toronto from London and has been playing a role as an informal advisor to Trudeau on the plan for recovery from the economic devastation caused by Covid-19 related restrictive measures. Carney and deputy PM Chrystia Freeland are among the leading contenders to replace Morneau.During the course of his media interaction Morneau said that it had “never been” his “plan to run for more than two federal election cycles.” The 57-year-old was an MP from Toronto Center and was first elected in 2015. He was appointed Finance Minister in October 2015 and remained in that post till the resignation.Both Trudeau and Morneau have also been embroiled in the controversy over the grant of a near billion dollar contract to a charity with links to them and their families. While that contract was cancelled following the controversy it resulted in, both of them are also being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner as well as a couple of Parliamentary panels.The acrimonious exit, which is likely to jolt Bay Street, Canada’s equivalent of Wall Street, and have economic repercussions given its timing, was not reflected in Trudeau statement, as he said “I want to thank Bill for everything he has done to improve the quality of life of Canadians and make our country a better and fairer place to live. I have counted on his leadership, advice, and close friendship over the years and I look forward to that continuing well into the future.”Just recently, as reports came out about growing rancour leading to Morneau’s departure, Trudeau’s office released a statement that he had “full confidence in Minister Morneau and any statement to the contrary is false.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-foreign-minister-resigns-over-differences-with-trudeau/story-Rg6X1Dm6SUCj7e8ukfmlUL.html
18-08-2020||World||Biden will tell truth, trust science: Michelle Obama at Democratic convention||Former vice president Joe Biden will “tell the truth and trust science” if he is elected to the White House in November, former First Lady Michelle Obama said on Monday as Democrats kicked off their now-virtual convention.With the Democratic party poised to officially anoint the 77-year-old Biden as its presidential candidate, President Donald Trump defied coronavirus concerns and staged competing events in Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota.Michelle Obama was given the primetime slot on the opening night of the Democratic convention, which was to have been held over four days in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but which is now taking place almost entirely online because of the Covid-19 outbreak.In excerpts of her remarks released ahead of her taped speech, Michelle Obama said Biden was a “terrific vice president” during the eight years he served as her husband Barack Obama’s number two.“I know Joe. He is a profoundly decent man guided by faith,” she said.“He knows what it takes to rescue an economy, beat back a pandemic and lead our country,” the former First Lady said.“He will tell the truth, and trust science,” she said in a jab at Trump, who has been accused of repeatedly ignoring the advice of his scientific advisers on how to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic.“He will make smart plans and manage a good team,” Obama said. “And he will govern as someone who’s lived a life that the rest of us can recognize.”Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who challenged Biden for the nomination from the progressive left, was also scheduled to address the convention, which is being live-streamed.“This election is the most important in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said in remarks released ahead of his appearance.“The future of our democracy is at stake,” he said. “The future of our planet is at stake.“We must come together, defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president,” Sanders said. “My friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine.” ‘Another Venezuela’ Trump flew on Air Force One meanwhile to Mankato, Minnesota, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and delivered remarks to supporters gathered on the airport tarmac.Speaking in Oshkosh, Trump accused Biden and his running mate Harris of seeking to enact “crazy socialist policies.”“This is the most dangerous election we’ve ever had,” Trump said. “It’ll be another Venezuela. This will be a very large-scale Venezuela if they win.”“The only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged,” he said.The Democratic convention is taking place amid a furor over Trump’s own efforts to limit mail-in voting.Insisting without proof that it fosters fraud, Trump has threatened to block extra funding that Democrats say is urgently needed to allow the US Postal Service to process millions of ballots.Democratic Party chairman Tom Perez said the convention would push back against Trump’s “assault on our democracy” by highlighting efforts to protect voting by mail.“This president can’t win on the merits and so he has to cheat. And it’s shameful,” Perez told a Washington Post webcast.Oshkosh, where Trump was speaking, is about a 90-minute drive north of the Milwaukee arena where Democrats had intended to gather in a sign of eagerness to win back Wisconsin, one of multiple Democratic strongholds which flipped to Trump in 2016.But the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed some 170,000 people in the United States, upended election campaigning.The Democratic convention and the Republican event, which begins on August 24, will be held virtually, without the usual roaring crowds and confetti.“We may be physically apart, but this week Democrats are coming together from across the nation to put forth our vision for a better America,” Biden tweeted.Live and curated content The experimental convention format will allow speakers to address American voters unfiltered -- largely shorn of the usual overwrought stagecraft and screaming delegates.Biden and Harris will address the convention live via videolink, while other speeches will be “a mix of live and curated content,” the campaign said.Biden enters the week with significant but tightening poll leads over Trump, and hoping his pick of Harris -- the first woman of color on a major party’s presidential ticket -- will invigorate Democrats.The California senator, former prosecutor and daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants is 55 and brings relatively youthful energy to the ticket.Tuesday will see addresses from former president Bill Clinton and Jill Biden, the nominee’s wife.On Wednesday, Barack Obama will speak, and Harris will have her spotlight moment before the convention culminates Thursday when Biden formally accepts the Democratic nomination and delivers his acceptance speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-president-biden-will-trust-science-says-michelle-obama-at-democratic-national-convention/story-dMLQQeUx9VPZHnuA85LMaO.html
18-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s rule on transgender health blocked at the 11th hour||A federal judge blocked the Trump administration on Monday from enforcing a new regulation that would roll back health care protections for transgender people.Finalized days after the Supreme Court barred sex discrimination against LGBT individuals on the job, the regulation from the federal Department of Health and Human Services was to have taken effect Tuesday.Monday’s preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn bars the administration from enforcing the regulation until the case can be heard in court and decided. Block indicated he thought the Trump administration’s so-called transgender rule is invalid in light of the Supreme Court ruling in June on a case involving similar issues in the context of job discrimination.Also read: US Supreme Court rules gay and lesbian people can sue for workplace bias“When the Supreme Court announces a major decision, it seems a sensible thing to pause and reflect on the decision’s impact,” Block wrote in his order, suggesting the agency may want to reconsider. “Since HHS has been unwilling to take that path voluntarily, the court now imposes it.”The HHS health care rule was seen as a signal to President Donald Trump’s social and religious conservative supporters that the administration remained squarely behind them after the shock of the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump.“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Gorsuch wrote. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what (civil rights law) forbids.”In a tweet, Trump called that “horrible & politically charged” and compared it to a shotgun blast in the faces of conservative Republicans.The HHS rule sought to overturn Obama-era sex discrimination protections for transgender people in health care. Similar to the underlying issues in the job discrimination case before the Supreme Court, the health care rule rests on the idea that sex is determined by biology. The Obama-era version relied on a broader understanding shaped by a person’s inner sense of being male, female, neither or a combination.Also read: ‘Accept us for who we are’: Transgender children deprived of normal school lifeThe lawsuit against the Trump administration rule was brought by an advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign, on behalf of two transgender women. One of the plaintiffs is an Army veteran, and the other a writer and activist.Judge Block dismissed as “disingenuous” arguments from HHS that its rule was legally valid, and he wrote that the agency acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” in enacting it.HHS said it was disappointed by the judge’s decision.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it a “victory for the LGBTQ community and the rule of law.”The judge “was unambiguous in ... ruling that the administration’s actions were in blatant violation of the Affordable Care Act’s protections and the Supreme Court’s recent ... decision, which affirmed that discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ included sexual orientation and gender identity,” Pelosi said in a statement.Judge Block was nominated to the federal bench by former President Bill Clinton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-rule-on-transgender-health-blocked-at-the-11th-hour/story-DdaAOZRIPFllF4DaOzxP9J.html
18-08-2020||World||Former CIA officer charged with giving China classified info||A former CIA officer and contract linguist for the FBI has been charged with spying for China, including by disclosing tradecraft and information on sources to Chinese intelligence officers who had co-opted him, according to documents unsealed Monday.Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 67, was arrested last week after an undercover operation in which prosecutors say he accepted an envelope with $2,000 in exchange for his past espionage activities. He told a law enforcement officer who was posing as a Chinese intelligence officer that he wanted to see the “motherland” succeed, prosecutors said.Also read: Why the CIA doesn’t spy on the UAE“The trail of Chinese espionage is long and, sadly, strewn with former American intelligence officers who betrayed their colleagues, their country and its liberal democratic values to support an authoritarian communist regime,” Assistant Attorney John Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official, said in a statement.An FBI affidavit accuses Ma, who worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989, of revealing government secrets to at least five Chinese intelligence officers in a Hong Kong hotel room over a three-day period in March 2001. Those secrets included information about CIA sources, international operations, staffing practices and operational tradecraft.Prosecutors say Ma’s meeting with the Chinese officers included a relative and fellow CIA employee who was not named in court documents and who is not being charged because, officials say, the now 85-year-old suffers from advanced and debilitating cognitive diseases.A video recording of the hotel meeting shows the men receiving payments of $50,000 for the information they provided, the authorities said.By that point, the FBI says, Ma had become a compromised asset of China’s Ministry of State Security, which collects intelligence information of value and interest to the Chinese government — a relationship that endured for years and carried over into Ma’s next job.Ma remained in touch with the Chinese intelligence officers after he joined the FBI as a contract linguist in 2004, at which point he used his work computer to copy images of documents related to missiles and weapon system technology research. Over the next several years, he brought a digital camera into a secure FBI work area and photographed translation documents, and also stole secret records that he took with him to Asia, it was alleged.Some of Ma’s travel drew scrutiny, prosecutors said. In 2006, he returned home from Honolulu after a trip to Shanghai and was found to be carrying $20,000 and a set of golf clubs that he did not previously own.The Justice Department alleges that Ma and his co-conspirator also helped Chinese intelligence officers identify suspected human sources. At one point, according to an FBI affidavit, Ma received an email message from a Chinese intelligence contact that had as an attachment a photograph of five puppies sitting on a park bench. The FBI believes the photo was meant to prompt Ma to arrange for his former CIA colleague to provide information on five people who were suspected of being informants.The FBI undercover investigation took shape in January 2019 when an official posing as a Chinese intelligence officer met with Ma in his Honolulu office and showed him a video recording of the 2001 meeting in Hong Kong and asked for help identifying people who were present.Ma, apparently convinced that the undercover officer was an actual intelligence officer, provided the help and met again with the officer two months later, when he accepted $2,000 for his work on China’s behalf, according to court papers.He offered to do more work for China, prosecutors said, and met again last week with the undercover officer, accepting a red envelope with $2,000 and saying that he wanted “the motherland” to succeed.A naturalized U.S. citizen born in Hong Kong, Ma was charged in federal court in Honolulu with conspiring to gather and communicate national defense information for a foreign nation. He faces up to life in prison if convicted, and is due to make his first court appearance Tuesday.A phone message left for a lawyer listed as Ma’s federal defender was not immediately returned Monday.Another former CIA officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, was sentenced to 19 years in prison last November for an espionage conspiracy in which prosecutors say he received more than $840,000 from China to divulge the names of human sources and his knowledge of spycraft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-cia-officer-charged-with-giving-china-classified-info/story-dwb9He0djkXf2Cn8gyAtXM.html

The university placed the students living there in isolation and prohibited them from leaving.“As a student, I’m frustrated as hell,” said Ryan Novozinsky, a junior from Allentown, New Jersey, and editor of the student newspaper. “These are people I have to interact with.” And, he added, “there will be professors they interact with, starting today, that won’t be able to fight this off.” OSU has a combination of in-person and online courses, and students, staff and faculty are required to wear masks indoors and outdoors where social distancing isn’t possible.Outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people eat, live, study — and party — in close quarters.The virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the US.A cluster of Covid-19 cases in a dorm was announced Sunday by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The disclosure marked the fourth such outbreak since the semester began Aug. 10 at the state’s flagship public university campus. The three others were at a dorm, private student housing and a fraternity house.A faculty committee that advises the administration was scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the situation. The head of the panel warned that the school may have to rethink its decision to hold classes on campus.“We knew there would be positive cases on our campus. But clusters, five or more people that are connected in one place, are a different story,” Mimi Chapman wrote to the university system’s board of governors. “The presence of clusters should be triggering reconsideration of residential, in-person learning.” The University of Notre Dame reported 58 confirmed cases since students returned to the South Bend, Indiana, campus in early August. At least two off-campus parties over a week ago have been identified as sources, school officials said.At the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where some in-person classes began Monday, school and county health officials announced over the weekend that they are trying to identify people who may been exposed to Covid-19 earlier this month from members of a fraternity and a sorority.In Alabama, officials were frustrated by scenes of crowded entertainment districts and bars on the first weekend many students returned to campus at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. Mayor Walt Maddox warned that such behavior could put the treasured football season in danger.“If you don’t want to protect yourself and you don’t want to protect your family and you don’t want to protect your friends and thousands of jobs, maybe, just maybe, you would want to protect football season so we can have it this fall,” Maddox said in an interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-clusters-erupt-at-us-universities-as-semester-begins/story-xgM45axzDixLKPgfEzKv0N.html
18-08-2020||World||Israeli forces shoot, wound deaf Palestinian at checkpoint||Israeli security guards on Monday shot and wounded a Palestinian who is deaf and couldn’t hear their commands to stop at a West Bank checkpoint, police said, while a suspected Palestinian attacker was shot and killed in a separate incident in Jerusalem.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the 60-year-old man was walking in an area of the Qalandia Crossing north of Jerusalem where only vehicles are permitted. Rosenfeld said security guards called upon the man to stop but he continued to “approach them suspiciously.” They then opened fire toward his legs, moderately wounding him. Only after did the guards discover that the suspect did not respond because he “cannot hear or communicate,” Rosenfeld said.Rosenfeld said later Monday that a guard involved in the shooting was detained as part of an investigation into the incident.The incident comes less than three months after Israeli police shot and killed a 32-year-old Palestinian with severe autism. Israeli border police forces chased the man into a nook in Jerusalem’s Old City and fatally shot him as he cowered next to a garbage bin after apparently being mistaken for an attacker.The shooting sparked criticism and calls for police to amend their open fire guidelines to take into consideration those with disabilities.Later on Monday, police said one person was lightly wounded in a suspected stabbing attack in Jerusalem’s Old City. Rosenfeld said the alleged attacker was shot and killed.In recent years, lone Palestinian attackers have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings. But Palestinians and Israeli rights groups say Israeli forces often use excessive force and at times kill suspected attackers who could have been arrested.Heba Yazbak, an Israeli lawmaker of Palestinian origin, said Monday’s incident at the crossing exposed trigger-happy Israeli forces.“First they shoot and then they check,” she said. “The shooting of an innocent deaf Palestinian is just another example of the ease in which Israeli security forces can harm human life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-forces-shoot-wound-deaf-palestinian-at-checkpoint/story-xW9TzZKmf09ZOxLnojTfZJ.html
18-08-2020||World||Google fights ‘pay for news’ plan with threat to Oz users||US technology giant Google went on the offensive on Monday against an Australian plan forcing digital giants to pay for news content, telling users their personal data would be “at risk”.Australia announced last month that firms such as Google and Facebook would have to pay news media for content.The measures will include fines worth millions of dollars for non-compliance and force transparency around the algorithms that the firms use to rank content.Google is fighting a rearguard action to prevent the measures from kicking in - and been accused by Australia of spreading “misinformation”. On Monday, it told users in a new homepage pop-up that “the way Aussies use Google is at risk” and their search experience “will be hurt” by the changes.Google, in an open letter, claimed it would be forced to hand over users’ search data to news media companies and give them information that would “help them artificially inflate their ranking” above other websites. Google says it already partners with Australian news media by paying them millions of dollars each year, suggesting the changes could put its free services “at risk”.“Rather than encouraging these types of partnerships, the law is set up to give big media companies special treatment and to encourage them to make enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk,” the letter states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-fights-pay-for-news-plan-with-threat-to-oz-users/story-VYHnRYINFbB5EmCvgQPGPP.html
18-08-2020||World||National security US’ excuse to bring down non-American firms, alleges China||The US has been using national security as an excuse to bring down non-American companies, China said on Monday.“TikTok has met almost all US demands, but still cannot be spared. Such bullying practice deviates from international trade rules and fair competition. It will also hurt US’ own interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry said.US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on August 14, requiring ByteDance to divest its interests in video-sharing app TikTok’s operations in the US within 90 days.“There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance ... might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” the US President said in the order.The new order came after an earlier executive order was signed by Trump. The previous order could have forced US-based app stores to stop distributing the TikTok app if ByteDance did not reach a deal to divest from it in 45 days.Under the latest order, ByteDance is expected to destroy all its copies of TikTok data attached to American users.Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said that the Trump administration is “working hard” to protect Americans from the threats of “untrusted vendors” such as TikTok and WeChat, which it wants to remove from US app stores like those operated by Apple and Google.US politicians have repeatedly criticised TikTok, owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance, of being a threat to national security because of its ties to the Chinese Communist Party.China and the US are at loggerheads on a variety of issues including Hong Kong national security law, the South China Sea, coronavirus and trade. Last month, India’s ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) banned 47 apps, which were variants and cloned copies of the 59 apps banned earlier in June.These banned clones include Tiktok Lite, Helo Lite, SHAREit Lite, BIGO LIVE Lite and VFY Lite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-using-national-security-as-excuse-to-bring-down-non-american-companies-china/story-l0fqpvT6kMI8VGw16kTZOJ.html
18-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un stirs suspense with rare meeting on mystery issue||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is convening a key ruling party body on Wednesday for the first time in eight months to address a “crucial” mystery issue. He’s got plenty of tricky situations to choose from.The state’s official Korean Central News Agency offered few clues about the gathering of the Central Committee, saying it will “discuss and decide on an issue of crucial significance in developing the Korean revolution and increasing the fighting efficiency of the Party.” It didn’t elaborate.Kim is facing difficulties on various fronts, both at home and abroad. Floods have wiped out farmland to deal another blow to the virus-hit economy, while a reported health scare earlier this year raised questions about succession. His nuclear discussions with President Donald Trump have also ground to a halt without him winning any sanctions relief, and the U.S. and South Korea this week kicked off joint military drills.“The unusual succession of party meetings in recent months -- and possibly even the lack of much North Korean activity on the foreign policy front of late, for example weapons testing -- suggest the quarantine measures and the global pandemic have had serious ramifications for the economy and the people’s living standards,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former U.S. government analyst specializing in North Korea.North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials. The virus brings large risk to the impoverished state, whose antiquated medical systems could be overwhelmed by a large outbreak.The meeting will be the first time the Central Committee has convened since a four-day marathon session in late December, when Kim called for a “frontal breakthrough” to build up the economy and state security. He also warned Trump that North Korea was no longer bound by his pledge to stop major missile tests.Key party meetings often lead to a shake up of cadres, which could mean new powers for his prominent sister Kim Yo Jong and a purge of those seen as falling down on the virus or the economy. At a politburo meeting last week, Kim sacked the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, removed the southern border city of Kaesong from virus lockdown and said he would not accept foreign food aid because of the risk posed by the pandemic.North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month. It has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.Kim needs to urge his officials to help boost the economy before the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party on October 10, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government over the years. Kim has promised to make great achievements at home to honor the spirit of the revolution, such as opening a huge new hospital in Pyongyang.“Kim may reshuffle his bureaucrats during the meeting in a bid to speed up the restoration of damages by the recent flood and Covid-19 before the October 10,” Yang said. “The meeting is likely to emphasize issues surrounding internal politics, mainly economy.”Kim’s decision to oust Kim Jae Ryong as premier could help deflect blame for any hardships instigated by a poor harvest. The country’s economy was already under pressure from his decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on North Korea’s miniscule legal trade. This year, it could send the economy into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.Agricultural production is a key element of the economy, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the country for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished.Trump LeverageA weaker economy could decrease Kim’s leverage in nuclear negotiations that started with Trump in 2018, making it more difficult for him to achieve the sanctions relief he wanted in exchange for scaling back his nuclear weapons program. With the U.S presidential election coming up, Kim may be playing a waiting game, churning out fissile material and missiles that make his regime more of a threat for whoever wins.The announcement of another meeting came on the same day the U.S. and South Korea began a set of joint military drills, scaled down due to the virus. North Korea so far hasn’t unleashed its typical torrent of rhetoric denouncing joint drills as a prelude to nuclear war.“North Korea’s reticence on the drills thus far tracks with a drop in North Korea’s commentary and statements on foreign policy writ large since late last year,” said Lee, the former U.S. analyst. “The main reason seems to be that North Korea needs to focus on domestic issues for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-stirs-suspense-with-rare-meeting-on-mystery-issue/story-v0QBBEXpc1htUNLOkMhk1I.html
18-08-2020||World||Japan economy falls 27.8% due to Covid-19||Japan’s economy shrank at annual rate of 27.8% in April-June, the worst contraction on record, as the coronavirus pandemic slammed consumption and trade, according to government data released on Monday.The cabinet office said Japan’s preliminary seasonally adjusted real GDP fell 7.8% quarter on quarter. The annual rate shows what the number would have been if continued for a year.Japanese media reported the latest drop was the worst since World War II. But the cabinet office said comparable records began in 1980. The previous worst contraction, a 17.8% drop, was in the first quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis.The world’s third largest economy was already limping along when the virus outbreak struck in China late last year. It has weakened as the pandemic gained ground, leading to social distancing restrictions and prompting many people to stay home when they can.“In April, May, a state of emergency was issued, it was a situation where the economy was artificially stopped,” said Yasutoshi Nishimura, minister for economic and fiscal policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-economy-falls-27-8-due-to-covid-19/story-J6dgffbap3COuo5w7cDIYK.html
