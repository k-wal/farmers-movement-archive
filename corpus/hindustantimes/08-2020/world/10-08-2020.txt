The Federation of Indian Associations (FIA) of the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said in a statement that it “will be creating history” on August 15, 2020 by “hosting the first ever flag hoisting ceremony at Times Square” to commemorate India’s Independence Day. “It will be the first time ever that India’s tricolour will be unfurled at the iconic venue in all its glory,” the organisation said, adding that Consul General of India in New York Randhir Jaiswal will be the Guest of Honour at the event. The FIA said this year’s Independence Day celebrations will include the flag-hoisting ceremony at Times Square and the annual tradition of illuminating the Empire State Building in hues of the tricolour - orange, white and green. The Empire State lighting ceremony will be held on August 14. “The Times Square flag hoisting ceremony is a testament to the Indian-American community’s growing patriotism and is a fitting tribute to the FIA which is celebrating its golden jubilee year,” the organisation said. Established in 1970, the FIA is among the largest umbrella diaspora organisations. In July, Ankur Vaidya was appointed the FIA Chairman, succeeding prominent Indian-American community leader Ramesh Patel who passed away due to complications from coronavirus. Vaidya, 40, has been long associated with the FIA and was the President of the umbrella diaspora organisation for the year 2014. He is the youngest member of the Board and the youngest to be chosen as its chairman. The Consulate General of India in New York will host a virtual Independence Day celebration on August 15 in which it has invited “members of the Indian community and friends of India” for the commemoration that will be live streamed. The FIA annually organises its flagship event - the India Day Parade to mark India’s Independence Day in August. Top US political leaders, lawmakers as well as prominent members of the Indian-American community and celebrities from India have participated in the annual parade that draws a crowd of thousands in the heart of Manhattan each year. This year, however, the parade will not be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-indian-tricolour-to-be-hoisted-at-iconic-times-square-in-new-york/story-CmJJCMIcxEu2eFE727vlvL.html
10-08-2020||World||India sending more relief, humanitarian material to explosion-hit Lebanon||India is immediately sending relief and humanitarian material of medicines, foodstuff and essential items to Lebanon and is discussing with the authorities there on any further contributions to help alleviate difficulties on ground in the wake of the massive explosion last week that destroyed the port of Beirut and killed more than 150 people.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti offered deep condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India to Lebanon on “this terrible human tragedy”. “We are shocked by the loss of human lives and the widespread destruction this has caused in Beirut. We pray for strength to families to overcome their great loss,” Tirumurti said on Monday at a briefing on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon.Tirumurti said India just recently sent Lebanon essential medical items to combat Covid-19. “We are immediately sending more relief and humanitarian material of medicines, foodstuff and other essential items to do whatever we can to alleviate the difficulties on the ground. We are discussing with the Government of Lebanon on how we can contribute further,” he said.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also paid condolences to the families and loved ones of the more than 150 people who were killed, and wished a full recovery to the many thousands of injured in the explosion, which sent shockwaves across the bustling city of Beirut, bursting  out windows and shaking buildings.Tirumurti recalled that he had paid an official visit to the “beautiful city of Beirut” last year, and said it is difficult for him to imagine that this vibrant and bustling city has been affected by the blast. “I admire the resilience of the people and the dedication of the rescue workers to cope with this tragedy,” he said.India has had traditionally close and historical relations with Lebanon, including through Indian peacekeepers in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Tirumurti said, adding that “I would like to express our solidarity with Lebanon at this juncture.” Guterres said almost a week after the blast, many people remain missing. Buildings were damaged for miles around the city of Beirut after 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilisers, stored at the port for six years, reportedly caused the explosion. A plane carrying 20 tonnes of World Health Organization health supplies landed in Beirut on Wednesday to cover 1,000 trauma interventions and 1,000 surgical interventions for people suffering from injuries and burns as a result of the blast. Further, within hours of the blast, the Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon released USD 9 million from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to address immediate needs. Last Friday, the Emergency Relief Coordinator released a further USD 6 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund.UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the devastating impact of last week’s tragedy makes it imperative for the international community to stand beside the people of Lebanon who have generously hosted thousands of refugees for years. “We must respond by providing the necessary humanitarian assistance to alleviate the immediate suffering and to support the Lebanese people as they embark on the road to recovery. The needs are enormous and great.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-sending-more-relief-humanitarian-material-to-explosion-hit-lebanon/story-4LyN3kgDhgKsuxbjtdXxAP.html

Multiple countries, including Russia, have already offered their assistance in dealing with the consequences of the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-sends-usd-1-7-million-worth-protective-equipment-to-lebanon/story-U5Z6XWDCb67DyUUgZxaqzH.html

Yet less than 100 people had officially received the inoculation against the epidemic by early August and its widespread use could be dangerous, the Association of Clinical Trials Organizations said in a letter sent to Health Minister Mikhail Murashko on Monday.“Why are all corporations following the rules, but Russian ones aren’t? The rules for conducting clinical trials are written in blood. They can’t be violated,” ACTO Executive Director Svetlana Zavidova said by phone. “This is a Pandora’s Box and we don’t know what will happen to people injected with an unproven vaccine.”The Gamaleya vaccine, which is being developed together with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, began Phase 3 testing last week. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Monday he hopes it will be registered “soon,” while one of his deputies has said production is likely to start next month and the Health Ministry said mass vaccinations could begin by October.World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters last week in Geneva that vaccines should go through all stages of testing before being licensed.A spokesperson for RDIF declined to comment on the letter. The Health Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Scores of Russia’s business and political elite have already been given access to the experimental vaccine as early as April, according to people familiar with the effort. Military volunteers completed Phase 2 trials in July, according to the Defense Ministry. The results haven’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal.Researchers and pharmaceutical companies in other countries including the U.S., the U.K., Japan and China are also racing to develop vaccines. AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. have begun late-stage testing for Covid-19 vaccines, with initial results from some of the human trials expected as early as October.ACTO represents a group of multinational companies that conduct clinical trials in Russia, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Novartis AG.Russia had over 27,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the second quarter, according to Federal Statistics Service data. It has the fourth-most confirmed cases in the world, with nearly 900,000 people diagnosed.“They haven’t published anything,” Zavidova said of the Russian efforts. “This runs counter to the rest of the world. There is a standard to publish data even from unsuccessful studies.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-covid-19-vaccine-is-pandora-s-box-industry-body-warns/story-O8cSVr8VIHD3s478TKvWVP.html

He said they held up the announcement until after the commemorations of the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and parliamentary elections earlier that month.“The administration resorted to secrecy for political and security reasons,” he said, and only provided “engineered statistics” to the public.He also criticized testing efforts and warned of a renewed outbreak next month as universities hold entrance exams and people mark major Shiite holidays.Iran’s Health Ministry has reported a total of nearly 330,000 cases and 18,616 deaths, including 189 fatalities in the last 24 hours.Authorities in Iran have come under heavy criticism since the start of the pandemic because of their reluctance to impose the kind of sweeping restrictions seen elsewhere in the region.

China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, is a breakaway province.Speaking at the regular ministry briefing on Monday, Zhao said the US side should stop official interactions and contact of all kinds as well as the upgrading of substantive relations with the island.Also read: China sends fighter jets as US offers Taiwan ‘strong’ supportAzar met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, a high-profile visit that comes in the backdrop of a severe low in US-China relations. The evident friction in the China’s ties with Washington has likely exacerbated by Azar’s visit, making him the highest-level US official to visit the self-governing island since formal diplomatic relations were severed in 1979 in deference to China.Separately, Zhao announced sanctions on 11 US lawmakers and individuals, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, as countermeasures against earlier US sanctions on Chinese central government and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) officials following the passing of the national security law for Hong Kong. Zhai said China has decided to impose sanctions on individuals who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues“China resolutely opposes and strongly condemns such blatant interference in Hong Kong affairs - China’s internal affairs - as it seriously violated international law and basic principles of international relations,” Zhao added.“Since the return of Hong Kong (from British rule), the “one country, two systems” principle has been recognised around the world as a success and Hong Kong residents enjoy democratic rights and all sorts of freedoms in line with the law. That is a fact that no unbiased person can deny, Zhao said.“But the principle also faces challenges during its implementation, that is to say, national security risks in HKSAR,” Zhao said.Also read: US health chief meets Taiwan’s leader, fueling China tensionsBesides Rubio and Cruz, Beijing sanctioned Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, Pat Toomey and Congressman Chris Smith. The heads of NGOs namely Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for Democracy, Derek Mitchell, president of the National Democratic Institute, Daniel Twining, president of the International Republican Institute, Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, and Michael Abramowitz, president of Freedom House, were also sanctioned.“I want to reiterate that Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs that no external forces can interfere in. China urges the US to have a clear understanding of the situation, correct mistakes, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China’s internal affairs,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-us-lawmakers-over-hong-kong-slams-top-american-official-s-taiwan-visit/story-UNbMCKF7QE3GnOlvU5sxsL.html

Heads of organisations including the National Endowment for Democracy and Freedom House were also named.Beijing already placed a travel ban on Rubio, Cruz and Smith last month after Washington announced similar measures against Chinese officials linked to measures taken against Muslims in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-11-us-politicians-heads-of-organisations/story-c980q7TxX5C8wME5ImUmvI.html
10-08-2020||World||Donors pledge 253 million euros in emergency aid for Lebanon after blast||An emergency donor conference on Sunday for blast-stricken Lebanon raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief, the French presidency said. Those commitments would not be conditional on political or institutional reform, President Emmanuel Macron’s office said. There were also pledges made for longer-term support that would depend on changes brought in by the authorities, the Elysee Palace said. World powers promised not to fail the Lebanese people as the capital, Beirut, recovers from the massive explosion that killed 158 people and destroyed swathes of the city last Tuesday. Lebanon was already mired in political and financial crisis before the blast.But foreign countries demanded transparency over how the aid is used, wary of writing blank cheques to a government viewed by its own people as deeply corrupt. Some are concerned about the influence of Iran through the Shi’ite group Hezbollah.The “assistance should be timely, sufficient and consistent with the needs of the Lebanese people ... and directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency,” the final communique stated.Macron, who visited Beirut on Thursday, hosted the conference by video-link and in his opening remarks urged participating nations to put aside their differences and support the Lebanese people.The international response should be coordinated by the United Nations in Lebanon, he added.The offer of assistance included support for an impartial, credible and independent inquiry into the blast. Public anger over the explosion has prompted some Lebanese to call for a revolt to topple their political leaders.“Our role is to be by their side,” Macron said from his summer retreat on the French Riviera.ReformsPresident Donald Trump told the conference the United States was ready to continue providing aid to help the Lebanese, the White House said.“The President called for calm in Lebanon and acknowledged the legitimate calls of peaceful protesters for transparency, reform and accountability,” a White House statement said. Trump later said the United States would send additional planes loaded with medical supplies, food and water and would give substantial aid to Lebanon, though he declined to give a dollar figure.“We haven’t given a number, but it will be substantial. On a humanitarian basis, we have to do it,” Trump told reporters in Morristown, New Jersey.The International Monetary Fund said it was willing to redouble efforts to help Lebanon after the devastating blast, but said all of the country’s institutions needed to show willingness to carry out reforms.In a statement to the conference, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, laid out reforms expected, including steps to restore the solvency of public finances and the soundness of the financial system, and temporary safeguards to avoid continued capital outflows.The explosion gutted entire neighbourhoods, leaving 250,000 people homeless, razing businesses and destroying critical grain supplies.Rebuilding Beirut will likely run into the billions of dollars. Economists forecast the blast could wipe up to 25% off of the country’s GDP. Up to Sunday’s conference there had been an array of offers of immediate humanitarian support such as rescue teams and medical supplies.In a sign of the mistrust between Beirut and donors before the blast, debt default talks between the Lebanese government and International Monetary Fund had stalled in the absence of reforms. The communique said Lebanon’s partners were ready to support the country’s longer-term economic recovery if leaders committed fully to the changes expected by the Lebanese.Many Lebanese say the blast, blamed on a huge store of ammonium nitrate, highlighted the negligence of a corrupt political elite. Protesters stormed government ministries in Beirut on Saturday and demonstrations erupted again on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donors-pledge-253-million-euros-in-emergency-aid-for-lebanon-after-blast/story-WEUFbMK2HMeJKk00MReHsL.html
10-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Extreme poverty rises; a generation sees a future slip away||As a domestic worker, Amsale Hailemariam knew from the inside out the luxury villas that had grown up around her simple shelter of raw metal and plastic sheeting. And in them, she saw how her country, Ethiopia, had transformed.The single mother told herself, “Oh God, a day will come when my life will be changed, too.” The key lay in her daughter, just months from a career in public health, who studied how to battle the illnesses of want and hunger.Then a virus mentioned in none of her textbooks arrived, and dreams faded for families, and entire countries, like theirs. Decades of progress in one of modern history’s greatest achievements, the fight against extreme poverty, are in danger of slipping away because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The world could see its first increase in extreme poverty in 22 years, further sharpening social inequities.“We are living in a state where we are above the dead and below the living,” Amsale said, near tears. “This is not life.” With the virus and its restrictions, up to 100 million more people globally could fall into the bitter existence of living on just USD 1.90 a day, according to the World Bank.  That’s “well below any reasonable conception of a life with dignity,” the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty wrote this year. And it comes on top of the 736 million people already there, half of them in just five countries: Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Congo and Bangladesh. India is struggling with one of the world’s largest virus caseloads and the effects of a lockdown so abrupt and punishing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the poor to forgive him. Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, has surpassed India with the most people in extreme poverty — roughly half its citizens. And Congo remains one of the world’s most crisis-ridden countries, with outbreaks of Ebola and measles smoldering.Even China, Indonesia and South Africa are expected to have more than 1 million people each fall into extreme poverty, the World Bank says.“It’s a huge, huge setback for the entire world,” Gayle Smith, president of the ONE Campaign to end extreme poverty, told The Associated Press. Smith, a former administrator for the US Agency for International Development, called the global response to the crisis “stunningly meager.” Most of the millions newly at risk are in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that against countless odds had some of the world’s fastest growing economies in recent years. The World Bank shared with the AP the earliest data out of Ethiopia as it takes a global measure of the pandemic’s direct effects over several months, showing that the pain is already widespread. Similar efforts are under way in more than 100 countries.Back in 1991, when Ethiopia began its transformation, the country was exhausted by war. A new leader, Meles Zenawi, was shaking off years of Marxist dictatorship and terrifying drought whose images of withered children left the world aghast. The former rebel had a vision that became his legacy, one of bringing millions of countrymen out of grinding poverty.Amsale was newly arrived in the capital, Addis Ababa, from what is now neighbouring Eritrea, her baby daughter in her arms. For her the child, Bethlehem Jafar, became a tiny symbol of the city’s rise.Bethlehem benefited from the welfare of the state and the charity of those who saw in her a better future. Her mother scraped by through manual labor, vowing her girl would never do the same.Fellow Ethiopians were moving up in the world, as the government looked to emulate China’s astonishing lifting of more than 800 million people from poverty. Some embraced new manufacturing jobs. Others left subsistence farms for the growing sectors of hospitality, services and aviation that catered to the changing times, hoping to join Africa’s expanding middle class.The number of people in extreme poverty dropped dramatically, from nearly half of Ethiopia’s population in the mid-1990s to 23 per cent two decades later. “Impressive,” the World Bank said.The high-altitude city of Addis Ababa, Africa’s diplomatic capital, became an aviation hub, and a magnet for millions of citizens seeking better lives. Some grasped the first rung of upward mobility in the hustle of the untaxed informal sector, dodging the growing number of cars in the streets that signaled the middle class.Under the country’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, the capital in the past two years has seen a wave of new construction, including malls and luxury apartments. And a source of national pride is a massive dam near completion on the Nile, funded completely by Ethiopia and its citizens in a bid to pull millions more from poverty.Now Ethiopians of all kinds are hurting in the pandemic. The country, along with Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, is expected to see half of sub-Saharan Africa’s new extreme poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-extreme-poverty-rises-a-generation-sees-a-future-slip-away/story-0nQw8Wi0RLAW6GhGVzwoAN.html

The government accepted the advice of a loya jirga, a grand assembly of elders, on Sunday to release 400 “hard-core” Taliban prisoners, paving the way for talks aimed at ending a war that has ground on since US-backed Afghan forces ousted a Taliban government in late 2001. “We are ready to sit for talks within a week from when we see our prisoners released. We are ready,” Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, told Reuters on Monday.A government source told Reuters that President Ashraf Ghani would likely sign the decree to release the prisoners later on Monday.“Everyone is waiting for Ghani to sign on the decree. The original plan is to travel to Doha on Wednesday and the talks will begin on Sunday,” the source said. US Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who reached an agreement with the Taliban in February for the withdrawal of the last US troops, welcomed the progress, having spent months trying to bring the militant movement to the negotiating table with the government. “In the next few days, we expect the completion of prisoner releases, then travel of the Islamic Republic team to Doha, & from there the immediate start of intra-Afghan negotiations,” he said on Twitter.The Taliban had demanded the release of last 400 of 5,000 prisoners to be freed, as a condition for joining peace talk. But the government had been hesitant as these prisoners were involved in some of the worst violence, including a 2017 truck bombing near the German embassy in Kabul that killed more than 150 people - the deadliest attack in the 19-year insurgency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-to-sign-release-of-taliban-prisoners-peace-talks-expected-in-days/story-Ww6xX5sV2DUkPgwojGpd2N.html

Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over issues ranging from trade to Hong Kong and China’s handling of Covid-19.Beijing’s move is the latest in a tit-for-tat round of sanctions between China and the United States over allegations of rights abuses and interference. Washington on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as well as the city’s current and former police chiefs, under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.Those sanctions freeze any U.S. assets owned by the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.The U.S. lawmakers targeted by Beijing on Monday have been vocal critics of a new national security law that expands Beijing’s authority in Hong Kong. Last month, China announced sanctions against Cruz, Rubio, Smith and other U.S. officials after Washington penalized senior Chinese officials over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region.Beijing’s latest measure also includes new sanctions against the heads of the U.S.-based campaign groups Freedom House and Human Rights Watch. Both had were been subjected to sanctions in December in relation to Hong Kong.It also imposed sanctions on the heads of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and the International Republican Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-sanction-us-officials-including-senators-rubio-cruz-over-us-action-on-hong-kong/story-gBWWMLqwxsCq7eEV9Z33GK.html

Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing.Azar is visiting to strengthen economic and public-health cooperation with Taiwan and support Taiwan’s international role in fighting the pandemic.“Taiwan’s response to COVID-19 has been among the most successful in the world, and that is a tribute to the open, transparent, democratic nature of Taiwan’s society and culture,” he told Tsai.Taiwan’s early and effective steps to fight the disease have kept its case numbers far lower than those of its neighbours, with 480 infections, including seven deaths. Most cases have been imported.The United States, which has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, has repeatedly clashed with China over the pandemic, accusing Beijing of lacking transparency.Tsai told Azar his visit represented “a huge step forward in anti-pandemic collaborations between our countries”, mentioning areas of cooperation including vaccine and drug research and production.Taiwan has been particularly grateful for US support to permit its attendance at the World Health Organization’s (WHO) decision-making body the World Health Assembly, and to allow it greater access to the organisation.Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to China’s objections, which considers it a Chinese province.“I’d like to reiterate that political considerations should never take precedence over the rights to health. The decision to bar Taiwan from participating in the WHA is a violation of the universal rights to health,” Tsai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sends-fighter-jets-as-us-offers-taiwan-strong-support/story-e0Nfq5vpWbdrfpcJomWI2J.html

Another eruption in 2014 killed 16 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-s-sinabung-volcano-erupts-sending-column-of-ash-5-000-m-into-sky/story-2iJ200xs6xKLLdiiIUHyYK.html
10-08-2020||World||Left believes in ‘tearing down the system’, says US attorney general Barr||US Attorney General William Barr mounted a partisan attack on the Democratic Party in an interview that aired Sunday, claiming the left believes in “tearing down the system” and pursues absolute victory as “a substitute for religion.”Barr also told a Fox News TV host he was worried that an increase in mail-in voting could lead to a contested presidential election in November, sounding in on an issue often raised by US President Donald Trump.In an interview with conservative pundit Mark Levin, Barr said Democrats had pulled away from classic liberal values and now were akin to the “Rousseauian Revolutionary Party” aimed at destroying the institutions upon which the country was built.“They’re not interested in compromise, they’re not interested in dialectic exchange of views. They’re interested in total victory,” Barr said of the left. “It’s a secular religion. It’s a substitute for a religion.” The comments come nearly two weeks after a contentious hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in which Barr denied accusations he was doing Trump’s bidding by intervening in high-profile cases and sending federal agents into cities.Barr has come under fire from Democratic lawmakers for sending federal officers to disperse protesters in Portland, Oregon, where some demonstrators have attacked a federal courthouse and others have gathered to speak out against racism and police brutality following the May 25 death of George Floyd.Barr said police have been unfairly maligned and targeted with violent attacks during nationwide protests, and argued greater attention should be paid to a recent surge in violence in some cities that has led to numerous deaths of Black people.He said he believed systemic racism existed, but that the “best example” was in education, with public schools consistently failing inner-city youth. He pointed to school choice - a policy endorsed by Trump - as one solution to the problem. “I believe Black lives matter, but I believe all Black lives matter. I also believe that it’s not just a matter of protecting their safety from physical harm, it’s also providing economic opportunity, which this administration has done,” Barr said.Trump, who trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls, has raised questions about the integrity of the November election and he and his allies have proclaimed without evidence that expanded voting by mail - sought by many due to the coronavirus pandemic - will lead to widespread fraud.When asked about the push to expand mail-in ballots, Barr said he was “very worried about it.” He said he was fine with “individual cases” where people that have difficulty making it to the polls apply for and receive a ballot in the mail. “But the idea that you, without any request from the voter, will mail out your voting list, all these thousands and thousands of ballots, is scary because most of those mailings go to a lot of addresses where the people no longer live,” Barr said. “They could easily create a situation where there’s going to be a contested election.”(This story refiles to fix typo in first paragraph) (reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/left-believes-in-tearing-down-the-system-says-us-attorney-general-barr/story-UFJhWDSuaOwd6Z5Qqwd6QI.html

Prefabricated structures are manufactured off-site in advance, usually in standard sections, so that they can be easily shipped and assembled at the main construction site.A pair of 192-meter-tall (630 feet) towers will come up in Singapore but large portions of the structure are being manufactured over the border in Malaysia and will later be moved to the original construction site.Also read: South Asian origin Canadians worst-hit due to job losses caused by Covid-19Individual modules of residential project Avenue South Residence are being manufactured at Senai, Malaysia, a report published in CNN stated. The modules, a series of six-sided boxes of concrete, will first reach a facility in Singapore for fitting and furnishing before reaching the construction location for the final assembling.This kind of construction method is believed to reduce the amount of construction work carried out at the actual site. In case of a site being amid a residential or a busy city location, such a method can cut down on the inconvenience caused to the locals and those around. Given the pandemic situation, the method also involves having fewer people at the construction site at a given time.

A look at the site plan so sees two majestic towers that are 56 storeys high and there will be 18 Sky Gardens with unique dining & entertaining venues. There will also be 4 function rooms on level 56 which offers unrivalled views of the city centre,” the official website reads.

10-08-2020||World||South Asian origin Canadians worst-hit due to job losses caused by Covid-19||Canadians of South Asian origin, including Indo-Canadians, have been the demographically worst-hit community due to jobs losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. According to the country’s data agency Statistics Canada (StatCan), as against an overall unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent for July, the comparative figure for South Asians was at 17.8 per cent.In fact, according to the labour force survey released by StatCan, minority groups have largely suffered more than the mainstream due to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. While South Asians have been the worst affected, the unemployment rate among those of Arab origin is 17.3 per cent and black Canadians at 16.8 per cent.The agency also pointed out that South Asians and Chinese Canadians has experiences “large” Covid-19-related increases in unemployment. It noted, “South Asian (+9.1 percentage points) and Chinese (+8.4 percentage points) Canadians experienced relatively large increases in their unemployment rates from July 2019 to July 2020.” And among South Asians, women were harder hit than men, with a 20.4 per cent unemployment rate as against 15.4 per cent.Overall, the employment situation appears to be gradually improving in the country. Employment rose by 419,000 or 2.4 per cent in July which, when combined with gains from June of 953,000 and May of 290,000, indicates a degree of economic recovery with restrictions that hampered activity being gradually relaxed. However, the unemployment numbers were still 1.3 million behind the pre-February level. The unemployment rate overall was at 10.9 per cent below the record high of 13.7 per cent in May, but still not close to the pre-COVID-19 situation in February when the rate was at 5.6 per cent.The gains in employment in July came largely due to part-time work, with that accounting for five-sixths of the additions, at 345,000 as compared to just 73,000 full-time positions.“The relatively flat growth in full-time work in recent months is reflected in an increase in the proportion of part-time workers doing so involuntarily.,” StatCan analysed, adding that 29.7 per cent of those working part-time would have preferred full-time work but are unable to secure such openings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-asian-origin-canadians-worst-hit-due-to-job-losses-caused-by-covid-19/story-OAS2aL6bVNdgeXf46KukoM.html
10-08-2020||World||Covid-19 spreading fast because billions don’t have water to wash hands: UN||A severe household water shortage facing two out of five people in the world is undermining efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic.Frequent and thorough hand washing are among the most effective measures in restricting the spread of the virus because the primary routes of transmission are droplets and direct contact, according to the World Health Organization. Yet, some 3 billion people don’t have access to running water and soap at home, and 4 billion suffer from severe water scarcity for at least one month a year, the United Nations group UN-Water said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is a disastrous situation for people living without access to safe water and safely managed sanitation,” UN-Water Chair Gilbert F. Houngbo said in an interview. “The chronic underinvestment has left billions vulnerable and we are now seeing the consequences.”Years of deferred investments in clean water and sanitation are now putting everyone at risk as the virus spreads through developed and developing nations generating a cycle of infection and reinfection.The world needs to spend $6.7 trillion on water infrastructure by 2030, according to the UN, not just for the urgent sanitation needs, but to tackle longer term issues from the pandemic such as providing better irrigation to head off a potential food crisis, Houngbo said.Some companies have stepped in to offer solutions for the most urgent problems. Japan’s Lixil Group Corp., which owns brands such as American Standard and Grohe, worked with Unicef and other partners to create an off-grid hand washing gadget that needs only a small amount of water in a bottle. For $1 million it will make 500,000 units in India to be donated to serve 2.5 million people before it starts retail sales.It’s a rapid, short-term response to help fight the pandemic, but more sustainable investments are needed, such as installing piped water to more homes, said Clarissa Brocklehurst, faculty member of the Water Institute at University of North Carolina and a former water, sanitation and hygiene chief at Unicef.Water inequalitiesThe lack of access to basic water and sanitation is one more example of the lethal effects of inequality being exposed by the pandemic. The impacts of water mismanagement are felt disproportionately by the poor, who are more likely to rely on rain-fed agriculture for food and are most at risk from contaminated water and inadequate sanitation, the World Bank said.Underprivileged people in cities are particularly vulnerable as they often live in densely populated areas where social distancing is hard, especially if they have to share a water source. Transmission in the Americas has been tougher to contain in poor urban areas that have limited access to water, sanitation and public health services, said Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization.As many as 5.7 billion people could be living in areas where water is scarce for at least one month a year by 2050, creating unprecedented competition for water, said UN’s Houngbo.By one estimate, each degree of global warming will expose about 7% of the world’s population to a decrease of renewable water resources of at least 20%. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to 2 degrees, may reduce climate-induced water stress by as much as 50%.“Hand washing for so long has been what I would call infantilized,” Brocklehurst said. “All of a sudden, it’s a matter of life and death and adults are teaching themselves hand-washing songs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spreading-fast-because-billions-don-t-have-water-to-wash-hands-un/story-ovDcXYZXYfnNCbBa4OUiYN.html
10-08-2020||World||Israeli jeweller makes $1.5 million gold coronavirus mask||An Israeli jewellery company is working on what it says will be the world’s most expensive coronavirus mask, a gold, diamond-encrusted face covering with a price tag of $1.5 million.The 18-karat white gold mask will be decorated with 3,600 white and black diamonds and fitted with top-rated N99 filters at the request of the buyer, said designer Isaac Levy.Levy, owner of the Yvel company, said the buyer had two other demands: that it be completed by the end of the year, and that it would be the priciest in the world. That last condition, he said, “was the easiest to fulfill.” He declined to identify the buyer, but said he was a Chinese businessman living in the United States.The glitzed-up face mask may lend some pizzazz to the protective gear now mandatory in public spaces in many countries. But at 270 grams (over half a pound) — nearly 100 times that of a typical surgical mask — it is not likely to be a practical accessory to wear.In an interview at his factory near Jerusalem, Levy showed off several pieces of the mask, covered in diamonds. One gold plate had a hole for the filter.“Money maybe doesn’t buy everything, but if it can buy a very expensive COVID-19 mask and the guy wants to wear it and walk around and get the attention, he should be happy with that,” Levy said.Such an ostentatious mask might also rub some the wrong way at a time when millions of people around the world are out of work or suffering economically. Levy said that while he would not wear it himself, he was thankful for the opportunity.“I am happy that this mask gave us enough work for our employees to be able to provide their jobs in very challenging times like these times right now,” he said.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-jeweller-makes-1-5-million-gold-coronavirus-mask/story-hGU96ZBw0JeFZhpuYE32CL.html
10-08-2020||World||US health chief meets Taiwan’s leader, fueling China tensions||On the most senior visit by an American official in more than four decades, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar hailed Taiwan’s democracy and praised President Tsai Ing-wen’s response to the pandemic in comments likely to stoke tensions with China.“It is a true honor to be here to convey a message of strong support and friendship from President Trump to Taiwan,” Azar said when meeting Tsai in prepared remarks. He called Taiwan’s democracy “an inspiration to the region and the world” and said he wanted to use the visit “to learn about how our shared democratic values have driven success in health.”In comments to reporters, Azar said that Taiwan was “so scarred” by China’s lack of transparency during the SARS outbreak in 2003 that its people didn’t trust information coming from Beijing or the World Health Organization. He also said that the US has fought for Taiwan to be included as an observer in the World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body.Tsai called it “highly regrettable” that China has blocked Taiwan from participating in the World Health Assembly, saying her government could help countries fight the disease. “The decision to bar Taiwan from participating in the WHA is a violation of the universal right to health,” she said.Taiwan has been a rare global success story in containing Covid-19, as the US grapples with one of the world’s worst outbreaks. In keeping with Taiwan’s stringent anti-virus procedures, Azar’s delegation is abiding by measures including multiple tests for Covid-19, mandatory daily temperature checks and wearing masks at all times. He’s also scheduled to speak with Taiwan’s health minister on Monday and hold a press briefing, according to a person familiar with the situation.The visit has drawn China’s ire as the US challenges Beijing on a range of fronts, from the early handling of the virus to Chinese-owned technology companies to a new security law for Hong Kong. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin last week said Beijing was “firmly opposed” to the trip, calling Taiwan “the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations.”The trip comes days after President Donald Trump moved to ban Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and TikTok, owned by Bytedance Ltd., sending shock waves through the global tech industry amid increased fears of a push for decoupling the world’s biggest economies. The Trump administration has also led the way in condemning China over its crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, where media tycoon Jimmy Lai was arrested on Monday.Azar’s visit has little to do with the virus and is primarily aimed at sending a message to Beijing as it increases diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan, according to Jonathan Sullivan, director of China programs at the Asia Research Institute and an associate professor at the University of Nottingham.“There is a confidence in Taiwan, which this demonstration of American support will buttress, that it can live with Chinese pressures, limited as they are, especially during a moment when the backlash to ‘Chinese assertiveness’ is growing around the world,” he wrote in an email.Taiwan has rejected China’s criticism of Azar’s visit, saying on Thursday that Beijing was a “global troublemaker.”“What the Chinese government can do is stop making irresponsible remarks on the international stage” and stop interfering with Taiwan’s dealings around the world, ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said at a briefing Thursday. “What the Chinese government can do is ‘return politics to the people, listen to the voices of the people, and understand the needs of the people’ because the 1.4 billion people of China and Hong Kong deserve freedom.”Azar’s trip coincided with a visit by former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori to pay his respects to the late President Lee Teng-hui, who led Taiwan from dictatorship to democracy in the 1990s and reshaped its relationship with China.In a meeting with Tsai on Sunday that could further worsen Japan-China ties, Mori conveyed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s condolences while the Taiwanese president said she hoped the two sides can work together to combat the virus. The group included Abe’s younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, who is also a lawmaker in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/honor-to-convey-message-of-strong-support-friendship-us-health-chief-to-taiwan/story-ITPlNnDH2y41ybUdjOdqpK.html
10-08-2020||World||Ohio governor’s conflicting Covid-19 tests raise backlash||The Ohio governor’s positive, then negative, tests for Covid-19 have provided fuel for skeptics of government pandemic mandates and critics of his often-aggressive policies.“I’m sure the internet is lighting up with ‘Well, you can’t believe any test,’ ” Mike DeWine said in a WCOL radio interview Friday, after a whirlwind of events the day before when the initial positive showing forced the Republican to scrub a planned meeting with President Donald Trump. And on Sunday, he told CNN’s “State of the Union” that “people should not take away from my experience that testing is not reliable or doesn’t work.”Instead of seeing Trump at the Cleveland airport, DeWine returned to this state capital for new testing with his wife, Fran, through Ohio State University’s medical center. They then went to their southwestern Ohio farm in Cedarville, where DeWine said he planned to quarantine for 14 days. But within hours, he had received Columbus test results that were negative. The first test, part of protocol for people meeting with the president, was a rapid-result antigen test, while the Columbus testing was a genetic, laboratory test whose results are considered more reliable.The governor’s office said Saturday another test for each by Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center again returned negative results for DeWine and his wife.The conflicting results come as Americans have grown frustrated about access to testing and by slow results. Ohioans also remain divided over DeWine’s actions to deal with the pandemic, with some saying his early shutdown actions unnecessarily damaged businesses. He was an early advocate of wearing masks to stop the Covid-19 spread even as other Republicans in Ohio remain unconvinced.State Rep. Nino Vitale, a conservative GOP gadfly from Urbana, tweeted a photo of DeWine wearing a mask minutes after the positive test was announced Thursday.“I think the question must be asked. Has he not been wearing his mask, or do masks not stop the spread?” Vitale said in his post, which also stated he wished the governor no ill will.DeWine said he received some “not so nice” texts during the day Thursday about wearing masks. He reasserted Friday that while they might not be 100% effective, they do help prevent spread and have been made a noticeable difference in the state’s most-populated cities.Critics were blasting him on his official Twitter account, too.DeWine, 73, a former US senator and House member who is in his first term as governor, at first appeared to have been only the second US governor to positive for the coronavirus.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he contracted the virus last month. Stitt, a Republican who has been disdainful of mask mandates, said he contracted Covid-19 by hugging friends.Longtime Cincinnati-area conservative activist Mike Wilson, who has been analyzing and writing about coronavirus data since he contracted COVID-19 this summer, saw a storm of strong reactions on his Facebook page including from some who said DeWine’s results show the pandemic is “a scam.”“At this point, this is clearly not a hoax,” said Wilson, who has fully recovered from the virus. He said continued pandemic-deniers are mostly “outliers,” but many other people are frustrated over what they see as DeWine’s overreactions and also about the testing issues. Test results, including false positives, affect individual lives by triggering quarantines that are a rising concern as Ohio schools prepare to reopen.The number of positive cases in Ohio had decreased after the first surge, hitting a low in late May. But numbers again began to rise in mid-June as Ohio began to reopen businesses.DeWine had resisted a statewide mask mandate until July 23. He quickly backed off an earlier try at a mask requirement inside businesses and balked at closing down bars, instead recently mandating a “last call” at 10 p.m. and an 11 p.m. closing time. Nearly 3,700 Ohio deaths have been linked to the coronavirus.Wilson thinks by now, DeWine and other government officials should allow people to make their own decisions on which precautions they need or are willing to take.“We’ve found that people’s individual behavior matters more than those government actions anyway,” Wilson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ohio-governor-s-conflicting-covid-19-tests-raise-backlash/story-7VTWJYJ4kxwMD0zr8TnnLL.html

Much of that has gone toward funding research and manufacturing capacity that will help a vaccine be distributed globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-says-us-covid-19-testing-has-mind-blowing-problems/story-MrsQ0Kj3xqofPwi2FJln7M.html

Those bosses who do intend to review salaries anticipate making 1% increases to basic pay, compared with 2% this time last year. Even so, hiring intentions rose, indicating that businesses are reshaping in response to the crisis.The specter of mass unemployment is looming large over the UK economy as it begins its fragile recovery following months of lockdown. While the government has been paying the wages of 9.6 million jobs at a cost of 33.8 billion pounds ($44 billion) as of Aug. 2, it has started to wind down the program, even as many businesses are still struggling. The Bank of England last week warned unemployment will rise to about 7.5% by the end of the year.“Until now, redundancies have been low -- no doubt due to the Job Retention Scheme -- but we expect to see more redundancies come through this autumn, especially in the private sector once the scheme closes,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser at the CIPD. “This will likely be accompanied by a pay squeeze for workers, which is actually to be welcomed to help preserve jobs.

It has prompted fears among activists and foreign governments that it will be used to silence basic freedoms in the city.Lai’s media group and Apple Daily backed the pro-democracy protests that rocked the city last year, but it’s been years since he was seen as playing a central role in Hong Kong’s democracy movement. Lai had earlier been arrested in February on suspicion of participating in an unlawful assembly in 2019 and intimidating a reporter two years before that, and was granted police bail.The U.S. has led foreign governments in expressing concern over the law, saying Hong Kong could no longer be considered sufficiently autonomous from the mainland. It has begun revoking its so-called special trading privileges, which help underpin its reputation as an international business hub, and sanctioned Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam as well as other officials last week.Lam has defended the national security law and called it the “most important” development in relations between Hong Kong and Beijing since the city’s handover to Chinese rule in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-under-national-security-law-report/story-uCZ7RRNRaMT2tp1wXjbWDO.html

Protesters also broke into the housing and transport ministry offices.Fire broke out at an entrance to Parliament Square as demonstrators tried to break into a cordoned-off area, TV footage showed. Protesters also broke into the housing and transport ministry offices.Two government ministers resigned amid the political fallout of the blast and months of economic crisis, saying the government had failed to reform.Tuesday’s explosion of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate killed 158 people and injured more than 6,000, compounding months of political and economic collapse and prompting furious calls for the government to quit.Riot police wearing body armour and carrying batons clashed with demonstrators as thousands converged on Parliament Square and nearby Martyrs’ Square, a Reuters correspondent said.“We gave these leaders so many chances to help us and they always failed. We want them all out, especially Hezbollah, because it’s a militia and just intimidates people with its weapons,” Walid Jamal, an unemployed demonstrator, said, referring to the country’s most influential Iran-backed armed grouping that has ministers in the government.The country’s top Christian Maronite cleric, Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, said the cabinet should resign as it cannot “change the way it governs”.“The resignation of an MP or a minister is not enough ... the whole government should resign as it is unable to help the country recover,” he said in his Sunday sermon.Lebanon’s environment minister resigned on Sunday, saying the government had lost a number of opportunities to reform, a statement said.Damianos Kattar’s departure follows the resignation of Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad earlier on Sunday in the wake of the explosion.Anger boiled over into violent scenes in central Beirut on Saturday. Those protests were the biggest since October when thousands of people took to the streets to demand an end to corruption, bad governance and mismanagement.About 10,000 people gathered at Martyrs’ Square, which was transformed into a battle zone in the evening between police and protesters who tried to break down a barrier along a road leading to parliament. Some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks. One policeman was killed and the Red Cross said more than 170 people were injured in clashes.‘Change the government’“The police fired at me. But that won’t stop us from demonstrating until we change the government from top to bottom,” Younis Flayti, 55, a retired army officer, said on Sunday.Nearby, mechanic Sabir Jamali sat beside a noose attached to a wooden frame in Martyrs’ Square, intended as a symbolic warning to Lebanese leaders to resign or face hanging.“Every leader who oppresses us should be hanged,” he said, adding he will protest again.Lawyer Maya Habli surveyed the demolished port.“People should sleep in the streets and demonstrate against the government until it falls,” she said.The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse. The government has said it will hold those responsible to account.An emergency donor conference in France raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief, the French presidency said.For many, the blast was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which has since been rebuilt.“I worked in Kuwait for 15 years in sanitation to save money and build a gift shop in Lebanon and it was destroyed by the explosion,” said Maroun Shehadi.“Nothing will change until our leaders just leave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-police-fire-tear-gas-as-protesters-regroup-and-two-ministers-quit/story-2IybVinkJ4TO4VKO8YiWSM.html

10-08-2020||World||China targeting US election infrastructure with cyberattacks: Report||Chinese government-linked hackers have been targeting US election infrastructure ahead of the 2020 presidential election, White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said on Sunday, indicating a more active level of alleged Chinese interference. O’Brien’s comments appeared to go beyond a statement released on Friday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence which said China “has been expanding its influence efforts,” and that Russia was already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden. But did not specifically accuse Beijing of hacking attempts against US election-related systems.“They’d like to see the President lose,” O’Brien said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “China - like Russia, like Iran - they’ve engaged in cyberattacks and phishing and that sort of thing with respect to our election infrastructure, with respect to websites and that sort of thing.” China has consistently denied US government claims that it hacks US companies, politicians or government agencies. “The US presidential election is an internal affair, we have no interest in interfering in it,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in April.O’Brien said the United States had seen hackers try to infiltrate websites belonging to Secretary of State offices around the country, which are responsible for administering elections at the local level, and collecting data on Americans. “It is a real concern and it’s not just Russia,” he said. “There will be severe consequences for any country that attempts to interfere in our free and fair elections.” The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ODNI declined to comment or clarify whether O’Brien’s comments contradicted their own. The ODNI previously said that “adversaries” seek to compromise the private communications of American political candidates and penetrate US election systems ahead of November’s election. And that China would prefer President Donald Trump does not win reelection. Multiple reviews by US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump’s 2016 campaign and undercut his rival Hillary Clinton’s chances in that election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-targeting-us-election-infrastructure-with-cyberattacks-report/story-GT0YYMpliHe3Ncp1eIpIcK.html
