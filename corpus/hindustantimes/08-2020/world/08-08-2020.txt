08-08-2020||World||Brazil near 100,000 deaths from Covid-19||Brazil was leaping toward a grim milestone — 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 — on Saturday, and five months after the first reported case, the country had not shown signs of crushing the disease.Brazil, a nation of 210 million people, has been reporting an average of more than 1,000 daily deaths from the pandemic since late May.The Health Ministry on Friday said there had been a total of 2,962,442 confirmed infections with the new coronavirus and 99,572 deaths — tolls second only to the United States. And as in many nations, experts believe that both numbers are severe undercounts due to insufficient testing.In a tribute to Covid-19 victims, the non-governmental group Rio de Paz placed crosses and a thousand red balloons on the sand on the famed Copacabana beach Saturday.“It’s very sad. Those 100,000 represent various families, friends, parents, children”, said Marcio Silva, 55, who lost his children in the pandemic and joined the tribute.One poster read: “100 thousand: Why are we the second country in number of deaths?” At the end of the tribute, members of the NGO released the balloons, which sailed into the sky.President Jair Bolsonaro — who himself reported being infected — has been a consistent skeptic about the impact of the disease and an advocate of lifting restrictions on the economy that had been imposed by state governors trying to combat it. He has frequently mingled in crowds, sometimes without a mask.“I regret all the deaths, it’s already reaching the number 100,000, but we are going to find a way out of that”, Bolsonaro said in a Thursday night Facebook transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-near-100-000-deaths-from-covid-19/story-CZyf5u9HYlBrIaIM2IvSVO.html
08-08-2020||World||Protests in Beirut amid public fury over massive blast||Police fired tear gas and clashed with demonstrators in Lebanon’s capital on Saturday at the start of a planned protest over this week’s massive explosion that devastated large parts of Beirut and killed more than 150 people.Thousands of people poured into Beirut’s main square, where they set up symbolic nooses to hang politicians whose corruption and negligence they blame for Tuesday’s explosion at the Port of Beirut.The huge blast was caused by thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate improperly stored at the port for more than six years, apparently set off by a fire. It was the biggest in Lebanon’s history and caused an estimated $10-15 billion worth of damage, according to Beirut’s governor. It also left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.The protest Saturday was the first significant demonstration since the explosion and organizers planned to hold a symbolic funeral for the dead. As the protest got underway however, small groups of young men began throwing stones at security forces. Near parliament, riot police fired tear gas at protesters who hurled stones and tried to jump over barriers that close the road leading to the legislature. The protesters later set on fire a truck that was fortifying barriers on a road leading to parliament.The gathering at Martyrs Square and outside the parliament building and government headquarters came amid popular anger against Lebanon’s political leadership. The country’s ruling class, made up mostly of former civil war-era leaders, is blamed for widespread corruption, incompetence and mismanagement that contributed to Tuesday’s explosion.The army issued a statement reminding the protesters to act peacefully and abstain from closing roads or attacking public or private property. Police also issued a statement after the protests began urging people to act “in a civilized way far away from violence.”The protest came as senior officials from the Middle East and Europe arrived in Lebanon in a show of solidarity with the tiny country that is still in shock suffered after Tuesday’s blast.Lebanon is mired in its worst economic and financial crisis in decades making it difficult for many people who had their properties damaged to fix them.In a show of anger, the president of the Christian opposition Kataeb party said its three legislators have decided to resign from Parliament over this week’s “disaster.” Sami Gemayel called on every “honorable” member of parliament to resign and work for the “birth of a new Lebanon.”A senior Kataeb party official was killed in the blast, which claimed at least 154 lives, wounded more than 5,000 people and laid waste to the country’s largest port and nearby areas.Also killed were 43 Syrians, the country’s embassy in Beirut said. Lebanon is home to some 1 million Syrian refugees.The Dutch foreign ministry said Saturday that Hedwig Waltmans-Molier, the wife of the Netherlands’ ambassador to Lebanon, had also died of injuries sustained in Tuesday’s blast.Documents that surfaced after the blast showed that for years officials had been repeatedly warned that the presence of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate at the port posed a grave danger, but no one acted to remove it. Officials have been blaming one another since the explosion and 19 people have been detained including the port’s chief, head of Lebanon’s customs department and his predecessor.“We will support Lebanon through all available means,” Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the secretary-general of the 22-member Arab League told reporters after meeting President Michel Aoun on Saturday morning. Aboul Gheit said he would take part in a donors conference for Lebanon in France on Sunday and convey Lebanon’s demands to the international community.Later on Saturday the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, arrived in Beirut for a brief visit. Turkey’s vice president and the country’s foreign minister arrived Saturday morning and met Aoun, saying that Ankara was ready to help rebuild Beirut’s port and evacuate some of the wounded from Lebanon to Turkey for treatment.At the site of the blast in Beirut’s port, workers were still searching for dozens of people who have been missing since Tuesday. Bulldozers were also seen removing debris near the giant grain silos that are still partly standing.International aid has been flowing to Lebanon for days and several field hospitals have been set up around Beirut to help treat the wounded.President Donald Trump said Friday that he had spoken by telephone with Aoun and French President Emmanuel Macron, who paid a brief visit to Lebanon on Thursday. Trump did not mention the investigation, but noted that medical supplies, food and water were being sent from the United States, along with emergency responders, technicians, doctors and nurses.The ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in fertilizers and explosives, originated from a cargo ship called MV Rhosus that had been traveling from the country of Georgia to Mozambique in 2013. It made an unscheduled detour to Beirut as the Russian shipowner was struggling with debts and hoped to earn some extra cash in Lebanon. Unable to pay port fees and reportedly leaking, the ship was impounded.In 2014, the material was moved from the ship and placed in a warehouse at the port where it stayed until the explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-in-beirut-amid-public-fury-over-massive-blast/story-GD2nlu6gIJPlJqqVo1bUfI.html
08-08-2020||World||Lebanese security forces fire tear gas at Beirut protesters||Lebanese security forces are firing tear gas at stone-throwing protesters after they tried to reach the Parliament area in downtown Beirut.Thousands of people had poured into Beirut’s main square Saturday hanging up symbolic nooses that they say officials should be hanged on over this week’s blast while protesters and riot police clashed near parliament.The violence by a small group of young men began at the start of anti-government protests planned in the wake of the deadly explosion at Beirut port that devastated large parts of the capital and killed more than 150 people.The explosion of thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate stored at the port, apparently set off by a fire, was the biggest in Lebanon’s history and caused an estimated $10-15 billion worth of damage, according to Beirut’s governor.

08-08-2020||World||Schools face big coronavirus test as students return to classroom||Reopening schools is easy. Keeping them open will be the hard part.As educators prepare to welcome students back to class for the first time in months, schools’ ability to quickly identify and contain coronavirus outbreaks before they get out of hand will be put to the test in thousands of districts around the country.Newly reopened schools in Mississippi, Indiana and Georgia have already reported infections just days into the academic year, triggering virus protocols that include swiftly isolating infected students, tracing their contacts and quarantining people they exposed.“It doesn’t matter if you open schools in July, like we did, or if you open in August, September or October. All schools are going to have to deal with the issue of positive Covid-19 test results,” said Lee Childress, superintendent of Corinth School District in Mississippi, where more than 100 students are quarantined at home after being exposed to a handful of infected classmates.Schools are trying to mitigate the risk of transmission by spreading desks apart, serving meals in the classroom and keeping groups of students together throughout the day. Many schools — but not all — will require students and staff to wear masks, which health experts say is critical to cutting down on spread.Administrators say it might be difficult to control the mixing and mingling that happens at every school. Asymptomatic carriers could silently spread the virus to many others. A student might not remember every contact, or be reluctant to tell the truth because that would mean forcing friends into quarantine.Contact tracing might prove difficult “when you have that many students and they have multiple contacts inside of a building,” said Dallas schools chief Michael Hinojosa.Schools are reopening as new infections run at about 55,000 a day in the U.S. While that’s down from a peak of well over 70,000 in the second half of July, cases are rising in about half of the states, and deaths are climbing in many of them.In Indiana, where case numbers and the positivity rate have been rising, a student showed up to class outside Indianapolis before getting the results of a virus test. Greenfield-Central Junior High soon learned he was positive.It was the first day of school.“We felt like we were at a good place to start school and then, through no fault of our own, a kid comes to school who shouldn’t have been there,” Superintendent Harold Olin said, acknowledging “uncomfortable” conversations with parents whose children then had to be quarantined.Because it was the school system’s first case, Olin himself grabbed a tape measure and headed to the infected student’s classroom to figure out who was seated nearby so they could be notified of their potential exposure.Jason Martin’s son, Houston, who attends seventh grade at Greenfield-Central, was among those forced to learn remotely for 14 days.“Clearly, he’s disappointed,” Martin said. But the school “responded pretty well from a bonehead parent making a decision to send their kid to school knowing they have a pending COVID test result.”The question of whether an infected student or staffer should trigger an automatic shutdown has divided school officials.New York City’s public school system, the largest in the U.S., says it will automatically shutter classrooms or buildings for 14 days at a time, depending on the severity and circumstances of an outbreak. In hard-hit Texas, school systems in Houston and Dallas say they will close a building for up to five days if a student or staffer tests positive, to allow for cleaning and to give contact tracers time to do their work.It’s too risky to try to keep a school open while officials figure out who might have been exposed, Hinojosa said.“Until there’s a vaccine, just be prepared to have these rolling shutdowns,” he said.Others administrators say they will try to keep schools open during an outbreak, counting on quick action to keep a lid on it.In Pennsylvania, the Bethlehem Area School District intends to keep classrooms open if there’s a confirmed case. “One closure decision can lead to a potentially crippling and precedent-setting domino effect of closures throughout the school district,” the district says on its website.Dr. Ibukun Akinboyo, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Duke University, said even the best plans for reopening and responding to sick students and staff are going to run into trouble if there’s a high level of community spread.“Whatever is happening in the community will likely play out in the schools as well,” she said.In Mississippi, where more than 20% of virus tests have been coming back positive, at least eight students and one staff member in Corinth have tested positive since school resumed last week. District officials used classroom seating charts to determine who needed to be quarantined.The tally through Friday: 122 people.Nurses, administrators and teachers have worked together to identify the infected students’ close contacts — anyone who was within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes. But at some point, contact tracing ceases to be practical, and a school might have to close, Childress said.“I think if you have a large number, the process could quickly become unmanageable, and that would be something that we would know when we see it,” he said.Joel Barnes and his wife are rethinking their decision to send their four kids back to Corinth schools after their son was exposed at the high school. They are awaiting the results of his virus test.“We expected there to be some cases of COVID, but we’re honestly surprised that it happened so quickly and has spread to so many so rapidly,” said Barnes, who has lung and nerve damage from a car accident and worries about contracting the virus. “Now it’s taken off.”The couple have pulled two of their children from school in favor of remote lessons.“In hindsight, we wish we’d gone virtual from the start,” he said.Joseph Allen, who directs a program at the Harvard University School of Public Health focused on healthy buildings, said masking, contact tracing and quarantining are all important — but so is proper ventilation and air filtration, which Allen said too many districts are ignoring.Small, inexpensive steps like opening windows, equipping classrooms with box fans and portable air purifiers, and holding classes outside can make a big difference in keeping the virus at bay, even if an infected student or teacher shows up, Allen said.“We need to get a bit more creative with schools,” he said. “If we don’t do those upfront things, we’re going to have cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/schools-face-big-coronavirus-test-as-students-return-to-classroom/story-EaSNmpgkm0f5kzVIeZk8rI.html

The risk to safety was low and test results from Randox kits were not affected, it said.Up to 741,000 unused Randox kits are estimated to be in the system, either at warehouses, at care homes or at private homes. The ministry gave instructions on how to return them.Randox said the recall was a “regulatory measure” that applied only to sample collection kits within the NHS programme. Private customers or kits were not affected, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-orders-recall-of-741-000-coronavirus-testing-kits-over-safety-concerns/story-f1gSL62SXtRxi7gYzF8NqL.html
08-08-2020||World||US President Trump among world leaders to take part in Lebanon Aid Conference||Global leaders including US President Donald Trump will participate in an international aid conference on Sunday to support Lebanon, as the country, crippled by corruption, a banking crisis and growing popular defiance against the authorities, is seeking massive relief after blasts in Beirut.The video-conference will be co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and the United Nations. Macron said he would make sure any aid goes directly to the Lebanese people and not into “corrupt hands,” during a visit to Beirut on Thursday.Several allies of Lebanon have offered support since Tuesday’s explosions in the port of Beirut that left over 150 people dead, many missing, more than 5,000 injured and close to 300,000 people homeless as the blast partially destroyed the city. Authorities said the biggest explosions in Beirut’s history caused an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion worth of damage.Gulf states, European nations and the US have sent mobile clinics, food and medicine to the country. European Council President Charles Michel was in Beirut on Saturday and promised support.The chief of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, pledged to mobilize regional efforts to provide support. Turkey said it is ready to help rebuild the port, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, citing Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay during a visit to Lebanon on Saturday.Also read: Wife of Dutch envoy to Lebanon dies after being hurt in Beirut blastThe country, which is almost entirely reliant on imports of fuel, food and material, may use Turkey’s Port of Mersin, on the Mediterranean, until the Port of Beirut is rebuilt and Ankara is ready to also help reconstruct the buildings nearby and send medical assistance and food aid, the agency said on Twitter.Promises of relief come as the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah rejected rumors that the militant group had stashed weapons at Beirut’s port before this week’s devastating explosions. Officials have blamed the accident on a vast store of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, unloaded from a ship in 2014 and kept at the port despite repeated safety warnings.“We don’t have anything at the port, not weapons, missiles or ammunition or nitrate or anything else at all. Not now, not in the past or the future,” Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech.Lebanon’s president Michel Aoun said on Friday an investigation would examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference. “The cause has not been determined yet. There is a possibility of external interference through a rocket or bomb or other act,” Aoun said.To protest the current government supported by Hezbollah, the Kataeb party -- a Christian group that opposes the ruling majority -- announced the resignation of its members from the parliament on Saturday, Lebanon-based MTV channel said on Twitter. The general secretary of the party, Nizar Najarian, was killed in the explosion. He was chairing a meeting for the party at its headquarters near the site of the blast. Marwan Hamade, from the party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, and independent lawmaker Paula Yacoubian also announced their resignations.A Shattered Beirut Leaves Lebanese Asking If They Have a FutureLebanon has arrested 20 people, including port and customs officials, and placed everyone who had an official role at the port since 2014 under house arrest. A team of French explosive experts arrived in Beirut Thursday to help with the investigation that’s being led by the Lebanese army and police intelligence.The explosion came as Lebanon is reeling under its worst financial meltdown in decades and the government’s inability to implement reforms and tackle corruption as demanded by the international community.The administration is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a $10 billion loan program, but those negotiations had stalled over internal disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-to-hold-lebanon-aid-conference-on-sunday/story-NsSHTHHirCyHdghtRw9WpI.html

08-08-2020||World||‘Can’t afford to rebuild’: Furious Lebanese count their losses from blast, plan demonstration||As Beirut mourns its dead and grapples with the scale of rebuilding after this week’s massive blast, some Lebanese activists planned to demonstrate in the city on Saturday, angered by the government’s response to the disaster.Tuesday’s port explosion, the biggest in Beirut’s history, killed 154 people, injured 5,000 and destroyed a swathe of the city. Some residents, struggling to clean up shattered homes, complain the state they see as corrupt - there had been months of protests against the government’s handling of a deep economic crisis before this week’s disaster - has let them down again. The demonstration was planned for Saturday afternoon.“The people are doing your work, shame,” someone wrote on the dust covering a car window, referring to Lebanese leaders.The prime minister and presidency have said 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is used in making fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years without safety measures at the port warehouse.President Michel Aoun said on Friday an investigation would also examine whether it was caused by a bomb or other external interference. Aoun said the investigation would also weigh if the blast was due to negligence or an accident. Twenty people had been detained so far, he added.‘WE CAN’T AFFORD TO REBUILD’Some residents wondered how they would ever rebuild their lives.Tearing up, Bilal Hassan used his bare hands to try to remove debris from his home located a few hundred metres from where the port blast hit. He has been sleeping on a dusty couch besides pieces of splintered glass.When his three wounded teenage children ran for their lives they left blood stains on the staircase and walls.“There is really nothing we can do. We can’t afford to rebuild and no one is helping us,” he said, standing beside a large teddy bear that was blown across his home, and a damaged photograph of him and his wife.Bulldozers ploughed through the wreckage of mangled homes and long rows of flattened cars as soldiers stood by. Volunteers with shovels streamed through streets.Danielle Chemaly said her charity organisation, whose headquarters was destroyed, had provided assistance to 70 families who were left homeless by the explosion.“We have given people initial help but we don’t know what we can do for families in the future. It requires major projects,” she said. Officials have said the blast could have caused losses amounting to $15 billion. That is a bill that Lebanon cannot pay after already defaulting on a mountain of debt - exceeding 150% of economic output - and with talks stalled on a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund.AID FROM ABROADFrance and other countries have rushed emergency aid to Lebanon, including doctors, and tons of health equipment and food. The blast destroyed Lebanon’s only major grain silo and U.N. agencies are helping provide emergency food and medical aid. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would join a conference call with Lebanon’s president and other world leaders on Sunday to discuss aid to the country.For ordinary Lebanese, the scale of destruction is overwhelming.“It felt like a mini atomic bomb,” said George Rohana, sitting beside a supermarket that was demolished. A few onions were left in the debris of the blast that tore a huge hole through the shop into an adjacent apartment.“Now we have a situation where people are stealing metals and other items from the destruction,” said Rohana. “The other day someone walked away with a broken toaster.”  (Reporting by Michael Georgy; Editing by Frances Kerry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-t-afford-to-rebuild-furious-lebanese-count-their-losses-from-blast-plan-demonstration/story-TZjN5kQFP2hIX9WlbDFSFM.html

But his stand was mirrored by that of deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who made the same point in a statement released by her office. “”Canadian aluminum does not undermine US national security. Canadian aluminum strengthens US national security and has done so for decades through unparalleled co-operation between our two countries,” she addedThe tariff war between the neighbouring nations comes as a repeat of events of 2018 when Canada had retaliated by imposing $ 16.6 billion worth of tariffs on American products entering the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-impose-dollar-for-dollar-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods/story-dsGnHQphT3hDiDZ8W3erBO.html
08-08-2020||World||Turkmenistan to let WHO conduct independent coronavirus sampling||The World Health Organization has secured permission to conduct independent sampling in officially coronavirus-free Turkmenistan, after expressing “serious concern” over rising pneumonia cases there, a WHO official said. A Saturday state television report showing a teleconference involving Turkmenistan’s leader Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov and WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made no mention of WHO concern over pneumonia cases or Berdymukhamedov’s pledge over sampling. But Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director, said the United Nations health body had “expressed serious concern about (a rise) in #COVID19 negative pneumonia” in Turkmenistan during the Friday call with Berdymukhamedov that he also participated in. The WHO “urged for a @WHO team to sample independently #COVID19 tests in-country & take to @WHO reference labs. President agreed,” Kluge tweeted on Friday, without offering further details. A WHO mission visited the secretive gas-rich Central Asian state last month and advised the country to adopt measures including contact tracing “as if Covid-19 were already circulating” but stopped short of saying that it thought the government was covering up coronavirus cases.Turkmenistan has since implemented a nationwide lockdown and warned citizens to wear masks, citing “dust” and “pathogens” carried by wind, rather than the virus. State television said Berdymukhamedov had raised the issue of a “pneumonia of unknown etymology, which is rapidly spreading in our (Central Asian) region” in the call with the WHO, without saying if the pneumonia had reached Turkmenistan. Berdymukhamedov even speculated that pneumonia cases in the region could be linked to a “new coronavirus.”“I am confident in the need to consolidate the efforts of states in the very near future to correctly diagnose this disease under the patronage of the World Health Organization,” Berdymukhamedov was reported as saying. Health is an important feature of state propaganda in ex-Soviet Turkmenistan, which has also claimed in the past to have zero cases of HIV/AIDS.All-powerful Berdymukhamedov, a 63-year-old former dentist and health minister, is regularly shown cycling and working out and has overseen a government clampdown on tobacco use.The country is regularly cited as among the most repressive in the world with no free press or independent institutions to check the power of Berdymukhamedov, who is known as the Arkadag, or “protector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkmenistan-to-let-who-conduct-independent-coronavirus-sampling/story-ZMNmbxvbHZEpGfQRWsWoTK.html
08-08-2020||World||Is France helping Lebanon, or trying to reconquer it?||It was almost as if Emmanuel Macron forgot that Lebanon is no longer a French protectorate.Visiting explosion-ravaged Beirut this week, France’s leader comforted distraught crowds, promised to rebuild the city and claimed that the blast pierced France’s own heart. “France will never let Lebanon go,” Macron said. “The heart of the French people still beats to the pulse of Beirut.”His critics denounced the overtures as a neocolonialist foray by a European leader seeking to restore sway over a troubled Middle Eastern land – and distract from mounting problems at home. A meme circulating online dubbed him Macron Bonaparte, a 21st century Emperor Napoleon.But Macron’s defenders — including desperate Beirut residents who called him “our only hope” — praised him for visiting gutted neighborhoods where Lebanese leaders fear to tread, and for trying to hold Lebanon’s politicians accountable for the corruption and mismanagement blamed for Tuesday’s deadly blast.Macron’s visit exposed France’s central challenge as it prepares to host an international donors conference for Lebanon on Sunday: how to help a country in crisis, where French economic ties run deep, without interfering in its internal affairs.“We are walking on the edge of a precipice. We have to aid, support and encourage the Lebanese people, but at the same time not give the impression that we want to establish a new protectorate, which would be completely stupid,” said Jack Lang, a former French government minister who now heads the Arab World Institute in Paris. “We must find new, intelligent solutions to aid the Lebanese.”France’s ties with Lebanon reach back at least to the 16th century, when the French monarchy negotiated with Ottoman rulers to protect Christians – and secure influence — in the region. By the time of the 1920-1946 French mandate, Lebanon already had a network of French schools and French speakers that survives to this day — along with France’s cozy relationships with Lebanon’s power brokers, including some accused of fueling its political and economic crisis.A surprising online petition emerged this week asking France to temporarily restore its mandate, saying Lebanon’s leaders have shown “total inability to secure and manage the country.”It’s widely seen as an absurd idea – Macron himself told Beirut residents Wednesday that “it’s up to you to write your history” – but 60,000 people have signed it, including members of France’s 250,000-strong Lebanese diaspora and people in Lebanon who said it’s a way to express their desperation and distrust of the political class.Aside from a show of much-needed international support, many in Lebanon viewed Macron’s visit as a way to secure financial assistance for a country wracked with debt.The French leader also managed to bring the divided political class together, if briefly. In a rare scene, the heads of Lebanon’s political factions — some of them still bitter enemies from the 1975-1990 civil war — appeared together at the Palais des Pins, the French embassy headquarters in Beirut, and filed out after meeting Macron.But to many, the visit was seen as patronizing. Some lashed out at the petition and those celebrating “France, the tender mother.”One writer, Samer Frangieh, said Macron gathered the politicians as “schoolchildren,” reprimanding them for failing to carry out their duties.There were other, more subtle jabs against France’s show of influence. While Macron was touring neighborhoods torn apart by the explosion, the health minister in the Hezbollah-backed government toured field hospitals donated by Iran and Russia, major power players in the region.“I get the people who want the mandate. They have no hope,” said Leah, an engineering student in Beirut who did not want her last name published out of concern for political repercussions. She spoke out strongly against the idea, and against those who see Macron as Lebanon’s “savior.”She said that risks worsening Lebanon’s divisions, as Maronite Christians and French-educated Muslims embrace Macron while others lean away. “He hasn’t resolved his issues with his country, with his people. How is he giving advice to us?” she asked.In Paris, Macron’s domestic political opponents from the far left to the far right warned the centrist leader against creeping neocolonialism, and extracting political concessions from Lebanon in exchange for aid. “Solidarity with Lebanon should be unconditional,” tweeted Julien Bayou, head of the popular Greens party.Macron himself firmly rejected the idea of reviving the French mandate.“You can’t ask me to substitute for your leaders. It’s not possible,” he said. “There is no French solution.”But he made a point of noting that he plans to return to Lebanon to verify that promised reforms are being undertaken on Sept. 1, the 100th anniversary of the declaration of Greater Lebanon – and the beginning of French rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-france-helping-lebanon-or-trying-to-reconquer-it/story-HPZ9lPb1LDzrf2kIkl46AN.html
08-08-2020||World||Beijing’s top Hong Kong office says US sanctions are ‘clowning actions’ and ‘ridiculous’||Beijing’s top representative office in Hong Kong said on Saturday that sanctions imposed by Washington on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials were “clowning actions” that would not frighten or intimidate Chinese people. The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Luo Huining, the head of China’s Liaison Office, as well as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other current and former officials that Washington accuses of curtailing political freedoms in the global financial hub. The move ratchets up already strained tensions between the United States and China, more than a month after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on Hong Kong that drew condemnation from Western governments and rights groups.“The unscrupulous intentions of the U.S. politicians to support the anti-China chaos in Hong Kong have been revealed, and their clowning actions are really ridiculous,” the Liaison Office said in a statement. “Intimidation and threats cannot frighten the Chinese people.” Luo, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, said US sanctions on him indicated he was doing what he “should be doing for my country and Hong Kong”, according to the statement. As well as Luo and Lam, the sanctions target Hong Kong police commissioner Chris Tang and his predecessor Stephen Lo; John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary of security, and Teresa Cheng, the justice secretary. Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, was also on the list. The sanctions freeze any US assets of the officials and generally bar Americans from doing business with them.The Treasury Department said Beijing’s imposition of “draconian” national security legislation had undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and set “the groundwork for censorship of any individuals or outlets that are deemed unfriendly to China.” Beijing imposed the law directly on Hong Kong just before midnight on June 30, circumventing the city’s legislature, and the city’s officials were not aware of the details of the law until it was implemented.Police chief Tang told local media on Saturday that maintaining the security of the country and Hong Kong was his responsibility and foreign sanctions were meaningless to him.The security legislation targets what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Some political analysts say the national security law coming directly from Beijing and bypassing Hong Kong’s legislature signals the start of a more authoritarian rule in the semi-autonomous city and a march toward mainland control.Critics fear the legislation will crush wide-ranging freedoms in Hong Kong denied to people in mainland China that are seen as key to its success as a global financial centre.Supporters of the law say it will bring stability after a year of sometimes violent anti-government protests that plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-s-top-hong-kong-office-says-us-sanctions-are-clowning-actions-and-ridiculous/story-1CjdG99XRw3x7r3HyMXJVP.html
08-08-2020||World||China-US ties plunge further over Hong Kong sanctions||China on Saturday slammed the United States for imposing “barbarous” sanctions in response to Beijing’s crackdown in Hong Kong, capping a dramatic week of deteriorating relations between the world’s two biggest economies.In the toughest US action on Hong Kong since China imposed a sweeping new security law on the territory, Washington on Friday sanctioned a group of Chinese and Hong Kong officials -- including the city’s leader Carrie Lam.The move came after President Donald Trump’s administration forced Chinese internet giants TikTok and WeChat to end all operations in the US, in a twin diplomatic-commercial offensive set to grow ahead of the US presidential election in November.China on Saturday criticised the sanctions as “barbarous and rude”.“The ill intentions of US politicians to support people who are anti-China and messing up Hong Kong have been clearly revealed,” Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong said in a statement.The Treasury Department announced it was freezing the US assets of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other senior officials, including Luo Huining -- the head of the Liaison Office.It accused the sanctioned individuals of being “directly responsible for implementing Beijing’s policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes”.The move criminalises any US financial transactions with the sanctioned officials.In a short statement, Luo said he welcomed the blacklisting.“I have done what I should do for the country and for Hong Kong,” he said.“I don’t have a dime’s worth in foreign assets.”TENSIONS SPIKE AHEAD OF ELECTIONBeijing’s security law was imposed in late June, following last year’s huge pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, sending a political chill through the semi-autonomous city.Since then, authorities have postponed elections, citing the coronavirus pandemic, issued arrest warrants for six exiled pro-democracy activists and launched a crackdown on other activists.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the security law violated promises made by China ahead of Hong Kong’s 1997 handover that the city could keep key freedoms and autonomy for 50 years.“Today’s actions send a clear message that the Hong Kong authorities’ actions are unacceptable,” Pompeo said in a statement.The US measures come three months ahead of the November election in which Trump, who is behind his rival Joe Biden, is campaigning hard on an increasingly strident anti-Beijing message.As public disapproval has grown for his handling of the pandemic, Trump has pivoted from his previous focus on striking a trade deal with China to blaming the country for the coronavirus crisis.TIK TOK, WECHAT BANSOn Thursday, Trump made good on previous threats against WeChat and TikTok -- two Chinese-owned apps with major audiences that US officials say pose a national security threat.In an executive order, Trump gave Americans 45 days to stop doing business with the platforms, effectively setting a deadline for a potential, under-pressure sale of TikTok to Microsoft.The move also threw into doubt the American operations of WeChat’s parent firm, Tencent, a powerful player in the video game industry and one of the world’s richest companies.China condemned the move as “arbitrary political manipulation”.The new restrictions sent Tencent shares tanking as much as 10 percent at one point in Hong Kong trade on Friday, wiping almost $50 billion off its market capitalisation.Trump’s order claimed TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.TikTok has repeatedly denied sharing data with Beijing.WeChat is a messaging, social media and electronic payment platform and is reported to have more than a billion users, with many preferring it to email.The latest US actions follow a protracted battle over Huawei, the Chinese network and smartphone giant accused by the Trump administration of being a tool for espionage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-ties-plunge-further-over-hong-kong-sanctions/story-g2FFlgapLDeppKIeWiSeUI.html
08-08-2020||World||US court will rehear Epstein victims’ claims over plea deal||A federal appeals court has decided to reconsider claims that Florida federal prosecutors violated the rights of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse victims by not informing them about a secret plea deal.The Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a previous panel’s 2-1 decision rejecting an effort to undo an agreement federal prosecutors made with Epstein more than a decade ago. Instead of facing stiff federal charges, Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to lesser state crimes and served a relatively short jail sentence.Some of the victims have long claimed the Miami US attorney’s office violated their rights by not informing them of the plea deal. This decision by the appeals court will allow their argument to be heard by the full court.“I had confidence this day would come,” one of the victims, Courtney Wild, said in a statement on Friday. “We have fought for 12 years, and as I’ve said before, no matter how many obstacles pile up, we will never give up fighting for what is right.” Epstein, a wealthy financial adviser, died at age 66 last year in a New York jail after he was indicted on multiple charges related to the sexual abuse of dozens of underage girls over many years. His longtime friend and cohort, Ghislaine Maxwell, is now facing charges related to the same series of events and is jailed in New York.In the earlier ruling by the 11th Circuit three-judge panel, the judges found that because prosecutors never brought charges against Epstein in Florida, the victims were not entitled to any relief under the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act. They are seeking to overturn Epstein’s plea deal, which could expose others who were involved to prosecution.An attorney for the victims, University of Utah professor Paul Cassell, said in an email that the decision will provide a chance for them to possibly undo the Florida plea deal.“This is an important ruling for crime victims, not just for Epstein’s victims but all victims of federal crimes. We look forward to arguing before the full 11th Circuit that (the) ‘secret’ plea deal violate the Crime Victims’ Rights Act and that this particular deal should be rescinded,” Cassell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-will-rehear-epstein-victims-claims-over-plea-deal/story-eB7Zt3woMuHgWCUg1F2tAP.html
08-08-2020||World||US counterspy chief warns Russia, China, Iran trying to meddle in 2020 election||The top US counterintelligence official on Friday warned that Russia, China and Iran will all try to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, with Russia already trying to undercut Democratic candidate Joe Biden.In an unusual public statement, William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the three countries were using online disinformation and other means to try to influence voters, stir up disorder and undermine American voters’ confidence in the democratic process.President Donald Trump, asked at a news conference in New Jersey how he would respond to interference in the November 3 vote, said: “We’re going to watch all of them, we have to be very careful.”He added that he believed Russia, China and Iran all wanted him to lose the election.Foreign adversaries also may try to interfere with US election systems by trying to sabotage the voting process, stealing election data, or calling into question the validity of election results.“It would be difficult for our adversaries to interfere with or manipulate voting results at scale,” Evanina said.Trump repeated his refrain that the biggest risk to the integrity of the election was mail-in ballots. “It’s much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in, it’s much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots,” he said, referring to foreign countries.Trump has been attacking the idea of voting by mail ever since a resurgence in coronavirus infections made it less likely that people will want to vote in person in November, saying despite research to the contrary that mail-in voting is vulnerable to fraud.Multiple reviews by US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia acted to boost Trump’s 2016 campaign and undercut his rival Hillary Clinton’s chances in that election. Trump has long bristled at that finding, which Russia denies.Evanina warned on Friday that Russia is already going after former vice president Biden and what it regards as an anti-Russia US “establishment.”In a statement, the Biden campaign said Trump “publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections.”Evanina said Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician, has been “spreading claims about corruption - including through publicized leaked phone calls” to undermine Biden’s campaign and the Democratic Party. Trump supporters in the US Senate have launched investigations questioning Biden’s son Hunter’s involvement in alleged business activities in Ukraine.Evanina said “Kremlin-linked actors” also are trying to “boost President Trump’s candidacy via social media and Russian television.” He said his agency assessed that China would prefer that Trump not win re-election, because Beijing regards him as too unpredictable. He said China has been expanding efforts to influence US politics ahead of the election to try to shape US policy, exert pressure on US politicians it regards as anti-China, and deflect criticism of China.Evanina said Iran is likely to use online tactics such as spreading disinformation to discredit US institutions and President Trump and to stir up US voters’ discontent. The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Mark Warner, thanked Evanina for his warning in a statement and added that all Americans “should endeavour to prevent outside actors from being able to interfere in our elections, influence our politics, and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.”Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s re-election campaign, insisted that Trump has been “tougher on Russia than any administration in history.” “We don’t need or want foreign interference, and President Trump will beat Joe Biden fair and square,” Murtaugh added.Many officials who oversee US election technology and outside security experts now worry less about hacking in the elections than about misinformation and logistics such as a shortage of poll workers and slowdowns at the US postal service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-counterspy-chief-warns-russia-china-iran-trying-to-meddle-in-2020-election/story-OFiHvB7dJjP5wZOKib23nO.html
08-08-2020||World||Study finds asymptomatic Covid-19 patients spread virus similar to symptomatic ones||A South Korean study, published in medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine, has found that asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 spread the virus similar to the symptomatic patients. The study suggests that asymptomatic people who are infected with the coronavirus carry similar levels of the pathogen in their nose, throat and lungs as those with symptoms. The study was carried out by a team of researchers from Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in South Korea. The experts analysed swabs taken from over 300 patients between March 6 and 26. Of the total, 193 patients were symptomatic while 110 were asymptomatic.Also read: California processing Covid-19 backlog of up to 300,000 lab recordsAccording to the experts, it was found that many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic for a prolonged period. The study, therefore, calls for all infected persons to be isolated regardless of symptoms to contain the spread of the contagion.The study is also among the first few to distinguish between pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients with the asymptomatic ones. Previously, it was found that an estimated 30 percent of Covid-19 patients never develop symptoms. Asymptomatic patients, however, were reported to test negative for the virus sooner when compared to patients with symptoms.  The authors said their findings “offer biological plausibility” to reports of asymptomatic transmission, adding that the analysis only looked at the amount of viral genetic material present. The team did not attempt to follow the subjects to see if that translated to the spread of the infectious virus.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-asymptomatic-covid-19-patients-spread-virus-similar-to-symptomatic-ones/story-PVWvjjynwCcHCADTmdJ0aL.html
08-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says he’ll order unemployment payments if impasse persists||President Donald Trump said that if he can’t reach agreement with Democrats over stimulus legislation, he’s prepared to sign executive actions to provide expanded unemployment benefits, a temporary payroll tax deferral, eviction protection and student-loan relief.“If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get the American people the relief they need,” Trump said Friday at a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.The president blamed top Democrats -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- for failing to agree to a deal, and said they’re trying to influence the outcome of November’s election.Trump’s announcement signalled that he was giving negotiators more time in negotiations with Democrats over another coronavirus relief package, with the two sides trillions of dollars apart on overall spending and on key issues, including on aid to state governments and the amount of supplementary unemployment benefits.To act on his own, the president is relying on an expansive and controversial reading of executive power that likely will face legal challenges. Trump told reporters that he’s not concerned about getting sued.Pressure DemocratsTrump’s advisers say executive action could pressure Democrats to reduce their demands and allow him to argue to voters that he’s looking out for their well-being amid congressional inaction.Two people familiar with the matter said Trump would extend the supplemental unemployment insurance at a $400-per-week level, a reduction from the $600 in the last stimulus bill. It wasn’t clear what mechanism he would use to fund the extension or how long it would be in place.Trump said his payroll tax order would eliminate the levy until the end of the year and it would be retroactive to July 1st.Trump told reporters the orders could be completed “by the end of the week. They’re being drawn by the lawyers right now.”Pelosi and Schumer said they again offered to cut $1 trillion from the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion proposal if Republicans would raise the top-line number of their plan by $1 trillion.“We are willing to make compromises,” Schumer said at a news conference before going into the Friday session. “The speaker made a very fair offer.”Demanding ConcessionsAfter the talks ended Friday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would recommend to the president that he sign the executive orders.The White House has demanded concessions from Democrats on unemployment insurance and aid to state and local governments, and that will be key to any further talks, Mnuchin said. The state aid has been a particular sticking point with Trump, which he opposes and emphasized in a tweet Friday.Pelosi said Friday Democrats still demand $915 billion while Republicans are only offering $150 billion. Mnuchin said remains to some aid related to Covid-19 and to help firefighters and police.There also are differences on the Democrats’ demand to extend the $600 a week supplemental unemployment bonus that has expired, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s insistence on a temporary liability shield for companies, schools and other organizations.One of the biggest hurdles is disagreement on the overall size of the package. Schumer said a majority of Democrats won’t vote for a package of less than $2 trillion. The party controls the House and their votes would be needed to get any legislation through the Republican-led Senate, given internal GOP divisions.Republican StanceSenate Republicans wouldn’t be able to back any deal of $2 trillion or more, given that as much as $1 trillion of the March stimulus package remains unspent, according to a GOP aide in that chamber. Schumer pointed out that some of Republican senators would be unlikely to support a bill regardless of size.Friday’s talks took place after Labor Department reported a 1.76 million jump in payrolls in July, beating most estimates. The unemployment rate fell to 10.2%, still higher than at the peak of the Great Recession in 2009. And higher-frequency data are turning more negative, as businesses use up the last of their federal loans and reduced jobless benefits pressure consumer spending.Democrats had criticized the president when he had threatened the idea of executive orders during negotiations.“An executive order will leave millions of people out,” Schumer said Thursday. “It will be litigated. It won’t be effective and things will get worse. So we urge them to rethink their position.”On the payroll levy, because the president alone can’t cut taxes, Trump would be simply delaying the due date for the tax, which is paid jointly by employers and employees and goes to fund Social Security and Medicare.The administration might hope that employers will stop withholding the money from Americans’ paychecks, with voters in turn pressuring Congress to eventually pass legislation forgiving the accumulated amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-ll-order-unemployment-payments-if-impasse-persists/story-S3qjpz6uP2XhQT3P26CPNK.html
08-08-2020||World||California processing Covid-19 backlog of up to 300,000 lab records||California officials have identified two data glitches that caused the state to undercount new coronavirus cases for more than a week, leaving a backlog of as many as 300,000 lab records to process.The held-up test results will probably be worked through in one to two days, Mark Ghaly, California’s Health and Human Services secretary, said in a briefing Friday. The data reporting issues, first disclosed on Tuesday, have left public health officials unable to trust numbers showing cases slowing in the state with the most US infections.Two overlapping issues created the problem, Ghaly said. On July 25, a server outage in the state’s centralized reporting system prompted workers to install a temporary patch that, over days, interfered with the proper flow of lab records. Then, on the 31st, the system stopped receiving records from one of the largest commercial labs in the state’s testing program, Quest Diagnostics, after a certificate that needs to be renewed every two years expired.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayBoth problems have since been fixed, Ghaly said. But state officials are now building a new system to track disease data, since the old one, known as CalREDIE, wasn’t designed to handle this many records.There are 250,000 to 300,000 lab records that are left to process, and the exact effect on California’s coronavirus case counts isn’t yet known, Ghaly said. The state’s 14-day average rate of positive tests -- which may be affected by the backlog -- is at 6.1%. Some of the jammed-up records will be duplicates, while others will be for other infectious diseases tracked by the same systems.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage California has more than 538,000 confirmed virus cases, and on Friday became the third US state to exceed 10,000 deaths from Covid-19. Earlier this week, before the data glitches came to light, Governor Gavin Newsom said slowing new case counts offered “encouraging” signs the state may have turned a corner in its outbreak.Ghaly said that after checking with hospitals around the state, he believes accurate data won’t change the underlying trend of improvement. New case counts, he said, appear to be stabilizing and trending down after July’s spike. The state’s data show hospitalizations, unaffected by the reporting issues, have fallen 17% from a peak.“We do feel confident in the trends,” Ghaly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-processing-covid-19-backlog-of-up-to-300-000-lab-records/story-SltBz056TdVTRwBvaIjoMN.html
08-08-2020||World||US officials: Russia vs Joe Biden, China vs Donald Trump pre-election||US intelligence officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the November election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting President Donald Trump’s re-election bid, the country’s counter intelligence chief said Friday in the most specific warning to date about the threat of foreign interference.US officials also believe that China does not want Trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the White House, expanding its efforts to shape public policy in America and to pressure political figures seen as opposed to Beijing’s interests.The statement from William Evanina is believed to be the most pointed declaration by the US intelligence community linking the Kremlin to efforts to get Trump re-elected — a sensitive subject for a president who has rejected intelligence agency assessments that Russia tried to help him in 2016.It also links Moscow’s disapproval of Biden to his role in shaping Obama administration policies supporting Ukraine, an important US ally, and opposing Russian leader Vladimir Putin. That assertion conflicts with the narrative advanced by Trump, who has made unsubstantiated claims that Biden’s actions in Ukraine were intended to help the business interests of his son, Hunter.Evanina’s statement, three months before the election, comes amid criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats that the intelligence community has been withholding from the public specific intelligence information about the threat of foreign interference in American politics.The latest intelligence assessment reflects concerns not only about Russia but China and Iran as well, warning that hostile foreign actors may seek to compromise election infrastructure, interfere with the voting process or call into question voting results. Despite those efforts, officials see it as unlikely that anyone could manipulate voting results in any meaningful way, Evanina said.“Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer,” said Evanina, director of the National Counter intelligence Security Center. “We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia and Iran.”Concerns about election interference are especially acute following a wide-ranging effort by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf through both the hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord among US voters. Trump has routinely resisted the idea that the Kremlin favoured him in 2016, but the intelligence assessment released Friday indicates that unnamed Kremlin-linked actors are again working to boost his candidacy on social media and Russian television.The White House responded to Friday’s news with a statement saying “the United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our electoral processes and will respond to malicious foreign threats that target our democratic institutions.”“The United States is working to identify and disrupt foreign influence efforts targeting our political system, including efforts designed to suppress voter turnout or undermine public confidence in the integrity of our elections,” said the statement from National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot.In a separate statement, the Trump campaign said it didn’t want or need foreign assistance and said China and Iran were opposed to Trump because “he has held them accountable after years of coddling by politicians like Joe Biden.”Democrats in Congress who have participated in recent classified briefings on the election interference threat have expressed alarm at what they have heard. They have urged the US intelligence community to make public some of their concerns, in part to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Obama administration officials were seen as slow and overly deliberate in their public discussion of active Russian measures in that year’s election.A bipartisan congressional report released by the Senate intelligence committee earlier this year said the Obama administration was ill-prepared to handle the interference and failed to respond effectively as officials feared getting caught up in a heavily politicized environment and undermining the election.When it comes to Russia this year, US intelligence officials assess that it is working to “denigrate” Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia “establishment” among his supporters, Evanina said. US officials believe that tracks Moscow’s criticism of Biden when he was vice president for his role in Ukraine policies and his support of opposition to Putin inside Russia.The US statement called out by name Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian lawmaker who has been active in leveling unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden and his son concerning Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat. That effort has included publicizing leaked phone calls.Democrats, including members of the Senate intelligence panel, have voiced concerns that an ongoing Republican probe into Hunter Biden and his work in Ukraine would parallel Russian efforts and amplify Russian disinformation. That investigation is being led by Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee. He has denied any wrongdoing.Though US officials allege that China has its own preference, the statement Friday did not directly accuse Beijing of election interference or taking action to prop up Biden.Instead, the statement said, China views Trump as “unpredictable” and does not want to see him win reelection, Evanina said. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of the November election in an effort to shape US policy and pressure political figures it sees as against Beijing. The Trump administration’s relationship with China has taken a starkly more adversarial tone, including the closure last month of Beijing’s consulate in Houston and an executive order Thursday that banned dealings with the Chinese owners of consumer apps TikTok and WeChat,“Although China will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action, its public rhetoric over the past few months has grown increasingly critical of the current administration’s Covid-19 response, closure of China’s Houston consulate and actions on other issues,” he wrote.On Iran, the assessment said Tehran seeks to undermine US democratic institutions as well as Trump and divide America before the election.“Iran’s efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content,” Evanina wrote. “Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s re-election would result in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-russia-vs-joe-biden-china-vs-donald-trump-pre-election/story-hgtEgf3BLenqoNAMqaBjmO.html
08-08-2020||World||Prachanda’s security guards test Covid positive, PM Oli gets more time||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli appeared to have bought some time, sealing the locality that is home to his prime rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ after six guards on his security detail tested positive to the coronavirus disease.The precautionary measure helps PM Oli avoid any meeting with Prachanda who has lately, amped up his attacks on the prime minister and this week told party workers to prepare for the worst. It was a message that Dahal had conveyed to PM Oli’s emissary, the Nepal Communist Party’s deputy leader in parliament Subas Nembang, also on Thursday.That is before authorities sealed off parts of Khumaltar, the neighbourhood outside the capital city that Dahal shifted to in 2017 when he couldn’t find a house in Kathmandu with enough parking space for his security entourage. Six security guards deployed to protect Dahal had tested positive. In a Facebook post, Dahal’s daughter Ganga, who assists her father, said everyone else in the family and the secretariat had tested negative. The order to seal off the area around the Dahal residence came soon.Kathmandu watchers say the Covid order issued by the Oli government offers a reprieve to the prime minister who has been at his wits’ end trying to bunk party meetings. Last month-end, the NCP’s standing committee had gone ahead to hold its meeting without PM Oli after the prime minister postponed it once again.Dahal, who had been negotiating a way out to end the deadlock with PM Oli, last month reversed his stand after reports that the Oli camp may have quietly registered his old party - CPN-UML - with the Himalayan nation’s election commission. The ruling Nepal Communist Party was formed in 2018 with the merger of PM Oli’s CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Dahal faction’s CPN (Maoist Centre).The Dahal faction suspects that PM Oli was preparing to break up the NCP at a time of his choosing. That the wily Oli had no plans to strike a compromise with detractors who want him to give one of his two positions - PM or the NCP’ co-chairman - became clear this week when during a visit home, he declared that “there was no question of resigning in the middle of the journey”.Dahal responded the next day, Wednesday, with a long statement to a select group of journalists, asking party cadres to prepare for the “worst”. At the briefing that he addressed jointly with three senior party leaders Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal and party spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Dahal said: “Our main concern is not about gaining power, what we want is to follow the proper procedure while running the NCP. We are not focusing on gaining any position, but our fight is against the wrong trend developing in the party”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prachanda-s-security-guards-test-covid-positive-pm-oli-gets-more-time/story-bhdzIlanwwF83fdh4SkCmM.html

The state department said in the updated advisory, “Do not travel to India due to COVID-19.”The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which guided the state department revision, said on its own updated travel webpage Americans should avoid “all non-essential travel” to India as the risk of contracting Covid-19 is “high” and, it added, most significantly “if you get sick in India and need medical care, resources may be limited.” Also read| Covid-19: Tracing India’s journey to two million casesIn an interactive cartographic representation of its assessment on the pandemic, the CDC framed its India warning a little differently: “If you get sick in India and need medical care, healthcare resources may be overwhelmed.”But this advisory can change. “CDC continues to monitor every country in the world, and as they identify that a country is either improving or that a country may be going in the other direction, they will let us know and we will, in turn, make the adjustment,” Karin King, deputy assistant secretary for overseas citizen services, told reporters at a news briefing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Of the more than 19 million Covid-19 infections worldwide, nearly a fifth — close to 4.9 million — are in the United States, followed by Brazil with 2.9 and India with 1.9 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

08-08-2020||World||Mike Pompeo rejects Congress’ subpoenas for IG, Biden probe info||Secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Friday rejected congressional subpoenas issued for him and for the State Department to provide information and testimony to lawmakers about two politically charged developments. The refusals set the stage for an escalation in the confrontation between the State Department and the Democratic-controlled House ahead of November’s elections.In letters sent to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Pompeo and the State Department’s acting legislative affairs chief said they had no intention of complying with the subpoenas. They said the subpoenas were politically motivated, without merit, and unnecessary as the information and testimony could be otherwise obtained. The letters were obtained by The Associated Press shortly after they were sent to Capitol Hill.While congressional subpoenas are legally binding, the Trump administration through various Cabinet agencies has repeatedly refused to comply with House demands with little consequence. There was no immediate response to the letters from the committee, although the panel later announced it was seeking testimony from another official in an unrelated matter.In one letter, Pompeo said committee chairman, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, was out of line in issuing the subpoenas, which he said were “outrageous” and ignored the State Department’s good faith efforts to answer questions about the firing of the department’s inspector general and the provision of Ukraine-related documents to Republican-controlled Senate committees.Engel had issued the subpoenas on July 31 and Aug. 3, complaining that Pompeo and the State Department were “stonewalling” repeated requests for information on both matters.The first subpoena demanded that the State Department turn over to Engel’s committee copies of thousands of pages of documents he said the department had given to the Senate regarding former Vice President Joe Biden as well as his son, Hunter, for his work for a gas company in Ukraine while his father was vice president.It also asked for internal department emails about responding to Congress. It said Pompeo had delivered more than 16,000 pages of records to the Senate but refused to send the same materials to the Democrat-led House.In response, the State Department’s acting head of legislative affairs, Ryan Kaldahl, said the agency was not obliged to provide the documents to any committee not conducting its own investigation into the matter. He suggested that Engel’s committee seek copies from its Senate counterparts.Kaldahl also said the committee had not shown that its demand was for a legitimate legislative purpose and suggested that it was entirely partisan. “The department is unable to consider whether any accommodation is possible in response to the committee’s requests unless the committee explains in detail its legislative purpose,” he wrote.The second subpoena demanded the testimony of four senior State Department officials about the firing in May of department Inspector General Stephen Linick, which Democrats have alleged came in retaliation for probes the watchdog was conducting into Pompeo. Pompeo has denied knowledge of any investigation into his own conduct.In rejecting that subpoena, Pompeo said in a letter to Engel that most of the officials in question, including the Under Secretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao and others, were prepared to be interviewed voluntarily and repeated that offer.“Mr. Bulatao and the other requested witnesses will appear and unambiguously refute your baseless accusations and provide full transparency before the elected representatives of the American people,” Pompeo wrote.“Furthermore, let me express how outrageous it is for you to suggest that the depart,ent is ‘stonewalling’ any investigation into the president’s replacing of Steve Linick,” he wrote, citing at least four offers for Bulatao and others to appear before the committee.Congressional aides have said those offers were unacceptable because they were contingent on dropping other avenues of inquiry.Shortly after the letters were sent, Engel announced he was seeking testimony in an unrelated matter from the US ambassador to Britain, Robert “Woody” Johnson on Sept. 30. Johnson is alleged to have tried to weigh in with British officials to move the British Open golf tournament to one of Trump’s resorts and also is accused of inappropriate racist and sexist behaviour.This is not the first time Pompeo has rebuffed a House subpoena. He did not comply with a subpoena to provide documents during the House’s impeachment inquiry into Trump last year, and several other Trump administration officials refused to testify in that probe.The administration’s record of complying with subpoenas is poor and has left congressional Democrats flustered with little recourse except in the courts.The House Judiciary Committee sued former White House Counsel Donald McGahn for his refusal to testify about former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report in April 2019, and that case has been tied up in courts. On Friday, an appeals court said that the committee can make the claim in court, reversing an earlier court decision.While the decision was good news for the committee, the matter won’t be resolved any time soon. One of the dissenting judges in that case noted that the House session ends Jan. 3, and “the chances that the committee hears McGahn’s testimony anytime soon are vanishingly slim.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-rejects-congress-subpoenas-for-ig-biden-probe-info/story-cMmjSAsWMUUO5FiYrWHVQI.html
