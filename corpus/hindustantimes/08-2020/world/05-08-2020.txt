Colombia now has the ninth-highest total of Covid-19 infections worldwide, prompting President Iván Duque to prolong the quarantine again until late August.The effects of the long isolation are beginning to surface: In the capital of Bogota, the mayor’s office reports that suicide attempts are up 21% since the start of quarantine. Psychologists have seen a dramatic rise in new patients complaining of anxiety and depression. Divorce lawyers say they are getting more inquiries, although clients also discover they cannot afford to separate.“From one moment to the next, my life changed,” said Myriam Roncancio, 35, who is living with her parents after breaking up with her husband. “A 180-degree turn.”Health experts say Colombia and a handful of other places in Latin America with especially long lockdowns have been moderately successful in using the time to slow infections, boost testing and expand ICU capacity. But they also worry about quarantine fatigue just as cases reach their peak, and they say more should be done to stress commonsense protections.“I’m worried about middle- to low-income countries where it seems quarantine is the main strategy,” says Andrés Vecino, a health economist at John Hopkins University. “And that creates a problem because in the medium term, it gets exhausted.”The long lockdown is essentially a result of timing: Colombia and much of South America imposed the strict measures when they had far fewer cases than Europe. Quarantines in Europe have steadily been lifted as confirmed cases have dropped, although some countries in Africa are still locked down.But in Latin America -– now an epicenter in the pandemic -– reports of infections are continuing to climb.“We wanted to go at the same velocity as Europe,” said Carlos Alvarez, a clinical trial coordinator for the World Health Organization in Colombia. “But the moment of the pandemic was different.”A map by researchers at the University of Oxford tracking government response measures shows much of the world in an accordion-like dance of opening and closing to various degrees, while a considerable part of South America remains stuck.“It’s not the only region -– but it is more true in Latin America than many other parts of the world, I’d say,” said Thomas Hale, a professor spearheading the project.Outside the region, a few other parts of the world remain continuously confined.In Africa, where cases are rising, several countries have imposed strict measures. South Africa, with more than 500,000 cases, has banned the sale of alcohol and cigarettes, closed bars and imposed a nighttime curfew. Masks are mandatory in public areas, with fines imposed on those who ignore the regulation.To be sure, even Colombia’s nationwide “preventative obligatory isolation” was never as deep and strict as quarantines elsewhere. There are now 46 exceptions that allow people to leave home for various activities.Peru gave up on isolation measures after three months due to the severe economic cost and high number of informal workers flouting the quarantine. Others like Brazil and Mexico never closed entirely.But many Colombians like Nilva Rodriguez, 50, in Barranquilla, have scarcely left their homes. Only twice in four months has she been outside the house she shares with her elderly parents, brother, his pregnant wife and a teenage child.When she talks to relatives in Miami, she says they are stunned to learn that she cannot even go to a nearby beach because it remains closed.Her mother, accustomed to going to church each day, has grown depressed and complains that virtual Mass just isn’t the same. Her father sometimes gets irritable. Everyone has staked out a part of the house for themselves.“Every month has its drama, its situation,” she says.Calls to a Bogota hotline to report domestic violence have more than doubled since before quarantine. The mayor’s office has set up a mobile brigade operating around the clock to respond to mental health crises. A city phone service offering psychological support has gotten nearly 25,000 calls during the lockdown.Miguel Antonio Duarte, a psychologist in Bogota, said he has twice as many patients. They include men with anger-management issues and women looking to end relationships.“This context has allowed women to finally realize they are being mistreated,” he said.Conversely, the lockdown has also made it more difficult for many women to report domestic abuse and file for divorce, said lawyer Jimmy Jiménez.In Bogota, residents are allowed out for certain nonessential activities only on odd or even days of the week, depending on the last number of their national identification cards. Because many also work from home, that means little time to escape from an abusive spouse. Those seeking divorces quickly realize they can’t afford it, barely able to pay rent, utilities and food bills as a family unit.As a result, many strained couples stay together, sleeping in separate rooms.The escalating mental strain is happening in a country where many already feel anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress related to Colombia’s long civil conflict -– and where there is considerable stigma around psychological ailments.“This is a country with the traumas of war, drug trafficking, violence,” said Dr. Omar Cuéllar, the director of a private mental health clinic in Bogota. “It’s a hotbed in which very easily any new circumstance can make things that much worse.”Colombia has significantly increased virus testing and expanded ICU capacity by almost 40% since the outbreak began — advancements that officials say have allowed it to avoid a total collapse of the health care system.Yet experts like Dr. Luis Jorge Hernández, a public health professor at the University of the Andes, worry about the harmful side effects of asking people to stay inside so long, like lower vaccination rates and worsening cardiac disease in those already mostly sitting indoors.“The quarantine is causing a lot of damage,” he said.President Iván Duque says the country is moving toward more focused quarantines. Bogota is instituting stricter lockdowns in certain neighborhoods for two-week periods. The mayor also is requiring those who are obese or with certain chronic diseases to stay indoors.The Americas branch of the WHO put out a strict call last week for nations not to reopen until their cases are declining.For Roncancio, whose marriage of 10 years ended abruptly, life has been on hold.After she lost her job as a restaurant administrator at the start of the outbreak and her husband lost his as a baggage handler at Bogota’s airport, they were unable to pay their rent and their quarreling became more frequent. That’s when he left, she says.Now she shares a room with her two children in her parents’ apartment and gets out only twice a week to buy groceries.“It’s like a ghost town,” she said. “I can’t get used to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombia-s-long-covid-19-lockdown-fuels-anxiety-and-depression/story-IEs2WD8MXjrtM3nc7AUhNP.html

05-08-2020||World||Beirut reels from huge blast as death toll climbs to at least 135||Lebanese rescue teams pulled out bodies and hunted for missing in the wreckage of buildings on Wednesday as investigations blamed negligence for a massive warehouse explosion that sent a devastating blast wave across Beirut, killing at least 135.More than 5,000 people were injured in Tuesday’s explosion at Beirut port, Health Minister Hamad Hassan said, and up to 250,000 were left without homes fit to live in after shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland.Hassan said tens of people remained missing. Prime Minister Hassan Diab declared three days of mourning from Thursday.The death toll was expected to rise from the blast, which officials blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port. The explosion was the most powerful ever to rip through Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war that ended three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections. The blast rattled buildings on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about 100 miles (160 km) away.President Michel Aoun said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures, after it was seized.In an address to the nation during an emergency cabinet session, Aoun said: “No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city”.He said the government was “determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable.”An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on “inaction and negligence”, saying “nothing was done” by committees and judges involved in the matter to order the removal of hazardous material.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material since 2014 to be put under house arrest, ministerial sources told Reuters. The cabinet also announced a two-week state of emergency in Beirut.GRAPHIC: Blast rocks Lebanese port area https://graphics.reuters.com/LEBANON-SECURITY/BLAST/xklvydjjqpg/chart.png‘COLLAPSE OF LEBANON’Ordinary Lebanese, who have lost jobs and watched savings evaporate in Lebanon’s financial crisis, blamed politicians who have overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance.“This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class,” said Hassan Zaiter, 32, a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut.The health minister said the death toll had climbed to 135, as the search for victims continued after shockwaves from the blast hurled some of the victims into the sea.Relatives gathered at the cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour.The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed. Health officials said hospitals were struggling with the big influx of casualties and were running out of beds and equipment to attend to the injured and those in critical condition.Beirut’s Clemenceau Medical Center was “like a slaughterhouse, blood covering the corridors and the lifts,” said Sara, one of its nurses.Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud told broadcaster LBC the blast had caused damage worth up to $5 billion, and possibly more, and left up to 250,000 people without homes. “This is the killer blow for Beirut, we are a disaster zone,” said Bilal, a man in his 60s, in the downtown area.Offers of international support poured in. Gulf Arab states, who in the past were major financial supporters of Lebanon but recently stepped back because of what they say is Iranian meddling, sent planes with medical equipment and other supplies. Iran offered food and a field hospital, ISNA news agency said.The United States, Britain, France and other Western nations, which have been demanding political and economic change in Lebanon, also offered help. Germany, the Netherlands and Cyprus offered specialised search and rescue teams.Two French planes were expected to arrive on Thursday with 55 rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic. French President Emmanuel Macron will also visit Lebanon on Thursday. Other Arab and European countries are sending doctors, mobile hospitals and equipment.‘CATASTROPHE’For many it was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which had since been rebuilt.“This is a catastrophe for Beirut and Lebanon.” Beirut’s mayor, Jamal Itani, told Reuters while inspecting damage.Officials did not say what caused the initial blaze at the port that set off the blast. A security source and media said it was started by welding work being carried out on a warehouse.Taxi driver Abou Khaled said ministers “are the first that should be held accountable for this disaster. They committed a crime against the people of this nation with their negligence.”The port district was left a tangled wreck, disabling the nation’s main route for imports needed to feed a nation of more than 6 million people.Lebanon has already been struggling to house and feed refugees fleeing conflict in neighbouring Syria and has no trade or other ties with its only other neighbour Israel.“On a scale, this explosion is scaled down from a nuclear bomb rather than up from a conventional bomb,” said Roland Alford, managing director of British explosive ordnance disposal firm Alford Technologies. “This is huge.”The blast prompted the Special Tribunal for Lebanon on Wednesday to postpone its verdict in the trial over the 2005 bombing that killed ex-Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri to Aug. 18. The tribunal’s decision had been expected this Friday.The U.N.-backed court put on trial four suspects from the Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah. Hariri and 21 others were killed by a big truck bomb on another part of the Beirut waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-reels-from-huge-blast-as-death-toll-climbs-to-at-least-135/story-EcVKOQoD5MFoPZrIvJKHfM.html
05-08-2020||World||Coronavirus testing in the US is dropping, even as deaths mount||US testing for the coronavirus is dropping even as infections remain high and the death toll rises by more than 1,000 a day, a worrisome trend that officials attribute largely to Americans getting discouraged over having to wait hours to get a test and days or weeks to find out the results.An Associated Press analysis found that the number of tests per day slid 3.6% over the past two weeks to 750,000, with the count falling in 22 states. That includes places like Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri and Iowa where the percentage of positive tests is high and continuing to climb, an indicator that the virus is still spreading uncontrolled.Amid the crisis, some health officials are calling for the introduction of a different type of test that would yield results in a matter of minutes and would be cheap and simple enough for millions of Americans to test themselves — but would also be less accurate.“There’s a sense of desperation that we need to do something else,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute.Widespread testing is considered essential to containing the outbreak as the U.S. approaches a mammoth 5 million confirmed infections and more than 156,000 deaths out of over 700,000 worldwide.Testing demand is expected to surge again this fall, when schools reopen and flu season hits, most likely outstripping supplies and leading to new delays and bottlenecks.Some of the decline in testing over the past few weeks was expected after backlogged commercial labs urged doctors to concentrate on their highest-risk patients. But some health and government officials are seeing growing public frustration and waning demand.In Iowa, state officials are reporting less interest in testing, despite ample supplies. The state’s daily testing rate peaked in mid-July but has declined 40% in the last two weeks.“We have the capacity. Iowans just need to test,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said last week.Jessica Moore of rural Newberry, South Carolina, said that after a private lab lost her Covid-19 test results in mid-July, she had to get re-tested at a pop-up site organized by the state.Moore and her husband arrived early on a Saturday morning at the site, a community center, where they waited for two hours for her test. Moore watched in the rear-view mirror as people drove up, saw the long line of cars, and then turned around and left.“If people have something to do on a Saturday and they want to get tested, they’re not going to wait for two hours in the South Carolina heat for a test, especially if they’re not symptomatic,” Moore said.Before traveling from Florida to Delaware last month, Laura DuBose Schumacher signed up to go to a drive-up testing site in Orlando with her husband. They were given a one-hour window in which to arrive.They got there at the start of the window, but after 50 minutes it looked as if the wait would be another hour. Others who had gone through the line told them that they wouldn’t get their results until five days later, a Monday, at the earliest. They were planning to travel the next day, so they gave up.“Monday would have been pointless, so we left the line,” Schumacher said.The number of confirmed infections in the U.S. has topped 4.7 million, with new cases running at nearly 60,000 a day on average, down from more than 70,000 in the second half of July.U.S. testing is built on highly sensitive molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the coronavirus. Although the test is considered the gold standard for accuracy, experts increasingly say the country’s overburdened lab system is incapable of keeping pace with the outbreak and producing results within two or three days, the time frame crucial to isolating patients and containing the virus.“They’re doing as good a job as they possibly can do, but the current system will not allow them to keep up with the demand,” said Mara Aspinall of Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions.Testing delays have led researchers at Harvard and elsewhere to propose a new approach using so-called antigen tests — rapid technology already used to screen for flu, strep throat and other common infections. Instead of detecting the virus itself, such tests look for viral proteins, or antigens, which are generally considered a less accurate measure of infection.A number of companies are studying Covid-19 antigen tests in which you spit on a specially coated strip of paper, and if you are infected, it changes color. Experts say the speed and widespread availability of such tests would more than make up for their lower precision.While no such tests for the coronavirus are on the U.S. market, experts say the technology is simple and the hurdles are more regulatory than technical. The Harvard researchers say production could quickly be scaled into the millions.A proposal from the Harvard researchers calls for the federal government to distribute $1 saliva-based antigen tests to all Americans so that they can test themselves regularly, perhaps even daily.Even with accuracy as low as 50%, researchers estimate the paper strip tests would uncover five times more Covid-19 cases than the current laboratory-based approach, which federal officials estimate catches just 1 in 10 infections.But the approach faces resistance in Washington, where federal regulators have required at least 80% accuracy for new Covid-19 tests.To date, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed only two Covid-19 antigen tests to enter the market. Those tests require a nasal swab supervised by a health professional and can only be run on specialized machines found at hospitals, doctor’s offices and clinics.Also, because of the risk of false negatives, doctors may need to confirm a negative result with a genetic test when patients have possible symptoms of Covid-19.On Tuesday, the governors of Maryland, Virginia, Louisiana and three other states announced an agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation to purchase more than 3 million of the FDA-cleared antigen tests, underscoring the growing interest in the technology.When asked about introducing cheaper, paper-based tests, the government’s “testing czar,” Adm. Brett Giroir, warned that their accuracy could fall as low as 20% to 30%.“I don’t think that would do a service to the American public of having something that is wrong seven out of 10 times,” Giroir said last week. “I think that could be catastrophic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-in-the-us-is-dropping-even-as-deaths-mount/story-Ac09CHZmZY5xiP8obuHt1J.html
05-08-2020||World||US officials say no sign Beirut blast was attack||Two US officials say there are no indications that the massive explosion Tuesday evening in Lebanon’s capital was the result of an attack by either a nation state or proxy forces.A senior Defense Department official and a member of the US intelligence community told The Associated Press that, at the moment, the explosion appears to have been caused by improper storage of explosions.Both individuals spoke Wednesday to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence briefings publicly.The senior Defense Department official told the AP that they had “no idea” what President Donald Trump was referring to when he said during a press briefing at the White House on Tuesday that the explosion “looks like a terrible attack. Trump later said that his “great generals” told him that they felt like it was an attack.Inquiries to the Pentagon on Tuesday about President Trump’s attack remarks were referred to the White House.The Paris prosecutor’s office says a first assessment has established that 21 French nationals were among those injured in the Beirut port explosion.In a statement Wednesday, the office said it is opening an “unintentional injuries” investigation into the blast and its causes.The investigation will be carried out by the French National Gendarmerie, one of the country’s two national police forces.The prosecutor’s statement said the group France Victimes is working to bring help and assistance to the French who were wounded, as well as their loved ones.Tunisian President Kaïs Saied has ordered the dispatch of two military planes loaded with medical equipment, medicine and food to Lebanon following the deadly Beirut port explosion.A statement from the presidency Wednesday said that the Tunisian head of state gave instructions to ministers of defense Imad Hazgui and interim Social Affairs and Health Minister Mohamed Habib K’chaou, to deliver this aid “urgently.” According to the statement, a team of Tunisian doctors and nurses will also be sent to Lebanon to help treat the wounded, 100 of whom will be flown back to Tunisia aboard the two planes to be treated in Tunisian hospitals.The Tunisian president sent a note of condolence to his Lebanese counterpart Michel Aoun on Tuesday, in which he assured him of Tunisia’s support and solidarity in this ordeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-say-no-sign-beirut-blast-was-attack/story-YgSUypu6v6jhQDMdeg3AeO.html

05-08-2020||World||‘Mars is looking real’: SpaceX’s test rocket makes 1st flight, landing upright||SpaceX launched a prototype of its Mars rocketship hundreds of feet into the air, then landed it upright in a successful test flight.The flight lasted barely 45 seconds and reached just 500 feet (150 meters) Tuesday night at the southeastern tip of Texas near Brownsville, but was an important first for SpaceX’s Starship. Some earlier tests ended in explosions on the pad.“Mars is looking real,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk tweeted after the short hop. “Progress is accelerating.”Musk said several more short hops are planned before a test version of Starship aims for a high altitude. The latest test model is relatively plain: It stands a full-scale 100 feet (30 meters) tall and resembles a steel silo — or stretched-out can — with a cap on top.The private company plans to launch reusable Starships atop still-in-the-works rockets, carrying cargo or crew not only to low-Earth orbit but also the moon and Musk’s most desirable destination, Mars. The entire stack will stretch nearly 400 feet (120 meters).On Sunday, SpaceX safely returned two NASA astronauts from the International Space Station following a two-month test flight. Their Dragon capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico off the Pensacola, Florida, coast.SpaceX is now the only private company to fly people to and from orbit.“We’re going to go to the moon. We’re going to have a base on the moon. We’re going to send people to Mars and make life multi-planetary,” Musk said following splashdown. “This day heralds a new age of space exploration. That’s what it’s all about.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mars-is-looking-real-spacex-s-test-rocket-makes-1st-flight-landing-upright/story-cC0DeCfdllOAxzFnGDyLaL.html
05-08-2020||World||Beirut blast: Warnings of ‘extreme danger’ ignored by Lebanon officials about stored ammonium nitrate||The volatile chemical suspected of causing the deadly explosion that flattened Lebanon’s main port had been lying in storage there for six years despite warnings from customs officials about its hazards, documents show.The ammonium nitrate -- equivalent to 1,800 tons of TNT -- was unloaded from the cargo ship Rhosus in 2014, according to two letters issued by the director general of Lebanese Customs. For reasons that are unclear, dockworkers unloaded the chemical, which can be used to make fertilizers and explosives, and put it into storage.Workers welding a door on Tuesday started a fire that ignited the chemicals, Lebanese broadcaster LBCI said, citing people who attended a Supreme Council of Defense briefing after the blast. Authorities haven’t said what triggered the explosion that roared through Beirut, killing at least 100 people and wounding 4,000.Customs officials asked judicial authorities at least twice to issue orders for the highly inflammable substance to be confiscated or re-exported, according to the letters from the customs authority. In one of the letters, dated May 3, 2016, the director general at that time, Shafik Merhe, warned of “the extreme danger” from storing the chemical in a warehouse “in these unsuitable weather conditions,” saying it posed a risk to the staff and port.LBCI reported on Wednesday that the Rhosus had been scheduled to sail with its cargo from Beirut six years ago but stayed at the port due to a mechanical failure. Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Tuesday described the storage of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate at the port as “unacceptable” and vowed those responsible would be held accountable.The widely used commercial chemical explosive is almost as powerful as dynamite. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh used about 2 tons of it to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma, killing 168 people.As Lebanese army personnel and rescue workers sifted through the rubble, looking for dozens of missing people, the government placed all port officials under house arrest, Information Minister Manal Abdel-Samad told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting. A two-week state of emergency has been imposed in the city, and a coronavirus-related lockdown was extended for the next two months.Outrage over the government’s role in the calamity ran high in a country already groaning under the weight of its worst financial crisis and a resurgent coronavirus outbreak. Dozens of people gathered in downtown Beirut as former Prime Minister Saad Hariri inspected the damage, beating cars in his convoy and shouting “They killed Beirut.”The explosion was so powerful that it was heard in Cyprus, and severely damaged buildings miles away. Massive shipping containers were flipped upside down as if they were toys, and cranes melted under the intense fire that still burned on Wednesday, and was being doused by helicopters whirring above.“It’s like an apocalypse,” lawmaker Yassine Jaber told Bloomberg. “Pure negligence and that’s the ultimate manifestation of how bad governance has been in Lebanon, with no accountability whatsoever, a manifestation of failure that should jolt us to wake up.”Hospitals, already stretched to capacity by the virus emergency, were overwhelmed. The government appealed to other countries for emergency aid as concerns mounted over food supply in the import-dependent nation.Wheat silos at the port were damaged, and their contents -- equal to about six weeks of the country’s needs -- were rendered unfit for consumption, Economy Minister Raoul Nehme said. He assured Lebanese there would be no flour or bread crisis.France and various Arab states pledged medical aid, while Germany offered members of its armed forces to aid search operations. French President Emmanuel Macron plans to visit Lebanon on Thursday, Agence France Presse reported.“The damage is massive at the port and it will take a very long time to fix and build,” Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told a local television station. The port at Lebanon’s second-largest city, Tripoli, will serve as the alternative, possibly backed up by facilities in Sidon and Tyre, Najjar said.The Beirut port handles 6 million tons of shipments a year.Before the blast, talks with the International Monetary Fund for a $10 billion loan had stalled over the government’s failure to agree on a reform plan, and Gulf states deflected Lebanon’s request for a bailout, afraid money would fall into the hands of Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. Officials had been discussing ways to partially privatize the port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-blast-warnings-of-extreme-danger-ignored-by-lebanon-officials-about-stored-ammonium-nitrate/story-Sd2AA6YZmJ9PwbPZhUd6SK.html

05-08-2020||World||Donald Trump, Biden to accept their nominations remotely due to Covid-19||President Donald Trump and his presumptive Democratic challenger for the White House, Joe Biden, will accept their respective party nominations in speeches delivered remotely, in a major break from tradition as 2020 campaigns and candidates seek new ways to get around the Covid-19 epidemic.“I’ll probably do mine live from the White House,” President Trump said Wednesday on Fox News, hours after reports emerged Republicans could be considering the White House.“It’s easy and I think it’s a beautiful setting, and we are thinking about that. … It’s the easiest alternative,” he added.The Democratic National Convention said shortly after in a statement that Biden “will no longer travel to Milwaukee (venue of a pared down convention) and will instead address the nation and accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware”. Further details will be announced later.Candidates have traditionally accepted the nomination at lavishly mounted conventions that last three to four days. But in view of surging Covid-19 cases, both Trump and Biden have had to overhaul their plans, as have all others running for US House of Representatives, the Senate and state elections.Trump cancelled plans last month to hold the convention with the usual pomp and fanfare in Jacksonville, Florida after the state saw a surge in Covid-19 infections with the potential of continuing through till the convention slated for August 24-27. A limited version will be held in Charlottesville, North Carolina.US president have traditionally avoided the use of the White House and other federal facilities for overtly political purposes, but Trump will cross no legal lines if he did indeed deliver the acceptance speech from the White House as he has indicated, experts and pundits have said.Democrats took the first step in the direction of an unconventional convention when they announced in June that Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, will accept the nomination at a pared down convention in Wisconsin. He will be physically there, but delegates and all others will attend remotely.Few other details have been made available of the conventions that will be followed by three presidential debates between Trump and Biden on September 29 and October 15 and 22. The Trump camp is pushing for a fourth, insinuating, at the same time, that former vice-president is trying to duck debates.At their conventions, two parties will declare their respective manifestoes, called platforms, which would lay out their agenda. Republican are going with their 2016 platform, as is. Democrats released a draft last month, which was a bridge-building exercise between the campaign and Bernie Sanders-led progressives of the party. Though still be finalized, it has also retained substantial portions from the 2026 platform adopted by Hillary Clinton, the nominee then.On India, for instance, it’s almost the same one-line construct: “And we will continue to invest in our strategic partnership with India — the world’s largest democracy, a nation of great diversity, and a growing Asia-Pacific power.”In 2016, the platform had this on India: “We will continue to invest in a long-term strategic partnership with India—the world’s largest democracy, a nation of great diversity, and an important Pacific power.”Democrats helping the Biden campaign have said the former vice-president is far more engaged on India than it may seem from the perfunctory one sentence in the draft platform.

The unit, headed by a brigadier general, will operate a sampling center, a quarantine center, recovery hotels, an evaluation complex and an epidemiological investigations center.The move looks to give the country’s largest organization overall responsibility for contact tracing at a time when the government has come under fire for its handling of the pandemic. The ministry of defense has long advocated utilizing the military’s vast infrastructure and resources to combat the spread of the virus but has been rebuffed till now because of inter-government squabbling.Israel received praise for its early handling of the coronavirus crisis and imposing tight movement restrictions. But since reopening the economy in May new cases have spiked to record highs, with upwards of 2,000 infections a day.

05-08-2020||World||Meghan Markle’s friends can stay anonymous in privacy case, says UK judge||A British judge ruled Wednesday that the Duchess of Sussex can keep the names of five close friends secret while she brings a privacy invasion lawsuit against a British newspaper — but he chided both sides in the case for playing out their battle in the media as well as the courtroom.The former Meghan Markle is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and the MailOnline website over five articles that published portions of a handwritten letter she wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, after her marriage to Prince Harry in 2018.Meghan, 39, is seeking damages from publisher Associated Newspapers Ltd. for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and data protection breaches.The duchess asked the judge to prohibit publishing details of female friends who spoke anonymously to People magazine to condemn the alleged bullying she had received from the media. She argued that the friends were not parties to the case and had a “basic right to privacy.”The women’s names are included in a confidential court document, but they have been identified in public only as A to E.Associated Newspapers’ attorney Antony White said during a court hearing last week that the friends were potential witnesses in the case, and keeping their names secret “would be a heavy curtailment of the media’s and the defendant’s entitlement to report this case and the public’s right to know about it.”The judge acknowledged he had to balance “the competing demands of confidentiality and open justice.”Warby ruled in favor of anonymity, saying it would serve justice by shielding Meghan’s friends from the “glare of publicity” in the pretrial stage of the case.“Generally, it does not help the interests of justice if those involved in litigation are subjected to, or surrounded by, a frenzy of publicity,” he said. “At trial, that is a price that may have to be paid in the interests of transparency. But it is not a necessary concomitant of the pretrial phase.”No date has been set for the full trial, which is likely to be one of the highest-profile civil cases in the U.K. for years.The judge said that in pretrial wrangling, each side had “overstated its case” and made “hyperbolic assertions” about the other.“Neither side has, so far, been willing to confine the presentation of its case to the courtroom,” Warby said.“Both sides have demonstrated an eagerness to play out the merits of their dispute in public, outside the courtroom, primarily in media reports.,” he said. “That approach to litigation has little to do with enabling public scrutiny of the legal process, or enhancing the due administration of justice.”Associated Newspapers, which is contesting the duchess’s privacy-infringement claim, says it was Meghan’s friends who brought the letter into the public domain by describing it in the People article. One told the magazine that the duchess had written: “Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimizing me through the media so we can repair our relationship.”The publisher’s lawyers argue that the information about the letter disclosed in the article must have come “directly or indirectly” from Meghan.But Meghan’s attorney, Justin Rusbrooke, argued that the duchess was unaware her friends were speaking to the magazine. They say the anonymous interviews were arranged by one of the five friends, who was concerned about the toll media criticism was taking on the duchess, pregnant at the time with her first child.American actress Meghan Markle, star of TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born the following year.In January, the couple announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said was unbearable intrusion and racist attitudes from the British media. They are currently based in the Los Angeles area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-s-friends-can-stay-anonymous-in-privacy-case-says-uk-judge/story-IUSfGtXR1EpACR5zhT3rbI.html
05-08-2020||World||‘Most powerful ever to rip through Beirut’: City reels from huge blast, death toll climbs to at least 100||Lebanese rescue workers dug through the mangled wreckage of buildings on Wednesday looking for survivors after a massive warehouse explosion sent a devastating blast wave across Beirut, killing at least 100 people and injuring nearly 4,000.Officials said the toll was expected to rise after Tuesday’s blast at port warehouses that stored highly explosive material.The blast was the most powerful ever to rip through Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections.It sent a mushroom cloud into the sky and rattled windows on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about 100 miles (160 km) away.President Michel Aoun said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, had been stored for six years at the port without safety measures. He called it “unacceptable”.An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on negligence. Ordinary Lebanese blamed politicians who have overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance that has plunged Lebanon into financial crisis.“It’s like a war zone. I’m speechless,” Beirut’s mayor, Jamal Itani, told Reuters while inspecting damage he estimated ran into billions of dollars. “This is a catastrophe for Beirut and Lebanon.”The head of Lebanon’s Red Cross, George Kettani, said at least 100 people had been killed. “We are still sweeping the area. There could still be victims. I hope not,” he said.The intensity of the blast threw victims into the sea and rescue teams were trying to recover bodies. Many of those killed were port and custom employees and people working in the area or driving through during the Tuesday afternoon rush hour.The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues because hospitals were overwhelmed, Kettani said.‘KILLER BLOW’Facades of central Beirut buildings were ripped off, furniture was sucked into streets and roads were strewn with glass and debris. Cars near the port were flipped over.“This is the killer blow for Beirut, we are a disaster zone. My building shuddered, I thought it was an earthquake,” said Bilal, a man in his 60s, in the downtown area.Like others, he blamed the political elite. “We already have a financial economic crisis, people are hungry and, these thieves and looters, will they compensate for the losses? Who will compensate for those who lost their loved ones,” he said.Offers of international support poured in. Gulf Arab states, who in the past were major financial supporters of Lebanon but recently stepped back because of what they say is Iranian meddling, sent planes with medical equipment and other supplies. Iran offered food and a field hospital, ISNA news agency said.The United States, Britain, France and other Western nations, which have been demanding political change in Lebanon, also offered help. The Netherlands said it was sending doctors, nurses and specialised search and rescue teams.“This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class,” said Hassan Zaiter, 32, a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut.For many it was a dreadful reminder of the 1975 to 1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which had been rebuilt. Post-war reconstruction and political corruption mired Lebanon in huge debts.TANGLED WRECK“With this blast they took us back to the years of war ... Our leaders are in a coma,” said Ali Abdulwahed, 46, a manager at Café de l’Etoile, a restaurant next to parliament.Prime Minister Hassan Diab promised accountability, saying: “Those responsible will pay the price”.Officials did not say what caused the initial blaze at the port that set off the blast. A security source and media said it was started by welding work being carried out on a warehouse.The port district was left a tangled wreck, disabling the nation’s main route for imports needed to feed a nation of more than 6 million people. Lebanon has already been struggling to house and feed hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria.Lebanon’s main grain silo at the port was destroyed, leaving the nation with less than a month’s wheat reserves.The U.S. embassy in Beirut, which moved to another part of the city after a huge bomb attack struck its originally waterfront embassy in 1983, warned residents about reports of toxic gases released by the port blast.The explosion came three days before a U.N.-backed court is due to deliver a verdict in the trial of four suspects from the Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah over a 2005 bombing that killed former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others.Hariri was killed by a huge truck bomb on another part of the Beirut waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-powerful-ever-to-rip-through-beirut-city-reels-from-huge-blast-death-toll-climbs-to-at-least-100/story-88JRbTknt9uG0iCQWH7D3O.html
05-08-2020||World||Lebanese confront devastation after massive Beirut explosion||Residents of Beirut confronted a scene of utter devastation on Wednesday, a day after a massive explosion at the port rippled across the Lebanese capital, killing at least 100 people, wounding thousands and leaving entire city blocks flooded with glass and rubble.Smoke was still rising from the port, where a towering building of silos was half destroyed, spilling out mounds of grain. Hangars around it were completely toppled. Much of the downtown area was littered with damaged vehicles and debris that had rained down from the shattered facades of buildings.An official with the Lebanese Red Cross said at least 100 people were killed and more than 4,000 were wounded. George Kettaneh said the toll could rise further.It was unclear what caused the blast, which appeared to have been triggered by a fire and struck with the force of an earthquake. It was the most powerful explosion ever seen in the city, which was split in half by the 1975-1990 civil war and has endured conflicts with neighboring Israel and periodic bombings and terror attacks.Scores of people were missing, with relatives pleading on social media for help locating loved ones. An Instagram page called “Locating Victims Beirut” sprang up with photos of missing people, and radio presenters read the names of missing or wounded people throughout the night. Many residents moved in with friends or relatives after their apartments were damaged and treated their own injuries because hospitals were overwhelmed.Lebanon was already on the brink of collapse amid a severe economic crisis that has ignited mass protests in recent months. Its health system is confronting a coronavirus surge, and there were concerns the virus could spread further as people flooded into hospitals.There was no evidence the explosion was an attack. Instead, many Lebanese blamed it on decades of corruption and poor governance by the entrenched political class that has ruled the tiny Mediterranean country since the civil war.Saint George University Hospital, one of the major private hospitals in Beirut which had been receiving Covid-19 patients, was out of commission Wednesday after suffering major damage. A physician who identified himself as Dr. Emile said 16 staff and patients, including four nurses, died in the blast. He declined to give his last name out of privacy concerns.The blast also wounded a number of UN peacekeepers stationed in the area. Bangladesh said 21 members of its Navy were wounded, one critically. Italy, one of the top contributors to the UNIFIL mission, said one of its soldiers was wounded.Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi told a local TV station that it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship impounded in 2013.Explosives experts and video footage suggested the ammonium nitrate may have been ignited by a fire at what appeared to be a nearby warehouse containing fireworks.Ammonium nitrate is a common ingredient in fertilizer as well as explosives. It was used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, when a truck bomb containing 2,180 kilograms (4,800 pounds) of fertilizer and fuel oil ripped through a federal building, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more.Security forces cordoned off the port area on Wednesday as a bulldozer entered to help clear away debris. A young man begged troops to allow him to enter and search for his father, who has been missing since the blast occurred. He was directed to a port official who wrote down his details.In Beirut’s hard-hit Achrafieh district, civil defense workers and soldiers were working on locating missing people and clearing the rubble. At least one man was still pinned under stones from an old building that had collapsed. Volunteers hooked him up to an oxygen tank to help him breathe while others tried to free his leg.The blast severely damaged numerous apartment buildings, potentially leaving large numbers of people homeless at a time when many Lebanese have lost their jobs and seen their savings evaporate because of a currency crisis. The explosion also raises concerns about how Lebanon will continue to import nearly all of its vital goods with its main port devastated.Prime Minister Hassan Diab, in a short televised speech, appealed for international aid, saying: “We are witnessing a real catastrophe.” He reiterated his pledge that those responsible for the disaster will pay the price, without commenting on the cause.There is also the issue of food security in Lebanon, a tiny country already hosting over 1 million Syrians displaced by that country’s nearly decade-long civil war.Drone footage shot Wednesday by The Associated Press showed that the blast tore open a cluster of towering grain silos, dumping their contents into the debris and earth thrown up by the blast. Some 80% of Lebanon’s wheat supply is imported, according to the US Agriculture Department.Estimates suggest some 85% of the country’s grain was stored at the now-destroyed silos.Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency quoted Raoul Nehme, the minister of economy and trade, as saying that all the wheat stored at the facility had been “contaminated” and couldn’t be used. But he insisted Lebanon had enough wheat for its immediate needs and would import more.Several countries have pledged aid in the aftermath of the blast, with even Israel offering humanitarian assistance. The two countries have been in conflict for decades, and Israel fought a 2006 war with the Hezbollah militant group.Lebanon’s economic crisis is rooted in decades of systemic corruption by political factions that exploit public institutions for the benefit of their supporters. Decades after the civil war, residents endure frequent power outages and poor public services.Lebanese have held mass protests calling for sweeping political change since last autumn but few of their demands have been met as the economic situation has steadily worsened.Beirut’s port and the customs authority are notoriously corrupt. Like nearly all public institutions, they are controlled by Lebanon’s political factions, including Hezbollah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-confront-devastation-after-massive-beirut-explosion/story-oUaPCNDUdHpzyfMzEz99uN.html
05-08-2020||World||Search for Beirut blast survivors intensifies as death toll mounts||Army personnel and rescue workers sifted through mountains of rubble from a massive explosion that flattened Lebanon’s main port, looking for survivors from a blast that roared through the capital, Beirut, killing dozens and wounding thousands more.Lebanese authorities appealed to other countries for emergency aid as concerns over food supply in the import-dependent nation mounted. Officials blamed highly explosive materials equal to 1,800 tons of TNT that had been stored at the port for years, but haven’t said whether the explosion on Tuesday evening was an accident or an attack.Outrage over the government’s role in the calamity ran high in a country already groaning under the weight of the worst financial crisis in its history, and a resurgent coronavirus outbreak. The explosion was so powerful that it was heard in Cyprus, and severely damaged buildings miles away. Massive shipping containers were flipped upside down as if they were toys, and cranes melted under the intense fire that still burned on Wednesday, and was being doused by helicopters whirring above.“It’s like an apocalypse,” lawmaker Yassine Jaber told Bloomberg. “Pure negligence and that’s the ultimate manifestation of how bad governance has been in Lebanon, with no accountability whatsoever, a manifestation of failure that should jolt us to wake up.”Hospitals, already stretched to capacity by the virus emergency, were overwhelmed by a casualty toll that climbed throughout the night. At least 100 people were killed, 4,000 were injured, and dozens were missing.The army cordoned off the port, through which much of Lebanon’s food and other supplies enter. The nation imports nearly all of its needs from abroad, including wheat and fuel, which the central bank has been subsidizing from its dwindling reserves. Wheat silos at the port were damaged, and their contents -- equal to about six weeks of the country’s needs -- were rendered unfit for consumption, Economy Minister Raoul Nehme said.Nehme will be meeting with wheat importers and formulating a response plan, his office said.“The damage is massive at the port and it will take a very long time to fix and build,” Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told a local television station. The port at Lebanon’s second-largest city, Tripoli, will serve as the alternative, possibly backed up by facilities in Sidon and Tyre, Najjar said.The Beirut port handles 6 million tons of shipments a year.A two-week state of emergency was declared, and cabinet is expected to meet later in the day to discuss this latest crisis to beset the country. The government issued a global appeal for help, its own coffers emptied by corruption and mismanagement. Before the blast, talks with the International Monetary Fund for a $10 billion loan had stalled over the government’s failure to agree on a reform plan, and Gulf states deflected Lebanon’s request for a bailout, afraid money would fall into the hands of Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.The calamity was Lebanon’s worst in decades. Video footage showed what appeared to be a fire, followed by crackling lights and then a much larger explosion as an enormous cloud of smoke rapidly engulfed the area around the Port of Beirut.The aftermath of the explosion left people rushing for help on foot and motorbikes, some with blood streaming over their faces, outside a Beirut hospital. One hospital said it had taken in 400 people and others appealed for blood donations, saying they’d reached their capacity. On Wednesday, people were on the streets inspecting their damaged shops and homes.‘Destroyed City’“Beirut has never seen anything like this before,” the city’s governor, Marwan Abboud, told reporters near the scene, comparing it to the aftermath of a nuclear bomb. “It is a destroyed city, people lying on the streets, damage everywhere.”Prime Minister Hassan Diab described the blast as a “major national disaster,” and said the material that caused the explosion had been there since 2014.“I will not rest until we hold whoever is responsible accountable and punish them with the most severe punishment,” he said. “It’s unacceptable that 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate have been stored in a container in a depot for the past six years,” he said during a meeting of the Higher Defense Council.In Washington, President Donald Trump added to confusion over the chain of events in Beirut, saying U.S. military officials “seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind.” He said he “met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event.”He provided no evidence to back up that assertion and the White House National Security Council had no comment.The explosion took place during the first of a two-day grace period that the government had given citizens before it reinforces a full lockdown with a curfew to contain the coronavirus epidemic after the country saw a major spike in cases in recent weeks.Traffic was heavy throughout the day as people flooded the capital and other areas. Myriam Sawma, 31, was among the many who left their homes to buy essentials before the lockdown resumed.“I was at the mall and we heard the first blast and then another and complete white smoke covered the area. People were screaming and running everywhere,” said Sawma, who was at a popular shopping center in the neighborhood of Ashrafieh.The port explosion came as Lebanon braces for a verdict from a United Nations-backed court on Friday in the case of the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon has accused four members of Hezbollah of having a role in the killing, which was a turning point in the country’s modern history. The assassination sparked nationwide protests and forced the collapse of a government as well as the withdrawal of Syrian troops that had stationed in Lebanon after the civil war from 1975-1990, ending its tutelage over its neighbor.Hezbollah, which also plays an influential role in Lebanon’s political and economic life, has denied the allegations and said it would not hand over the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-beirut-blast-survivors-intensifies-as-death-toll-mounts/story-6rp5ZnAMQ5MxtaOlJPa3mM.html
05-08-2020||World||After blast, Lebanon has enough grain for less than a month, minister says||Lebanon’s main grain silo at Beirut port was destroyed in a blast along with the wheat inside, leaving the nation with less than a month’s reserves of the grain although other vessels with supplies are on the way, the economy minister said on Wednesday.Raoul Nehme told Reuters a day after Tuesday’s devastating blast that Lebanon needed reserves for at least three months to ensure food security and was looking at other storage areas.He said reserves now stood at “a bit less than a month”.The explosion was the most powerful ever to rip through Beirut, leaving the port district a wreck of mangled masonry and disabling the main entry port for imports to feed a nation of more than 6 million people.The Beirut silo was capable of holding 120,000 tonnes of grain, said Ahmed Tamer, the director of the port of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second biggest city.The port in Tripoli, Lebanon’s second biggest port, is not equipped with grain storage facilities but wheat could be transferred to warehouses 2 km (about one mile) away, he said.At the time of the blast, the Beirut silo held no more than 15,000 tonnes of wheat as some millers had unloaded cargoes directly because of a delay in issuing letters of credit for payment, Ahmed Hattit, the head of the wheat importers union, told the local Al-Akhbar newspaper.Hattit said existing reserves of flour were sufficient to cover market needs for a month and a half and said there were four ships carrying cargoes totalling 28,000 tonnes of wheat that had not docked at the port yet.Lebanon is trying to immediately transfer four vessels carrying 25,000 tonnes of flour to the port in Tripoli, an economy ministry official told news channel LBCI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-blast-lebanon-has-enough-grain-for-less-than-a-month-minister-says/story-8kJ165FctPriBlh7NhOpYM.html

Taiwan is a key irritant in the troubled relationship between the world’s two largest economies, which are also at odds over trade, technology, territorial claims in the South China Sea and China’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China has lodged “solemn complaints” over the visit with U.S. officials in both Beijing and Washington.“The Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations,” Wang said at a daily briefing. He said Washington needs to stop all forms of official contact with Taiwan and make good on its commitment to Beijing to “avoid serious damage to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”The US maintains only unofficial ties with Taiwan in deference to Beijing, but is the island’s most important ally and provider of defense equipment.The American Institute in Taiwan, which operates as Washington’s de facto embassy on the island, said Wednesday that Azar’s “historic visit will strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan partnership and enhance US-Taiwan cooperation to combat the global Covid-19 pandemic.”In a tweet, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it looks forward to welcoming Azar and his delegation. “This is the highest-level visit by a US Cabinet official since 1979! Taiwan and the US are like minded partners cooperating closely in combating coronavirus and promoting freedom democracy & human rights worldwide.”The ministry said Azar will meet with independence-minded President Tsai Ing-wen, with whose government Beijing cut off virtually all contacts four years ago, and with Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and top health officials.Tsai tweeted to Azar that “Your timely visit is another testament to the strong Taiwan-US partnership based on our longstanding friendship & shared values.”AIT said Azar will discuss the disease, global health and Taiwan’s role as a supplier of medical equipment and technology.The visit is believed to be scheduled for next week, although AIT said details on the timing and agenda would be announced later.Azar would be the first HHS secretary to visit Taiwan and the first Cabinet member to visit in six years, the last being then-Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy. His Cabinet ranking is higher than previous U.S. visitors.“Taiwan has been a model of transparency and cooperation in global health during the Covid-19 pandemic and long before it,” Azar said in the AIT statement. “This trip represents an opportunity to strengthen our economic and public health cooperation with Taiwan, especially as the United States and other countries work to strengthen and diversify our sources for crucial medical products.”Azar’s visit was facilitated by the 2018 passage of the Taiwan Travel Act that encouraged sending higher-level officials to Taiwan after decades during which such contacts were rare and freighted with safeguards to avoid roiling ties with Beijing.McCarthy’s visit to Taiwan in 2014 sparked a protest from China’s foreign ministry, which accused the U.S. of betraying commitments made to it about maintaining only unofficial links with Taipei.China objects to all official contact between Taiwan and the U.S. But its increasing diplomatic pressure, including poaching Taiwan’s few remaining diplomatic allies and excluding it from international gatherings including the World Health Assembly, have fostered already considerable bipartisan sympathy for Taipei in Washington and prompted new measures to strengthen governmental and military ties.Taiwan’s strong performance in handling its Covid-19 outbreak has also won it plaudits while highlighting its exclusion from the World Health Organization and other UN bodies. Despite its close proximity to China, where the global pandemic is believed to have originated, the island of 23 million has recorded just 476 cases and seven deaths from Covid-19, largely as a result of rigorous testing and case tracing.“In contrast to authoritarian systems, US and Taiwan societies and economies are uniquely equipped to drive global progress in areas such as medicine and science to help the world tackle emerging threats,” AIT said. “The Covid-19 pandemic is the most recent example of joint U.S.-Taiwan efforts to confront global challenges for the good of the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sending-highest-official-to-taiwan-since-ties-cut-in-1979/story-ShkeMwjuCy10cPUDWGSdqN.html
05-08-2020||World||Fireworks, ammonium nitrate likely fueled Beirut explosion||Fireworks and ammonium nitrate appear to have been the fuel that ignited a massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital of Beirut, experts and videos of the blast suggest.The scale of the damage — from the epicenter of the explosion at the port of Beirut to the windows blown out kilometers (miles) away — resembles other blasts involving the chemical compound commonly used as an agricultural fertilizer.But the compound itself typically doesn’t detonate on its own and requires another ignition source. That likely came from a fire that engulfed what initially appeared to be fireworks that were stored at the port.Online videos of the disaster’s initial moments show sparks and lights inside the smoke rising from the blaze, just prior to the massive blast. That likely indicates that fireworks were involved, said Boaz Hayoun, owner of the Tamar Group, an Israeli firm that works closely with the Israeli government on safety and certification issues involving explosives.“Before the big explosion, you can see in the center of the fire, you can see sparks, you can hear sounds like popcorn and you can hear whistles,” Hayoun told The Associated Press. “This is very specific behavior of fireworks, the visuals, the sounds and the transformation from a slow burn to a massive explosion.”Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, offered a similar assessment.“It looks like an accident,” Lewis told the AP. “First, there was a fire preceding the explosion, which is not an attack. And some of the videos show munitions what I could call popcorning, exploding like ’pop, pop, pop, pop.’”He added that “it’s very common to see fires detonate explosives.”“If you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don’t put it out, it blows up,” he said.The white cloud that accompanied the massive blast appeared to be a condensation cloud, often common in massive explosions in humid conditions that can follow the shock waves of an explosion, Lewis said.Orange clouds also followed the blast, likely from toxic nitrogen dioxide gas that’s released after an explosion involving nitrates.Experts typically determine the power of the blast by measuring the crater left behind, which appeared massive in aerial footage shot on Wednesday morning by the AP.The Beirut blast, based on the crater and glass windows being blown out a distance away, exploded with the force equivalent to detonating at least 2.2 kilotons of TNT, said Sim Tack, an analyst and weapons expert at the Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor.What initially started the fire at the port remains unclear. Beirut was sunny before Tuesday’s explosion, with a daily high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).Lebanese Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi, in comments to a local TV station, made no mention of ignited fireworks but said it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the dock ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014. That amount could cause the explosive force seen in the blast Tuesday, Tack said.Based on the timeline and the size of the cargo, that ship could be the MV Rhosus. The ship was initially seized in Beirut in 2013 when it entered the port due to technical problems, according to lawyers involved in the case. It came from the nation of Georgia, and had been bound for Mozambique.“Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port’s warehouses,” the lawyers wrote in a 2015 article published by shiparrested.com. “The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning and/or proper disposal.”It remains unclear what conditions the ammonium nitrate had been stored in — or why tons of an explosive chemical compound had been left there for years. Lebanon already was on the brink of collapse amid a severe economic crisis that has ignited mass protests in recent months.The devastation surrounding the port resembled other ammonium nitrate explosions, such as the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and a 1947 ship explosion that struck Texas City, Texas.It also is unclear what conditions a possible shipment of fireworks at the port had been stored in. Fireworks are very common in Lebanon, used to celebrate religious occasions and weddings.While military explosives are generally safe to transport, common “cheap pyrotechnics” made in China are often of very low quality and can ignite very easily, especially in hot weather, said Hayoun, the Israeli explosives expert.The “end result,” he added is that “hundreds of tons of energetic materials” were detonated to create a explosion of this magnitude.“It started definitely with fireworks,” he said.___Follow Jon Gambrell and Josef Federman on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP and www.twitter.com/joseffederman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fireworks-ammonium-nitrate-likely-fueled-beirut-explosion/story-GFTfW2MCvzFyaJ9CgMXgcJ.html
05-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson govt rapped for delay in imposing border curbs||An influential committee of UK parliament on Wednesday criticised the Boris Johnson government for allowing thousands of travellers into the UK without requiring them to self-isolate before the March 23 lockdown, which led to a “far worse” situation.The Home Affairs Select Committee is particularly critical in its report of the decision on March 13 to remove self-isolation guidance for travellers arriving at a time when other comparable countries were strengthening their border measures.At the time, it said hundreds of new coronavirus cases were arriving every day, particularly from Spain, Italy and France, including British residents returning home. It also added that the decision not to include Spain in country-specific measures in late February was a mistake.The cross-party committee said it was unable to find any scientific evidence to justify this “inexplicable decision” and says that the failure to have any special border measures in place in mid March was a “serious error”.As of Tuesday night, there were 46,299 deaths and 306,293 cases in the UK, making it the worst affected European country and one of the worst in the world. Recent decline in deaths and cases has prompted the government to ease restrictions.Yvette Cooper, committee chair, said: “The government’s failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people”.“The UK was almost unique in having no border checks or quarantine arrangements at that time. That alone should have rung loud alarm bells for ministers and made them think again”.“Many times Ministers told us they were following the science, but we cannot find any science at all behind their completely inexplicable decision to lift all the self isolation guidance for travellers on 13 March a full ten days before lockdown”, she added.Drawing on evidence that thousands of people with the virus arrived in or returned to the UK in February and March, the committee concluded that the UK’s experience has been “far worse” as a result of the decision not to require quarantine during March.Cooper added: “We are concerned that border measures just weren’t taken seriously enough at the beginning of the crisis, either in the discussions among scientific advisers or in ministerial decision making”.“It appears ministers took decisions without critical information they should have had, and it has been extremely difficult to work out who took key decisions and on what basis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-govt-rapped-for-delay-in-imposing-border-curbs/story-yjtuQ0lbnP8dGiaSAbskvL.html

China’s position on the Kashmir issue is clear and consistent. This issue is a dispute leftover from history between Pakistan and India. That is an objective fact as laid out by the UN Charter, UN Security Council resolutions and the bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India,” spokesperson Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Wednesday.He was responding to a question from the Associated Press of Pakistan on the change of Kashmir’s status.“Any unilateral change to the status quo is illegal and invalid. This issue should be properly resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultations between the parties concerned,” Wang said.Wang added that Pakistan and India are neighbours “...that cannot be moved away. Co-existence serves the fundamental interests of both and the common aspiration of the international community.”China hopes, Wang said, that the two countries could properly handle differences through dialogue, improve relations and jointly safeguard peace, security and development of both countries and the wider region.Wang did not separately mention the areas over which New Delhi and Beijing have disputes in the region.Last year, China had called the move “unacceptable”, urging New Delhi to respect Chinese territorial sovereignty and uphold peace and tranquility in the border areas.Beijing had then referred to the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which China controls but New Delhi claims as part of the new union territory of Ladakh.India had then rejected Beijing’s criticism, saying the proposal to form new UTs including that of Ladakh was an “internal matter”.New Delhi had also pointed out the two sides had agreed to maintain peace along their disputed border until a mutually acceptable solution is found to the issue.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had visited Beijing in August and explained India’s position, saying that the change in the administrative status of the region did not impact the Line of Actual Control (LAC) - the de facto border with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-move-in-j-k-illegal-china-on-one-year-of-article-370-abrogation/story-IcqbXZrz2PuONlbXth4dIJ.html

That’s not the case.” He also said that precautions and some restrictions that have been in place since the outset of the coronavirus crisis like social distancing and wearing of masks “will still have to continue with the new reality for quite some time.”Tam echoed that point and said that while a vaccine, whenever it is available, and if it is “safe and effective” will comprise “one important layer of protection.” However, other “personal, daily” measures will have to continue.Canada will release guidelines for safety for children as several provinces plan reopening schools this September. This will include wearing of masks for older children. Canada has so far reported 117,664 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and recorded 8958 deaths.The warning from public health officials came as a new survey showed that while the majority of Canadians are ready to take the vaccine whenever it is available, a significant number remain sceptical about its efficacy. The poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute noted that “one-in-seven (14%), say that they will not get a vaccine in addition to eight per cent who say they are not sure.” On the other hand, nearly half, 46 per cent of respondents, said “they will get a vaccination as quickly as possible if it becomes available” while another 32 per cent said they were “willing to be vaccinated but not immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-have-to-manage-covid-19-over-2021-theresa-tam/story-Wxf860Ut5cs4boEkflo7JL.html

The success of the demonstration mission for SpaceX Crew Dragon, the first crewed US spaceship to achieve orbit since the Space Shuttle era, means it will likely soon be certified for regular service.The next mission is already planned for September.“The mission went just like the simulators, from start to finish, all the way there was really no surprises,” said Hurley.Both men are veterans of the Space Shuttle program, which ended in 2011, and they had been training for five years with SpaceX.Splash down at 15 miles per hour in the Gulf of Mexico felt “pretty firm,” said Hurley, but that was expected.One person who will particularly benefit from Behnken’s knowledge: astronaut Megan McArthur, who is slated to make the same voyage in the spring of 2021 on the same spacecraft, and is Behnken’s wife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-an-animal-nasa-astronauts-describe-noisy-jolting-descent/story-c8N5P8KWlqHMTuIAamjiYO.html

We are in touch with Indian community members, so far there is no report of casualty. We are keeping a close watch and are in touch with community organisations. There is lot of damage to buildings in central Beirut.”The Embassy has also shared its helpline numbers with the Indian community.The National News Agency of Lebanon reported that a warehouse at the Beirut Port caught fire and lead to major explosions, which reverberated in the capital and the suburbs and left behind great damages to the surrounding buildings and a considerable number of wounded.Dramatic images and videos on social media showed huge plumes of smoke billowing out of the site of the massive blast near Beirut’s port.Local media showed people reporting shattering of glass windows of buildings and cars shaking.Al Jazeera reported that the force of the blast was massive and it caused panic in the streets and pieces of glass were seen everywhere.The daily quoted Hamad Hassan, Lebanon’s health minister saying hundreds were wounded in the explosion. It also quoted security sources put the initial death toll at 10 but medical and rescue teams on the ground said dozens were killed.Several people on board an Italian ship docked near the explosion site, the Orient Queen, were wounded and taken to hospital.Though the cause of the blast is unknown, the initial reports have stated that the explosion occurred in Beirut’s port area containing warehouses.The blast comes ahead of a verdict on Friday by UN-backed panel on the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed in car bombing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-blast-indian-embassy-staff-safe-in-touch-with-indian-community-members-says-envoy-suhel-azaz-khan/story-w4geg7D545Z4wU9rwj8aGP.html

The company said it could start a large pivotal Phase III trial as soon as late September, and on a conference call added that it could produce 1 billion to 2 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Novavax research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters the late-stage clinical trial could potentially glean enough data to obtain regulatory approvals as early as December. Maryland-based Novavax said its vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, produced higher levels of the antibodies in healthy volunteers after two doses than those found in recovered Covid-19 patients, raising hopes for its eventual success.The addition of the company’s MatrixM adjuvant, a substance designed to boost the body’s immune response, did enhance the effect of the vaccine in the study, the company said. The Novavax vaccine is among the first of a handful of programs singled out for US funding under Operation Warp Speed, the White House program to accelerate access to vaccines and treatments that can fight the virus. Effective vaccines and treatments are considered essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 695,000 lives worldwide.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Novavax’s vaccine contains synthesized pieces of the surface protein that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells, spurring production of antibodies to fight the infection.The US government in July agreed to pay Novavax $1.6 billion to help cover costs related to testing and manufacturing the vaccine, with the aim of procuring 100 million doses by January 2021.The trial, which started in late May, tested the vaccine in 106 subjects aged 18 to 59 versus a placebo. The Phase I study looked at the vaccine’s safety and ability to induce immune responses.It tested 5 microgram and 25 microgram doses of the vaccine, with and without the adjuvant. The company said it would likely move forward with the lower dose.Eight study participants experienced adverse side effects after receiving a second vaccine dose during the trial, although none required medical intervention, the company said. Headache, fatigue, and muscle pain were among the more common side effects, and the vaccine was “well tolerated” overall, the company said.Because Covid-19 vaccines are being developed at unprecedented speed, safety issues are being watched very closely. “When you are talking about vaccinating the entire world, safety is almost more important than efficacy,” said Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, an investment fund specializing in biotechnology companies.The Phase II portion of the study will be conducted in multiple countries, including the United States. It will gauge the vaccine’s ability to prevent infections or reduce severity of Covid-19, in addition to safety and immune response, among a broader range of volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-induces-immune-response-in-early-study/story-uvA8OtBoi3dfLWH2Y4dJYM.html

Immediately after the incident, the authorities concerned withdrew 16 policemen, including the check-post in-charge. The prime minister’s Press Secretary Ihsaul Karim said Hasina telephoned Rashed’s mother and assured the family of providing financial assistance.“The prime minister assured Rashed’s family of carrying out a proper probe into the killing and trying the persons responsible (for the murder),” he told PTI. The Home Ministry has launched an investigation into the killing, forming a high-level committee.According to family members, 36-year-old Rashed used to make travel documentaries following his retirement and was staying at Cox’s Bazar for the last two months for making a film.Rashed was killed when he was returning to Cox’s Bazar from Teknaf along with an associate in a private car, the Prothom Alo newspaper reported, citing an “intelligence agency report”.The report said as the duo reached the check point, police halted the vehicle and after knowing Rashed’s identity, signalled them to proceed. However, they immediately stopped them again and ordered the duo to come out of the car.The report said as Rashed came out of the car, the check-post in-charge inspector Liakat Ali shot him three times.Shortly after the incident, an operative of the intelligence agency and villagers from nearby area came to the scene and found Rashed lying in a pool of blood but alive. However, when the intelligence agency operative wanted to record the video of the scene identifying himself, police snatched away his handset and the identity card.According to the report, the policemen delayed in taking Rashed to a hospital in Cox’s Bazar. When he was brought to the hospital, the doctors declared him dead on arrival and described the delay as an “ill strategy of police”.Police is yet to issue any formal statement. A local police officer claimed that an altercation between Rashed and the policemen at the check-point took place after they halted his vehicle and attempted a search suspecting him and his associate as robbers. Rashed allegedly brandished his pistol, prompting the inspector to fire the gunshots in “self defence”.According to the police officer, foreign liquor and cannabis were recovered during a search at the rest house where Rashed and his associate were staying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-pm-hasina-assures-proper-probe-trial-in-retired-army-major-killing/story-8YXlNFVtQEZbQplUQzTnsO.html
05-08-2020||World||Trump encourages mail voting in key battleground Florida after months of criticising method||In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump now is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of Florida to vote by mail after months of criticising the practice, and only days after threatening to sue Nevada over a new vote-by-mail law.His encouragement follows a surge in Democratic requests to vote for mail in Florida, a state that Trump almost certainly must win to secure a second term. Democrats currently have about 1.9 million Floridians signed up to vote by mail this November, almost 600,000 more than the Republicans’ 1.3 million, according to the Florida Secretary of State.In 2016, both sides had about 1.3 million signed up before the general election.“Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True. Florida’s Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot & Vote by Mail!,” Trump tweeted Tuesday.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany rejected the notion that the president has changed his views. She said he supports absentee voting by mail for a reason, as opposed to states mailing out ballots to all voters regardless of whether they requested them. Most election officials say there is little effective difference between absentee voting and voting by mail.Trump elaborated on why he supports voting by mail in Florida, but not elsewhere.“They’ve been doing this over many years and they’ve made it really terrific,” Trump said.“This took years to do,” he added. “This doesn’t take weeks or months. In the case of Nevada, they’re going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can’t do that.”Yet Florida hardly has a history of flawless elections, most notably in 2000 when the state’s disputed vote count had to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, delivering the presidency to George W. Bush over Al Gore.Trump cited a New York race as an example of what can go wrong, claiming no one could know the winner. In that race, a judge ruled Monday that about 1,000 disputed ballots should be counted. That will likely not affect the outcome since the incumbent, longtime Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney is leading her closest challenger by about 3,700 votes.“I think they have to do the election over. That election is no good,” Trump said.More voters during this year’s primary elections opted to vote by mail, and several states relaxed restrictions for voting absentee through the mail. Trump himself voted by mail in the Florida primary earlier this year.Five states have relied on mail-in ballots since even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person, but there is no evidence to support Trump’s assertion that voting by mail leads to widespread fraud.Trump has gone so far as to suggest by tweet that the November election should be delayed “until people can properly, securely and safely vote.”States that use mail-in votes exclusively say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn’t disrupt the vote. Election security experts say voter fraud is rare in all forms of balloting, including by mail.With Florida’s large retirement population, voting by mail is expected to become a more popular option this November. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was asked Saturday if he had concerns about the option. “No, I’m not concerned about mail-in voting in Florida,” he said tersely.Florida GOP officials welcomed Trump’s tweet.“Thank you for the clarification Mr President! This is very helpful,” said Joe Gruters, the chair of Florida’s Republican Party. “Florida will deliver you the 29 electoral votes!”Florida is considered a must-win state for Trump’s reelection prospects. Its presidential contests are usually close, with Trump winning by just 1.2 percentage points in 2016, and George W. Bush winning Florida by just 537 votes in 2000.Nevada lawmakers have recently passed a bill that would add the state to a growing list of U.S. states mailing active voters ballots ahead of the November election.The bill, which was passed Sunday, was signed into law Monday by Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat.

05-08-2020||World||Massive Beirut blast kills more than 70, injures thousands||A massive explosion rocked Beirut on Tuesday, flattening much of the city’s port, damaging buildings across the capital and sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky. More than 70 people were killed and 3,000 injured, with bodies buried in the rubble, officials said.The blast struck with the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake, according to Germany’s geosciences center GFZ, and it was heard and felt as far away as Cyprus more than 200 kilometers (180 miles) across the Mediterranean.Also read: Beirut blast area housed highly-explosive materials, says Lebanese internal security chiefThe sudden devastation overwhelmed a country already struggling with both the coronavirus pandemic and an economic crisis. For hours afterward, ambulances rushing in from around Lebanon carried away the wounded. Hospitals quickly filled beyond capacity, pleading for blood supplies, and generators to keep their lights on.For blocks around the port, where the explosion took place, bloodied residents staggered through streets lined with overturned cars and littered with rubble from shattered buildings. Windows and doors were blown out kilometers (miles) away. Army helicopters helped battle fires raging at Beirut’s port.The cause of the blast was not immediately known, but initial reports suggested a fire had detonated a warehouse at the port.Abbas Ibrahim, chief of Lebanese General Security, said it might have been caused by highly explosive material that was confiscated from a ship some time ago and stored at the port. Local television channel LBC said the material was sodium nitrate. Witnesses reported seeing a strange orange-colored cloud like that which appears when toxic nitrogen dioxide gas is released after an explosion involving nitrates.Also read: Massive blast shakes Lebanon’s capital Beirut, hundreds injuredThe explosion came amid ongoing tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah military group on Lebanon’s southern border. Many residents reported hearing planes overhead just before the blast, fueling rumors of an attack, though Israeli military overflights are common. An Israeli government official said Israel “had nothing to do” with the blast. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the news media. Israeli officials usually do not comment on “foreign reports.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo extended his “deepest condolences” to the people of Beirut and said the United States is closely monitoring the situation. “Our team in Beirut has reported to me the extensive damage to a city and a people that I hold dear, an additional challenge in a time of already deep crisis,” Pompeo said in a written statement.The blast was stunning even for a city that has seen civil war, suicide bombings and bombardment by Israel.“It was a real horror show. I haven’t seen anything like that since the days of the (civil) war,” said Marwan Ramadan, who was about 500 meters (yards) from the port and was knocked off his feet by the force of the explosion.Health Minister Hassan Hamad said the preliminary toll was more than 70 dead and more than 3,000 wounded. Emergency teams streamed in from across Lebanon to help, and the injured had to be taken to hospitals outside the capital. Hamad added that hospitals were barely coping and offers of aid were pouring in from Arab states and friends of Lebanon.Beirut’s governor, Marwan Abboud, broke into tears as he toured the site, exclaiming, “Beirut is a devastated city.” Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed that “those responsible will pay.”Initially, video taken by residents showed a fire raging at the port, sending up a giant column of smoke, illuminated by flashes of what appeared to be fireworks. Local TV stations reported that a fireworks warehouse was involved. The fire then appeared to spread to a nearby building, triggering a more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and generating a shock wave.Also read: Massive blast at Beirut port injures dozens across capitalOne of Israel’s top bomb experts, Boaz Hayoun, said fireworks could have been a factor setting off the bigger blast. “Before the big explosion, ... in the center of the fire, you can see sparks, you can hear sounds like popcorn and you can hear whistles,” said Hayoun, owner of the Tamar Group, which works closely with the Israeli government on safety and certification issues involving explosives. “This is very specific behavior of fireworks.”Charbel Haj, who works at the port, said it started as small explosions like firecrackers. Then, he said, he was thrown off his feet by the huge blast. His clothes were torn.Some of those injured lay on the ground at the port, Associated Press staff at the scene said. A civil defense official said there were still bodies inside the port, many under debris.Outside one hospital, Omar Kinno sat on the pavement, holding back tears. Kinno, a Syrian, said one of his sisters was killed when the blast rocked their apartment near the port, and another sister’s neck was broken. His injured mother and father were taken to a hospital but he didn’t know which, and he was making calls trying to track them down.“I have no idea what happened to my parents. I am totally lost,” he said.Confusion reigned across the city, as people cleared out of damaged homes or tried to locate family. Motorcyclists picked their way through traffic, carrying the injured.One woman covered in blood from the waist up walked down a trashed street while talking furiously on her phone. On another street, a woman with a bloodied face looked distraught, staggering through traffic with two friends at her side.“This country is cursed,” a young man passing by muttered.The blast came at a time when Lebanon’s economy is facing collapse from the financial crisis and the coronavirus restrictions. Many have lost jobs, while the worth of their savings has evaporated as the currency has plunged in value against the dollar. The result has thrown many into poverty.Several of Beirut’s hospitals were damaged in the blast. Roum Hospital put out a call for people to bring it spare generators to keep its electricity going as it evacuated patients because of heavy damage.Outside the St. George University Hospital in Beirut’s Achrafieh neighborhood, people with various injuries arrived in ambulances, in cars and on foot. The explosion had caused major damage inside the building and knocked out the electricity at the hospital. Dozens of injured were being treated on the spot on the street outside, on stretchers and wheelchairs.“This is a catastrophe we have on our hands,” said one doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make press statements.The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said one of its ships in the port was damaged and a number of its peacekeepers were injured, some seriously.It was reminiscent of massive blasts during Lebanon’s civil war and took place only three days before a U.N.-backed tribunal was set to give its verdict in the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a truck bombing more than 15 years ago. That explosion, with a ton of explosives, was felt kilometers (miles) away, just like Tuesday’s explosion.French President Emmanuel Macron said in a tweet that his country was sending aid. Israel offered emergency assistance through international intermediaries, its Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Iran, Hezbollah’s patron, also said it was ready to help. “Stay strong, Lebanon,” its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/27-dead-about-2-500-wounded-in-beirut-blasts-health-minister/story-0Y5tORDGjzMydR9yzRdLGJ.html

In India alone, a minimum of 30 million school students are adversely affected. In poorer countries, schools provide not only education but also nutrients, food and life skills. A conservative estimate is that disruption in school education may continue for at least four months more.”Also read: UN chief says 1 billion students affected by Covid-19 closuresAccording to a global projection covering 180 countries by the UN education agency UNESCO and partner organisations, some 23.8 million additional children and youths from pre-primary school to university level are at risk of dropping out or not having access to school next year due to the pandemic’s economic impact.“We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people,” Guterres said in a video message and a 26-page policy briefing. “The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people, and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come.”According to the policy briefing, “the unparalleled education disruption” from the pandemic is far from over and as many as 100 countries have not yet announced a date for schools to reopen.Guterres called for action in four key areas, the first being reopening schools. “Once local transmission of Covid-19 is under control,” he said, “getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority.”Guterres said increasing financing for education must be given priority. Before the pandemic, low- and middle-income countries faced an education funding gap of $1.5 trillion annually, he said, and the gap in education financing globally could increase by 30% because of the pandemic.The secretary-general said education initiatives must target “those at greatest risk of being left behind”, including youngsters in crises, minorities, and the displaced and disabled. And these initiatives should urgently seek to bridge the digital divide that has become even more evident during the Covid-19 crisis, he said.On a positive note, Guterres said the pandemic is providing “a generational opportunity to reimagine education” and leap forward to systems that deliver quality education.Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Delhi’s Springdales School, said: “There is no doubt this is one of the greatest human crises that has taken place. And its largest impact has been felt on children — regular students, more so children in rural areas across the world because they have absolutely no access to education. So there is no doubt an entire aspect of learning that will be affected by the pandemic because there are these ages of learning that will face a gap at different levels because of the pandemic, whether it is the foundation, primary, middle level or another level.”Educationist Meeta Sengupta said that the “continuity of learning” is the first step for bringing back students to classrooms whenever the schools reopen. “We need to start working as a community to create a mesh network of the internet to make it available to the poor. There should be measures to raise funds for digital devices and internet connection to enable children from poor families to continue learning at their homes. The continuity should not break because once students step out of learning; coming back is very difficult. The relationship between students and schools should be continued,” she said.Findings from a National Statistical Office survey on social consumption on education, conducted in 2017-18, show that India’s gross enrolment ratio was 99.2 between primary and middle school education level. It is the ratio of the number of persons currently enrolled in a particular level of education to the number of persons in the corresponding official age group. For example, the ratio of 99.2 in primary to middle school level means for every 100 persons in the age group of 6 to 13 years, there are 99.2 students enrolled in Classes 1 to 8. To be sure, this does not mean nearly everyone in the age group of 6 to 13 years is enrolled in school because some of the students in Classes 1 to 8 would be students from other age groups, particularly above the age of 13, who enrol at a age higher than the one recommended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-effect-on-students-a-catastrophe-may-hurt-decades-of-progress-un/story-EWOIDwq2m9LrWjOiVd6QWK.html
05-08-2020||World||Donald Trump defends US’ testing, cites India’s handling of coronavirus||President Donald Trump on Tuesday used India’s statistics on testing coronavirus disease to defend his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States and said that the former country is having a “tremendous problem” battling the disease. The US president brought up India’s Covid-19 tests, as he has many times before, his administration’s better testing record as he battles widespread criticism of his handling of the epidemic, marked by abject denial of the threat, underplaying the magnitude of the crisis and being dismissive of social distancing norms advocated his own public health officials and member his of task force.“India has 1.4 billion people, they have 11 million tests,” he said, to contrast the 60 million tests in the United States with a population of 330 million. “I think we’re doing very well. I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flare ups and nations that they were talking about,” Trump said.Statistically, the United States has conducted most Covid-19 tests but experts suggest that it should carry out more tests as the country has already clocked 4.7 million infections and 155,000 fatalities, a quarter of the global count.The president has used either outdated numbers of Indian testing. India had conducted nearly 18 million tests by July 28, when the Axios interview was recorded, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, the official tracker. The 20 million mark was crossed on Sunday.Trump had used the same figures — of 60 million for the US and 11 million for India — at a news briefing last Friday, which did not tally what the White House said later. In a statement issued in support of Trump’s claims of better testing, the White House had said, “India has a population more than four times as large as the United States, but has only conducted around one-third of the number of tests.”In a periodic attack, the president also attacked China for the epidemic. “This was sent to us by China, one way or the other,” he said of the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China last December. “And we are never going to forget it. believe me, we are never going to forget it.”Trump brought up India-China clashes to show he takes his intelligence briefings — called the President’s Daily Brief (PBD) — seriously, and that he reads them and, he insisted, comprehends them “better” than a lot of people. The interviewer had asked about it in the context of information that was reported to have been cited in a February PBD that Russians were offering bounty to Taliban fighters for killing American forces in Afghanistan. Trump has insisted that information never reached him, and also that it was based on dubious intelligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-defends-us-testing-cites-india-s-handling-of-coronavirus/story-OvooWIUqURXm36paGsLuYJ.html

Israel’s Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told Israeli N12 television news that the explosion was most likely an accident caused by a fire. The blast occurred in the city’s port area, where there were warehouses housing explosives, Lebanon’s state news agency NNA and two security sources said. A third security source said there were chemcials stored in the area.Footage of the blast shared around by residents on social media showed a column of smoke rising from the port district followed by an enormous blast. Those who filming what initially appeared to be a big blaze where thrown backwards by the shock.It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze that set off the blast or what kind of explosives were in the warehouses. The governor of Beirut port told Sky News that a team of firefighters at the scene had “disappeared” after the explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-not-involved-in-beirut-blast-israeli-official-says/story-Acg57ejkyMCQDeZvf4lxwI.html
05-08-2020||World||Trump says Beirut explosion an ‘attack’ caused by a ‘bomb’||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the massive explosion that killed at least 78 people and wounded thousands in Beirut, Lebanon was an “attack” caused by a “bomb of some kind”.“It looks like a terrible attack,” President Trump said to reporters at a White House news briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic.When pressed for details he said he had met with “some of our great generals, and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a -- some kind of a manufacturing explosion”.He aded: “They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind.”No further details were available. Unidentified defense department officials told CNN they had no evidence to suggest it was an attack, as the president indicated.Lebanese authorities have not yet called the explosion as an attack. “I will not relax until we find the responsible party for what happened, hold it accountable and apply the most serious punishments against it because it isn’t acceptable that a shipment of ammonium nitrate — estimated to be 2,750 tons — was in a depot for the past six years without precautionary measures being taken,” a senior official said in a televised statement from Prime Minister Hassan Diab, according to The New York Time.It also quoted Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, the head of Lebanon’s general security service, hours earlier that “highly explosive materials” were stored at the site.Ammonium nitrate has been used in deadly accidents such as one in Texas in 1937 that killed over 580 people, and in bombings as in Oklahoma City in 1995 in which 168 people died.Shortly before Trump’s remarks, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, “I’d like to extend my deepest condolences to all those affected by the massive explosion at the port of Beirut today,. We are closely monitoring and stand ready to assist the people of Lebanon as they recover from this tragedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-beirut-explosion-an-attack-caused-by-a-bomb/story-4Mybage4zhqTHMQmEA0lYK.html
