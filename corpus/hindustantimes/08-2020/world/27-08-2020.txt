Of the total number of 189 applications, decisions (grants or refusals) were reached in 163 cases.The Home Office’s country policy and information note for India on notes that on September 6, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that consensual sexual acts between adults, conducted in private, was no longer an offence under Section 377 of the IPC.“The historic ruling effectively scrapped the colonial law, which deemed sex between consenting gay men, a punishable offence”, the note adds.The 189 applications based on sexual orientation were among overall 8837 asylum applications made by Indian citizens in the period 2015-19. Of all asylum applications from citizens of various countries, the grant rates are among the lowest for Indians: 3 per cent.The figures also record that the list of largest number of voluntary returns to country of origin of those either detained under immigration rules or those who are in the country illegally is topped by Indians: 1,290, or 16 per cent, in the year ending June 2020.Visitor visas issued during the year were down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chinese and Indian nationals accounted for 42 per cent of all such visas issued, but they were down 44 per cent for Chinese and 41 per cent for Indians compared to the previous year.“There were falls in the number of visitor visas granted due to travel restrictions implemented in response to Covid-19 to almost all nationalities, with the largest falls seen for: Chinese nationals, down 273,105 (-44%); Indian nationals, down 206,206 (-41%)”, the Home Office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sexual-orientation-less-indians-seek-uk-asylum-after-sc-ruling/story-vi3OLtvCOZPCD5ngdif5UI.html
27-08-2020||World||‘I looked him in the eyes’: Pakistan family watches mosque shooter face justice in New Zealand||Around 3 am each morning this week, Khurshid Alam woke up in his Pakistan home to watch survivors give testimony against the man who shot dead 51 worshippers in New Zealand mosques, including his brother, Naeem, and nephew, Talha.Divided by thousands of miles, a seven-hour time difference and the coronavirus pandemic shutting borders, Naeem’s widow, Ambreen, was among those who faced the shooter in Christchurch High Court and on Thursday heard his sentence.White supremacist Brenton Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, was jailed for life without parole for the March 2019 attacks he launched on two Christchurch mosques while livestreaming.“It was a very traumatic time, the last few days,” Alam said from his home in Lahore in eastern Pakistan. “What we have lost cannot come back, but at least we know that justice has been given.”Alam had earlier watched the address by his sister-in-law, admiring her bravery. Alam’s wife also travelled for days amid the pandemic and spent two weeks in quarantine to provide support for Ambreen, who lives in Christchurch, in court.Many victims’ families have watched from secure video links overseas and more than 50 received support to enter New Zealand, which has largely closed its borders to non-residents.Ambreen described how her life had capsized since the moment last year, standing in a hospital in the early hours of the morning after the shooting, she realised her missing husband and 21-year old-son were not among the names hospital staff read out as injured.Act of bravery “Since my husband and son passed away, I have never had a proper normal sleep,” she told the court, and the gunman, on Tuesday. “I don’t think I ever will.”She also spoke of her pride in her husband, who was posthumously awarded for courage in Pakistan for charging at the gunman, buying precious time for worshippers to escape.“Naeem died trying to save others and his act of bravery is something his sons will always feel proud for. His death was a reflection of his life,” she said.Ambreen said she felt distressed watching survivor after survivor stand up to address the shooter, but that once she had delivered her speech, she felt a surge of victory.“It was quite a relief to express my opinion in front of him,” she said. “I looked him in the eyes.”Since losing her eldest son, who had just graduated as an engineer, and her husband and “best friend”, Ambreen has cared for her two surviving sons, is learning to drive, has taken her family on the Haj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and endured New Zealand’s strict weeks-long lockdown.Throughout, she said, her anxiety grew over what would happen to the shooter.When the sentence was finally delivered on Thursday, her family from New Zealand to Pakistan felt some solace.“I miss them. It’s a lifelong struggle for me,” she said. “But I felt like Naeem and Talha were there with me. I thought: they are waiting for justice to be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-looked-him-in-the-eyes-pakistan-family-watches-mosque-shooter-face-justice-in-new-zealand/story-HEXiSrG7bKMEGCWMB7IBHL.html

Traffic was blocked on the interstate and Highway 90.“Stay inside and wait for additional direction from local officials,” Edwards wrote on Twitter.Residents of Lake Charles heard Laura’s winds howling and the sound of breaking glass as the storm passed through the city of 78,000 with winds of 85 miles per hour (137 km per hour) and gusts up to 128 mph (206 kph) in the hour after landfall.The windows of the city’s 22-floor Capital One Tower were blown out, street signs were toppled and pieces of wooden fence and debris from collapsed buildings lay scattered in the flooded streets, video footage on Twitter and Snapchat showed. Lake Charles resident Borden Wilson, a 33-year-old pediatrician, was anxiously anticipating his return home after evacuating to Minden, Louisiana.“I never even boarded up my windows. I didn’t think to do that. This is the first hurricane I’ve experienced. I just hope my house is fine,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview.Laura made landfall just before 1 a.m. as a Category 4 storm packing winds of 150 mph (240 kph) in the small town of Cameron, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It rapidly weakened to a Category 1 storm on Thursday morning with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), and was forecast to become a tropical storm later in the day. The NHC warned that high water levels would persist along the Gulf Coast for several hours as Laura moved north and then northeast.Besides threatening life, the storm slammed the heart of the US oil industry, forcing oil rigs and refineries to shut down production.The Port of Lake Charles remained closed as workers were unable to enter or exit the facility due to downed power lines and trees. The port avoided significant flooding but power was out as of Thursday morning, manager of security and safety Ed Manint said. The harbor police were assessing the damage, he said. ‘Less surge than we thought’Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Pete Gaynor told Fox News that the agency would make storm damage assessments on Thursday and had the resources to respond to the storm now, adding he expected to see significant damage from wind and building damage.“I think we’re generally fortunate - less surge than we thought,” Gaynor said.The NHC on Wednesday predicted storm surge would be “unsurvivable” and could penetrate up to 40 miles inland. While the worst projections had not materialized, damaging winds and flooding rainfall would continue spreading inland later on Thursday, the NHC said. Laura could spawn tornadoes on Thursday over Louisiana, Arkansas and western Mississippi, and was expected to drop 4 to 8 inches of rain (101 to 203 mm) across portions of that region, the NHC said.US President Donald Trump on Thursday approved an emergency declaration for Arkansas, the White House said, authorizing federal officials to coordinate relief efforts and freeing up federal funds. He had approved an emergency declaration for Texas on Monday.Trump was scheduled to visit FEMA’s headquarters in early afternoon to receive a briefing on the hurricane.The eastern coastal counties of Texas that had braced for the worst were largely spared Laura’s rage. Galveston’s acting mayor, Craig Brown, told MSNBC he was canceling the island city’s evacuation on Thursday after the storm turned more toward Louisiana. The mayor of Beaumont, Texas, Becky Ames, told MSNBC the situation was “manageable.”Texas Governor Greg Abbott was planning to travel to east Texas to survey the damage on Thursday, his spokesman said. Around 650,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana and Texas were without power early Thursday, and local utilities in the storm’s path warned outage numbers would climb as the storm marched inland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-slams-southwestern-louisiana-gutting-buildings-and-killing-at-least-one/story-D6Ef0Y7XciFwPdOu2WZGSK.html

Last week, deaths fell 17% from the prior week and below an average of 1,000 a day for the first time in weeks, according to a Reuters analysis. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHowever, while US metrics on cases, deaths, hospitalizations and test positivity rates were declining, health experts warned there could be another surge as schools reopen and colder weather forces more gatherings indoors.This week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested. This contradicted earlier guidance from the CDC, shocking doctors and politicians and prompting accusations that it may have been based not on sound science but on political pressure from the Trump administration.The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut slammed the CDC’s move as “reckless” and “not based on science,” and said they will not change testing guidelines in their states. “CDC and HHS have not shared their scientific rationale for this change in policy, which substitutes sound science-based public health guidance with the president’s misinformation,” they said in a joint statement. “Health experts recommend testing close contacts of individuals with Covid-19 to identify and prevent asymptomatic spread. This type of robust testing by our states has been a key factor in our success so far to flatten the curve in the tristate area.”On Wednesday, the top US government infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told CNN he was having surgery during discussion of the change and expressed worry about the CDC’s move. US confirmed cases are now over 5.8 million - the highest total in the world. The US death toll is also the world’s highest.On a per capita basis, the United States ranks 12th in the world for the number of deaths, with 54 deaths per 100,000 people, and tenth in the world for cases, with 1,774 cases per 100,000 residents, according to a Reuters analysis.US consumer confidence dropped in August to its lowest in more than six years, as households worried about the labor market and incomes, casting doubts on the sustainability of the economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 recession.The ebb in confidence followed the expiration of a $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement on July 31. For weeks, Republicans and Democrats have been deadlocked over the size and shape of a fifth coronavirus-response bill, on top of the approximately $3 trillion already enacted into law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-exceed-180-000-cases-continue-to-fall/story-lHcWl49VSkXoeng0CKLDyK.html

It’s a multi-organ disease, so the virus is really attacking the lungs, but also the heart and other organs,” Kluge said.“Younger people, particularly with the winter coming, will be in closer contact with the elder population,” he said. Older people and at-risk groups must protect themselves with a flu vaccination as winter approaches, a season when more hospitalisations and deaths may be expected, he added.Kluge, asked about concerns that schools could become a driver of infection, said that WHO’s 53 European member states would discuss the issue in meetings on Aug. 31 and in mid-September. “What we know is that we can’t open societies without opening the schools first,” he said. “So the key issue here is that it depends a lot on the level of transmission in the community. Basic measures have to be applied everywhere.”He added: “So far we know that the school setting has been not a main contributor to the epidemic. There is also more and more publications that adds to the body of evidence that children do play a role in the transmission, but that this is so far more linked with social gatherings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tricky-moment-for-europe-as-schools-reopen-but-not-a-driver-of-covid-19-who/story-9N1gvqJlUnVER8WMqCWLHL.html
27-08-2020||World||Russia: No signs of crime in Alexei Navalny coma case so far||Russian authorities said Thursday they have found no indication so far that opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s coma, which his allies and German doctors treating him believe may have been brought about by poisoning, was caused by a criminal act.A preliminary inquiry launched last week hasn’t found any indication of “deliberate criminal acts committed against” Navalny, Russia’s Prosecutor General’s office said. The statement comes amid growing pressure from the West to investigate the sudden illness of the Kremlin’s fiercest critic and authorities’ apparent reluctance to do so.Navalny, an opposition politician and corruption investigator who is a longtime foe of President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.Over the weekend, he was transferred to the Charité hospital in Berlin, where doctors found indications of “cholinesterase inhibitors” in his system. They are yet to identify a specific substance.Found in some drugs, pesticides and chemical nerve agents, cholinesterase inhibitors act by blocking the breakdown of a key chemical in the body, acetycholine, which transmits signals between nerve cells.Navalny’s allies insist he was deliberately poisoned and say the Kremlin was behind it, accusations that officials denounced as “empty noise.”The Russian doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia have repeatedly contested the German hospital’s conclusion, saying they had ruled out poisoning as a diagnosis and that their tests for cholinesterase inhibitors came back negative.The politician’s team submitted a request to Russia’s Investigative Committee, demanding authorities launch a criminal probe on charges of an attempt on the life of a public figure last week, but said they received no response.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday he saw no grounds for a criminal case until the cause of the politician’s condition was fully established.On Thursday, Russian police said they have been conducting a preliminary probe — an inquiry to determine whether a criminal investigation should be launched — to “establish all the circumstances of the incident.”The announcement about the inquiry came after multiple Western and European officials — including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — called upon Russia to start a full and transparent investigation into Navalny’s condition.On Wednesday night, the politician’s illness was discussed in a phone conversation between Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.According to the Kremlin’s readout of the call, Putin pointed out that “premature and unfounded accusations” were unacceptable and underscored Russia’s “interest in a thorough and objective investigation of all the circumstances of the incident.”German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Thursday once again urged Moscow to investigate Navalny’s condition.“We still expect of Moscow that a contribution be made from there to things being cleared up,” Maas said in Berlin ahead of a meeting with his counterparts from other European Union countries.“Otherwise, conjecture and speculation will remain that certainly won’t improve relations between Germany and Russia, and also relations between the EU and Russia, but will continue to weigh on them,” he said.Peskov on Thursday refused to comment on Maas’ statement and reiterated that there were no grounds for a criminal investigation.“Nothing has changed in that regard. We still, unfortunately, don’t understand what caused the condition the patient is in,” Peskov told reporters.He added that the inquiry announced by the Interior Ministry had started “in the first days” after Navalny fell ill and is routine police work “always carried out in cases like this.”The Prosecutor General’s office, in the meantime, said they reached out to Germany with a request to share their findings and clinical evidence of the alleged poisoning, adding that German law enforcement confirmed their “intention to cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-no-signs-of-crime-in-alexei-navalny-coma-case-so-far/story-BbfkAo1LceGT87UEoveGSO.html

27-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s big night: Expect talk of GOP progress, Dem anarchy||Four years ago, Donald Trump accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for president with a dark convention speech that painted a dystopian portrait of America in decline and offered a singular solution: himself.Though Trump has been president for three-and-a-half years, his rhetoric on the state of the nation has remained bleak. And as he prepares to deliver his second acceptance speech on Thursday, the president faces a country in crisis, one gripped by a once-in-a-century pandemic, a battered economy, a racial reckoning and a massive hurricane taking aim at the Gulf Coast.Though he will promise national greatness, there was little expectation he would deliver a message designed to unify the divided electorate.In 2016, his message was “I alone can fix it.” This time, while trailing in the polls, he will offer himself as the last remaining defense against radical forces threatening the American way of life.Aides have closely guarded details of the address, which was being revised the night before Trump was to speak from the White House South Lawn. While Trump has centered his recent stump speech on anarchists that he depicts overrunning city streets, aides signaled that Thursday’s speech will not be as dark as his infamous “American carnage” inaugural address.Against a backdrop of patriotism, Trump will describe America as a work in progress, one that is not perfect but has achieved much. It’s an argument meant to offer a contrast with Democrats whom the president has described as not loving their country. In a similar vein, aides said, Trump would speak to progress made on combating the coronavirus, which has been treated as something of an afterthought during much of the convention although it is still killing 1,000 Americans a day.But it is Trump’s handling of the pandemic that has sent him tumbling in the polls and maximized the pressure around his speech. And while aides recognize that few Joe Biden supporters are likely to switch sides, their goal with the speech is to set up a permissions structure for Republicans who have defected from Trump over his rhetoric or policies to come home.“He needs to give those people who don’t approve of him an excuse to be for him,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary for President George W. Bush.Fleischer said Trump should speak personally about his experiences with COVID-19 — including friends lost to the virus. And while much of the convention has been about energizing Trump’s base, Fleischer also saw openings for Trump to address the public’s concerns about social unrest and crime, particularly after violence erupted in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a white officer shot a Black man seven times.“It strikes me that the choice for Republicans, the choice for the county, is that Biden is a good man who will do a lot of bad things to the country. Trump is a pretty rough and boorish guy who has done and will do a lot of good things for the country,” Fleischer said.The Trump campaign has struggled to make this a choice election. So far, voters have instead viewed it as a referendum on how the president has handled a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 Americans and left millions unemployed.Most of the convention has been aimed at former Trump supporters or nonvoters as well as trying to drive up negative impressions of Biden so that some of his possible backers stay home. Aides said Trump is expected to deliver some direct attacks on his Democratic opponent and will sharply juxtapose the far left — whom he argues has Biden in its thrall — with the rest of the nation.But Jeff Shesol, who served as a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, said Trump should use the moment to try to broaden his appeal to moderates and independents.“Here’s a guy who’s never had 50 percent approval at any point in his presidency, who’s down in the polls considerably nationally and in many of the battleground states,” Shesol said. “If there ever was an occasion for someone to sort of extend his arms and sweep more people in, if he conceivably could, it would be this moment.”“Yet it would be unwise to suggest that he’s going to do it,” Shesol said, “or that he, you know, is capable of doing it.”Trump met with top aides Wednesday afternoon to edit the speech before traveling to Baltimore to support Vice President Mike Pence’s turn in the convention spotlight. Further revisions could come until shortly before he was to appear on the White House lawn.New security fencing went up around the perimeter of the White House complex to prepare for possible protesters — some in town for a civil rights march on Friday. Aides were not certain if the noise from protesters would be heard during the speech. Earlier in the summer, demonstrators were audible during some outdoor presidential events.Stripped of the ability to do his mega-rallies, Trump has few set pieces left in the race’s remaining 68 days to overtake Biden. Beyond the fall debates, Thursday’s speech may be his biggest moment, but historians say there are few acceptance speeches that have truly altered races.Franklin Roosevelt’s 1932 speech, in which he laid out the New Deal, set the course for his time in office. George H.W. Bush’s 1988 speech, which helped him win that year, also tripped up his reelection bid four years later after he broke his “read my lips: no new taxes” promise, said presidential historian Julian Zelizer of Princeton University.“He’ll offer a few lines, I’m sure, about building a consensus,” Zelizer said. “But the focus will be divisive comments, dark rhetoric and blaming his failures on his enemy. It will be classic Trumpism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-big-night-expect-talk-of-gop-progress-dem-anarchy/story-E64divSaEgv3ZsJNg3BwxL.html
27-08-2020||World||Donald Trump caps Republican convention with pitch for a second White House term||President Donald Trump will make a crucial pitch for a second term in the White House on Thursday with a keynote address at the Republican National Convention highlighting his record in office and charting a path for the next four years.The former New York businessman’s speech on the White House South Lawn, an unusual location for a partisan event, will cap a four-day convention that has portrayed him as a leader who can restore order after months of protests over racial injustice and revive an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.Trump is seeking to turn around a re-election campaign that has been overshadowed by the pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 people in the United States and put millions of Americans out of work.With just over two months before the Nov. 3 vote, Democrat Joe Biden is leading in opinion polls in part because of public discontent with Trump’s handling of the health crisis.Trump, a former reality television host, and his advisers have set up his speech with a producer’s eye. He will address the nation with the White House as his backdrop, irking critics who say he is flouting conventional norms by hosting a political event on such historic grounds.The president, who faced criticism earlier this year for not articulating a clear vision for a second term, will be sharing his policy plans on Thursday and in upcoming speeches on the campaign trail, a campaign official said.Fireworks are expected over Washington’s nearby monuments at the conclusion of Trump’s speech accepting his party’s presidential nomination. He will address a large crowd on the lawn despite warnings against such gatherings because of the pandemic, which has forced both political parties to scale back their conventions and turn events mostly virtual.Trump’s campaign says precautions against the coronavirus will be taken. The president often boasts about his crowd sizes; his campaign has largely done away with his signature rallies because of the virus.‘NOT GROUNDED IN REALITY’Also on Thursday, in a bit of counter-programming, Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris plans to deliver a speech in Washington characterizing the Republican convention as a dishonest distraction from the White House’s pandemic response.“Part of what I will be talking about is that they’re dealing in lies but also they are not grounded in reality,” Harris said during a fundraising event on Wednesday. “People are grieving. They’re grieving the loss of lives and the people they’ve loved. They’re grieving the loss of jobs. They’re grieving the loss of normalcy and consistency.”Democrats have criticized Trump’s aggressive response to demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis.On Wednesday Trump said he was sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after violent protests there in the wake of the latest shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by police. Republicans at the convention have embraced his “law and order” approach and falsely accused Biden of trying to “defund the police.”Republican officials had promised an uplifting and hopeful convention this week, though many speakers have used their time to paint dire portraits of chaos and the advent of socialism in the United States if Democrats win the White House.Trump kicked off the week on Monday by accusing Democrats of seeking to steal the election by advocating for mail-in voting. His previous high profile speeches have also emphasized grim themes, including his inaugural address in January 2017 that described “American carnage.”Other speakers scheduled for Thursday include Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson; attorney Rudy Giuliani, a fierce critic of the Bidens, and religious leader Franklin Graham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-caps-republican-convention-with-pitch-for-a-second-white-house-term/story-K3p9nGeBagOoShtCdh4qRP.html
27-08-2020||World||Unicef report flags unequal access to online classes across globe||At least a third of the world’s schoolchildren, which works to around 463 million, could not access remote learning since schools have been shut down because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak since early this year, according to a new report released by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) on Thursday. Also read: Covid-19 spreading fast as billions don’t have water to wash hands, says UNThe report has been released amid several states in India have started taking steps on reopening schools, despite the contagion. Around 1.5 billion schoolchildren are affected by closures during lockdown across the world, said Unicef’s Remote Learning Reachability report, which underlines the limitations of remote learning and exposes deep inequalities in access and prioritise reopening schools safely.In India, at least 1.5 million schools are closed because of the pandemic, which is affecting 286 million students from pre-primary to secondary levels, of which 49% are girls. Another 6 million girls and boys were already out of schools prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Unicef.“Schools are closed, parents are out of work and families are under a growing strain. An entire generation of children have seen their education and learning interrupted. Access to digital education is limited and by itself cannot solve the learning gap. Blended approaches are needed involving communities, parents, volunteers to reach out to these children and support their learning activities,” said Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, India Representative, Unicef.Globally, 49% of schoolchildren are in their primary classes. Reopening of schools is a challenge in India because of the large size of classrooms and poor infrastructure at several institutions. Many of these schools have limited washrooms and cramped canteens, where maintaining social distancing norms is not always possible. “It’s difficult for children to wear masks and follow hygiene and social distancing norms, whether it is at school, on their way to school, or in the playground. This makes reopening of schools safely a massive challenge. The central and state governments are using the online portal Diksha; TV channels like Doordarshan and Swayam Prabha and the National Repository of Open Education Resources; and other platforms for continuing education at home. Radio is also a great way to reach children in remote areas and should be used for distance learning,” said Dr Rajesh Sagar, a professor of psychiatry at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Around 24% households in India have access to the internet, but connectivity is patchy across states. The situation is likely to be far worse for children at home, according to experts. Access to technology and tools at home is a challenge and children may not be able to use them to learn remotely. This is because of several competing factors such as sharing the gadgets with parents and other siblings, additional pressure to do home tasks, and also because of the absence of online curriculum support for quality education content in many Indian languages. The Unicef report found that a country’s choice of remote learning technology appears to be influenced by their income group. For example, radio-based instruction is implemented at much higher rates by low-income countries (80%) than lower middle-income (56%) and upper-middle-income (46%) countries.Internet- and TV-based instruction is much less common among low-income countries (47% and 60%, respectively), while these methods are implemented by a much larger share of lower middle-income countries (79% and 82% cent, respectively) and upper-middle-income countries (95% and 92%, respectively), the report stated. The report, which compiled data from over 100 countries, used a globally representative analysis on the availability of home-based technology and tools needed for remote learning among pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schoolchildren. The data included access to TV, radio and internet, and the availability of curriculum delivered across these platforms during school closures.The report found students in sub-Saharan Africa are the most affected, as remote learning proved elusive to at least 50% of them. “For at least 463 million children whose schools closed due to Covid-19, there was no such a thing as remote learning. The sheer number of children whose education was completely disrupted for months on end is a global education emergency. The repercussions could be felt in economies and societies for decades to come,” said Henrietta Fore, executive director, Unicef, at the launch of the report on Thursday..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unequal-access-to-online-classes-widening-learning-gap-unicef-report/story-f0H98ZoBTDNTZWUm8gZFIK.html

It reported damage to houses and public facilities in North Hwanghae and South Hwanghae provinces, where the typhoon made landfall. Roads were also flooded in the city of Nampo, which is closer to Pyongyang.In South Korea, the Ministry of the Interior and Safety reported damages to buildings, walls, roads and other structures.By Thursday afternoon, power had been restored to most of more than 9,300 South Korean homes, including over 3,500 in cities and towns near Seoul and around 900 in the southern resort island of Jeju, which was hit by the typhoon on Wednesday.More than 470 domestic flights in and out of Jeju and the southern mainland city of Busan were canceled. South Korean authorities also halted some railroad services, shut down public parks and sea bridges and moved hundreds of fishing boats and passenger vessels to safety.Workers in Seoul and other major cities were restoring makeshift coronavirus testing stations that had been dismantled out of concerns that the tents and booths wouldn’t have withstood the strong winds.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said earlier this week that leader Kim Jong Un had called for thorough preparations to minimize casualties and damage from the typhoon. Fishing boats were moved and buildings, farms and railroads reinforced, according to state media.The storm comes weeks after torrential rains caused flooding and massive damage to homes and crops in North Korea, inflicting further pain to an economy ravaged by border closures over the pandemic and U.S.-led sanctions over Kim’s nuclear program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-damages-buildings-floods-roads-on-korean-peninsula/story-bM8daHN0y2SUx3Q5QzjPsI.html

The incident has led to a fresh wave of protests across the country, which had started after the shooting of George Floyd.Officer Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the police force in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot Blake seven times at point blank range while three of his children watched in the Midwestern city.Blake survived, but may be paralysed for life.The Wisconsin Department of Justice also gave the official account of Blake’s shooting for the first time on Wednesday, saying he had a knife in possession when Sheskey opened fire.“Mr Blake walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward. While holding onto Mr Blake’s shirt, Officer Rusten Sheskey fired his service weapon 7 times. Officer Sheskey fired the weapon into Mr Blake’s back,” the department said in a statement.It was not clear from the statement if the knife, recovered from inside the car, was in Blake’s hands when he was shot.The US Department of Justice announced late on Wednesday that it was opening a civil rights investigation into Blake’s shooting.Protests over the incident have descended into violence across the US. The governor of Minnesota declared a state of peacetime emergency on the city of Minneapolis after violent protests erupted on Wednesday night following the death of a Black homicide suspect who police say shot himself.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed a curfew following what he described as mass looting of businesses, destruction of property and unrest. Authorities also said there was misinformation spread in relation to the death of the suspect.Many sportsmen and women have also showed their support with NBA basketball players, tennis star Naomi Osaka, baseball and soccer players all pulling out of fixtures in protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-cop-who-shot-jacob-blake-in-the-back-7-times-named-more-details-of-incident-revealed/story-oMETyLUp7YtMtsobj2vnzI.html

Videos on social media showed heavy winds and rain battering a tall building, blowing out windows and littering glass and debris into the air and onto the ground as the hurricane moved over southwestern Louisiana.The damage was observed in Lake Charles, which is about 45 miles (72 kilometres) north of where the storm made the landfall.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) hurricane-chasing airplane gave people a rare glimpse of the conditions inside Laura as it passed through the hurricane. A time-lapse video of the journey was shared by Nick Underwood of the NOAA on Twitter. Kermit (#NOAA42) flew through Hurricane #Laura FIVE times today.

It did not provide further details and could not be reached for comment. Hong Kong media identified one of those on the vessel as Andy Li, who media said was recently arrested under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing on its freest city on June 30. The security legislation, opposed by many in Hong Kong, punishes what Beijing broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. The Hong Kong government, police and security bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Taiwan has proved a popular destination for Hong Kong people aiming to leave their city as Beijing tightens its grip, with the self-ruled island’s President Tsai Ing-wen pledging to help those who arrive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-arrests-at-least-10-at-sea-hong-kong-media-say-suspects-fleeing-to-taiwan/story-DoWYePFLxxcCB5WMtzKdSN.html

The National Hurricane Center said the storm, which intensified rapidly on Wednesday, came ashore at 1 am on Thursday.A Weather Channel meteorologist had a narrow escape from the falling debris while reporting Hurricane Laura’s landfall. Stephanie Abrams was continuously moving back and forth to maintain her balance and was struggling to provide live coverage as the winds pushed her to one side.Videos and photos surfaced on social media showing the ruthless impact of Laura as streets were covered with water closer to the coast of Lake Charles in Louisiana.Authorities urged coastal residents of Louisiana and Texas to evacuate. After initial refusal, people decided to vacate their premises after strong winds started moving trees back and forth.Laura will be the seventh named storm to strike the United States in 2020 setting a new record for landfalls by the end of August.Apart from Laura, here is a look at other tropical storms that are headed towards Mexico:1. Tropical Storm Hernan is expected to curve toward the southern tip of Baja California and may swing near the coast around the resort of Puerto Vallarta. The National Hurricane Center said Hernan had wind speeds of about 65 kmph and was located about 300 km south of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.2. Tropical Storm Iselle, formed within hours is also expected to curve towards the southern tip of Baja California. It formed further offshore, about 1,095 km southwest of the tip of the Mexican state.Both these tropical storms are likely to decline to tropical depressions later in the week.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-laura-makes-landfall-in-louisiana-a-look-at-other-tropical-storms-heading-towards-mexico/story-Ds0qukY90URVyiv8ZIBvmJ.html

27-08-2020||World||Working fast to resolve problem in India, TikTok founder tells employees||Chinese software developer Bytedance, which owns TikTok, is moving fast to resolve problems it is facing in India and the US, its founder Zhang Yiming said Thursday, hours after the embattled company’s top executive quit a few months into the job.“…we are moving fast to find solutions to the problems we face globally, especially in India and the United States,” Beijing-based Zhang told his employees in a letter.Zhang’s letter was released after the company’s chief executive Kevin Mayer quit TikTok, which has been banned in India and accused by the Donald Trump administration of breaching US’s national security.Thirty-six-year-old Zhang’s letter seemed an attempt to assuage the worries of those working in the company, which is under increasing international scrutiny for its ties with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).“First of all, I want to thank Kevin for joining us when we encountered our biggest challenges—especially in India and the United States,” Zhang wrote in Mandarin.“Second, I hope everyone understands that we are moving fast to find solutions to the problems we face globally, especially in India and the United States. I can’t say too much now. But I can guarantee that we are looking for solutions that are in line with the interests of users, creators, partners, and employees,” Zhang wrote.The Indian government banned the popular short-video sharing app TikTok on June 29, two weeks after Indian and Chinese troops violently clashed in eastern Ladakh, causing fatalities on both sides for the first time in decades.Dozens of other Chinese apps were also banned.Also Read: How to download all your videos from TikTok before you lose access to the appIn a statement, New Delhi said the apps were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.“The compilation of the data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,” the statement added. The company denied breaking any law in India.“TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government,” TikTok India tweeted the statement after the ban.The company faced new problems in the US weeks after.In early August, US President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok on the basis of national security concerns.Trump then signed two Presidential executive orders banning US transactions with the Chinese companies that own TikTok and WeChat, owned by Chinese tech giant, Tencent, saying Washington must take “aggressive action” in the interest of national security.TikTok this week sued the US government over the executive orders.Until recently, TikTok was one of the most downloaded mobile apps.According to the report by Sensor Tower, which provides market intelligence and analysis on the mobile app market, said in April that TikTok had crossed the 2 billion-mark.Of the 2 billion, Indians had downloaded the app 611 million times, the most in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-fast-to-resolve-problem-in-india-tiktok-founder-tells-employees/story-3897NjxHdT2vTr99SMRNxO.html
27-08-2020||World||Hurricane Laura makes landfall in southwestern Louisiana near Texas||Hurricane Laura made landfall in southwestern Louisiana as a ferocious Category 4 monster with 150 mph winds early Thursday, swamping a low-lying coast with ocean water that forecasters said could be 20 feet deep and unsurvivable.The National Hurricane Center said the storm, which intensified rapidly Wednesday before plowing into land, came ashore at 1 a.m. CDT near Cameron, a 400-person community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the Texas border.“Potentially catastrophic impacts will continue,” forecasters said.Also read: ‘Unsurvivable’ storm surge feared as Hurricane Laura strengthens to Category 4Winds gusted above hurricane force to 127 mph (204 kph) while Laura’s northern eyewall moved onshore over Cameron Parish. Forecasters said even stronger winds were possible that could rip apart buildings, level trees and toss vehicles like toys.Authorities had implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate, but not everyone did before howling winds began buffeting trees back and forth in an area that was devastated by Rita in 2005.Video and photos on social media showed torrents of rain flying sideways past street lights in Lake Charles, and streets covered with water closer to the coast. A sudden storm surge knocked over cameras meant to capture the hurricane’s effects.With hours of violent weather ahead, officials said the extent of destruction likely wouldn’t be clear until daybreak, when search and rescue missions will begin.Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico, the system arrived early Thursday during high tide as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.“It looks like it’s in full beast mode, which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way,” University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.Also read: Hurricane Laura poses biggest storm threat to US oil output in 15 yearsHurricane-force winds extending 60 miles (95 kilometers) from the storm’s center neared the coast, forecasters said, and bands of heavy rain fell 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the beach in Lake Charles.Maximum sustained winds increased to 150 mph (241 kph) before nightfall, and forecasters said up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings as the storm pushed on to land, but there were no immediate reports of damage. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were without power in Texas and Louisiana.One major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore with tropical storm-force winds. Earlier Wednesday, winds picked up as shoppers rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre.Trent Savoie, 31, said he was staying put. “With four kids and 100 farm animals, it’s just hard to move out,” he said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards fretted that the dire predictions were not resonating despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.Officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles in coastal Cameron Parish, which could be completely covered by ocean water.“It’s a very sad situation,” said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. “We did everything we could to encourage them to leave.”Edwards activated the state’s entire National Guard. In Lake Charles, Guard members drove school buses around neighborhoods, offering to pick up families. Across the state line in Port Arthur, Texas, few stragglers boarded evacuation buses, and city officials announced that two C-130 transport planes offered the last chance to leave.A Category 4 hurricane can render wide areas uninhabitable for weeks or months and knock out power for just as long. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining under the coronavirus pandemic. The parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders included areas turning up high rates of positive Covid-19 tests.The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura’s storm surge, from 10 feet (3 meters) just days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.On Twitter, President Donald Trump urged coastal residents to heed officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometers). Storm surge warnings extended from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.For some, the decision to leave home left them with no place to stay. Wary of opening mass shelters during a pandemic, Texas officials instead put evacuees in hotels, but Austin stopped taking arrivals before dawn because officials said they ran out of rooms. Other evacuees called the state’s 211 information line and were directed to Ennis, outside Dallas, only to be told after driving hundreds of miles no hotels or vouchers were available.Taniquia Ned and her sisters showed up without money to rent a room, saying the family had burned through its savings after losing jobs because of the coronavirus. “The Covid-19 is just totally wiping us out,” said Shalonda Joseph, 43, a teacher in Port Arthur.Edwards lamented that the storm meant suspension of community testing for Covid-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana open and students return to college campuses.Forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns.Laura was expected to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it’s expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the Northeast.Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. She and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland. Almost 15 years have passed since Hurricane Rita destroyed the city.“The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again.”The hurricane also threatened a center of the U.S. energy industry as the majority of Gulf oil and natural gas production shut down. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes, however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.Laura will be the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-makes-landfall-in-southwestern-louisiana-near-texas/story-7OMHHv0tuTh9EnVMcjJN7I.html
27-08-2020||World||National Guard activated after downtown Minneapolis unrest||The governor of Minnesota activated the National Guard on Wednesday night to help quell unrest that broke out in downtown Minneapolis following what authorities said was misinformation about the suicide death of a Black homicide suspect.“We once again see the unrest on our streets. And not just Minnesota but as a nation, this pain continues on,” Gov. Tim Walz said at a late night news conference.Walz declared a peacetime emergency in Minneapolis and said he was mobilizing the Minnesota National Guard but did not say how many troops were being deployed. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed a curfew Wednesday night until 6 a.m. Thursday and requested National Guard help after people broke windows and stole merchandise from downtown stores.“Minneapolis, it’s time to heal. We must rebuild and recover. Dangerous, unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,” the Democratic governor said in a statement.Minneapolis was rocked by protests that turned violent after George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, died after a white police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes on May 25. Floyd’s death sparked protests worldwide. Demonstrators also have gathered in downtown Minneapolis this week to protest after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot multiple times by police in Wisconsin on Sunday, leaving him paralyzed.In Minneapolis, Floyd’s death set off several nights of violence, including the burning of a Minneapolis police precinct office, until Walz activated the National Guard. South Minneapolis, where Floyd was arrested, and North Minneapolis saw the brunt of vandalism, but downtown Minneapolis was largely spared.TV footage and reporter’s tweets Wednesday night showed people grabbing merchandise at a Saks OFF 5TH store, a fire at a British pub and broken windows on the door and shrimp scattered on the sidewalk outside Ruth’s Chris Steak House. Minnesota Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said fireworks were being set off and bottles thrown late Wednesday, and there were reports of gunshots.Police were making arrests and trying to clear downtown, Schnell told reporters. The number of arrests would not be available until Thursday morning, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said. One officer was hospitalized with a serious injury that was not life-threatening, Elder said.The Minnesota State Patrol has mobilized about 150 troopers and all available metro area state troopers in response to the unrest in Minneapolis, Walz said.“This is part of a larger narrative. It was the flash point of George Floyd, it has spread across this nation. It does us no good to try and either divide or ignore or to make it worse or to blame someone. We’re just, as a state and as a nation, going to have to come together and figure out what our next steps are,” Walz told reporters.Frey said during a news conference Wednesday night that he and Walz had been in contact to address the unrest. Frey said bolstering enforcement was an effort to “stay ahead of the game as much as possible.”“What we’re calling for right now is peace,” Frey said. “What we’re calling for right now is for people to return to their homes.”Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo dispelled rumors on social media about the death of an unidentified Black man suspected in a Wednesday afternoon homicide, who later fatally shot himself on the Nicollet Mall as officers approached. The incident, which was captured on city surveillance video and released by police within 90 minutes, nonetheless sparked protests and looting in the heart of downtown.The video confirmed the police account of what happened and showed the man glancing over his shoulder before pulling out the gun and firing, then collapsing to the ground as a half-dozen witnesses ran away with their hands in the air, according to the Star Tribune. The officers, one of whom had his gun drawn, shooed a remaining witness away and kicked the suspect’s gun away before performing chest compressions.“This is not an officer-related incident,” Arradondo said. “We’re compounding more tragedy by the destruction and folks wanting to do harm to our communities in our downtown sector this evening.”“This is my city. We will not tolerate that,” he continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-guard-activated-after-downtown-minneapolis-unrest/story-sue0CihptEeL2jOaguvH9M.html
27-08-2020||World||Pence accepts nomination, calls Biden Trojan horse for radical left||Vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday accepted the Republican party’s renomination, calling Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for President, a “Trojan horse” for the radical left wing of his party, reprising the Trump campaign’s chief argument against the challenger.Republicans are framing the November 3 election as a choice between themselves as protectors of law and order against an onslaught by the radical wing of the Democratic party, which, they argue has a stranglehold on Biden, on this and the issues of taxation, education, and climate change.Pence deployed that line of attack as the United States struggled to come to grips with yet another shooting of a black man by a white police officer. This time in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which led to the killing of two persons during clashes between anti-racism protestors and armed white militiamen.“When you consider their agenda, it’s clear: Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for a radical left,” Pence said in his prepared remarks, seeking to discredit the Democratic nominee in the eyes of American voters by tying him to the extreme wing of his party.Pence delivered the acceptance speech from Fort McHenry, a historical monument in Baltimore, an hour’s drive from Washington DC. Its survival against unrelenting night-long bombardment by the British navy in 1812 inspired the American national anthem “The Star Spangled Banner”.“Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country,” Pence said on the third day of the convention, attacking Biden. The Trump administration, on the other hand, he added, “will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and colour.”Pence went on to defend the president and his policies. “He does things in his own way, on his own terms,” he said, seeking to make sense of and explain Trump’s chaotic presidency, as had First Lady Melania Trump in her speech to the convention on Tuesday.“Not much gets past him, and when he has an opinion, he’s liable to share it. He’s certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people,” Pence added.The vice-president, who heads the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak, predictably defended the administration’s response against persisting criticism that it was confused, sluggish and, worse, marked by stark disregard of the advice of its own public health experts.The United States has been hit the worst by the epidemic — with nearly 6 million cases and 180,000 deaths.“But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who have lost loved ones. We mourn with those who mourn, and we grieve with those who grieve,” the vice-president said, striking a different note from other speakers who have either tended to only praise Trump’s response to the epidemic or ignored it altogether. “And this night, I know millions of Americans will pause and pray for God’s comfort to each of you.”President Trump will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday, the last day of the convention, from the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-accepts-nomination-calls-biden-trojan-horse-for-radical-left/story-ruF5DI1iLoT9y2qWjRJuTP.html
27-08-2020||World||UN chief to renew call to India, G20 nations to invest in sustainable transition post-Covid||UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres will renew his call to India and other G20 countries to invest in a clean, sustainable transition as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, during his virtual address to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Guterres will deliver the 19th Darbari Seth Memorial lecture on August 28 organised by TERI, a global think-tank focusing on a broad range of sustainable development and climate-related issues, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday. In his lecture titled ‘The rise of renewables: shining a light on a sustainable future’, Guterres will renew “his call on G20 countries, including India, to invest in a clean, sustainable transition as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic”. G20 consists of 19 individual countries -- including the US, Russia, China, Japan, Australia, Saudi -- plus the European Union. Dujarric said Guterres is expected to say that as governments mobilise trillions of dollars to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, their decisions will have climate consequences for decades. While Guterres will deliver the memorial lecture, India’s Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar will preside and deliver the presidential address. The annual lecture was initiated by TERI in 2002 in memory of the institute’s founder Darbari Seth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-to-renew-call-to-india-g20-nations-to-invest-in-sustainable-transition-post-covid/story-517ob3WUcxDpVixQ44P8WP.html
27-08-2020||World||Rapid USD 5 coronavirus test doesn’t need specialty equipment||The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorised the first rapid coronavirus test that doesn’t need any special computer equipment to get results.The 15-minute test from Abbott Laboratories will sell for USD 5, giving it a competitive edge over similar tests that need to be popped into a small machine. The size of a credit card, the self-contained test is based on the same technology used to test for the flu, strep throat and other infections.It’s the latest cheaper, simpler test to hit the US market, providing new options to expand testing as schools and businesses struggle to reopen and flu season approaches. The FDA also recently greenlighted a saliva test from Yale University that bypasses some of the supplies that have led to testing bottlenecks.Both tests have limitations and neither can be done at home. Several companies are developing rapid, at-home tests, but none have yet won approval. Abbott’s new test still requires a nasal swab by a health worker, like most older coronavirus tests. The Yale saliva test eliminates the need for a swab, but can only be run at high-grade laboratories.And in general, rapid tests like Abbott’s are less accurate than lab-developed tests. The FDA said in a statement announcing the decision that negative results with Abbott’s test may need to be confirmed with a lab test in some cases. The agency granted Abbott’s test an emergency use authorization late Wednesday for patients with suspected Covid-19.The two additions should help expand the number of available tests. The US is now testing about 690,000 people per day, down from a peak of 850,000 daily tests late last month. Many public health experts believe the country will soon need to test vastly more people to find those who are infected, isolate them and contain the virus.The FDA noted that Abbott’s test could be used in a doctor’s office, emergency room or some schools. “Given the simple nature of this test, it is likely that these tests could be made broadly available,” the FDA said.Since the start of the pandemic, nasal swab tests that are sent to a lab have been the standard for Covid-19 screening. While considered highly accurate, the tests rely on expensive, specialized machines and chemicals. Shortages of those supplies have led to repeated delays in reporting results, especially during a spike in cases last month.Government and health experts view rapid tests that can be run outside the laboratory system as key to boosting capacity.“Those screening tests are what we need in schools, workplaces and nursing homes in order to catch asymptomatic spreaders,” said Dr Jonathan Quick of the Rockefeller Foundation, in an interview earlier this month. The nonprofit group has called for the US to conduct about 4 millions per day by October, mostly rapid, point-of-care tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rapid-usd-5-coronavirus-test-doesn-t-need-specialty-equipment/story-VHPtlz8L2XW4C7YmRerMbO.html
27-08-2020||World||Hurricane Laura moves toward landfall in southwestern Louisiana||Laura roared toward landfall in southwestern Louisiana near the Texas border as a menacing Category 4 hurricane late Wednesday, pushing ocean water topped with waves on to a low-lying coast that forecasters said would be inundated with “unsurvivable” storm surge as much as 20 feet deep.Authorities implored coastal residents of Texas and Louisiana to evacuate, but not everyone did before howling winds began buffeting trees back and forth in an area that was devastated by Rita in 2005.Also read: ‘Unsurvivable’ storm surge feared as Hurricane Laura strengthens to Category 4The storm grew nearly 87% in power in just 24 hours to a size the National Hurricane Center called “extremely dangerous.” Drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico, the system was on track to arrive early Thursday during high tide as the most powerful hurricane to strike the U.S. so far this year.“It looks like it’s in full beast mode, which is not what you want to see if you’re in its way,” University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said.Hurricane-force winds extending 60 miles (95 kilometers) from the storm’s center neared the coast, forecasters said, and bands of heavy rain fell 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the beach in Lake Charles.Late Wednesday, Laura was churning about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of Lake Charles and moving north-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).Maximum sustained winds increased to 150 mph (241 kph) before nightfall, and forecasters said up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings as the storm pushed on to land, but there were no immediate reports of damage. Thousands of homes and businesses were without power.Also read: Hurricane Laura poses biggest storm threat to US oil output in 15 yearsOne major Louisiana highway already had standing water as Laura’s outer bands moved ashore with tropical storm-force winds. Thousands of sandbags lined roadways in tiny Lafitte, and winds picked up as shoppers earlier Wednesday rushed into a grocery store in low-lying Delcambre.Trent Savoie, 31, said he was staying put. “With four kids and 100 farm animals, it’s just hard to move out,” he said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards fretted that the dire predictions were not resonating despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.Officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles in coastal Cameron Parish, which could be completely covered by ocean water.“It’s a very sad situation,” said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. “We did everything we could to encourage them to leave.”Edwards activated the state’s entire National Guard. In Lake Charles, Guard members drove school buses around neighborhoods, offering to pick up families. Across the state line in Port Arthur, Texas, few stragglers boarded evacuation buses, and city officials announced that two C-130 transport planes offered the last chance to leave.Abbott warned that people who fail to get out of harm’s way could be cut off from help long after the storm hit.A Category 4 hurricane can render wide areas uninhabitable for weeks or months and knock out power for just as long. The threat of such devastation posed a new disaster-relief challenge for a government already straining under the coronavirus pandemic. The parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders included areas turning up high rates of positive Covid-19 tests.The National Hurricane Center kept raising its estimate of Laura’s storm surge, from 10 feet (3 meters) just days ago to twice that size — a height that forecasters said would be especially deadly.By Wednesday night, Laura was churning about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Lake Charles and moving north-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).On Twitter, President Donald Trump urged coastal residents to heed officials. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometers). Storm surge warnings extended from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.For some, the decision to leave home left them with no place to stay. Wary of opening mass shelters during a pandemic, Texas officials instead put evacuees in hotels, but Austin stopped taking arrivals before dawn because officials said they ran out of rooms. Other evacuees called the state’s 211 information line and were directed to Ennis, outside Dallas, only to be told after driving hundreds of miles no hotels or vouchers were available.Taniquia Ned and her sisters showed up without money to rent a room, saying the family had burned through its savings after losing jobs because of the coronavirus. “The Covid-19 is just totally wiping us out,” said Shalonda Joseph, 43, a teacher in Port Arthur.Edwards lamented that the impending storm meant suspension of community testing for Covid-19 at a crucial time — as elementary and secondary schools in Louisiana open and students return to college campuses.Forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire towns. Water was already rising in the small Louisiana community of Holly Beach in the imperiled Cameron Parish.Laura was expected to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could arrive by Friday in parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. Laura is so powerful that it’s expected to become a tropical storm again once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the Northeast.Becky Clements, 56, evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. She and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland. Almost 15 years have passed since Hurricane Rita destroyed the city.“The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again.”The church educator said she fears for her office, which is in a trailer following recent construction.“I very much anticipate that my office will be gone when I get back.”The hurricane also threatened a center of the U.S. energy industry as the majority of Gulf oil and natural gas production shut down. Consumers are unlikely to see big price hikes, however, because the pandemic has decimated demand for fuel.Laura closed in on the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.Laura will be the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-moves-toward-landfall-in-southwestern-louisiana/story-XGhzjc8fhx2M44fGnjFsiL.html
27-08-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases top 24 million||Worldwide Covid-19 infections exceeded 24 million as cases continued to climb in Europe and Asia, with Italy, France and South Korea reporting the most new infections in months. New U.S. testing guidelines drew criticism from state leaders and public-health experts, while a top Trump administration official defended the move.Moderna Inc. presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people. Abbott Laboratories won US clearance for a 15-minute Covid test that will be priced at just $5.The World Economic Forum postponed its annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss resort of Davos to early summer 2021. The European Union’s trade chief stepped down after growing criticism that he broke virus regulations in his native Ireland.Key Developments:Japan Virus Jump Hitting EconomyJapanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said a jump in virus cases from July and heavy rains are dragging on the nation’s economy. He told a parliamentary committee the economy’s overall recovery trend is not yet back. Nishimura said on Wednesday a second wave of the virus now spreading in Japan is bigger than the one that caused the government to declare a state of emergency in April.South Korea Sees Most Cases Since MarchSouth Korea had 441 more coronavirus cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, the biggest gain since early March, according to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. That compared to 320 the previous day. Of the new cases, 154 were confirmed in Seoul, 100 in Gyeonggi province and 59 in Incheon.Vice Finance Minister Kim Yongbeom said he believed that the nation can handle the resurgence of the coronavirus with current social distancing rules. Still, so-called Level 3 rules would be needed if the situation worsens, he added at a briefing.WHO Team Didn’t Visit Wuhan, FT SaysA World Health Organization team that was meant to investigate the origin of the coronavirus concluded their trip to China without a visit to Wuhan, the Financial Times reported, citing the UN agency. The WHO told the FT that its advance team had remote conversations with senior scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology but declined to comment on whether the team had planned to visit the city.The organization said the initial team had been laying groundwork before a larger international investigation but didn’t provide details on whether the bigger task-force would travel to Wuhan. China’s foreign ministry called concerns over the credibility of the inquiry “totally unjustified,” according to the FT.Singapore to Provide Tests for China-Bound TravelersSingapore will offer Covid-19 tests for travelers to China prior to departure, in an effort to align with new Chinese requirements aimed at stemming the growing number of imported virus cases.The new travel rules were instituted after China earlier registered dozens of passengers arriving from the Singapore who tested positive for the coronavirus. In response, the world’s second largest economy had temporarily suspended a number of flights from Singapore as a precautionary measure.Texas Deaths Rise, Hospitalizations DeclineTexas virus deaths rose by 229, a number that has remained persistently high as new cases and hospitalizations have declined since July. A total of 11,805 people have died from Covid-19, according to state death certificate data, since the outbreak began. Cases climbed to 592,137 after the state added another 5,507 to the tally Wednesday, including some backlogged data. Hospitalizations declined to 4,806, continuing a two-month downward trend.Abbott Cleared for $5, 15-Minute TestA 15-minute Covid test from Abbott Laboratories that will be priced at just $5 won emergency authorization for use in the U.S., a breakthrough that could ease the bottleneck that has crimped much of the nation’s testing capacity.The product, dubbed BinaxNOW, works without relying on laboratory equipment at a time when labs can take as long as two weeks to produce results. It uses a nasal swab and a small reactive card, and it can be administered by a range of health-care workers, including pharmacists, at almost any location.Abbott will start shipping the test within two weeks and intends to manufacture 50 million tests a month by the end of October.Fauci Concerned Over New Test Guidelines: CNNAnthony Fauci, the top U.S. top infectious disease doctor, told CNN that he is concerned that the CDC’s new coronavirus testing guidelines will make people believe “that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern, when in fact it is.”Fauci said in the CNN interview that he was in surgery when the new testing recommendations were discussed.EU Trade Chief Quits After Virus-Rule BreachThe European Union’s trade chief, Phil Hogan, stepped down after growing criticism that he broke virus regulations in his native Ireland.Hogan was under pressure over his attendance at a golf dinner last week that violated coronavirus regulations as well as his behavior during quarantine upon arrival in his home country. The resignation came a day after Ireland’s government said that Hogan’s “delayed and hesitant” response impaired public confidence.U.S. Cases Rise 0.8%Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.8% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 5.8 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase matched the average daily gain over the past week. Deaths rose by 0.8% to 179,150.French New Cases Hit Four-Month HighFrance reported 5,429 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, a four-month high that comes after similarly important surges in recent days. Prime Minister Jean Castex will hold a press conference on Thursday to address the health situation as infections rise.Greece Reports Record New Cases Greece reported a record-high 293 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 9280. The number is the highest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The average age of people who tested positive is 39. The country also recorded five new deaths, bringing the total to 248.Cuomo Blasts CDC Guidance as ‘Propaganda’New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said the state won’t follow recent guidance on the coronavirus from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling it “political propaganda.”The CDC this week said that people who have potentially been exposed to the virus and are asymptomatic don’t need to be tested. The agency, contrary to its previous recommendations, also said that people traveling from hot spots no longer need to self-quarantine for 14 days.“We’re not going to follow the CDC guidance,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said on a conference call with the media.He accused Republican President Donald Trump of using the agency to “forward his political agenda,” saying it’s “frightening and it is alarming.”Italy Reports Most New Cases in 3 1/2 MonthsItaly recorded 1,367 new cases Wednesday, the highest number in three months and a half, on the day the government ruled out a new lockdown.Many of the new infections involve Italians returning from vacations either within the country or abroad. The Lombardy region said two out of three of the latest cases are holidaymakers returning from outside of Italy.In response to the surge, Italy is ramping up testing in ports and airports, with a record 93,529 tests carried out Wednesday. Still, the health minister said the country is ruling out a new nationwide lockdown.Moscow Invites Residents to Join Vaccine TrialsMoscow is inviting all its residents to participate in Phase 3 testing of a Covid-19 vaccine that was approved for use earlier this month, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on his blog Wednesday.Russia approved the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, which Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute is developing with the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Defense Ministry, before it finished clinical trials. The testing will continue even as medical workers are vaccinated. Many members of the local elite, including one of President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, have already been inoculated.The capital accounts for more than a quarter of Russia’s nearly 1 million cases.Moderna Vaccine Produces Antibodies in Trial of Older PeopleModerna Inc. presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its Covid-19 vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people.In a phase 1 trial, Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine produced “consistently high levels” of neutralizing antibodies -- a key component of the body’s protective response -- in older adults, the company said in a statement. Antibody levels produced in people more than 55 years old were comparable to those seen in younger adults, the company said in a statement.The findings are important because older adults often don’t respond as well to vaccines as younger adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-top-24-million/story-HI5k9Y8ZmyYYy1JDkETbMP.html
27-08-2020||World||New Zealand mosque shooter sentenced to life without parole||The white supremacist who slaughtered 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without the possibility of parole.The judge imposed the maximum available sentence on 29-year-old Australian gunman Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the first time the sentence has been imposed in New Zealand.Judge Cameron Mander said Tarrant’s crimes were so wicked that a life time in jail could not begin to atone for them. He said they had caused enormous loss and hurt and stemmed from a warped and malignant ideology.“Your actions were inhuman,” Mander said. “You deliberately killed a 3-year-old infant as he clung to the leg of his father.”The March 2019 attacks targeting people praying at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques shocked New Zealand and prompted new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. They also prompted global changes to social media protocols after the gunman livestreamed his attack on Facebook.During the four-day sentencing hearing, 90 survivors and family members recounted the horror of the attacks and the trauma they continue to feel.Also read: Man sacked, deported from UAE for ‘celebrating’ New Zealand mosque shootingSome chose to yell at the gunman and give him the finger. Others called him a monster, a coward, a rat. Some sung verses from the Quran or addressed him in Arabic. A few spoke softly to Tarrant, saying they forgave him.Tarrant had earlier fired his lawyers and told the judge that he didn’t wish to speak at the hearing. A standby lawyer appointed by the court told the judge that Tarrant did not oppose a sentence of life without parole.Tarrant in March had pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism, reversing his earlier not guilty pleas.Prosecutors said Tarrant had flown a drone over the Al Noor mosque and researched the layout as he meticulously planned his attacks. He arrived with six guns including two AR-15s.Crown prosecutor Mark Zarifeh said he’d aimed to kill as many people as possible.“The offender’s actions are a painful and harrowing mark in New Zealand’s history,” he said.Also read: 5 Indians among those killed in New Zealand mosque shootingsTarrant was noticeably thinner in his sentencing hearing than when he was first arrested. He didn’t show the brazenness he did at his first court appearance the day after the attacks, when he made a hand gesture sometimes adopted by white supremacists.Dressed in a gray prison tracksuit, Tarrant showed little emotion during his sentencing. He watched the speakers, occasionally giving a small nod or covering his mouth as he laughed at jokes, often made at his expense.Sara Qasem spoke Thursday during the four-day hearing about her beloved father Abdelfattah, who was killed in the attacks.“All a daughter ever wants is her dad. I want to go on more road trips with him. I want to smell his garden-sourced cooking. His cologne,” she said. “I want to hear him tell me more about the olive trees in Palestine. I want to hear his voice. My dad’s voice. My baba’s voice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-mosque-gunman-sentenced-to-life-without-parole/story-VlnWPeSevOnygelJ9SIf2I.html

27-08-2020||World||Facebook removes ‘Kenosha Guard’ page following shooting||Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it removed a page for the Kenosha Guard, a group which had posted a “call to arms” in Kenosha, Wisconsin, saying the page violated its policy against “militia organizations.”The company’s action followed the shooting deaths on Tuesday night of two people during protests in Kenosha, which broke out in response to the police shooting of a Black man earlier this week.Authorities charged a 17-year-old from Illinois with homicide on Wednesday in connection with the deaths.Militias organized rapidly on Tuesday on Reddit and Facebook, where users shared coverage from Infowars, a right-wing conspiracy site. Infowars in turn amplified the Kenosha Guard’s Facebook post and said the groups were “recruiting citizens to patrol.”Though Facebook banned Infowars’ page long ago, tracking tool CrowdTangle showed its article on Kenosha was shared 274 times, according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab. It was also posted nine times to pages with a combined audience of more than 103,000 people.Many of the pages contained threats of violence.One commentor wrote on the Stand Up Kenosha page on Facebook: “Shoot to kill folks. Cause they won’t give you a second chance.”A Facebook spokeswoman said the company had not found evidence suggesting the shooter followed the Kenosha Guard page or had been invited to its event.She said Facebook was also removing content tied to the shooting, including the suspect’s page, which previously showed him posing with rifles.Reddit did not respond to a request for comment, although posts threatening to bring guns and pipe bombs and to “cleanse Kenosha of the rioters” were deleted there too.Before its removal from Facebook, the Kenosha Guard’s profile photos featured a large American flag and a man holding a military-style rifle.“Any patriots willing to take up arms and defend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs?” one post read, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. (https://bit.ly/2YC9uGJ)The group, which identified itself as a “social club,” also created a Facebook event called “Armed Citizens to Protect our Lives and Property” on Tuesday and warned police they would be “outnumbered.”Created on June 2, the page had nearly 3,500 followers as of Wednesday morning.After the shooting, the group posted a statement saying it was “unaware if the armed citizen was answering the Kenosha Guard Militia’s call to arms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-kenosha-guard-page-following-shooting/story-TaO6QtkZ5Y511kerydl6QI.html
27-08-2020||World||Covid-related emergency regime in Lebanon extended until year-end: Report||Lebanon’s Supreme Council of Defense said the decision had been made to extend the coronavirus-related emergency regime in the country until December 31 due to an increase in the number of cases, the presidential press service said in a statement.“The Supreme Council of Defense extended the civil mobilization regime from August 31 to December 31 and demanded that the health minister hold talks with private hospitals within five days to open specialized departments for the treatment of patients with coronavirus,” the press service said.The Lebanese Health Ministry has reported 561 new cases of the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) over the past day. The overall number of patients increased to 14,248, with 139 deaths.Lebanon reintroduced from August 19 the regime of an epidemiological emergency until September 7, with a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. As part of the emergency regime, all shopping centers, crowded places, restaurants and beaches are closed. Government agencies and the international airport continue to work in a reduced mode.The civil mobilization regime was first introduced in Lebanon on March 16. Since July, according to daily Health Ministry reports, the number of Covid-19 cases has begun to grow sharply. The Lebanese authorities say the deterioration of the epidemiological situation is primarily due to the neglect of the safety and personal hygiene measures prescribed by the ministry.Also, a negative role was played by citizens who arrived in the country from abroad after the opening of the international airport and violated the self-isolation regime. The explosion in the port of Beirut, which destroyed several neighborhoods, and thousands-strong demonstrations played a negative role as well.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic on March 11.According to the WHO, the global coronavirus death toll has surpassed 815,000 people, with the number of cases worldwide exceeding 23.7 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-related-emergency-regime-in-lebanon-extended-until-year-end-report/story-EUtP1NKtKkdQdbWHBaqJiI.html
27-08-2020||World||Top Democrat says Donald Trump’s remarks on TikTok deal are inappropriate||A top House Democrat rebuked President Donald Trump for commenting on the potential acquisition of the domestic operations of the popular TikTok video app by a US company, but at the same time said such a deal could protect American interests.Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline, who is leading a probe of the technology industry, told Bloomberg News on Wednesday that it’s the job of federal enforcement agencies to determine whether TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., promotes competition or compromises national security and said that the president shouldn’t insert himself into the outcome of those decisions.Trump issued an executive order August 14 forcing TikTok’s Chinese owner to divest its US assets, citing national security grounds. He subsequently weighed in on possible bids by Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Cicilline said it’s not the president’s role to decide who that buyer should be.“What we don’t need is the president of the United States injecting himself into a transaction in the way that he did,” Cicilline said. “I think that’s dangerous -- that kind of politicization of that company and their practices.”Trump has stepped up his attacks on TikTok as his administration increased pressure on China ahead of the November presidential election. Earlier this month, Trump threatened to shut down TikTok if its owners didn’t sell the business to a US company by Sept. 15. Then, on August 6, he signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting Americans from doing business with TikTok and another app, WeChat, which is also Chinese-owned, effective in 45 days.“I don’t mind whether it’s Microsoft or someone else, a big company, a secure company, a very American company buys it,” Trump told reporters on August 3. “It’ll close down on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money.”In an Aug. 19 speech in Arizona, Trump praised another possible bidder, Oracle.“Oracle is a great company,” said Trump during the speech. “I think its owner is a tremendous guy. He’s a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it.”Trump ordered TikTok to sell its US assets after an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, which reviews acquisitions of American businesses by overseas investors for national security risk. Cfius found ByteDance’s 2017 purchase of the app Musical.ly and merger with TikTok did raise concerns and Trump’s order effectively called for a reversal of that transaction.Cfius will have to certify that a sale to a US buyer resolves all outstanding national security concerns.“I guess Microsoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people,” Trump told reporters earlier this month. “But they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we’re the ones making it possible. Very simple: We’re the ones making it possible. So our Treasury has to be very well compensated.”Cicilline said if a US company buys TikTok, the purchase could give Facebook Inc. much-needed competition in the social media market and keep valuable data on American users out of the hands of Chinese authorities.“I think we have to obviously be conscious of the implications when that kind of data is collected by a foreign adversary,” Cicilline said, referring to TikTok. “I think it’s perfectly appropriate in reviewing a transaction to take into account the national security interests of the United States.”Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee, has been investigating whether companies such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. are too dominant in the marketplace. Last month, the chief executives of the four US technology giants appeared before the subcommittee to answer questions about whether they use their power to crush rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-democrat-says-donald-trump-s-remarks-on-tiktok-deal-are-inappropriate/story-80b1JjUeXSPwwxD3Yi8pXP.html
27-08-2020||World||Trump’s Covid-19 testing chief defends new advice after blowback||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s shift in guidance on Covid-19 testing away from asymptomatic individuals this week alarmed many public-health experts who say it’s a wrong turn that could restrict how many tests are performed.Brett Giroir, a top Trump administration official overseeing coronavirus testing, fired back on the criticism during a Wednesday briefing, telling reporters that the change wasn’t influenced by the White House and is intended to clarify to the public the limitations of such screenings, not to reduce how many tests are conducted.The new recommendations say testing may not be needed for asymptomatic close contacts and those who attended large, risky gatherings but lack symptoms. Giroir said that in areas with high virus rates, many people without symptoms will be tested at surge screening sites, which he contrasted with someone in a “place where it’s 1% positive saying I want to get tested today, tomorrow and the next day.”“I’m really not sure how people could interpret that if they actually read them because what we’ve tried to do is put more responsibility on public health officials,” he said.CNN reported on Wednesday that the CDC guidance change was due to pressure from Trump administration officials, citing an unidentified official. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the move “political propaganda” and an effort by President Donald Trump to bring down the number of cases with less testing. But Giroir said that the guidelines had been a joint effort, with the involvement of top health officials including Anthony Fauci, who has been one of the most prominent administration voices on the virus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageGiroir said that the final draft was circulated on Thursday at a White House Coronavirus Task Force meeting. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was in surgery that day though and didn’t attend the meeting, NIAID said.“He does recall quickly reviewing a version of the guidelines that circulated at some time before the Aug. 20 meeting,” according to the NIAID statement. “Without having the benefit of the discussion that took place on Aug. 20 at the Task Force meeting where the guidelines were finalized, but now reading them carefully, he has some concern that the revised guidelines could be interpreted as lessening the importance of asymptomatic spread of virus in the community.”The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid issued guidance on Tuesday regarding testing nursing home staff and residents that differs from the CDC recommendations, saying that anyone working or living at a nursing home will have to get tested for Covid-19 regularly.Although the CMS guidance didn’t specify how often staff should be tested, nursing homes will likely have to test them at least once a month. Frequency could rise to once a week if positivety levels in nearby communities are between 5% and 10% and twice a week if positive cases are above 10%, the head of the agency said.Nursing homes also have to offer residents testing after there’s been an outbreak or if they’re showing symptoms, the new guidelines say. Facilities that fail to comply could face hundreds of dollars per day in fines.The CDC’s recommendations for nursing home testing already include a section on reopening facilities that close after an outbreak. In that scenario, “initial viral testing of each resident (who is not known to have previously been diagnosed with Covid-19) is recommended because of the high likelihood of exposure during a pandemic, transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the risk of complications among residents following infection.”DOJ InquiryCovid-19 has ravaged nursing homes around the country, and the elderly make up a substantial portion of virus deaths in the US Some reports, including an analysis of state data by USA Today, say nursing home residents have made up 40% of coronavirus deaths.On Wednesday, the Department of Justice announced that it was seeking data from four Democrat-led states on deaths at nursing homes to see whether an investigation into whether their policies requiring facilities to re-admit patients diagnosed with Covid caused spikes in cases and deaths.The CDC guidance reflects a shift in tone by the federal government and some states that began earlier this summer, as lengthy delays in getting test results made headlines. In mid-July, for instance, Giroir recommended only testing individuals with symptoms and front-line workers, and Florida asked labs to prioritize tests for symptomatic individuals. Major commercial labs report that test results have become speedier in recent weeks, with turnarounds of a few days on average.Yet public health experts said the new guidance, released as part of an unpublicized update to the CDC’s website, could in fact cut down on testing.“This makes no sense,” wrote Leana Wen, a physician who formerly led Planned Parenthood and currently serves as visiting professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, in a tweet late Tuesday. “We need more testing, not less.”Howard Forman, director of the Yale School of Public Health’s health-care management program, called the shift “insane and counter to all the best evidence that we have about how testing is supposed to work and appears to work.”“We need to identify asymptomatic infected individuals as soon as feasible and isolate them and begin contact tracing when feasible,” he said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-covid-19-testing-chief-defends-new-advice-after-blowback/story-7GYLvY6TQFSsLn9OvDlRCN.html
27-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s regime baffles world with contradictory signals||What’s going on with Kim Jong Un? Is he sick? Worried about Covid-19? Consumed by an economic crisis? Battling internal threats?Perhaps the North Korean leader is biding his time until the US presidential election? Or maybe he’s playing the same game of threats, reconciliation and retreat that has kept his family in charge of the secretive state since the 1940s?All those scenarios have been floated to explain months of surprises and intrigue from Pyongyang, including stubborn -- but so-far-unsubstantiated -- rumors that the 36-year-old leader is unwell. The developments have underscored how little the world knows about North Korea, and left even many professional observers questioning how they go about interpreting Kim’s actions.“We need to check our assumptions about the leadership,” said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who previously worked at the Central Intelligence Agency. “Perhaps we are imposing our own expectations and habitual knowledge about the North Korean regime on the current situation. And if these expectations are false, then we risk drawing faulty or erroneous conclusions about the regime.”Indeed, Kim is behaving in ways that have defied expectations. After making economic development his central policy focus in 2018, he acknowledged last week that people’s living standards have “not been improved remarkably.” He has attended less than a third of the number of public events as he had at this time in 2019 and earlier this year missed birthday celebrations for his late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung.After promising to unveil a “new strategic weapon” and carrying out a record number of ballistic missile launches last year, North Korea has dramatically scaled back weapon tests in 2020. He’s even given his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, a more prominent role in relations with the US and South Korea, an unprecedented delegation of power that risks elevating a potential rival from the family’s so-called Mount Paektu bloodline.Kim Yo Jong proved her hard-line credentials in June by delivering a stern rebuke to Seoul before North Korea blew up a $15 million liaison office South Korean President Moon Jae-in helped establish on the northern side of the border in 2018. Since then, North Korea has been unusually quiet, foregoing even its standard criticism of US-South Korean military drills that started this month.Illustrating the struggle to read the signals, South Korean lawmakers said after a briefing by spy agency officials last week that Kim Jong Un had delegated some authority to his sister to relieve “stress,” adding that she was running “every aspect” of state affairs. The lawmakers held another briefing shortly after to play down their remarks, saying they were only sharing the spy agency’s interpretation.State media released what appeared to be fresh images of Kim Wednesday, publishing photos of him leading a Politburo meeting, dressed in summer white. Still, the rumors about his health have persisted, due in part to North Korea’s long history of manipulating state media reports for political purposes.The confusion was reminiscent of an episode in April after the Seoul-based news site Daily NK reported that Kim had undergone a “cardiovascular surgical procedure,” potentially explaining his absence from events honoring his grandfather. Subsequent reports that Kim was dead or incapacitated followed, only for him to turn up at a May 1 fertilizer plant visit looking healthy, if still overweight.“Kim Jong Un’s long absences have been unusual in the context of his general public activities in North Korea,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This has obviously led to some very poorly reasoned and supported rumors about his health. But it simply appears that the leader is taking precaution -- as so many of us are -- during an unprecedented global pandemic.”North Korea’s stability is not only a concern for its immediate neighbors, but the wider world since a turbulent leadership change would raise new questions about who controls a nuclear bomb stockpile that could grow to 100 warheads by year end. No matter who’s in charge, North Korean leaders have strong incentives to preserve the regime and Kim’s strategy of seeking sanctions relief from US President Donald Trump by building a more dangerous nuclear arsenal.Greater insight may come around Oct. 10, when the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea is expected to celebrate its 75th anniversary. Footage from those events, which analysis of satellite photos suggests will probably include the regime’s first military parade since 2018, should provide a fresh chance to evaluate Kim’s strategy and his relationship with top officials including his sister.As usual, North Korea’s propaganda machine has said nothing about Kim’s health or succession plans. The coronavirus has further cut the flow of intelligence out of the country, with North Korea slashing traffic across the Chinese border and curbing movements of diplomats posted in Pyongyang.Some of the few foreign diplomats and non-governmental organization workers who live in Pyongyang are leaving, with Swedish embassy staff among the latest to depart. Kim told a party meeting earlier this month that he wouldn’t accept international handouts due to worries of spreading the virus.Kim may also be preoccupied with the economic damage wrought by US sanctions and severe flooding, as well as the pandemic. North Korea is on track for its biggest contraction since the 1990s, when Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, faced a devastating famine, according to Fitch Solutions.“The economic struggle is already damaging Kim’s authority,” said Boo Seung-chan, a former adviser to South Korea’s defense minister who’s now an adjunct professor at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies. “Kim may need to share that authority with expert groups to better handle the crisis while minimizing damage to himself.”Economic issues have certainly dominated Kim’s recent public statements, including his decision earlier this month to replace former Premier Kim Jae Ryong after little more than a year on the job. He also announced plans to hold the first Workers’ Party congress in five years in January to update the country’s national development blueprint.The timing of the party congress could provide Kim a convenient platform to deliver a fresh message to the US before the next presidential inauguration on Jan. 20. While it’s unclear whether Trump can break the stalemate with North Korea if he wins a second term, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has signaled a different approach, criticizing the president’s emphasis on a personal rapport with Kim.Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former analyst for the US government specializing in North Korea, noted that Kim Yo Jong alluded to concern about a change in US leadership in an earlier statement about the need for good relations for the two countries, as well as their leaders.“I am surprised that he has not started taking steps to escalate tensions in the lead-up to showing off the ‘new strategic weapon,’” Lee said. “Part of this could be that Pyongyang is weighing its options before the US presidential election, but the main reason seems to be that it remains fettered by domestic issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-regime-baffles-world-with-contradictory-signals/story-1PyDQVNlrAj8AoOcTHNioI.html
27-08-2020||World||‘Unsurvivable’ storm surge feared as Hurricane Laura strengthens to Category 4||Hurricane Laura strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, prompting warnings of “unsurvivable” storm surge of up to 20 feet (six meters) and evacuation orders for hundreds of thousands of coastal residents of Louisiana and Texas.The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Laura was packing winds of 140 miles per hour (220 kilometers per hour) and was expected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast overnight.As an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 hurricane -- the second-highest on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale -- Laura could pummel the Louisiana and Texas coast with storm surge, extreme winds and flash flooding, the NHC said.An “unsurvivable storm surge with large and destructive waves will cause catastrophic damage from Sea Rim State Park, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana,” it said.Storm surges could penetrate up to 30 miles inland along parts of the coasts, and peak surge coupled with high tide could see water as high as 15 to 20 feet above normal levels.“The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm’s way and protect themselves,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.“The conditions of this storm are unsurvivable, and I urge southeast Texans to take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate.”“Your property can be replaced,” Abbott said. “Your life cannot be replaced.”President Donald Trump told residents in the path of the storm to “listen to local officials.”“Hurricane Laura is a very dangerous and rapidly intensifying hurricane,” Trump tweeted. “My Administration remains fully engaged with state & local emergency managers.”- ‘Not going to play with the good lord’ -Jimmy Ray was among those heeding evacuation orders in Lake Charles, Louisiana.“We were going to try to ride it out at the house, but we found out that it was going to be too bad,” Ray told AFP outside an evacuation facility.Another evacuee in Lake Charles, Patricia Como, said her sister, her brother, cousins and other family members had stayed behind but she was “not going to take a chance.”“I’m not going to play with the good lord,” Como said.At 1800 GMT, Hurricane Laura was about 200 miles south-southeast of Lake Charles and moving north-west at 16 miles an hour, the NHC said.It said the storm was expected to dump between five to 10 inches (13 to 26 cms) of rain on parts of the Gulf Coast between Wednesday and Friday.Craig Brown, the acting mayor of Galveston, Texas, which suffered the deadliest hurricane in US history in 1900 with thousands of deaths, said the authorities were “monitoring this very closely.”“We’ve had good cooperation from our residents on evacuation,” Brown said, adding that it was not mandatory.“If they want to stay put, then we allow them to do that,” he said. “But we do tell them if they stay, they may not have any emergency services available to them.”Angela Jouett, director of evacuation operations in Lake Charles, said the authorities had new protocols in place because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“People that come in they get their hands sprayed with sanitizer,” Jouett said. “They’re having their temperature checks, and we’re also spacing everybody in six foot distancing.”- Struck Haiti, Dominican Republican -In New Orleans, devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the historic French Quarter was empty of tourists, while sandbags were piled up in front of the doorways of colonial-style buildings and windows were boarded up with plywood. New Orleans remains traumatized from Katrina, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, flooding 80 percent of the city and killing more than 1,800 people.Laura earlier caused flooding in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, killing at least 25 people.In Cuba, it caused material damage but no deaths. The Atlantic storm season, which runs through November, could be one of the busiest ever this year, with the NHC predicting as many as 25 named storms.

27-08-2020||World||Dutch book ‘The Discomfort of Evening’ wins 2020 International Booker Prize||‘The Discomfort of Evening’, written by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld and translated from Dutch by Michele Hutchison, was on Wednesday announced as the winner of the 2020 International Booker Prize, making the writer the youngest winner of the prize at 29.The £50,000 prize will be split between Rijneveld and Hutchison, giving both the author and translator equal recognition. The winner was announced by chair of the judges, Ted Hodgkinson, at a digital event.The book was chosen from a shortlist of six books during a process described by organisers as rigoros by a panel of five judges, chaired by Hodgkindon, who is also head of Literature and Spoken Word at the Southbank Centre.Hodgkinson said: “We set ourselves an immense task in selecting a winner from our superb shortlist, filled with fiction bold enough to upend mythic foundations and burst the banks of the novel itself. From this exceptional field, and against an extraordinary backdrop, we were looking for a book that goes beyond echoing our dystopian present and possesses a timeless charge”.“Combining a disarming new sensibility with a translation of singular sensitivity, The Discomfort of Evening is a tender and visceral evocation of a childhood caught between shame and salvation, and a deeply deserving winner of The 2020 International Booker Prize.”Born in April 1991 in Nieuwendijk, Netherlands, Rijneveld, grew up in a farming family in North Brabant before moving to Utrecht, and has already won awards for both first poetry collection ‘Calfskin’ and debut novel ‘The Discomfort of Evening’.The Guardian described the winning book “an unflinching study of a family falling apart in the madness of grief, rendered all the more unnerving for the childishly plain, undramatic way their compulsive behaviours are reported”.The International Booker Prize is awarded every year for a single book that is translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland. This year the judges considered 124 books, translated from 30 languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-book-the-discomfort-of-evening-wins-2020-international-booker-prize/story-v9FA6JtPxBRVPiqJYqf5fL.html
27-08-2020||World||US sanctions Chinese individuals, firms over disputed South China Sea outposts||The United States on Wednesday announced restrictions against Chinese individuals and firms involved in the “large-scale reclamation, construction, or militarization of disputed outposts” in the South China Sea (SCS).These are first SCS-centric curbs announced by the Trump administration after a recent shift in policy from indifference to a full-fledged embrace of an international tribunal’s 2016 order rejecting all of China’s claims in the South China Sea.“Today, the Department of State will begin imposing visa restrictions on People’s Republic of China (PRC) individuals responsible for, or complicit in, either the large-scale reclamation, construction, or militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea, or the PRC’s use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.The department of commerce announced it was adding 24 Chinese companies to the Entity List, which pose a threat to the national security of the United States and therefore subjected to trade restrictions.“The United States, China’s neighbours, and the international community have rebuked the CCP’s sovereignty claims to the South China Sea and have condemned the building of artificial islands for the Chinese military,” said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement. “The entities designated today have played a significant role in China’s provocative construction of these artificial islands and must be held accountable.”The listed firms included the Chinese Communications Construction Company, a largely state-owned entity, and several subsidiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-chinese-individuals-firms-over-disputed-south-china-sea-outposts/story-F511Dmz5qggIrDM6qycLNP.html
27-08-2020||World||Officials change Covid-19 testing advice, bewildering experts||US health officials have sparked a wave of confusion after posting guidelines that coronavirus testing is not necessary for people who have been in close contact with infected people.The new guidance was posted earlier this week on the website of a federal agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC previously had advised local health departments to test people who have been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. But on Monday a CDC testing overview page was changed to say that testing is no longer recommended for symptom-less people who were in close contact situations.There was a caveat, however. Testing may be recommended for those with health problems that make them more likely to suffer severe illness from an infection, or if their doctor or local state officials advise they get tested.CDC officials referred all questions to the agency’s parent organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC. That suggests that HHS ordered the change, not CDC, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins University public health researcher.HHS officials officials have offered little explanation, but scheduled a briefing for Wednesday afternoon to answer questions.Across the country, public health experts called the change bizarre. They noted that testing contacts of infected people is a core element of public health efforts to keep outbreaks in check, and that a large percentage of infected people — the CDC has said as many as 40% — exhibit no symptoms.“I was taken aback and didn’t know that it was under consideration,” said John Auerbach, president of Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit that works to improve US preparedness against disease. “The recommendation not to test asymptomatic people who likely have been exposed is not in accord with the science.”Ultimately, restricting testing could be self-defeating, because it could skew the numbers and create a perception that rates of infection are higher. Testing people who appear to be healthy would tend to lower the overall rate of positive results, while narrowing testing to people who are sick would raise the overall positive rate, Auerbach said.Why HHS would order such a change quickly became a matter of speculation. Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious diseases specialist at Emory University, suggested in a tweet that there are two possible explanations.One is that it may be driven by testing supply issues that in many parts of the country have caused delays in results of a week or more, he suggested.The other is that President Donald Trump simply wants to see case counts drop, and discouraging more people from getting tested is one way to do it, he said.Dr. Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration, said the move follows another recent change: to no longer recommend quarantine for travelers coming from areas where infections are more common.“Both changes are highly problematic” and need to be better explained, said Frieden, who now is president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit program that works to prevent epidemics.Frieden said he, too, believes HHS forced CDC to post the changes. He called it “a sad day” because “CDC is being told what to write on their website.”New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo harshly criticized the new CDC recommendations and said the state would not be following the guidance.“Why would you reverse yourself on the quarantine order? Because they don’t want publicity that there is a COVID problem. Because the president’s politics are, ‘COVID isn’t a problem We’re past COVID. It’s all about the economy,’” Cuomo told reporters on a conference call.“What possible rationale is there to say ’You’re in close contact with a COVID-positive person. And you don’t need a test?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-change-covid-19-testing-advice-bewildering-experts/story-ZUSyQjKHMQ1mCjiiPcUZyN.html
27-08-2020||World||Coronavirus in vacant apartment implicates toilet in spread||The discovery of coronavirus in the bathroom of an unoccupied apartment in Guangzhou, China, suggests the airborne pathogen may have wafted upwards through drain pipes, an echo of a large SARS outbreak in Hong Kong 17 years ago.Traces of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in February on the sink, faucet and shower handle of a long-vacant apartment, researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a study published this month in Environment International. The contaminated bathroom was directly above the home of five people confirmed a week earlier to have Covid-19.The scientists conducted “an on-site tracer simulation experiment” to see whether the virus could be spread through waste pipes via tiny airborne particles that can be created by the force of a toilet flush. They found such particles, called aerosols, in bathrooms 10 and 12 levels above the Covid-19 cases. Two cases were confirmed on each of those floors in early February, raising concern that SARS-CoV-2-laden particles from stool had drifted into their homes via plumbing.The new report is reminiscent of a case at Hong Kong’s Amoy Gardens private housing estate almost two decades ago, when 329 residents caught severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in part because of faulty sewage pipelines. Forty-two residents died, making it the most devastating community outbreak of SARS, which is also caused by a coronavirus.“Although transmission via the shared elevator cannot be excluded, this event is consistent with the findings of the Amoy Gardens SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003,” Song Tang, a scientist with the China CDC Key Laboratory of Environment and Population Health, and colleagues wrote in the study, which cited unpublished data from the health agency.Apartments in multistory buildings may be linked via a shared wastewater system, said Lidia Morawska, director of the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Australia’s Queensland University of Technology. While solids and liquids descend the network, sewer gases -- often detectable by their odor -- sometimes rise through pipes in the absence of sufficient water, said Morawska, who wasn’t part of the research team.“If there’s smell, it means that somehow air has been transported to where it shouldn’t go,” Morawska said in an interview.Respiratory DropletsSARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly through respiratory droplets -- spatters of saliva or discharge from the nose, according to the World Health Organization. Since the first weeks of the pandemic, however, scientists in China have said infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in the stool of Covid-19 patients may also play a role in transmission. A February study of 73 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus in Guangdong province found more than half tested positive for the virus in their stool.Previous research has shown that toilet flushes can generate germ-laden aerosols from the excreta, the China CDC scientists said. Those particles can remain in the air for long periods and be dispersed over distances of more than 1 meter (3 feet), particularly in confined, poorly ventilated spaces.Fecal aerosolization occurred with SARS, and it’s possible that it may rarely occur with SARS-CoV-2, depending on sewage systems, said Malik Peiris, chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. The China CDC study found traces of virus, “which is not the same thing as infectious virus,” he said. “But one has to keep the possibility in mind.”Fecal PlumeIn the Amoy Gardens case, warm, moist air from the bathroom of a SARS patient excreting “extremely high concentrations” of virus in feces and urine established a plume in an air shaft that spread the airborne virus to other apartments, research showed.Although toilets are a daily necessity, they “may promote fecal-derived aerosol transmission if used improperly, particularly in hospitals,” the China CDC researchers said. They cited a fluid-dynamics simulation that showed a “massive upward transport of virus aerosol particles” during flushing, leading to large-scale virus spread indoors.“The study finds high plausibility for airborne transmission and outlines the evidence in great detail,” said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who was part of an international team invited to collaborate with China CDC on the study.A shared toilet was implicated in a SARS-CoV-2 infection that likely occurred on an evacuation flight from Milan to South Korea in late March, researchers said in a report in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.Airplane ToiletA 28-year-old woman developed Covid-19 symptoms about a week after the flight, during which she wore an N95 respirator mask, except when she used a toilet. The toilet was shared by other passengers, including one seated three rows away who was infected but had no symptoms. Because of strict infection control procedures implemented immediately before and during the flight, the authors concluded that the most plausible explanation for the infection is that it was acquired via indirect contact with an asymptomatic passenger while using an onboard toilet.Previous investigations confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was found on toilets used by Covid-19 patients, in the air in hospital nurses’ stations, on air outlet vents, and multiple other sites. The extent to which fecal aerosol plumes are infecting people with the SARS-CoV-2 virus isn’t known, said Queensland’s Morawska.“There are lots of situations where things happen and are pretty unusual,” said Morawska, who was part of a team that studied the Amoy Gardens contagion. Scientists should investigate the “unusual situations” because, by understanding them, they may find “they’re not that unusual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-vacant-apartment-implicates-toilet-in-spread/story-IYsEwXHNxtgKysbtmGO6JL.html
