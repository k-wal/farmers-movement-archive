There was no indication of a broad conspiracy in the charging documents filed against Clinesmith. US District Judge James Boasberg set a sentencing date for Dec. 10.While Clinesmith could face a statutory maximum of five years in prison, the U.S. sentencing guidelines in his case call for a range of zero to six months in prison, Boasberg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-fbi-lawyer-pleads-guilty-to-doctoring-email-in-russia-probe-of-trump-campaign/story-xm3C4ghX1BwL6SjkQdv3yL.html

In h Pakistan, there is confusion over what the next step will be but so far foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has not been asked to step down.General Bajwa, accompanied by ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz, had gone to Saudi Arabia at the behest of Imran Khan’s government in a bid to clarify matters and restore good relations between the two countries. The Saudi leadership is believed to have taken offence over remarks made earlier this month, by Pakistan’s foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who accused the Saudi-backed Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of dilly-dallying on Pakistan’s request for a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers on Kashmir.Instead, Bajwa held talks with Saudi Deputy Minister for Defence Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.This is being seen as a deliberate snub by the Saudi leadership to Pakistan’s overtures, say officials in Islamabad. But the failed mission in Saudi Arabia is also creating a gap on foreign policy matters between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the military leadership. Officials say that major foreign policy initiatives are taken with the nod of the army high command and the statement by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi against the OIC was no exception.“It is in this context that one must read the statement of minister Dr Shireen Mazari,” said an analyst. Dr Mazari has bitterly criticized the foreign ministry and praised the foreign policy initiatives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.Khan finally broke his silence on the issue on Tuesday. In a wide ranging interview with a private television channel, when asked about relations with Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan’s role “is not to divide the Muslim world”.He commented that Saudi Arabia has its own foreign policy. “News of breakdown in relations with Saudi Arabia is completely baseless,” he told his interviewer, adding “Saudi Arabia has helped Pakistan in every difficult time.”At the same time, Khan called China a long-time friend of Pakistan. “It should be clear that our future is connected with China,” he stressed. He said China had stood by Pakistan through good and bad times. “We are further strengthening our ties with China. China also needs Pakistan very much. Unfortunately, Western countries are using India against China,” he added.Amidst the confusion, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who started the row, remains unfazed. Over the weekend, local channels reported that Qureshi had reportedly slapped the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister, Azam Khan, after a heated argument.According to a media report, the minister wanted to meet Imran when Azam Khan stopped him outside the office. That is when Qureshi lost his temper and slapped him. Qureshi has reportedly expressed his disappointment at not being allowed to enter the office premises. The Foreign Office has rejected the report saying that no such incident took place.Critics are of the opinion that it is also not without significance that Qureshi met Qatar’s new envoy Sheikh Saoud bin Abdul Rehman Al-Thani on the same day as the army chief went to Saudi Arabia.The new envoy is from Qatar’s royal family. A diplomat said his appointment reflected the interest Qatar is showing in expanding relations with Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-breaks-silence-on-qureshi-remark-says-no-problems-in-ties-with-saudi/story-LghQaPf3oAyJDnJpk3qsqM.html
19-08-2020||World||As White House pushes ‘skinny’ Covid-19 bill, Democrat sees September action||The White House on Wednesday pushed for Congress to take up a narrow coronavirus economic relief bill that Democrats have long rejected, while a leading Senate Democrat said real action may come soon after the Sept. 7 US Labor Day holiday.With the breakdown of talks between the White House and top congressional Democrats now in its 12th day, Senate Republicans are floating a “skinny” version of the $1 trillion bill proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for a possible vote in the Republican-led chamber.That bill ran into immediate opposition from both Democrats and McConnell’s own Republicans when he unveiled it late last month.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called on Democrats to use Saturday’s vote on US Postal Service legislation in the House of Representatives as a vehicle for coronavirus relief including stimulus checks for individuals and funding for personal protective equipment and schools.“I think the outlook for a skinny deal is better than it’s ever been and yet we are still not there,” Meadows told reporters. “If Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi moves forward a single bill on postal ... let’s add in the things we can agree upon.”But leading Democrats have flatly rejected White House and Republican calls for narrow legislation, saying Americans need broad legislation and accusing Republicans of failing to grasp the severity of the crisis.House Democratic leaders are resisting calls by some centrist Democrats, including Representative Derek Kilmer, to hold a separate vote Saturday on extending federal unemployment benefits.“Saturday focus is postal,” a senior Democratic aide said, adding that there’s “still more consensus building in (the) caucus to be done.”Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said that he does not expect the White House to get serious about negotiations until after next week’s Republican presidential election convention, where he expects Republicans to tout President Donald Trump’s executive orders on coronavirus relief.“Once we get out of the Republican convention, the week before Labor Day, you’re going to see serious negotiations restart. And that means we could do something possibly right after Labor Day, when we return,” Kaine said in an online interview with Politico.The Senate is due to return from recess on Sept. 8 and the House on Sept. 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-white-house-pushes-skinny-covid-19-bill-democrat-sees-september-action/story-7doSuaARgAdXhBuIr8nVcO.html

Florida’s daily average reported deaths over the past week was 167 deaths. Two weeks ago, it peaked at 185 deaths.The state reported a total of 584,047 coronavirus cases, a daily increase of 4,115 cases.Hospitalizations for the virus have been declining for nearly a month, and the growth in new cases has been decelerating. The positivity rate for Covid-19 testing in Florida has averaged about 11.4% over the past week.There were 5,351 patients being treated for the disease in Florida hospitals early Wednesday — down from peaks above 9,500 patients in late July.Meanwhile, Florida’s largest teacher’s union argued with attorneys for the state of Florida during a hearing over whether schools should reopen during the pandemic.The Florida Education Association sued Governor Ron DeSantis, Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, the Florida Department of Education and others to stop brick-and-mortar schools from physically reopening, arguing it is unsafe to do so until the spread of the virus is under control.The teacher’s union is seeking an injunction from a judge in Tallahassee to stop schools from reopening by this Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/174-new-deaths-push-florida-s-covid-19-toll-to-over-10-000/story-HYYXNWlQ7PmWFvLLhMvS1N.html
19-08-2020||World||San Francisco blanketed in smoke as California fires rage||Thousands of people were under orders to evacuate in regions surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area Wednesday as nearly 40 wildfires blazed across the state amid a blistering heat wave now in its second week. Smoke blanketed the city of San Francisco.“Throughout the state of California right now, we are stretched thin for crews” because of the fires, said Will Powers, a state fire spokesman. “Air resources have been stretched thin throughout the whole state.”Police and firefighters went door-to-door early Wednesday in a frantic scramble to warn residents to evacuate as fire encroached on Vacaville, a city of about 100,000 that lies between San Francisco and Sacramento. Fire officials said at least 50 structures were destroyed and 50 damaged, and four people were injured.Television footage showed some homes in flames and thick ash dropping in a rural area near Interstate 80 as the fire appeared to head toward more densely populated areas.Diane Bustos told KPIX-TV that she and her husband tried to drive out but their vehicle caught on fire and they had to flee on foot.“I got all these flames on me and I lost my shoe, but I made it. God saved me,” she said.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the blaze was exhibiting “extreme fire behavior” and challenging firefighters.To the south in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, about 22,000 people were ordered to evacuate because of a fire that was burning in dense wooded parkland but threatened communities, Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox said.“This is a very active timber fire burning in two counties with a serious threat to both public safety and for structures that are out in front of it,” he said.Thousands of homes and businesses were also threatened in the wine-growing counties of Napa and Sonoma in an area devastated by a series of deadly blazes in the last three years. At least seven fires were grouped together as one of two major Lightning Fires in Northern California, a nod to their origins just a day earlier.Powers said much of the fire was burning through rural areas with steep terrain, making it difficult to get crews in.In Napa County, Gail Bickett, 80, loaded up her three dogs in a truck to evacuate as the fire burned behind houses across the road, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.“It’s scary,” she said. “It’s overwhelming.”In the East San Francisco Bay, a cluster of 20 separate lightning-sparked fires threatened about 1,400 structures in rugged terrain with dense brush. Strong winds and low humidity made the firefight challenging.Blazes engulfed rural and forest areas near the San Francisco Bay Area, near Salinas in Monterey County, around Oroville Dam north of Sacramento, forested areas west of Silicon Valley, in remote Mendocino County and near the Nevada state line north of Lake Tahoe.Several also were burning in northern coastline areas and in Southern California.Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a statewide state of emergency Tuesday.The cluster of wine country fires threaten an area that only last year grappled with another massive blaze that forced 200,000 to flee — a task made more complicated this year because of the pandemic.Tuesday afternoon, the fire was moving toward an area called Atlas Peak that burned in 2017 in a blaze that killed six people and destroyed nearly 800 buildings. The California Highway Patrol said helicopter crews were unable to do rescues in the area because the smoke was too thick to fly in.Robin Sisemore hosed down vegetation in front of her mother’s adjacent house. Both homes were new, replacing ones that burned just three years ago.To the south, evacuations were ordered for all of Boulder Creek to the west of Silicon Valley, a community of 5,000 high in the Santa Cruz mountains where windy, long, forested roads, some paved, some dirt, can easily become blocked during storms or fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/san-francisco-blanketed-in-smoke-as-california-fires-rage/story-LO2r4X1gdDYDAFXNbvyjHI.html
19-08-2020||World||Typhoon adds to southern China’s rain and flooding woes||China suffered a double blow Wednesday of flooding and landslides from unusually heavy seasonal rains and a typhoon that came ashore on its southern coast. Five people were missing in Yunnan province in the southwest after a landslide destroyed two houses, the official People’s Daily newspaper said. In Sichuan province, 21 vehicles parked in a square in Yibin city fell into a hole after the road beneath them collapsed in the middle of the night. No one was injured, according to media reports.Flooding has left more than 200 people dead or missing in China this year and caused USD 25 billion in damage, authorities said last week. Typhoon Higos drenched Hong Kong overnight before making landfall in Zhuhai, a city in Guangdong province, in the morning with maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour, China’s National Meteorological Center said. It weakened to a tropical storm as it moved west toward the neighboring Guangxi region. More than 65,000 people were evacuated, schools were closed and many fishing boats returned to port along the coast, according to Chinese media reports. Power was knocked out in Meizhou city in northeastern Guangdong province on Tuesday night after trees fell onto power lines, the electric company said. The worst of the flooding appeared to be over in Sichuan, where the emergency level was lowered Wednesday morning and the toes of a famous Buddhist statue re-emerged as waters receded, news reports said. It was the first time in at least 70 years that water had reached the foot of the Leshan Giant Buddha, a 71-meter (233-foot) -tall statue carved into the side of a mountain in the eighth century. Emei Mountain, a nearby tourist site, reopened to visitors after being closed for nearly three days. The sprawling Chongqing municipality saw its worst flooding since 1981. Water covered roofs in low-lying areas of the historic town of Ciqikou, which was closed to tourists because of the rains from Tuesday evening. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping visited hard-hit Anhui province, where the 13 sluice gates of the Wagnjiaba dam had been opened, flooding farmland and forests to prevent more extensive damage downriver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-adds-to-southern-china-s-rain-and-flooding-woes/story-D77mpSoOdZjOvnhmqCSA0J.html
19-08-2020||World||Mystery grows over Covid-19 spread via contaminated food packaging||Evidence shows that food is an unlikely route of transmitting the coronavirus across borders, but contaminated items continue to grab the spotlight, deepening the uncertainty over whether the $220 billion cold chain industry could be implicated in the spread of Covid-19.China has repeatedly found traces of the pathogen on packaging and food, raising fears that imported items are linked to recent virus resurgences in Beijing and the port city of Dalian. In the nation’s strongest action since it began testing food items in June, a major Chinese city on Sunday banned imports of frozen meat from coronavirus hotspots.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCold-storage facilities and meat processing plants are ideal environments for the virus to spread, as the pathogen thrives in cold and dry environments. But there has been no concrete evidence the virus can be transmitted through food, and experts remain doubtful that it’s a major threat.“We know that viruses usually can survive being frozen. So that means in theory it’s possible that infection could spread that way,” said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong. “But in reality, it’s a very low risk that that would happen because so many steps would need to be involved.”The virus would need to survive freezing and then defrosting. It would need to get onto someone’s hands and then into their nose or mouth, and still survive. “I don’t think it would be a frequent mode of transmission, but it is possible,” he said.China’s top respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan, who advises Beijing on its Covid-19 response, downplayed the role frozen food can play in transmission. “It is relatively rare to detect the virus from imported frozen food,” he said. “Let’s not exaggerate it.”Guangzhou banAmid a lack of conclusive proof, China is taking precautionary steps, creating major disruptions with its trading partners. The Cold Chain Association of China’s southern coastal city of Guangzhou ordered all member companies to suspend imports of frozen meat and seafood from coronavirus-hit areas.The order was issued after the local government in the nearby city of Shenzhen found the virus on a surface sample of chicken wings imported from Brazil. Hong Kong has also suspended imports from that plant.China has otherwise refrained from wider nationwide moves against imported meat due to the reliance of its population on the food source.New Zealand originally considered the possibility that a new cluster, which suddenly emerged last week after 102 days without a local virus case, could have been linked to a cold-storage plant, as the first person to test positive worked at an Auckland Americold facility.Ruled outBut preliminary findings from environmental testing at the plant have debunked the theory that the route of transmission was through chilled surfaces on materials arriving from overseas, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said Tuesday.“The full report will have the details but it seems clear now that the possibility is being ruled out from that investigation,” he said.A key unanswered question is whether the traces that China has detected on the packaging and surface of frozen foods are still viable and infectious, or whether they’re just dead and harmless vestiges of the pathogen.“What we know publicly and what we’ve seen so far is that yes this virus can survive outside people for up to a few days, depending on the environment,” said Sarah Cahill, senior food standards officer at Codex Alimentarius Commission, the body responsible for developing food standards under the World Health Organization and the United Nations.“But what are we actually detecting when we do these tests?” she said. “Are we just detecting RNA, which just means maybe this virus is no longer viable, or is that virus still an infectious agent?”It is not uncommon for a wide array of viruses, bacteria and parasites to be transmitted through contaminated food. The WHO estimates that almost one in 10 people in the world fall ill after eating contaminated food, leading to 420,000 deaths every year. Salmonella and the norovirus on produce or uncooked meat and seafood can cause symptoms like diarrhea and inflammation in the stomach and intestines.While diarrhea can be one of the symptoms of Covid-19 as well, experts are more focused on the possibility of the virus jumping from surfaces to human respiratory systems when people touch their faces after coming into contact with a contaminated item. Even then, some consider that scenario far-fetched.“Theoretically, it’s possible ,” said Takeshi Kasai, WHO’s regional director for the Western Pacific region, during an online briefing on Tuesday. “But so far our observations or the evidence coming from the past seven months of epidemiology: it is unlikely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-grows-over-covid-19-spread-via-contaminated-food-packaging/story-tkZ24sn6QGWBfkBbA5uXCI.html
19-08-2020||World||US election 2020: Democrats officially nominate Joe Biden for president||US Democrats officially nominated former Vice-President Joe Biden as their nominee for president on the second night of the mostly virtual convention at which two former presidents, two former secretaries of states and his wife, Jill Biden, spoke of him as the kind of unifying leader the nation needed now.“Thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart,” Biden said in brief remarks from home in Delaware, as his family broke into a small celebration. “Thank you all, it means the world to me and my family and I will see you on Thursday.” Also read: Joe Biden reassures India | HT EditorialOn Thursday, Biden is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech.Delegations from states and territories reported their votes from the primaries and caucuses in a virtual roll call.Biden waited 32 years to win the nomination after he first sought it in 1987. He had dropped out then even before the primaries over plagiarism allegations. He tried again in 2008 but pulled out after a poor showing in the first of the nominating contests, the Iowa caucus.Speakers on the second day of the convention included two former presidents — Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton; two former Secretaries of State — John Kerry and Colin Powell, a Republican; and one former defence secretary Chuck Hagel, also a Republican.Clinton, whose participation in the convention had been opposed by some Democrats because of past allegations of sexual harassment, launched a blistering attack on President Donald Trump’s handling of the epidemic. He said the Oval Office should operate at this time like a command centre; “instead, it’s a storm centre. There’s only chaos.”“If you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he’s your man,” Clinton said, adding that the choice before voters in November was between “Trump’s ‘Us vs. Them’ America against Joe Biden’s America, where we all live and work together.”Also read: Kamala Harris seeks to define role of US vice president on Joe Biden’s ticket“We deserve a person with integrity and judgment, someone who is honest and fair, someone who is committed to what is best for the American people,” said Carter, without mentioning Trump. “Joe is that kind of leader, and he is the right person for this moment in our nation’s history.”Secretary Powell, who became the second high-profile Republican to make an appearance at the Democratic convention in after John Kasich, said, “Today, we are a country divided, and we have a president doing everything in his power to make it that way and keep us that way.”Secretary Kerry attacked President Trump’s conduct of foreign relations. “When this president goes overseas, it isn’t a goodwill mission, it’s a blooper reel. He breaks up with our allies and writes love letters to dictators. America deserves a president who is looked up to, not laughed at.”The former first lady, who headlined the night, closed by talking of the man she has known and how he is someone who lost his wife and daughter to an accident and then a son to brain cancer understood the challenges confronting Americans in these uncertain times, and how he would address them.“I hear it from so many of you, the frustration of parents juggling work while they support their children’s learning—or are afraid that their kids might get sick from school,” she said of life in the shadow of the Covid-19 epidemic. A lifelong school teacher, she spoke from a high school in Delaware.She added, “The burdens we carry are heavy, and we need someone with strong shoulders. I know that if we entrust this nation to Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours: bring us together and make us whole.”Jill Biden did not mention President Trump at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-democrats-officially-nominate-joe-biden-for-president/story-LP53kWWNy2pqni357gSOgM.html

Meanwhile in Puli Khumri, the capital of northern Baghlan province, a bomb targeted a vehicle belonging to the provincial intelligence department, killing two service members and wounding 11 people, including both military and civilians, said Nazir Najem, the provincial governor’s spokesman.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz said one of the sticky bombs was attached to a police vehicle, while the other was attached to a car belonging to the education ministry. The police were investigating, he said.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said he was not aware of the explosions in Kabul.Meanwhile, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a mortar attack the previous day in Kabul that killed three people, including two government employees, and wounded at least 16, including four children and woman. Tariq Arian, the Interior Ministry’s spokesman, said militants fired a barrage of rockets from two vehicles toward different areas of the city. Earlier, reports said only that there were 10 wounded. The attacks came as Afghans on Tuesday marked their country’s Independence Day. The Islamic State group said it fired 16 mortar shells, targeting the presidential palace, embassies and Afghan government offices in Kabul. Authorities said most of the shells hit residential homes. The violence comes amid new uncertainties over the start of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul political leadership. The government said it would not release the last 320 Taliban prisoners it holds until the insurgents free more captured Afghan soldiers. The decision went against that of a traditional Afghan council held earlier this month — the Loya Jirga — and is likely to further delay intra-Afghan peace talks sought by the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-attacks-in-kabul-north-afghanistan-kill-4-injure-13-report/story-JfZizeaiqCuSqJnmf0hQPP.html

Protesters burned Israeli and American flags, trampled on posters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, and chanted “normalisation is betrayal to Jerusalem and Palestine.” Unlike Palestinian protesters last Friday near the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City who also burned posters of the Emirati crown prince, the Gaza demonstrators stopped short of burning symbols of the UAE — apparently not to antagonise the Gulf Arab country, where tens of thousands of Palestinians work and live.Also read: Telephone service begins between UAE and Israel amid deal The demonstrators in Gaza City also voiced support for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for his rejection of President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, which the Palestinians say unfairly favours Israel. The protest was organised by the militant Hamas group, which rules the Gaza Strip, and other factions. Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, denounced the Israeli-Emirati deal. “Normalisation with the occupation harms us and doesn’t serve us,” he said. “Instead, it serves and promotes the occupation in its projects that target Palestine and the region.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-in-gaza-rally-against-israel-uae-deal/story-zJg9IfdX1hGpx4MSEWFCdJ.html

You don’t come out of it the same — either better or worse,’‘ Francis said, adding improvised remarks to his planned speech for his weekly public audience.“We must come out better” from the Covid-19 pandemic, the pope said.After the Covid-19 pandemic, the pope said, the world can’t return to normality if normal means social injustice and degradation of the natural environment.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicFrancis said: “How sad it would be if for the Covid-19 vaccine priority is given to the richest.”“It would be sad if this vaccine were to become the property of this nation or another, rather than universal and for all,” the pontiff added, without indicating any particular country.He also said it would be scandalous if all the economic assistance in the works, most of it using public funds, ends up reviving industries that don’t help the poor or the environment.“The pandemic has laid bare the difficult situation of the poor and the great inequality that reigns in the world,’‘ the pope said in his speech. ”And the virus, while it doesn’t make exceptions among persons, has found in its path, devastating, great inequalities and discrimination,” Francis said, adding “and it has increased them.Throughout the pandemic, many poor, who often have jobs that don’t allow them to work from home, have found themselves less able to shelter from possible contagion during stay-at-home strategies enacted by many nations to reduce the contagion rate. Access to the best health care for the poor is often impossible in many parts of the world.Francis said response to the pandemic must be twofold. On one hand, “it’s indispensable to find the cure for such a small but tremendous virus, that brings the entire world to its knees.”On the other hand, “we must treat a great virus, that of social injustice, of inequality of opportunity, of being marginalized and of lack of protection of the weakest,” Francis said.Francis has dedicated much of his papacy to highlighting the plight of those living on life’s margins, saying societies must put them at the center of their attention.Noting how many are eager to return to normality and resume economic activity, Francis voiced caution: “Sure, but this ‘normality’ must not include social injustices and degradation of the environment.”“Today we have an occasion to build something different. For example, we can grow an economy of integral development of the poor and not of welfare,” the pope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-can-t-get-priority-for-covid-19-vaccine-poor-need-help-pope-francis/story-1z4uhC08ogG3XQa3jXeAhI.html

However, Trudeau also prorogued Parliament till a Throne Speech by the country’s Governor-General on September 23, the equivalent of the President’s speech opening Parliament in India. By proroguing Parliament, Trudeau has ensured all activity ceases.In a statement, his office said, “This speech will present the government’s detailed vision for the future.” This could well turn into a vote of no confidence, as one major Opposition party, the Bloc Quebecois has already said it will precipitate such a vote unless Trudeau resigns. Also read: Canadian foreign minister resigns over differences with TrudeauParty leader Yves-François Blanchet reiterated that position to reporters in Ottawa, as he said of the Throne Speech, “If it does not contain what it must contain, he will simply not survive a vote on his speech from the throne.” If the Liberal Party Government does lose that vote, it may mean fresh elections to the House of Commons before the end of 2020, barely a year since Trudeau’s returned to power in October last year, though with a minority mandate.The change in who will be in charge of the finance ministry at a crucial juncture attracted plenty of flak from the Opposition. Pierre Poilievre, finance critic for the principal opposition Conservative Party, said, “We now have a government of corruption, coverup and chaos at a time of a deadly pandemic and the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression.” That point was also reflected in the view of Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, who said in a statement, “Shutting down Parliament in the middle of a pandemic and an economic crisis, with a planned sitting next week and committees working hard to get answers and solutions for Canadians, is wrong. Canadians shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Mr Trudeau’s scandals.”Trudeau, meanwhile, stressed that a new Throne Speech, which lays out the Government’s agenda, was necessary, since the one “delivered eight months ago made no mention of Covid-19, had no conception of the reality we find ourselves in right now.” He also said his Government will seek to “reset” its “approach” for a “recovery to build back better.”The decision to prorogue Parliament comes in the context of hearings by two Parliamentary panels into the grant of a $912 million contract to WE Charity, which was cancelled after an uproar over its links to Trudeau and his family, including making payments to his mother, wife and brother. Those investigations will be stalled, even as the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner continues with his own probe of Trudeau in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-canada-s-finance-minister-steps-down-pm-trudeau-prorogues-parliament/story-JuX1f5VN1eK7QCB3OGeqdO.html

The series of crashes led to a complete closure of one of the main traffic arteries of Berlin.Local media reported that the man later stopped on the highway and put a box on the roof of his car claiming it had explosives inside. Specialists opened the box and found only tools. The man was detained by police, media reported.Police and prosecutors would not confirm the reports on Wednesday morning.The incident led to long traffic jams Tuesday evening. Some 300 people were stuck on the highway for hours and were getting support from the German Red Cross, the Berlin fire department tweeted Tuesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/series-of-crashes-last-night-leads-to-shutdown-of-berlin-highway/story-TUrnBZSCGlShwBO99TlihK.html
19-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris seeks to define role of US vice president on Joe Biden’s ticket||Kamala Harris’s prime-time speech at the Democratic convention on Wednesday night will be the first glimpse of how Joe Biden’s campaign plans to deploy a history-making vice presidential nominee as they work to define her role for a campaign that has largely been grounded by the coronavirus.The Biden campaign has a clear idea of the people they want Harris to win over in November: Black voters, younger voters and women. But as they strictly abide by health guidelines forced by coronavirus, they are severely limiting the candidates’ travel to in-person events and sharing few details about how Harris will engage with voters.Harris, a California senator and former state attorney general, distinguished herself during the primaries with sharp attacks on Biden’s civil rights record, nearly turning the race upside-down and exposing a possible liability to Biden’s candidacy among liberals, minorities and young people.Now, she’ll attempt to rally those same key constituencies around Biden, starting with the day before he accepts his party’s nomination. Her speech on Wednesday will be a critical opportunity to re-introduce herself to what will be one of the largest audiences she will reach before November. She is expected to share her cross-cultural origin story which echoes that of former President Barack Obama.The daughter of divorced immigrant parents, a University of California-Berkeley biologist from India, and a Stanford economics professor from Jamaica, she grew up a child of the civil rights movement in 1960s Oakland, California. She later attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, DC.That biography has energized key constituency groups, especially Black women. Members of her Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority were mainstays on the campaign trail when she was running for president and are expected to mobilize in force to support the new ticket.Harris will also have to navigate her background as a prosecutor after a summer of nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. She was elected district attorney in San Francisco in 2003 and attorney general of California in 2010. After her election to the U.S. Senate in 2017, she earned a reputation for her incisive cross-examination of witness in Senate hearings, in particular Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.She’s already signaling that she’ll bring that prosecutorial style to the campaign.“The case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut,” she said last week as Biden announced her as his running mate.In the week since, she’s proved to be a safe choice, but not a game-changing one. And that’s the best that any presidential candidate can ask for.“I don’t think it matters who the vice presidential candidate is historically,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on MSNBC before Harris was selected. She noted exceptions like “Lyndon Johnson for victory and Sarah Palin for defeat,” but added, “By and large it’s all about the two candidates for president.”Indeed, polls show Harris has made no difference to the vast majority of voters. An ABC/Washington Post poll Monday found 69% said the choice did not make them more or less likely to vote for the Democratic ticket. Only 18%, mostly liberals and African Americans, said Harris made them more likely to vote for Biden, and 11% said they were less likely to vote for the former vice president.Still, she seems to have passed the most important test. Voters see her as just as ready to take over the presidency as current Vice President Mike Pence, with 55% of voters seeing them both as qualified.Christopher Devine of the University of Dayton, and Kyle Kopco, authors of the book “Do Running Mates Matter?” say the choice matters mostly because of what it says about the candidate at the top of the ticket. The pick is the first presidential decision a candidate makes, and this one provides a window into Biden’s judgment and his ideology.“It’s a signal of whether Joe Biden is going to the left or anchoring himself in the center where he’s always stood,” Devine said. “Harris probably nudges him a little to the left. At the very least it’s a signal that he sees the importance of the left to his campaign.”During her 10-month campaign for the presidential nomination, Harris herself struggled to define herself ideologically in a crowded field of candidates. She positioned herself to the left of moderates like Biden, but never ventured as far as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.She briefly soared to second place in the polls after her debate takedown of Biden’s past positions on forced busing to enforce school desegregation and his work with senators who were segregationists.But among the biggest differences with Biden during the primary campaign was her short-lived support for Medicare for All — the latest branding of a single-payer, government-run health care system. She retreated from that position while still a presidential candidate.Her lack of a defined message combined with staff infighting and fundraising struggles led to the demise of her campaign in December, an early exit that likely helped preserve her chances to join the ticket.After Wednesday’s speech, Harris’s next big moment will be her debate against Pence in October, but most of her attacks are sure to be directed to the top of the Republican ticket. And how Trump responds could be more revealing than the attacks themselves.Trump has called her a “mad woman,” the “meanest” senator, a “nasty” woman and “disrespectful” to his Supreme Court picks and even Biden himself.“We’ve seen this with Donald Trump going back to 2016,” Devine said. “His response seems to be more aggressive when it comes to being challenged by women as opposed to men.“Kamala Harris could be that threat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-seeks-to-define-role-of-us-vice-president-on-joe-biden-s-ticket/story-r7LaWCY5PZS74WBT5hQNFN.html

Susan B Anthony was an American social reformer and a prominent anti-slavery rights activist but was best known for her role in the 19th century movement to secure voting rights for women. At the age of 52, she was arrested for voting in the 1872 elections held in Rochester, New York, in violation of laws permitting only men to vote. As America celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment—also known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment—President @realDonaldTrump will officially pardon its namesake.News of the day: https://t.co/DaQTQQYSok pic.twitter.com/8s5VlWqxIfAnthony refused to pay the fine and the authorities took no further action against her. Hundred years ago in  1920, her struggles bore fruit and the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution gave women the right to vote.Anthony was an active participant in the abolitionist movement of the 1840s, temperance movement (against consumption of alcoholic beverages), and a founding member of National Woman Suffrage Association (1869). Trump’s pardon comes amid outcry over postal services disruptions that Democrats say could render people unable to vote if they opt for mail-in voting. As a result of the protest, the United States Postal Service (USPS) decided to suspend the proposed operational changes till after the 2020 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-susan-b-anthony-pardoned-by-us-president-donald-trump/story-r2yDURVjvSelcHVTGHYTFI.html
19-08-2020||World||Explained: What is in-mail voting and the debate around it ahead of US elections 2020||The Democratic Party has nominated Joe Biden as its presidential candidate to take on Republican Donald Trump in the November election. The decision was taken at the ongoing convention of the party.The coronavirus pandemic has posed serious problems ahead of the election, and many are pushing for expanded use of postal ballots as against in-person voting to ensure social distancing and stay safe from the disease which has wreaked havoc in the United States.Trump is opposed to the system claiming it will lead to voter fraud. His party has accused that the practice of postal ballots will lead to rigged election.The case for in-mail voting:With the Trump administration openly trying to undermine mail-in voting this fall, some election officials around the country are hoping to bypass the Postal Service by installing lots of ballot drop boxes in libraries, community centres and other public places.Such boxes have been used with success for several years in states like Oregon, Washington and Colorado that rely largely or entirely on ballots that must be sent in. But their use is being expanded because of the coronavirus outbreak.State or local authorities in places such as Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are pressing for more boxes or drop-off sites that would enable ballots to reach election officials without going through the mail.What is in-mail voting:The process is simply sending a vote by mail. In the US, when the election authorities receive such a request, they send ballot to the address of the voter who wants to exercise this option after vetting the application. The voter (or a group of them) can then sign the envelope, casts it and send the ballot boxes back to authorities.Voting by mail is not new in the United States - nearly 1 in 4 voters cast 2016 presidential ballots that way. Routine methods and the decentralised nature of US elections make it very hard to interfere with mailed ballots, experts say.While mail balloting has its drawbacks, it can help minimise the long lines, faulty voting machines and Covid-19-induced staffing shortages that have plagued some elections this year.What are the hurdles?There are 17 states in the US such as Texas, New York and Louisiana that would need to change their policies to guarantee that everyone who wants to vote by mail in November is able to do that.It will be expensive. The Brennan Centre for Justice estimated the cost of ensuring that vote by mail was available for all voters could be up to $1.4 billion, with postage alone costing up to $600 million.How secure is the process?Election experts say it would be nearly impossible for foreign actors to disrupt an election by mailing out fake ballots.Ballots aren’t counted if they aren’t printed on the proper type of paper and don’t include specific technical markings.States also require voters to sign the outside of their envelope, which they match to a signature on file.Some 29 states and the District of Columbia allow voters to track their ballots to ensure they are received, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fourteen states and DC also allow voters to return their ballots by hand if they don’t trust the mail.Those envelopes are typically opened by a different group of workers than those who scan the ballots. Outside observers are allowed to monitor the process to ensure voter privacy.What about incidents of fraud?As with other forms of voting, documented cases of mail-ballot fraud are extremely rare.The conservative Heritage Foundation, which has warned of the risks of mail voting, found 14 cases of attempted mail fraud out of roughly 15.5 million ballots cast in Oregon since that state started conducting elections by mail in 1998.How is President Trump dealing with it?Trump made clear last week that he was blocking $25 billion in emergency aid to the Postal Service, acknowledging he wanted to curtail election mail operations, as well as a Democratic proposal to provide $3.6 billion in additional election money to the states to help process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.Trump criticised postal operations and claimed that universal mail-in ballots would be “a disaster”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-in-mail-voting-and-the-debate-around-it-ahead-of-us-elections-2020/story-xvNXQEDFtGjhSu0Ed3B6wJ.html

Last week, in an interview to an American broadcaster, top US expert Anthony Fauci said that he believes the vaccine should be out by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Fauci said that even half an effective vaccine would be enough to get the pandemic in control by the end of 2021. Here are the key developments in the quest to developing the Covid-19 vaccine:• Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate could be the first to be available to the Indian population if it gets the required clearances by the end of this year. Pune-based vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) has already received a nod from for India’s top drug regulatory body for conducting phase-II and III clinical trials on the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine.• Australia has secured access to a “promising” coronavirus vaccine, prime minister Scott Morrison announced on Tuesday. This comes as Australia recently sealed a deal with Swedish-British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to receive the Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Oxford University. Morrison said that country would manufacture it and offer free doses to the entire population.• State-owned Chinese pharmaceutical company SinoPharm said its Covid-19 vaccine will be commercially available by the end of the year. Liu Jingzhen, the chairman of the company, told a Chinese daily that the vaccine would cost less than 1,000 yuan ($140). Jingzhen also said that the vaccine would be administered in two shots in a gap of 28 days.Also read: Mild Covid-19 cases can produce strong T cell response - Study• The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a global pact aimed at providing easy and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccine to countries across the globe.

The programme is aimed at delivering 2 billion doses of effective, approved Covid-19 vaccines by the end of next year.• American biotechnology company Moderna, which is the first company in the United States to conduct a Phase III clinical trial of the potential Covid-19 vaccine, is aiming to enrol 30,000 volunteers for its trial, a CNN report stated.

19-08-2020||World||Donald Trump cancels China talks, raising questions about trade deal||President Donald Trump said he called off last weekend’s trade talks with China, raising questions about the future of a trade deal that is now the most stable point in an increasingly tense relationship.“I canceled talks with China,” Trump said Tuesday in Yuma, Arizona. “I don’t want to talk to China right now.”The phase-one trade deal, which came into force in February, had called for discussions on implementation of the agreement every six months. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was supposed to hold a video conference call with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, but it was postponed indefinitely.While China is making many of the structural changes it promised on issues such as intellectual property protection, its purchases of U.S. goods are well below where they need to be to meet promised targets, and there’s almost no chance they can be fulfilled now with the damage Covid-19 has done to the global economy. A collapse of the deal risks leading to a return of the tit-for-tat tariff war that hurt trade and companies around the world.Addressing whether the U.S. would pull out of the phase-one deal, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens.” Terminating the deal would require a written notification and take effect 60 days later, unless both parties agree on a different date.The talks never made it on to any official public calendar in Washington or Beijing, but the South China Morning Post reported that they were set for last Saturday. Earlier, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that information on high-level talks will be released “in due course.”China Is Buying American But Not Enough to Hit Trade Deal TargetTrump has stepped up pressure on China over everything from democracy in Taiwan and Hong Kong to popular apps WeChat and TikTok as he looks to make up ground in the polls before the November election. One of his main goals with the trade deal was to lower the U.S. deficit with China, but now it’s rising again.Even if China can buy enough soybeans, corn or pork to meet its promises on agriculture, it’s unlikely it can buy enough oil and gas to meet the promises on energy. In addition, the collapse of international travel will hit Chinese demand for new U.S. planes and has stopped hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens from traveling to the U.S. for college or tourism, decimating U.S. services exports.Trump has been stepping up complaints about China, particularly over the spread of the coronavirus, which he regularly calls the “China Virus.”“What China did to the world was unthinkable,” Trump said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-cancels-china-talks-raising-questions-about-trade-deal/story-PgOv82VYx57tQCgpU0oBzI.html
19-08-2020||World||Explainer: World Health Organization’s struggle for a global Covid-19 vaccine plan||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday urged countries to join a global pact aimed at ensuring less wealthy countries have access to Covid-19 vaccines, warning about the risks from so-called “vaccine nationalism.” Here is a look at the WHO’s plan and the approaches by wealthier nations.What is the WHO’s vaccine program?The COVAX global vaccines facility is a program designed to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and distribute it equitably around the world. Its aim is to deliver 2 billion doses of effective, approved Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.Also read: New immunity insights a boost against Covid-19The details of the program are still being hashed out ahead of an Aug. 31 deadline for nations to join. It is led by the WHO, along with the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). COVAX is part of a broader program, called the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, that works to ensure that vaccines, treatments, diagnostic tests and other healthcare resources are broadly available to combat the pandemic.What all wealthier nations are doing? They have focused on securing vaccines for their own citizens, striking deals for the first doses even as data has yet to prove the vaccines to be effective. Governments including United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union have spent tens of billions of dollars on deals with vaccine makers such as Pfizer Inc, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc and others. The United States alone has committed nearly $11 billion for development, testing, manufacture and stockpiling of hundreds of millions of doses. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayRussia and China are also working on vaccines and have already begun vaccinating some of their citizens.What kind of resources are being brought to bear?The ACT Accelerator is financed by a variety of nonprofits and governments. It is aiming to raise about $31 billion.So far, the COVAX facility has attracted interest from 92 poorer countries hoping for voluntary donations and 80 wealthier countries, a number little changed from a month ago, that would finance the scheme, according to the WHO.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage What is the WHO’s concern? The WHO has expressed concern that wealthier countries hoarding vaccines for their own citizens could impede efforts to end the pandemic.“We need to prevent vaccine nationalism,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a Tuesday virtual briefing. “Sharing finite supplies strategically and globally is actually in each country’s national interest.”WHO leaders have said that developing a coordinated global distribution system for Covid-19 vaccines that prioritize those at greatest risk of getting sick, such as healthcare workers, would help curb the spread of coronavirus worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-world-health-organization-s-struggle-for-a-global-covid-19-vaccine-plan/story-xZqTGh5yO1wjoU3WcNkBoI.html

The signal will be lowered to No. 3 between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., it said in a statement on its website.Most businesses close and public transport becomes limited when No. 8 signal or above is in place. The city is already facing its toughest social distancing restrictions so far due to a flare up of coronavirus cases, with restaurants forced to close at 6 p.m., public gatherings of more than two people banned and school lessons taking place online.Hong Kong canceled pre-market trading in the stock market and morning trading in securities market, including Hong Kong-China stock connect trading, and derivatives market has been delayed, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said in a statement.Under exchange rules, the morning trading session will be canceled if signal No. 8 or above is still hoisted at 9 a.m. Hong Kong time. If the signal isn’t lowered before noon, the entire day’s trading will be abandoned. HKEX is due to report its first-half earnings at noon and hold a media briefing in the afternoon.At 8 a.m., Higos was centered about 100 km west of Hong Kong’s observatory and is forecast to move northwest or west-northwest at about 20 km per hour inland and weaken gradually, the observatory said.As of 5 a.m., authorities had received nine reports of fallen trees, and one flood report, while two people were injured and sought treatment at hospital, local media RTHK reported.In 2018, the city raised the maximum No. 10 signal when Typhoon Mangkhut left the city with roads blocked, buildings damaged and low-lying areas flooded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-higos-shuts-down-hong-kong-with-tock-trading-in-doubt/story-HocDebH5KFaJKDUHKnxf2M.html

19-08-2020||World||WHO blasts ‘vaccine nationalism’ in last-ditch push against hoarding||Nations that hoard possible Covid-19 vaccines while excluding others will deepen the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday, issuing a last-ditch call for countries to join a global vaccine pact.The WHO has an Aug. 31 deadline for wealthier nations to join the “COVAX Global Vaccines Facility” for sharing vaccine hopefuls with developing countries. Tedros said he sent a letter to the WHO’s 194 member states, urging participation.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe global health agency also raised concerns that the pandemic’s spread was being driven now by younger people, many of whom were unaware they were infected, posing a danger to vulnerable groups. Tedros’ push for nations to join COVAX comes as the European Union, Britain, Switzerland and the United States strike deals with companies testing prospective vaccines. Russia and China are also working on vaccines, and the WHO fears national interests could impede global efforts.“We need to prevent vaccine nationalism,” Tedros told a virtual briefing. “Sharing finite supplies strategically and globally is actually in each country’s national interest.”The European Commission has urged EU states to skirt the WHO-led initiative, citing worries over its cost and speed. More than 21.9 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 772,647​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.‘NOT TWISTING ARMS’So far, the COVAX facility has attracted interest from 92 poorer countries hoping for voluntary donations and 80 wealthier countries, a number little changed from a month ago, that would finance the scheme, the WHO said.Still, some nations are waiting for the Aug. 31 deadline before making a commitment as the facility’s terms are still being finalised, Bruce Aylward, who leads the WHO’s ACT Accelerator initiative to speed supplies of Covid-19 diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, said.Read more: India eyes global front runners in Covid-19 vaccine plan“We are not twisting arms for people to join,” Aylward said. “We’ve had more and more discussions with a broader and broader group of players ... to work through what might be the barriers to collaborating - issues around price, issues around timing, issues around national expectations.”With more than 150 vaccines in development, about two dozen in human studies and a handful in late-stage trials, the WHO said even countries signing bilateral deals boost their odds by joining COVAX.“Which one will be the candidate that will be successful, we don’t know yet,” said Mariangela Simao, a WHO assistant director for drug and vaccine access. “By joining the facility at the same time that you do bilateral deals, you’re actually betting on a larger number of vaccine candidates.”COVAX now covers nine vaccine candidates.The WHO remains worried that infections among younger people are rising globally, putting at risk elderly and sick people in densely populated areas with weak health systems. “The epidemic is changing,” WHO Western Pacific regional director, Takeshi Kasai, said. “People in their 20s, 30s and 40s are increasingly driving the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-blasts-vaccine-nationalism-in-last-ditch-push-against-hoarding/story-tprhBIiJo3CR9TN5KXO7cJ.html
19-08-2020||World||CPC expels Xi’s critic, who accused him of provoking conflict with India to divert attention||China’s ruling Communist Party has expelled a staunch critic of President Xi Jinping who has accused him among others of “provoking” conflict with other countries, including with India, to divert the attention of the Chinese public from domestic economic and social tensions.The Communist Party of China (CPC) expelled Cai Xia, a former professor at the Central Party School, as punishment for speeches “that damaged the reputation of the country”, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Monday.Cai, 68, was punished because she had made speeches with “serious political problems”, the report said quoting a notice on the school’s website.Her speeches were of “extraordinarily execrable nature”, and seriously violated the political discipline of the party, the notice said.Cai told the Post that she was safe and well in the United States but declined to elaborate.In an interview to the UK’s Guardian newspaper in June, Cai said Xi was provoking conflict between China and India besides encouraging anti-American sentiment to consolidate his own position and authority.Asked what benefit is there to making China an enemy of the world and why Xi would provoke conflicts, Cai said, “there are several factors. Among them is that he wants to consolidate his own position and authority”.“Considering domestic economic and social tensions, as well as those in the party of the last few years, he will think of ways to divert the attention of the Chinese public, provoking conflict with other countries, for example encouraging anti-American sentiment and the recent clash between China and India”, she said, apparently referring to the clash in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.She also criticised Xi on multiple issues including the constitutional amendment removing the two-term limit for the President paving the way for lifelong tenure, secrecy related to coronavirus casualties and not acting to curb the virus when he came to know of it on January 7 this year.She said Xi forced through the amendment of China’s Constitution to abolish term limits for the President in 2018, giving him the ability to stay in power indefinitely.Cai said that China was moving towards disaster “because people cannot speak the truth.The party central school, where Cai worked is an important ideological institution was headed by Xi before he took over power in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cpc-expels-xi-s-critic-who-accused-him-of-provoking-conflict-with-india-to-divert-attention/story-DEr5fqZIQaruULAzFIkHbK.html
19-08-2020||World||Republicans preparing $500 billion Covid-19 relief proposal||Senate Republican leaders are preparing a slimmed-down virus relief package of roughly $500 billion that will include extended payments for unemployed people and smaller businesses, a GOP senator has said.The package will also include $10 billion for the embattled Postal Service, said one top GOP aide on Tuesday. The agency has become the focus of a campaign-season battle over whether it will have enough resources to handle an expected flood of mail-in ballots for this November’s presidential and congressional elections.Also read: Democrats set to retain senate, Republicans to keep HouseThe fight between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats has become a critical political battle that weaves together Trump’s troubled handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the deeply wounded economy.It also highlights newly imposed cuts in Postal Service operations that critics say are aimed at curtailing the agency’s ability to deliver mail-in votes in time for them to be counted this November. That has coincided with Trump’s repeated insistence, without foundation, that expected record levels of mail-in votes by people eager to avoid polling places will lead to widespread fraud in the presidential and congressional elections.Under intense public and political pressure, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said Tuesday that he would withhold some of the operational changes he has begun to impose, like the removal of mailboxes, until after the elections.Negotiations over a far larger coronavirus relief bill are expected to resume after Labor Day between the White House and top congressional Democrats. With Democrats demanding that bargainers piece together a wide-ranging measure, the trimmer package emerging from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said the emerging legislation will provide $300 weekly in extra federal payments for unemployed people above the state payments that beneficiaries receive. He said he believes the extra payments would run through 2020.A massive relief bill approved earlier this year provided $600 extra per week, but those payments expired at the end of July. Democrats want to continue the added $600 in payments, but Trump and congressional Republicans have pushed for less.Blunt said the trimmed-down measure would also have money for schools to cope with the coronavirus pandemic and for businesses struggling to stay open and retain employees during a staggering recession that has shuttered many companies.A second GOP Senate aide said the new proposal includes $105 billion for education.That aide said the plan also has $16 billion for virus testing and $29 billion for developing vaccines, manufacturing treatment and other initiatives aimed at conquering a virus that has killed more than 170,000 Americans and infected more than 5 million this year.The bill does not include a renewal of the one-time direct payments of up to $1,200 for taxpayers and dependents that were part of early legislation aimed at providing relief to people as the economy slowed to a near halt.The Democratic-led House approved a $3 trillion relief plan in May, while Senate Republicans offered a $1 trillion package. In negotiations between Democrats and the White House that dissolved in bitterness earlier this month, Democrats dropped their proposal to $2 trillion and asked Republicans to meet them at that halfway point, but that has not happened.The two GOP aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the legislation publicly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-preparing-500-billion-covid-19-relief-proposal/story-NVfwpRrJDUVEexp5Y4AONM.html

19-08-2020||World||Mali’s president and prime minister held by mutinous troops||Soldiers detained Mali’s president and prime minister Tuesday after surrounding a residence and firing into the air in an apparent coup attempt after several months of demonstrations calling for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s ouster.The soldiers moved freely through the streets of Bamako, making it increasingly clear that they were in control of the capital city. There was no immediate comment from the troops, who hailed from the same military barracks in Kati where an earlier coup originated more than eight years ago.African Union chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat condemned the “forced detention” of Malian leaders and called for their immediate release. He rejected “any attempt at the unconstitutional change of government.”The developments were also condemned by the United States, the United Nations, the regional bloc known as ECOWAS and former colonizer France, which along with a UN peacekeeping mission has worked since 2013 to stabilize the West African nation.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sought “the immediate restoration of constitutional order and rule of law,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.Tuesday’s political upheaval threatened to further jeopardize security in Mali, where the 2012 coup allowed an Islamic insurgency to take hold amid a power vacuum.But news of Keita’s detention was met with celebration throughout the capital by anti-government protesters who first took to the streets back in June to demand that the president step down three years before the end of his final term.The detention was a dramatic change of fortune for Keita, who seven years earlier emerged from a field of more than two dozen candidates to win Mali’s first democratic election post-coup in a landslide with more than 77 percent of the vote.Regional mediators from ECOWAS failed to bridge the impasse between Keita’s government and opposition leaders, creating mounting anxiety about another military-led change of power.Then on Tuesday, soldiers in the garrison town of Kati took weapons from the armory at the barracks and detained senior military officers. Anti-government protesters immediately cheered the soldiers’ actions, some even setting fire to a building that belongs to Mali’s justice minister in the capital.Hours earlier, Prime Minister Boubou Cisse urged the soldiers to put down their arms.“There is no problem whose solution cannot be found through dialogue,” he said in a communique.But the wheels already were in motion — armed men began detaining people in the capital of Bamako too, including the country’s finance minister, Abdoulaye Daffe.Keita, who has tried to meet protesters’ demands through a series of concessions since the demonstrations began, has also enjoyed broad support from France and other Western allies.“The U.S. is opposed to all unconstitutional changes of government whether in the streets or by security forces,” tweeted J. Peter Pham, the State Department’s special envoy for the Sahel region.It was a troubling repeat of the events leading up to the 2012 coup, which unleashed years of chaos in Mali when the ensuing power vacuum allowed Islamic extremists to seize control of northern towns. Ultimately a French-led military operation ousted the jihadists, but they merely regrouped and expanded their reach during Keita’s presidency into central Mali.On March 21, 2012, a similar mutiny erupted at the Kati military camp as rank-and-file soldiers began rioting and then broke into the camp’s armory. After grabbing weapons, they later headed for the seat of government under the leadership of Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo.Sanogo was later forced to hand over power to a civilian transitional government, which then organized the election Keita won.The current president has faced growing criticism of his government’s handling of the Islamic insurgency engulfing the country once praised as a model of democracy in the region. A wave of particularly deadly attacks in the north last year prompted the government to close its most vulnerable outposts as part of a reorganization aimed at stemming the losses.Regional mediators have urged Keita to share power in a unity government, but those overtures were swiftly rejected by opposition leaders who said they would not stop short of Keita’s ouster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mali-s-president-and-prime-minister-held-by-mutinous-troops/story-XK3mslaKuMQYWcWya0G8rI.html
19-08-2020||World||Flu season will be a test run for the US’s biggest-ever vaccine campaign||This fall, the US will need to vaccinate huge numbers of Americans in the middle of a public-health crisis. It will also be a valuable dry run should a coronavirus shot arrive months later.The annual US flu vaccine campaign has been cast into disarray by Covid-19, with people staying away from pharmacies, schools, offices, hospitals and other places where they typically get their shots. But with fears of a flu surge colliding with the coronavirus pandemic, health authorities are looking at how one vaccine effort can inform the other. In Denver, public-health officials are trying to increase the number of adults who get the flu vaccine this year to 65% from 45%. To do it, they’re setting up “strike teams” that can go from school to school giving vaccines, vans that can stop at construction sites and inoculate workers, and doing outreach to hard-to-reach communities.“This whole model that we’re building can then be moved into Covid,” said Judith Shlay a physician and associate director at Denver Public Health.In Baltimore, the city has several vans it sends out to conduct Covid-19 testing, targeting high-risk residents. It will likely use those vehicles for flu vaccines and then Covid-19, City Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said in an interview.“Our flu vaccine distribution will inform a Covid vaccine distribution,” Dzirasa said.The federal government has helped lead development of a vaccine, issuing more than $4 billion in contracts to drugmakers. The money is meant to speed production and cut financial risk for the most promising of the dozens of inoculations in development. President Donald Trump has said a shot could be ready by November, though other experts inside his government predict it will be well into 2021 before most Americans have access to one.So far, federal health authorities have offered little detail about their plans for administering vaccines. The U.S. has said that it will likely rely on the private sector to distribute the shots, and last week extended a contract to health-care supplier McKesson Corp potentially worth more than $300 million. But the government has said almost nothing about who will get the shots first, where they’ll be given, and how to make sure they get to hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities.At least 170,000 people in the US have died of the virus, many of them as a new surge of cases has expanded outside the Northeast to other parts of the country. While new cases have fallen from last month’s daily high of almost 80,000, new outbreaks are being reported in schools and colleges as students return, forcing some to shut days or weeks after opening. This week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans a call with health-care providers to discuss flu vaccination, along with guidance for delivering vaccines during the pandemic and operating “large vaccination clinics held in satellite, temporary, or off-site locations.”In the meantime, local authorities are still awaiting clarity. “We have not heard anything yet,’ Baltimore’s Dzirasa said. The US has been consulting with experts and medical ethicists on Covid-19 vaccine allocation plans. The government plans to work with the existing medical-distribution network to get shots to the public, said a senior Trump administration official, with possible help from the Defense Department.Never Done BeforeThere is no single national US flu vaccination campaign, per se. American and global health authorities pick the flu strains to target, drugmakers manufacture the shots, and they’re given by workplaces, schools, drugstores, local public-health departments, physicians and hospitals.The federal government typically plays a role in financing and promoting the vaccines, but not in physically distributing them. This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has purchased 9 million doses of the adult flu vaccine, compared with 500,000 in a normal year.The scale of the vaccination campaign needed for Covid-19 will be a daunting logistical challenge, said Howard Markel, a physician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Past efforts to vaccinate against pandemic threats have fallen short.“We’ve never vaccinated an entire American population,” he said in an interview.In 1976, after an outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix in New Jersey, the Gerald Ford administration planned a mass vaccination program to prevent a pandemic. “They were held in large gymnasiums and public meeting places,” said Markel, who recalled getting the shot when he was 16. “It was really very much an assembly line.”The vaccination drive was dismantled after several cases of Guillen-Barre syndrome were identified in people who got the shots. A US review of the campaign in 2003 confirmed the increase in cases of the disease, which can cause a form of muscle weakness or temporary paralysis, though the exact biological link between the vaccine and the condition wasn’t established.  In 2009, the H1N1 flu pandemic prompted another effort to quickly produce vaccines. Ultimately, only about 20% of the population got the shot, Markel said.“It is an enormous task, no question about it,” Markel said.Public-health officials will also have to overcome reluctance by some Americans to get a shot. An Aug. 7 Gallup poll found that one-third of people would not get a Covid-19 vaccine when it’s ready, even if it was free. And some Americans have rejected basic public health measures like wearing masks or social distancing, raising more questions about how willing they are to participate in a vaccine campaign.Some vaccine infrastructure already exists. A surge in demand for Covid-19 tests had drugstore chains, states and cities set up sites where people could line up or drive through. And the H1N1 flu pandemic also provided a roadmap for mass vaccination, said CVS Health Corp. Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo.“That was really the spark plug,” Merlo said in an interview this month. The company is in planning sessions with officials for an eventual coronavirus vaccine, Merlo said.A spokesperson for Walgreens, the next-largest US pharmacy chain behind CVS, said both existing testing and immunization infrastructure will support the future delivery of Covid vaccines.Sanofi, the French drugmaker that’s working with GlaxoSmithKline Plc on a coronavirus vaccine, said it’s been in touch with CVS and other drugstores about vaccination plans.“I would suspect that some of the blueprint that we’ve developed for flu immunization will also hopefully be a blueprint for Covid-19 vaccination,” said Elaine O’Hara, Sanofi’s head of vaccines for North America.Denver PlanAt Denver’s public health department, Shlay said she began thinking about how to deliver Covid-19 vaccines back in June.  She knew childhood immunizations had dropped sharply since March, when Covid shut things down, and she thought her agency could build a model to get a Covid-19 vaccine to people who need it.Under a $1 million grant from the CARES Act, the federal stimulus law to respond to the pandemic, her team has begun working on alternative flu vaccination strategies. The strike teams they are developing will be targeted at 84 schools where vaccination rates have slipped. And the agency is working with leaders from the Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American communities to bring flu-shot sites into neighborhoods.Particular outreach will focus on uninsured and unemployed adults — some of the same people are more likely to be hospitalized if they get sick — along with essential workers and people who are homeless.“We are going to try to reach that group that people don’t always think about,” Shlay said.There will be challenges making the switch to Covid-19. Early vaccines are expected to require two shots weeks apart, compared with a single flu dose. Health officials will have to keep careful registries of who has received which shots when, and make sure to reach people when their second doses are due. They’ll also have to handle the logistics of keeping vaccines refrigerated at the proper temperature.“A two-dose Covid vaccine will be much more complicated,” Shlay said. That’s part of the reason Denver health officials are planning now. “Covid has made us do things quicker than we’ve ever done before, and so we figure it out and we do it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flu-season-will-be-a-test-run-for-the-us-s-biggest-ever-vaccine-campaign/story-RLXpYYoFrkWYclkrqWnkVL.html

My dad, Mark Anthony Urquiza, should be here today, but he isn’t... My dad was a healthy 65-year-old.” Lifelong Republicans vouch for Joe Biden John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, was among a group of senior Republicans who spoke at the convention about their inability to support Trump in the White House. Kasich said, “I’m a lifelong Republican, but that attachment holds second place to my responsibility to my country. That’s why I’ve chosen to appear at this convention. In normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times.”Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York, said, “I’ve known Donald Trump for most of my political career. So disappointing, and lately so disturbing.” ‘The Rising’ plays, and The Boss approvesDemocrats used Bruce Springsteen’s The Rising as background score for a searing video of Trump’s handling of the many crises of his presidency — caging illegal immigrants, rising racism, the Covid-19 pandemic and the anti-racism protests that followed George Floyd’s killing.Springsteen had written the song after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. The Democratic National Committee said the song highlights the resilience of the American people in overcoming the crises.The Boss, as Springsteen is called, approved. He retweeted a Joe Biden post of the video. “Come on up for #therising,” he added, using a line from the song.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trusting-trump-was-dad-s-only-pre-existing-condition/story-xPvWpLr2JXWfTDLhbP93jM.html

The damaged ship spilled more than 1,000 tonnes of its cargo of 4,000 tons of fuel into the turquoise waters of the Mahebourg Lagoon, one of the island’s most pristine coastal areas.Most of the remaining 3,000 tonnes of fuel was pumped off the ship before it split into two but environmental groups warned that the damage to the surrounding coral reefs could be irreversible.The Wakashio was meant to stay at least 10 miles (16 kilometers) from shore but it ran aground just a mile from the island. Owner Nagashiki Shipping is investigating why the ship went off course and it has sent experts to help clean up the damage. The Mauritius government is seeking compensation from the company.The Mauritius government is under pressure to explain why immediate action wasn’t taken to empty the ship of its fuel before it began to leak. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth earlier blamed bad weather for the slow response.Environmentalists in Mauritius are objecting to plans to pull the bow of the ship — the smaller part of the Wakashio — out to sea and allow it to sink. The larger part of the ship will be dragged off the coral reef where it ran aground and towed away, possibly to India for salvage.“Authorities say they will tow the bow eight nautical miles out to sea and sink it in the waters that are 2,000 feet deep,” said Sunil Dowarkasing, an environmental consultant and former member of parliament in Mauritius.“But that area is where whales give birth and nurse their young,” said Dowarkasing. “The sunken bow could badly affect that critical area. So the environmental impact of that plan should be fully considered.” The Mauritius government has closed off the coastal area of the eastern part of the island, where thousands of civilian volunteers worked for days to try to minimize damage to the Mahebourg lagoon and protected marine wetlands polluted by the spilled fuel.Only officials and hired workers are permitted to work in the coastal area and the waters surrounding the grounded ship.Experts from France, Japan and the United Nations are also involved in the clean-up work.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the UN Development Program has allocated $200,000 to address the immediate impact of the spill.The International Maritime Organization, the UN Environment Program and the UN humanitarian office have deployed an oil spill expert to support the government, Dujarric said. And UN agencies are also supporting the public health response, assessing the risks to communities, providing forensic investigation and legal support, and using U.N. satellite imagery and analysis to help with remote mapping.After the government declared an environmental emergency, thousands of volunteers rushed to the shore to create makeshift oil barriers from tunnels of fabric stuffed with sugar cane leaves and even human hair, with empty plastic bottles tucked in to keep them afloat.The island nation of some 1.3 million people relies heavily on tourism and already had taken a severe hit due to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mauritius-arrests-indian-captain-of-japanese-ship-that-spilled-oil/story-zWEFWA4sFw2SmnuULlXcDP.html

19-08-2020||World||Half of UK’s population enjoy Rishi Sunak’s 50% eat-out discount||Over 35 million meals have so far been served under chancellor Rishi Sunak’s novel scheme that pays 50% of bills up to a maximum of £10 per person on food and non-alcoholic drinks from Monday to Wednesday in August, new figures released on Tuesday show.The ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme, intended to help the struggling hospitality industry and encourage people to return to a Covid-secure sense of normalcy, is offered by over 85,000 restaurants across the UK, including several serving Indian delicacies.A sum of £500 million has been allocated for the scheme that ends on August 31. Restaurants have reported ‘berserk’ business during Mondays to Wednesdays, but lower sales during the weekend.Sunak said: “Today’s figures show that Britain is eating out to help out – with at least 35 million meals served up in the first two weeks alone, that is equivalent to over half of the UK taking part and supporting local jobs in the hospitality sector”.“To build back better we must protect as many jobs as possible, that is why I am urging all registered businesses to make the most of this by claiming back today – it’s free, simple and pays out within 5 working days”, he added.The scheme aims to help protect the jobs of the hospitality industry’s 1.8 million employees by encouraging people to safely return to their local restaurants, cafes and pubs where social-distancing rules allow.Official figures show that nearly 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed, the highest of any sector.The scheme has been widely welcomed, but some doubted its economic logic.Jim Harra, chief executive of revenue and customs, questioned its value for money, writing to Sunak before the scheme was rolled out: “By nature, this is a novel scheme meaning there are also particular value for money risks surrounding the level of potential losses that could arise”.The Guardian called the scheme ‘junk policy’ in an editorial: “As policy…it is glib, gimmicky and, even Mr Sunak admits, a waste of millions of pounds. Junk, then, served up by a politician who should know much better”.“(His) error is in treating the slump in trade as driven by cost, rather than caution. Discounts and VAT cuts…will not lure out those diners who are worried that they may pick up a lethal virus, or that they may be about to lose their job”.“Others will take up the government’s offer by enjoying a slap-up meal at a discount on a Wednesday night rather than at full price on a Friday, thus defeating the entire purpose of the policy”, the editorial added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-uk-s-population-enjoy-rishi-sunak-s-50-eat-out-discount/story-XuBYL1TdHPg6D3G9supYPL.html
19-08-2020||World||Despite US sanctions bid, Iran aims to keep nuclear deal alive until US polls||The fate of a fragile 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers hinges on the result of the US presidential election in November, not a planned US bid this week to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Tehran, said several Iranian officials. When Iran agreed to sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program, Tehran warned that it would no longer stick to the deal if any of the parties sparked a so-called snapback of sanctions at the UN Security Council, a backstop included in the accord in case Iran stopped complying. US President Donald Trump’s administration plans this week to use that snapback provision, even though it quit the deal in 2018 and the move is opposed by the remaining parties to the accord - Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran. But despite Tehran’s declaration five years ago, three senior Iranian officials told Reuters that Iran’s leadership is determined to remain committed to the nuclear deal, hoping that a victory by Trump’s political rival Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election will salvage the pact. “Right now the decision is to remain in the deal even if Americans make their biggest mistake of triggering the snapback mechanism,” said a senior official, on condition of anonymity, who is involved in the discussions about Iran’s nuclear policy. “We will be still here, but Trump might not be at the White House in a few months,” the official said. Biden has said he would rejoin the nuclear deal, but only if Iran first returned to compliance. The accord was agreed by former US President Barack Obama’s administration, when Biden was vice president. A second Iranian official - a former nuclear negotiator - said Iran was “technically and politically” ready to quit.“But we have to be smart and not to fall in the U.S. trap which wants to push Iran out of the deal,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Enormous Leverage Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has described the next few weeks and months as critical for the nuclear deal. To trigger a return if all UN sanctions on Iran the United States will submit a complaint to the 15-member Security Council about Iran’s non-compliance with the nuclear deal.In response to what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign - a bid to get Iran to negotiate a new deal - Tehran has breached several central limits of the 2015 deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium.But diplomats say the snapback process will be tough and messy as Russia, China and other countries on the Security Council challenge the legality of the US move given Washington itself is no longer complying with what Trump called “worst deal ever” and has imposed strong unilateral sanctions on Iran.A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the US move to spark a return of all UN sanctions would risk “destroying” the nuclear deal, but “it will be a completely contested procedure so the snapback will have no effect, it will not be recognized by others.”The United States argues it can trigger the return of the sanctions because it is still named as a participant to the nuclear deal in a 2015 UN Security Council resolution that enshrines the agreement. A second European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “the overwhelming majority of the international community” believe the United States cannot trigger snapback. Outgoing US Iran envoy Brian Hook said on Tuesday that the nuclear deal, while well intentioned, had failed to deter Iran.“We have put in place enormous leverage for a (Trump) second term to get the kind of outcomes that we’re going to need,” he told a United Against Nuclear Iran think tank event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-us-sanctions-bid-iran-aims-to-keep-nuclear-deal-alive-until-us-polls/story-bs3OKKtGtu45q2TLKukVpO.html
19-08-2020||World||Mali’s President resigns after detention by mutinous soldiers||Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita resigned from his post and dissolved his government and parliament after he was detained by soldiers in a crisis that escalated following weeks of protests.“If elements of the army felt compelled to intervene to bring an end to this, I have no choice but to comply,” Keita, 75, said minutes after midnight Wednesday in an address broadcast on state television. “I don’t want a single drop of blood to be shed.”Tensions have run high in the West African nation since tens of thousands of people started gathering weeks ago to demand that Keita, who’s known as IBK, resign. While the protests started over discontent with his refusal to raise wages for teachers and doctors, they later widened to include criticism over alleged corruption and nepotism within the administration.On Tuesday, rebellious soldiers took Keita to military barracks in Mali’s biggest garrison town of Kati, on the outskirts of the capital, Bamako, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Prime Minister Boubou Cisse was also arrested, one of the people said.Efforts by the Economic Community of West African States to mediate between the government and protesters had so far failed. The opposition demonstrations have been led by Mahmoud Dicko, a conservative, Saudi-trained preacher who’s been a vocal critic of the government for several years.Ecowas condemned the overthrow of the Keita’s “democratically elected government” in a statement emailed hours before the leader’s televised speech, and called for the organization’s forces to be on standby. The bloc also announced sanctions that included closing borders and the suspension of trade.The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, urged Ecowas, the United Nations and other international organizations to join efforts and “oppose the use of force to resolve the political crisis in Mali,” according to a post on his Twitter account.The United Nations also condemned the soldiers’ actions Tuesday and called for “the immediate restoration of constitutional order and rule of law in Mali,” a spokesman for the Secretary-General said in a statement on the organization’s website.Power VacuumThe situation in Mali is reminiscent of the 2012 ouster of Keita’s predecessor, Amadou Toumani Toure, by junior officers angry about the lack of resources needed to fight Tuareg rebels in the north. The subsequent power vacuum was exploited by al-Qaeda-linked Islamist groups who seized control of the north. A French military intervention pushed back the insurgents, but some groups later returned and expanded to carry out attacks on civilians and about 15,000 UN peacekeepers in the country.“The international community will be perturbed by the mutiny,” Alexandre Raymakers, senior Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said in a research note. “France will fear it will worsen the ongoing political crisis, creating a major political vacuum and derail efforts to contain the growing insurgency,” he said before Keita was seized by the soldiers.The government’s inability to quash the Islamist insurgencies, which have claimed thousands of lives, fueled many of the protests against Keita. The leader assumed office on a wave of optimism after 2013 elections, but critics said he didn’t fulfill any of his campaign pledges after his 2018 re-election.(Updates with background, Ecowas threat to deploy force from fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mali-s-president-resigns-after-detention-by-mutinous-soldiers/story-hRACi6DY3d2KoSlzzvCgJO.html
