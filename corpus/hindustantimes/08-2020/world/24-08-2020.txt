The filing also named Eric Trump and Seven Springs, a New York estate owned by the Trump family.The attorney general said Eric Trump, president of Seven Springs and vice president of the organization, should be compelled to testify.The investigation centers on whether the Trump Organization and the president improperly inflated the value of assets to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits. Investigators are looking into whether the Trump Organization and its agents improperly inflated the value of the Seven Springs north of the city.In the court filings, the attorney general’s office wrote that “information regarding the valuation of Seven Springs is significant” to the office’s investigation.Emails seeking comment were sent to lawyers for the Trump Organization and Eric Trump.The investigation was launched in March 2019 after Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that Trump had inflated the value of his assets to obtain more favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage.Since then, the attorney general’s office has issued “a number of subpoenas and has taken testimony seeking information material to these matters,” the court filing said. Investigators have not yet determined whether the law was broken.“For months, the Trump Organization has made baseless claims in an effort to shield evidence from a lawful investigation into its financial dealings,” James said in a prepared statement. “They have stalled, withheld documents, and instructed witnesses, including Eric Trump, to refuse to answer questions under oath.”James’ office issued subpoenas to the Trump Organization and to Seven Springs LLC in December 2019, seeking financial documents, the filing said. Since then, both have “engaged in extensive good-faith discussions concerning the Trump Organization’s compliance with the subpoenas.”The attorney general’s office is also attempting to collect information about several other Trump-related properties, including the Trump National Golf Club near Los Angeles, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago and an office building on Wall Street in Manhattan where the Trump Organization “owns a ‘ground lease’ pertaining to the property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ny-ag-probes-if-donald-trump-pumped-up-value-of-estate-assets/story-5W3OBqiEnRUoer2rtwML6I.html
24-08-2020||World||Scientists say Hong Kong man got coronavirus a second time||University of Hong Kong scientists claim to have the first evidence of someone being reinfected with the virus that causes Covid-19.Genetic tests revealed that a 33-year-old man returning to Hong Kong from a trip to Spain in mid-August had a different strain of the coronavirus than the one he’d previously been infected with in March, said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, the microbiologist who led the work.The man had mild symptoms the first time and none the second time; his more recent infection was detected through screening and testing at the Hong Kong airport.“It shows that some people do not have lifelong immunity” to the virus if they’ve already had it, To said. “We don’t know how many people can get reinfected. There are probably more out there.”The paper has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases but not yet published, and some independent experts urged caution until full results are available.Whether people who have had Covid-19 are immune to new infections and for how long are key questions that have implications for vaccine development and decisions about returning to work, school and social activities.Even if someone can be infected a second time, it’s not known if they have some protection against serious illness, because the immune system generally remembers how to make antibodies against a virus it’s seen before.It’s not clear how different a virus needs to be to trigger illness, but the new work suggests that “COVID patients should not be complacent about prevention measures” and should continue social distancing, wearing masks and other ways to reduce infection, To said.Two experts with with no role in the work agreed.“We’ve always known reinfection was a possibility and I think this is highly suggestive” that it occurred in this case, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief scientist now at Georgetown University. “If there is a reinfection, it suggests the possibility there was residual immunity ... that helped protect the patient” from getting sick again, Goodman said.However, “if immunity wanes from natural infection, it could be a challenge for vaccines” and may mean booster shots are needed, he added.Julie Fischer, a microbiologist at CRDF Global, a nonprofit health group in Arlington, Virginia, said the study gives convincing evidence that reinfection can happen.“The real question is what this means for severity of disease” if that occurs, and whether such people can infect others, she said.One expert saw the report as good news. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said it’s encouraging the reported reinfection was without symptoms.“That’s a win as far as I’m concerned” because it suggests a first infection may protect a person from moderate to severe disease the second time around, he said in an interview streamed by the Journal of the American Medical Association.A mid-May survey by the doctors’ information-sharing site Sermo found that 13% of the 4,173 doctors responding believed that they had treated one or more patients who were reinfected. Among the respondents, 7% of those in the U.S. and 16% in other countries thought they’d seen such a case.However, health officials have also wondered whether people who tested positive long after their initial illness were simply showing signs of not completely clearing the virus rather than being infected anew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-say-hong-kong-man-got-coronavirus-a-second-time/story-jtKDhlx90dvxYxkW2bxO7M.html
24-08-2020||World||Professor, NASA researcher accused of concealing China ties||A NASA researcher and Texas A&M University professor has been charged with accepting federal grant money while hiding work he was doing for an university established by the Chinese government as well as his affiliation with Chinese-owned companies.Zhengdong Cheng faces charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and false statements, according to a criminal complaint released by the Justice Department on Monday. He was arrested Sunday.The case against Cheng is part of a pattern of Justice Department prosecutions against researchers at American universities who are accused of concealing their professional relationships with Chinese universities. The Trump administration has sought to crack down on professors tempted to exploit their ties to China, and their participation in talent recruitment programs, by stealing intellectual property for Beijing’s economic benefit.Cheng, who was hired by Texas A&M in 2004, led a team of researchers that received, nearly $750,000 in NASA grants for space research. At the same time, though, he served as director of an institute in Guangdong, China that was established by China’s Education Ministry, prosecutors say. In addition, he participated in talent recruitment programs established by the Chinese government that the U.S. says entices professors at American universities to steal cutting-edge research that can be provided to China.Prosecutors say Cheng hid those affiliations from the university and from NASA even as he collected federal grant money, and even though restrictions on the grant barred collaborating or coordinating with China, Chinese universities or China-owned companies.Cheng’s voicemail box at the university was full and could not accept messages, and it was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer. An email to the university seeking comment was not immediately returned.The Justice Department will “continue seeking to bring participate in these talent programs to light,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department’s top national security official, said in a statement.U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick, the top federal prosecutor for the Southern District of Texas, said the talent recruitment programs exploit “our open and free universities.”“China is building an economic and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world,” Patrick said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/professor-nasa-researcher-accused-of-concealing-china-ties/story-Xr4tJ26Sfy9HM4sGBYgZgL.html
24-08-2020||World||Police shooting lays bare Wisconsin’s deep partisan divide||The shooting by police in Wisconsin of a Black man sparked strong words of condemnation from the state’s Democratic governor, who said he stood by those who demand justice. Republicans and the police union countered Monday that the governor went too far, urging caution in making any judgments about what sparked the shooting.The divergent reactions to the shooting Sunday by Kenosha police is just the latest example of the deep divide in Wisconsin, a key presidential battleground state that has been at the forefront of partisan battles for the past decade ranging from redistricting to union rights. More recently, Republicans ignored Gov. Tony Evers’ call to do away with in-person voting for the state’s April presidential primary in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.Cellphone footage posted on social media Sunday appeared to show police shooting Blake multiple times in the back as he opened a door and leaned into an SUV. The state Department of Justice said officers were responding to a domestic incident, but it has not released more details. Blake was in serious condition Monday at a Milwaukee hospital.Protests erupted in Kenosha in the hours after the shooting, sparking concerns of more unrest across the country similar to what was seen after the May death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police. Chris Ott, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said the shooting “looks like attempted murder.”“Exhale,” said Republican state Sen. Van Wanggaard, a retired police officer from Racine, which is next to Kenosha. “Everyone should take a deep breath. ... We must let law and reason, not emotion, guide the next steps.”But Evers was passionate in his response, saying he stands with everyone who has demanded justice, equity and accountability and against excessive use of force when engaged with Black people.“While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,” Evers said.Wanggaard was among Republicans who condemned Evers for his comments, which were issued just as protesters took to the streets in Kenosha and clashed with police.“The best leaders attempt to diffuse situations, not escalate them,” Wanggaard said. “Evers’ statement was irresponsible and inflammatory. He jumped to conclusions without first having all the facts. At a time when stereotyping situations is especially risky, Evers stereotyped every police interaction with people of color — harming both.”Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha police union, called Evers’ statement “wholly irresponsible.”“As always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident,” Deates said in a statement. “We ask that you withhold from passing judgment until all the facts are known and released.”Evers used the latest shooting to demand action from elected officials in Wisconsin “who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.”Evers called on the GOP-controlled Legislature to pass a package of police reform bills in June, following Floyd’s death. The Legislature has not taken any action on the measures, which would ban the use of chokeholds by Wisconsin police officers, as well as limit other uses of force.Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Monday said he was creating a task force to examine police policies and standards, racial disparities, educational opportunities and public safety. He did not address any of the bills Evers and Democrats have advocated.“We must find a path forward as a society that brings everyone together,” Vos said, while denouncing violent protests and saying investigators must be able to complete their work “to know if the shocking 20-second video clip shared with the media tells the whole story.”Wisconsin Republicans echoed a law-and-order theme that President Donald Trump has been using in his reelection campaign, including during stops to Minnesota and Wisconsin last week. While calling for peaceful protests, Wisconsin Republicans also urged patience given the ongoing investigation.Jim Steineke, Republican majority leader of the Wisconsin Assembly, didn’t call out Evers by name but urged elected officials to “resist the temptation to rush to judgment.”“The frustration and anger that many in our communities are feeling must be met with empathy, but cannot be further fueled by politicians’ statements or actions that can stoke flames of violence,” Steineke said.Evers, in the second year of his first term, has been stymied by Republicans who control the Legislature and have it as their goal in November to build majorities strong enough to override any gubernatorial veto. The state also is at the forefront of the presidential race, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week emphasizing the recurring message that “it’s all riding on Wisconsin.” Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shooting-lays-bare-wisconsin-s-deep-partisan-divide/story-7SGAoEIgeW8rA5hc7fQ0cN.html
24-08-2020||World||Big California wildfires burn on as death toll reaches 7||Firefighters battling three massive wildfires in Northern California got a break from the weather early Monday as humidity rose and there was no return of the onslaught of lightning strikes that ignited the infernos a week earlier.A warning about dry lighting and gusty winds that could spark more fires was lifted for the San Francisco Bay Area and relieved fire commanders said the weather was aiding their efforts.“Mother Nature’s helped us quite a bit,” said Billy See, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection incident commander for a complex of fires burning south of San Francisco.California has had more than 13,000 lightning strikes since mid-August and more than 600 wildfires statewide have burned more than 1.2 million acres, or 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers), said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director with California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.More than 1,200 buildings have been destroyed and 14,000 firefighters have been deployed, he said.The three big fires around the Bay Area and many others burning across the state have put nearly 250,000 people under evacuation orders and warnings and authorities renewed warnings for anxious homeowners to stay away from the evacuation zones.Six people who returned to a restricted area south of San Francisco to check on their properties were surprised by fire and had to be rescued, the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office said.The death toll from the fires reached 7 over the weekend after authorities battling a big fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco announced the discovery of the body of a 70-year-old man in a remote area called Last Chance.He had been reported missing and police had to use a helicopter to reach the area of about 40 off-the-grid homes at the end of a windy, steep dirt road north of the city of Santa Cruz.The area was under an evacuation order and Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Chris Clark said the discovery of the man’s body was a reminder of how important it was for residents to evacuate from fire danger zones.“This is one of the darkest periods we’ve been in with this fire,” he said.The Santa Cruz fire is one of three “complexes,” or groups of fires, burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area. All were started by lightning.Fire crew made slow progress battling the blazes over the weekend, which included a break in the unseasonably warm weather and little wind.A fire in wine country north of San Francisco and another southeast of the city have within a week have grown to be two of the three largest fires in state history, with both burning more than 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).The wine country fire has been the most deadly and destructive blaze, accounting for five deaths and 845 destroyed homes and other buildings. Three of the victims were in a home that was under an evacuation order.Officials surveying maps at command centers are astonished by the sheer size of the fires, said Cal Fire spokesman Brice Bennett.“You could overlay half of one of these fires and it covers the entire city of San Francisco,” Bennett said Sunday.In Southern California, an 11-day-old blaze held steady at just under 50 square miles (106 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in the northern Los Angeles County mountains. Rough terrain, hot weather and the potential for thunderstorms with lightning strikes challenged firefighters on Sunday.Authorities said their firefighting effort in Santa Cruz was hindered by people who refused to evacuate and those who were using the chaos to loot. Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart said 100 officers were patrolling and anyone not authorized to be in an evacuation zone would be arrested.“What we’re hearing from the community is that there’s a lot of looting going on,” Hart said.He and county District Attorney Jeff Rosell expressed anger at what Rosell called the “absolutely soulless” criminals victimizing people already victimized by the fire. Among them was a fire commander who was robbed when he left his fire vehicle to help direct operations.Someone entered the vehicle and stole personal items, including a wallet and “drained his bank account,” said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.“I can’t imagine a bigger lowlife,” Hart said.Holly Hansen, who fled the wine country fire, was among evacuees from the community of Angwin allowed Sunday to return home for one hour to retrieve belongings. She and her three dogs waited five hours in her SUV for their turn. Among the items she took with her were photos of her pets.“It’s horrible when you have to think about what to take,” she said. “I think it’s a very raw human base emotion to have fear of fire and losing everything. It’s frightening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-california-wildfires-burn-on-as-death-toll-reaches-7/story-7f1xwY3zYn15g39RBV4jaL.html
24-08-2020||World||Trump vows to ‘prohibit’ US firms from replacing local workers with low-cost foreigners in 2nd term||President Donald Trump, who was on Monday formally nominated by Republicans to seek a second term, has vowed to “prohibit” American companies from replacing local workers with lower-cost foreign workers, a key fallout of outsourcing, and continue his hardline position on immigration.“We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country,” President Trump said in an unannounced appearance at the convention, based in Charlotte, after securing the nomination. He will formally deliver the acceptance speech on Thursday, from the White House.Called “Fighting for You”, the agenda also promises to “end reliance” on China by encouraging American companies to bring back operations and continue the president’s “America First” foreign policy, of ending wars and ensuring allies “pay their fair share” towards common defence.The agenda was released on the eve of the four-day Republican Party convention that nominated Trump on Monday morning as its nominee for the November 3 election, with Vice-President Mike Pence as his running mate. They are up against Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, and his running mate, Kamala Harris.Just hours ahead of the convention, Kellyanne Conway, counsellor to the president, announced she is leaving to spend more time with her children. It’s time for “less drama, more mama,” she said in a statement. Conway and her husband, George Conway, a conservative lawyer were a widely watched DC couple. As Conway remained one of the president’s fiercest defenders, the husband was an acerbic Trump critic.The 50-point agenda builds on the “incredible achievements” of the president’s first term in office, the campaign said in the announcement, and added that it will reflect his “optimism and certainty in America’s greatness”.It’s a bare-bones announcement that lists out the president’s 50 second-term priorities, which he will flesh out in his acceptance speech on Thursday, the final day of the convention, and on the campaign trail.“Prohibit American Companies from Replacing United States Citizens with Lower-Cost Foreign Workers,” the agenda said in a section headlined “End illegal immigration and protect American workers”, which indicates both continuity and hardening of the President’s position on immigration.It hits at the core of the outsourcing industry in the United States that has engendered and supported IT giants from many countries — and include TCS, Infosys and Wipro from India.Trump has been turning up pressure on the outsourcing industry — centered around H-1B non-immigrant short-term work visas — from practically the first quarter of his presidency. Earlier this month, Trump issued another executive order prohibiting federal government agencies from contracting work to companies that use foreign workers. At the same time, the president instructed the labor department to “finalize guidance to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers’ job sites to displace Americans workers”.Trump has suspended all legal immigration — Green Cards — and short-term non-immigration work visas, such as H-1B, till the end of December to ensure millions of Americans laid off because of the Covid-19 epidemic have a first shot at jobs that become available.Other elements of the agenda on immigration were a continuation of the current policies, such as ensuring new immigrants don’t need state help, block illegal immigrants from taxpayer-funded programmes and free college tuition.Ending “endless wars” and getting “allies to pay their fair share” will be Trump 2.0’s “America First foreign policy”, which continues the emphasis on bringing home troops from Afghanistan and making NATO allies ramp up their respective defence. Other foreign policy priorities include wiping out global terrorists that threaten Americans and build a “great” cyber security defence system and missile defence system.Other priorities were aimed at addressing domestic issues such as tackling the Covid-19 epidemic, finding a vaccine, defend police (against calls for defending them by anti-racism activists), cut drug prices and other promises on healthcare, and education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-vows-to-prohibit-us-firms-from-replacing-local-workers-with-low-cost-foreigners-in-2nd-term/story-6lYh1K8KFDDsMxQkWJaU2O.html
24-08-2020||World||UN warns on coronavirus plasma treatment, says ‘still experimental, results not conclusive’||The World Health Organization on Monday cautioned that using blood plasma from Covid-19 survivors to treat other patients is still considered an experimental therapy, voicing the concern as a US boost for the treatment has many scientists afraid formal studies will be derailed.On Sunday, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized what’s called “emergency use” of the treatment under its special powers to speed the availability of promising experimental drugs during a public health crisis. The action isn’t the same as approving plasma as safe and effective, and numerous rigorous studies are underway to find out if it really works.So far, “The results are not conclusive,” WHO’s chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said during a press briefing. “At the moment, it’s still very low-quality evidence.”Convalescent plasma is a century-old treatment that was used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines, and was tried more recently during the Ebola outbreak. When the body encounters a new germ, it makes proteins called antibodies that are specially targeted to fight the infection. The antibodies float in plasma — the yellowish, liquid part of blood — which is collected from Covid-19 survivors and given to patients infected with coronavirus.Swaminathan said WHO considered plasma therapy to be experimental and that it should continue to be evaluated. She said the treatment is difficult to standardize: Plasma must be collected individually, and people produce different levels of antibodies.“Of course, countries can do an emergency listing if they feel the benefits outweigh the risks,” she said. “But that’s usually done when you’re waiting for the more definitive evidence.”In a letter describing the FDA’s emergency action, the agency’s chief scientist said the treatment “should not be considered a new standard of care” for coronavirus infections, and that more data from studies will be available in the coming months.But already, so many Covid-19 patients have requested plasma rather than agreeing to be part of a research study that many scientists fear they won’t get a clear answer on whether the treatment really works -- and if it does, how and when it should be used for the best outcomes.Martin Landray, of the University of Oxford said that while the therapy offers “huge promise,” there was still no proof it works.“There is a huge gap between theory and proven benefit,” he said in a statement.If just a few thousand patients took part in the research “we would have the answer,” said Landray, who is conducting a plasma study in the UK. “If effective, convalescent plasma could be rapidly used worldwide. If not, it could be abandoned,”Stephen Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Leeds, said there was still considerable uncertainty about the immune system’s response to Covid-19, making any potential use of convalescent plasma challenging.The FDA’s action was announced during a Sunday press briefing by U.S. President Donald Trump, who called it a “breakthrough.”“It appears that the lessons from hydroxychloroquine have not been learned,” Griffin said, referring to the malaria drug touted by Trump and others as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.The FDA also granted hydroxychloroquine an emergency authorization before suspending it months later after several trials showed the drug didn’t work against Covid-19 and raised the risk of heart, kidney, liver and other problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-on-coronavirus-plasma-treatment-says-still-experimental-results-not-conclusive/story-R48JA2Hgv2vGzYIkqjRuMO.html
24-08-2020||World||Police shooting of Black man stirs unrest in Wisconsin city||Kenosha became the nation’s latest flashpoint city in a summer of racial unrest after police shot and wounded a Black man, apparently in the back, as he leaned into his SUV while his three children sat in the vehicle.Protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with officers in riot gear Sunday night, while Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden condemned the shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake, who was hospitalized in serious condition.Police in the former auto manufacturing center of 100,000 people midway between Milwaukee and Chicago said Blake was shot while they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute. They did not immediately disclose the race of the three officers at the scene or say whether Blake was armed, and they released no details on the dispute.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Blake’s family, said Blake was “simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident.”The officers were placed on administrative leave, standard practice in a shooting by police, while the state Justice Department investigates.The shooting happened around 5 p.m. Sunday and was captured from across the street on cellphone video that was posted online. Kenosha police do not have body cameras.In the footage, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns pointed and shout at him. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while Blake has his back turned.Seven shots can be heard, though it isn’t clear how many struck Blake or how many of the officers fired. During the shooting, a Black woman can be seen screaming in the street and jumping up and down.“While we do not have all of the details yet,” the governor said in a statement, “what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.”Biden called for “an immediate, full and transparent investigation” and said the officers “must be held accountable.”“This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,” he said, just over two months before Election Day in a country already roiled by the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. “Those shots pierce the soul of our nation.”Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha police union, called the governor’s statement “wholly irresponsible.”“As always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident,” Deates said in a statement. “We ask that you withhold from passing judgment until all the facts are known and released.”Online court records indicate Kenosha County prosecutors charged Blake on July 6 with sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant was issued the following day. The records contain no further details and do not list an attorney for Blake.It was unclear whether that case had anything to do with the shooting.Laquisha Booker, who is Blake’s partner, told NBC’s Milwaukee affiliate, WTMJ-TV, that the couple’s three children were in the back seat of the SUV when police shot him.“That man just literally grabbed him by his shirt and looked the other way and was just shooting him. With the kids in the back screaming. Screaming,” Booker said.Crump, the attorney who has also represented the Floyd and Taylor families, called the police officers’ actions “irresponsible, reckless and inhumane.”“We all watched the horrific video of Jacob Blake being shot in the back several times by Kenosha police,” Crump said in a statement. “Even worse, his three sons witnessed their father collapse after being riddled with bullets. ... It’s a miracle he’s still alive.”In the unrest that followed, social media posts showed neighbors gathering in the surrounding streets and shouting at police. Some chanted, “No justice, no peace!” Others appeared to throw objects at officers and damage police vehicles. Officers fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.In a scene that mirrored the widespread protests in recent months over police brutality and racial inequality, marchers headed to the Kenosha County Public Safety Building, which houses the police and sheriff’s departments. Authorities mostly blocked off the building, which was closed on Monday because of damage, officials said.Wisconsin’s Republican Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke cautioned the public and elected officials against “racing towards judgment,” given how few details were known.“The frustration & anger that many in our communities are feeling must be met with empathy, but cannot be further fueled by politicians’ statements or actions that can stoke flames of violence,” tweeted Steineke, who is white.For more than 100 years, Kenosha was an auto manufacturing center, but it has now largely been transformed into a bedroom community for Milwaukee and Chicago.The city is about 67% white, 11.5% Black and 17.6% Hispanic, according to 2019 Census data. Both the mayor and police chief are white. About 17% of the population lives in poverty.Like other cities across the U.S., Kenosha has been grappling with unemployment in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Its unemployment rate was 10.8% in June, among the highest in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-shooting-of-black-man-stirs-unrest-in-wisconsin-city/story-jhuIFtYwmtn8mpCNYNgtxH.html

Countries wishing to be part of the global COVAX plan have until Aug. 31 to submit expressions of interest, WHO officials said, with confirmation of intention to join due by Sept. 18, and initial payments due by Oct. 9.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the facility was critical to ending the Covid-19 pandemic, and would not only pool risk for countries developing and buying vaccines, but also ensure prices are kept “as low as possible”.“Vaccine nationalism only helps the virus,” he told a media briefing. “The success of the COVAX facility hinges not only on countries signing up to it, but also filling key funding gaps.”COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and is designed to guarantee equitable access globally to Covid-19 vaccines once they are developed and authorised for use. It currently covers 9 candidate Covid-19 vaccines and its aim is to secure supplies of and deliver 2 billion doses across countries that sign up by the end of 2021.“Initially, when there will be limited supply (of Covid-19 vaccines), it’s important to provide the vaccine to those at highest risk around the globe,” Tedros said.He said this included health workers on the front lines of the pandemic, who were “critical to saving lives and stabilising the overall health system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/172-countries-engaging-with-global-covid-19-vaccine-plan-says-who/story-J0wHyI0QO0SnCns90VnNcP.html
24-08-2020||World||TikTok sues Donald Trump administration over ban, says no security threat||TikTok said it is asking a judge to block the Trump administration from enacting a ban on the social media network, bringing a geopolitical fight over technology and trade into a U.S. courtroom in the run-up to the presidential election.TikTok said in a blog post Monday that its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., is challenging an Aug. 6 order from President Donald Trump prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with TikTok under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order doesn’t take effect for weeks, but it escalated tensions as the U.S. declared Chinese businesses a security risk and Beijing assailed the administration as targeting China to score political points. TikTok argues it poses no security threat.The White House issued a second order Aug. 14 under a separate national security law that would force ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets. The suit sidesteps the second order. That order is based on an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Decisions by the interagency panel, which is led by the Treasury Department, are all but impossible to overturn in court.The Justice Department declined to comment on TikTok’s challenge.Read More: Why Tencent and WeChat Are Such a Big Deal in ChinaThe suit comes as Trump steps up his campaign against China, betting it will help him win November’s election despite upsetting millions of younger TikTok users. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has urged American companies to bar Chinese applications from their app stores, part of his “Clean Network” guidance designed to prevent authorities in China from accessing the personal data of U.S. citizens.The outcome will also have implications for an increasingly interconnected global economy. Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. are among those already showing interest in buying TikTok.The challenge faces an uphill fight, according to James Dempsey, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley. Courts don’t generally review the president’s determinations on questions of national security, Dempsey said before the case was filed.But the company may be successful with a due process argument “that focuses not on the president’s ultimate decision but on the company’s lack of an opportunity to respond to the evidence against it,” Dempsey said. “A First Amendment challenge is also possible, but TikTok will have to establish that it has a First Amendment right to be on the phones of Americans or that TikTok is a publisher, separate from the First Amendment rights of its users.”Read More: Why Trump Is Threatening Your Teen’s Favorite AppTrump has threatened penalties on any U.S. resident or company that conducts transactions with TikTok or WeChat, a popular Chinese messaging app, saying that having Americans’ personal data exposed to China creates a national security risk. The apps could get bumped off Apple Inc. and Google’s app stores.While the order blocks all transactions involving the WeChat app, it doesn’t amount to a broader ban on dealings with its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd., according to a U.S. official. Still, Tencent’s U.S.-listed shares fell 7.4% in the immediate response to Trump’s Aug. 6 decree.On Friday, a group of WeChat users sued in a San Francisco federal court saying Trump’s ban on the messaging app violated their right of free speech and due process rights because it doesn’t provide notice of the specific conduct that’s prohibited.“This executive order risks undermining global businesses’ trust in the United States’ commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth,” TikTok said in a statement hours after Trump’s order. “And it sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-sues-donald-trump-administration-over-ban-says-no-security-threat/story-xwuoUIxTBffbms7GFse9iP.html
24-08-2020||World||Republicans nominate Donald Trump for second term, to take on Biden in the fall||The Republican Party formally nominated President Donald Trump for a second term in the White House Monday, one of the first acts of a GOP convention that has been dramatically scaled down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Trump has sought to minimize the toll of the pandemic, but its impact was evident as proceedings began in Charlotte. Instead of the thousands of people who were expected to converge on this city for a week-long extravaganza, just 336 delegates participated in a roll-call vote from a Charlotte Convention Center ballroom.Earlier, the convention renominated Vice President Mike Pence, and he thanked the delegates in person.“The choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher,” Pence said. “We’re going to make American great again. Again.”Party Chair Ronna McDaniel said as she began the proceedings: “We are obviously disappointed we could not hold this event in the same way we had originally planned,” But she thanked the city for allowing the convention to move forward in its truncated form.Many of the usual trappings of a convention were present, including signs designating each state and gift bags with Republican swag. But chairs on the ballroom floor were arranged with lots of space between them and convention organizers told participants to wear masks, though adherence to the rule was uneven. Still, the fact an in-person meeting was held at all marked a sharp contrast with Democrats.Last week, the Democrats created a well-received roll call via video montage with diverse officials and others from states across the country. The Republicans, overwhelmingly white, spoke from the ballroom floor.After Trump’s renomination, much of the action is shifting to Washington, where Republicans will spend the week trying to convince the American people that the president deserves a second term.The GOP convention is a crucial moment for Trump, who is trailing in national and battleground state polls and under intense pressure to turn the race around. Just 23% think the country is heading in the right direction, while 75% think it’s on the wrong path, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Aides want the convention to recast the story of Trump’s presidency and present the election as a choice between his vision for America’s future and the one presented by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.McDaniel worked to highlight that contrast, accusing Biden of embracing a radical left agenda and pushing back on Democrats’ efforts to demonstrate Biden’s empathy and kindness.“The truth is there’s only one person who has empathized with everyday Americans and actually been fighting for them every single day over the past four years, and that’s President Donald J. Trump,” she said.For both sides, it’s an unconventional convention year.The parties’ election year gatherings are typically massive events, drawing thousands of delegates, party leaders, donors, journalists and political junkies for a week of speeches, parties and after-parties that inject hundreds of thousands of dollars into the local economy and deliver a multiday infomercial for the nominee.The coronavirus has changed all that, as much as Trump has resisted. Just 336 delegates — six from each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories — have been invited to cast proxy votes on behalf of the more than 2,500 regular delegates. And stringent safety measures have been put in place guided by a 42-page health and safety plan developed by a hired doctor.Attendees were asked to practice enhanced social distancing and get tested prior to travel, fill out a pre-travel health questionnaire and participate in a daily symptom tracker. They’re also being tested onsite, have been asked to maintain a 6-foot (1.8-meter) distance from other people and to use face coverings as a condition of participation — though many attendees were seen openly flouting those rules Monday morning. The RNC has also committed to contacting every participant five, 14 and 21 days after the event to check on potential symptoms.The event had been met with protests, and police have made several arrests.Besides the formal nomination roll call, the party is also spending time in Charlotte approving a handful of new resolutions, including one that backs Columbus Day as a federal holiday and one that labels the Southern Poverty Law Center, which catalogs the country’s hate groups, as a “radical organization.” Another bemoans “cancel culture,” warning that it “has grown into erasing of history, encouraging lawlessness, muting citizens and violating free exchange of ideas, thoughts, and speech.”But they will not vote on a new 2020 platform, after a unanimous vote to forgo one this year.“RESOLVED, That the Republican Party has and will continue to enthusiastically support the President’s America-first agenda,” a resolution instead reads, in part.After the Charlotte kickoff, most of the GOP convention will take place in Washington, D.C., at and around the White House, as well as by video. It will feature remarks from well-known Trump supporters, including members of the Trump family, outspoken conservatives and everyday Americans who campaign officials say have been helped by Trump’s policies.First lady Melania Trump will speak Tuesday from the Rose Garden, Pence will appear from Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Wednesday and Trump will deliver his marquee acceptance speech on Thursday from the South Lawn before a crowd of supporters — blurring the lines between governing and campaigning yet again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-nominate-donald-trump-to-take-on-biden-in-the-fall/story-nLCAHEwfGkD2ksAU6Kik7K.html

Berlin’s Charite hospital said a team of doctors there had examined him in detail after his arrival.“The clinical findings indicate poisoning by a substance from the group of active substances called cholinesterase inhibitors,” the hospital said in a statement. The specific substance was not yet known, they said. The outcome remains uncertain but long-term effects, especially to the nervous system, could not be ruled out, it said.Cholinesterase inhibitors are drugs that can increase communication between nerve cells in the brain. They are sometimes used to temporarily improve or stabilise the symptoms of people with dementia.Common side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors include vomiting, muscle cramps, headache and hallucinations.Certain chemical classes of pesticides work against bugs by interfering with, or ‘inhibiting’ cholinesterase but they can also be poisonous, or toxic, to humans in some situations.Navalny collapsed on a plane on Thursday last week after drinking tea while on his way to campaign in Siberia.Doctors at the Siberian hospital that first treated Navalny said earlier on Monday they had saved his life but they had not found traces of poison in his system. They had not come under pressure from authorities while treating Navalny, they said. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tests-indicate-putin-critic-alexei-navalny-was-poisoned-german-doctors-says/story-Vugi6ON9WzG7zoHbjqjKXK.html
24-08-2020||World||What happens if Kim Jong Un is dead? Explaining North Korea’s succession plan||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s disappearance from public life in recent months led to speculation about his health. And the fear for the worst gained credence after reports surfaced that he has handed over some power to his sister Kim Yo Jong.Kim underwent a surgery earlier this year after which his health has been declining. And unlike other democratic countries, the Hermit Kingdom doesn’t have a succession plan in place. It is being ruled by Kim’s family since 1948; the 36-year-old became the supreme leader in 2011.So what happens if Kim dies?Kim’s grandfather Kim Il Sung started the Mount Paektu bloodline in the country in 1948. After his ascension to power, a cult of personality developed around him which was later passed on to his successors: Son Kim Jong Il and grandson Kim Jong Un in 2011.In a democratic country (example India), there are set protocols and designations which have been empowered by the Constitution of the country to run the affairs in case an elected leader is left incapacitated or can’t perform his/her duties due to some other reason. But in North Korea, the leader has to be from Kim’s bloodline.What about his sons?Reports in variuous outlet say that Kim has three sons - and the eldest one was born in 2010. Hence, the reponsibilities to run the affairs of the country rests on the shoulders of his sister Kim Yo Jong. She is the only person that the North Korean leader trusts.Kim has made his sister the “de facto second-in-command”, according to neighbouring South Korea’s intelligence agency. The sleuths of the agency said that Kim has delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his sister.Kim Yo Jong won fame ahead of her brother’s 2019 summit with US President Donald Trump in Vietnam, when her efforts to ensure everything went well included holding an ashtray for the North Korean leader at a train station on his journey.The Kim dynastyKim’s grandfather is a revered figure in the country. Many North Korean consider Kim Il Sung as the father of the country. He established the bloodline after end of the Japanese rule in North Korea in 1945.One of the first things that travellers to North Korea notice is a huge portrait of Kim Il Sung, pictured in front of an airplane and workers alongside the road as they drive out of Pyongyang International Airport. It’s an image that soon becomes very familiar.Millions of portraits, mosaics and paintings of Kim Il Sung, founder of North Korea, and his son Kim Jong Il, the father of current leader Kim Jong Un, offer daily reminders to the public of the central role of the Kim dynasty in their nation’s story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-happens-is-kim-jong-un-is-dead-explaining-north-korea-s-succession-plan/story-zmgJdgLbfn9n5OcNLbDnWN.html
24-08-2020||World||Amid concerns over Kim Jong Un’s health, expert claims North Korean leader is dead||The updates about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are being keenly tracked across the world. The 36-year-old, who took over the reins in 2011 has skipped several public appearances in the last few months, giving rise to speculation that something is not right.A journalist, who has extensively travelled in the Hermit Kingdom, has claims that Kim is dead. Roy Calley told some media outlets that there are such levels of secrecy in North Korea that even those living in the country do not know what the reality is.The journalist said that the major changes being introduced by Kim - like making his sister the de facto second-in-command - point towards something major happening in the country.ALSO WATCH | Kim Jong-un reportedly in coma, sister Kim Yo-jong may take over: Key details Calley’s comments came amid reports emerging from South Korea that Kim is in coma. “I assess him (Kim Jong Un) to be in a coma, but his life has not ended,” several media outlets quoted a former aide of South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung as saying.Jang also posted on social media, according to local media outlets, that no North Korean leader would entrust any of his authority to another person unless he was too sick to rule or was removed through a coup - pointing towards the transition of power to Kim’s younger sister Kim Yo Jong.He, however, insisted that the North Korean is still in coma and that Kim Yo Jong is not his successor, according to reports from South Korea.The last official reports from North Korea stated that Kim Jong Un has issued a dire warning for the country’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the US.The state media in North Korea reported last week that Kim told a gathering of ruling party leaders that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects” and that his development goals had been “seriously delayed”.The unusually candid assessment came as sanctions, flooding and the coronavirus pandemic pushed the North Korean economy toward what was expected to be its worst contraction in more than two decades.Hours later, South Korean lawmakers told reporters that the country’s spy agency determined that Kim had delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong. While she had taken an increasingly public role in diplomatic matters, such as responding to a letter from US President Donald Trump earlier this year, one lawmaker described a more formal power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-concerns-over-kim-jong-un-s-health-expert-claims-north-korean-leader-is-dead/story-BVaIjc1hk7Y3AicVaCm0iP.html
24-08-2020||World||Tropical storm Marco approaches Louisiana for expected landfall||After a day as a hurricane, Tropical Storm Marco approached Louisiana for an expected landfall around midday Monday, while Tropical Storm Laura was forecast to move along Cuba’s southern coast during the day before entering the Gulf of Mexico and heading toward the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.The Gulf Coast braced for a history-making onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Gov. John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Laura caused the deaths of at least 11 people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, while knocking out power and causing flooding in the two nations that share the island of Hispaniola.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, but the National Hurricane Center said its sustained winds decreased to 70 mph (110 kph) after nightfall. The center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast.Marco was centered about 115 miles (190 kilometers) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River land heading northwest at 10 mph (17 kph) Monday morning.Laura was centered about 175 miles (285 kilometers) east-southeast of Cayo Largo on Monday morning, and had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph) and was predicted to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday morning as it followed a path likely to take it to the Louisiana coast by Wednesday night, forecasters said.In the wake of Laura’s passage through the Caribbean, authorities on Sunday reported at least 11 deaths.Haitian civil protection officials said they had received reports a 10-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on a home in the southern coastal town of Anse-a-Pitres, on the border with the Dominican Republic. Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana, and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-marco-approaches-louisiana-for-expected-landfall/story-ISdsqutS3RvT8BvoFUvL1K.html
24-08-2020||World||Donald Trump’s diplomatic legacy: lost trust, scarred ties and sanctions||President Donald Trump made some of his flashiest 2016 campaign pledges in foreign policy areas, such as vowing to reevaluate the US relationship with NATO, abandon a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and bring US troops back from “forever wars.”The Republican president, a former businessman from New York who boasts about his deal-making skills, has delivered on some of his pledges, while partially meeting a few others. Some he has so far completely failed to achieve.If Trump is defeated in the November 3 election by Democratic rival Joe Biden, the new administration’s hardest challenge will be to restore the global standing and trustworthiness of the United States, analysts and former US and European officials say.Biden, vice president under President Barack Obama, will be taking over a scarred transatlantic relationship, deep antagonism with China and sanctions-dominated pressure campaigns against Iran, Syria and Venezuela.Here is a look at some of the key policy priorities of the Trump administration and potential challenges for Biden:CHINAA central theme in Trump’s 2016 campaign was to accuse China of “ripping off” the United States while vowing to seal a fair trade deal with Beijing that would help American businesses and create US jobs.After almost two years of tit-for-tat trade war with the world’s second largest economy, Trump has so far managed a stalled first phase of such an agreement. Meanwhile, Washington and Beijing have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each others’ goods and the global spread of the coronavirus from China has soured bilateral ties to their worst level in decades, raising fears of a new Cold War.Washington has acted against Beijing on multiple fronts: It ended the special status of Hong Kong, sanctioned top officials over human rights abuses and sought to ban Chinese technology companies from operating in the United States.A Biden administration would have little option but to maintain the hard stance, analysts say, but would likely seek to dial down some rhetoric to create room for engagement.IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL In 2018, the Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, saying he could strike a better one. He also launched a “maximum pressure” campaign to choke off Tehran’s sources of income.Despite almost two years of sanctions on everything from oil revenue to minerals and Iran’s central bank, Washington has yet to force a change of behavior by Tehran and bring it back to the negotiating table. Instead, escalating tensions have carried the two nations to the brink of war. Biden has said he would deal with Iran through diplomacy and re-enter the agreement, but only if Iran first returned to compliance with the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program. NATO & TRANSATLANTIC TIES Trump has repeatedly complained about the failure of many NATO partners to meet defense spending targets. He has also questioned the continued relevance of the organization created in 1949 at the start of the Cold War with Russia.His attacks soured ties with several European allies, but more members of the alliance have now increased spending to meet its target of two percent of GDP.This year, Trump vowed to cut the number of US troops in Germany, accusing Berlin of taking advantage of the United States while not meeting its NATO obligations.Analysts say repairing the transatlantic alliance will take time, but should be one of the easier tasks awaiting a potential Biden administration.BRINGING TROOPS HOMETrump promised in his 2016 campaign to stay out of foreign wars and bring home US troops deployed in Afghanistan, America’s longest war, which is now in its nineteenth year.Washington has begun cutting troop numbers in Afghanistan after striking a deal with the Taliban in February that envisaged the withdrawal of all US troops. This depends, however, on talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, which have stalled.Trump also ordered a pullout of US troops from Syria. The decision was repeatedly watered down by aides and the military, but numbers have still been reduced by more than half.PARIS CLIMATE DEAL One of Trump’s most controversial decisions was his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, something he had repeatedly vowed to do during the 2016 campaign.Trump said the agreement imposed “draconian” financial and economic burdens on the United States and vowed to negotiate a better one. A new agreement has not materialized. The Biden campaign said he would recommit to the original Paris deal and lead an effort to get major countries to toughen their domestic targets.MIDDLE EAST Trump delivered on his 2016 campaign promise to relocate the US Embassy in Israel to divided Jerusalem. The move was slammed by most of the Arab world but won praise from the Israeli government and its supporters, as well as evangelical Christians.His wider Middle East Peace plan was rejected by Palestinians as it allowed Israel to maintain control of long-contested West Bank settlements, but received some encouraging reviews from several Arab states.One, the United Arab Emirates, this month normalized ties with Israel in a historic deal brokered by the United States, a move that many analysts saw as a foreign policy win for Trump at a time when he has been trailing Biden in polls.NORTH KOREATrump surprised the world by entering unprecedented talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He made no progress in persuading Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, but some believe his ice-breaking diplomacy could be a building block for a future administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-diplomatic-legacy-lost-trust-scarred-ties-and-sanctions/story-6hGRrTAtkCWGZaPgTFC9DI.html
24-08-2020||World||White House adviser Kellyanne Conway to leave at end of August||White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said late on Sunday that she will be leaving the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at the end of August, citing the need to focus on her family. “I will be transitioning from the White House at the end of this month”, she said in a statement.Her departure, about two months before Trump seeks re-election, comes at a crucial time for the president. It leaves him without one of his more passionate spokespersons about his political and policy choices. Conway was his third campaign manager in 2016 and has been one of Trump’s most loyal and outspoken defenders in public and on cable news. She was also the first woman to successfully manage a presidential campaign to victory.More recently, the adviser was instrumental in getting Trump to restart regular, though shorter, White House briefings about the coronavirus outbreak, a practice that officials have viewed as successful in helping to stop a drop in opinion polls the president has suffered largely because of his handling of the pandemic. In a separate statement on Twitter, Kellyanne Conway’s husband, George, said he was stepping back from his role in the Lincoln Project, a project with the stated mission to “defeat Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box”.The decisions by the Conways come a day after their 15-year-old daughter, Claudia, said on Twitter that she was seeking “emancipation”. Claudia has previously been outspoken on social media against her parents’ views. George Conway, a conservative lawyer who had co-founded the Lincoln Project, has been a vocal critic of the president.In a public feud with Kellyanne Conway’s spouse last year, Trump called him a “wack job” and a “husband from hell”, prompting George Conway to say Trump was mentally unfit for his office.On Sunday, Kellyanne Conway described her time in the administration, and previously with the 2016 campaign, as “heady” and “humbling”.She had survived several rounds of staff turnovers in an often chaotic and drama-ridden White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-adviser-kellyanne-conway-to-leave-at-end-of-august/story-zTXMCnvtlk3npAvdxBPUiM.html

The two were expected to also discuss Iran and China.The agreement delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Also read: Mike Pompeo heads to Middle East as part of Donald Trump’s Arab-Israeli pushEarlier this month, the US, Israel and the UAE announced the deal to establish full diplomatic relations, which also requires Israel to freeze its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank sought by the Palestinians as part of their future state.Later in the trip, Pompeo was to meet with Netanyahu’s partner in the government and Defense Minister Benny Gantz, as well as Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi.After his Israel stop Pompeo was also slated to visit Sudan, the UAE and Bahrain, with additional stops in the Gulf possible, the State Department had said. In Sudan, the secretary of state said he would push for “deepening the Sudan-Israel relationship.”Ahead of Pompeo’s arrival, the Israeli military said it struck militant targets in the Gaza Strip early on Monday, in response to incendiary balloons launched into Israel the day before. It was the latest exchange as tensions between the two sides intensified in recent weeks.The army said it bombed “military posts and an underground infrastructure” belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Militants affiliated with Hamas have launched scores of incendiary balloons into southern Israel in recent weeks, causing extensive damage to farmland, in a bid to pressure Israel to ease the blockade imposed since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. On Friday, Palestinian militants launched 12 rockets at Israel, nine of which were intercepted, in the largest outbreak of violence in recent months.Israel has responded the balloons and sporadic rocket fire with airstrikes on militant positions.Israel and Hamas have fought three wars and numerous smaller skirmishes in the past 13 years. Last week Egyptian mediators tried to ease tensions and bolster the informal truce between Israel and Hamas that has largely held since the 2014 war in Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-arrives-in-israel-to-press-trump-s-middle-east-peace-push/story-8SkaWtiujS5l0hZnheHNbL.html

The acquisition of the warship will double the combat power of the Pakistani Navy’s surface fleet, Chinese state media reported. By 2021, the Pakistan navy is expected to have three more similar warships in its fleet.The Chinese state-owned Hudong Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai held the launch ceremony for the advanced warship with top officials and naval officers attending the function.The shipyard is a wholly owned subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the largest builders in the country.The ship launch took place two days after Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi discussed the situation in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during the second round of the China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ dialogue in Hainan, off the south China coast.President Xi Jinping called Pakistan a “good brother” and a “good partner” in a recorded message to his counterpart President Arif Alvi after the meeting.New Delhi is currently locked in tension with both China and Pakistan over disputed boundaries and the abrogation of Article in Jammu & Kashmir.India would be closely monitoring the military cooperation between its two hostile neighbours.“It is worth noting that the 054A/P was purchased by Pakistan as the successor to the F-22P frigate, and the F-22P frigate is an export model developed by China on the basis of the 053H3 frigate. China has been working hard to promote the Type 054A frigate to the international market,” local news website ifeng.com reported.Type 054A is the best frigate in service with the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), experts say. The warship has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tons and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles.“The Type 054A is a multi-role frigate and is recognized as the backbone of the PLAN fleet of surface combatants with 30 vessels in commission. They have a length of 134 meters, a beam of 16 meters for a displacement of 4,000 tons,” the navalnews.com, a website tracking naval technology, said in a report on the launch.“They have a crew complement of 165 sailors and are fitted with a PJ26 76mm main gun, 8 C803 anti-ship missiles, 32x VLS cells for HQ-16 surface to air missiles, 2x Type 730 30mm CIWS, 2x Triple Torpedo launchers,’’ the website added.Cao Weidong, a senior researcher at the PLA’s Naval Military Studies Research Institute, told the newspaper that it seems that all weapons and radars on the new ship will be made in China which “…reflects our progress in the industry and the Pakistani Navy’s confidence in our technology and capability”.China and Pakistan’s military ties have rapidly deepened in recent years.The new version of the fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan with upgraded fighting capabilities, for example, made its maiden flight in December and the first batch is set to be inducted by Islamabad in 2020.The JF-17 Block 3 aircraft was flown above Chengdu in southwest China’s Sichuan province in December, the Aerospace Knowledge magazine said in a report in January.The single-engine, multi-role combat aircraft has been developed jointly by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) and the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sells-most-advanced-warship-to-pakistan-3-more-to-sail-by-2021/story-7BIUtEAMdFLHsIznsVdXPO.html
24-08-2020||World||Donald Trump hails FDA’s authorization of plasma treatment for Covid-19||President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed FDA authorization of a coronavirus treatment that uses blood plasma from recovered patients, a day after accusing the agency of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons.The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) announcement of its “emergency use authorization” of the treatment came on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where Trump will be nominated to lead his party for four more years.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“This is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time,” Trump told an unusually brief White House news conference. “Today I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.”The FDA, explaining its decision, cited early evidence suggesting blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients when administered in the first three days of their hospitalization.The agency also said it determined this was a safe approach in an analysis of 20,000 patients who received the treatment. So far, 70,000 patients have been treated using blood plasma, the FDA said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “It appeared that the product is safe and we’re comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told reporters in a conference call.A day before the FDA’s announcement, Trump tagged the agency’s Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a Twitter post in which he said, “The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics.” “Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!”Trump is looking to boost his lagging poll numbers during the Republican convention this week, and progress in treatments or an effective vaccine to gain control of the virus would aid his re-election chances. At least 5,686,377 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the United States, according to a Reuters tally, and more than 176,000 Americans have died. Michael Steele, who served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2009 to 2011, said the Trump administration was putting politics ahead of science.“This is not about good science or even your health, it’s about his re-election,” Steele wrote on Twitter.Plasma is the element of blood that carries water, enzymes and blood cells throughout the body. It also carries the antibodies humans form to fight off disease and boost immunity.Covid-19 patients have been receiving convalescent plasma for several months through clinical trials at medical centres such as New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital and Johns Hopkins. Supplies of plasma are limited because they require that a recovered Covid-19 patient donate blood and that it matches the blood type of the recipient. Reuters reported that Covid-19 plasma supplies are dwindling, with the American Red Cross saying its stockpile of plasma for Covid-19 patients declined 70% in July. US regulators provided emergency authorization for Gilead Science Inc’s remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for Covid-19 earlier this year. Reuters reported that a senior administration official said therapeutic drugs that are being studied specifically for Covid-19 could be authorized for use and making doses by fall.The White House declined to comment on a separate report in the Financial Times that the administration is considering fast-tracking an experimental Covid-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University for use in the United States ahead of the Nov. 3 elections.One option being explored would involve the FDA awarding emergency use authorization in October to the potential vaccine, which was developed by Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca, the FT reported https://www.ft.com/content/b053f55b-2a8b-436c-8154-0e93dcdb3c1a, citing people briefed on the plan.A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca denied the company had discussed an emergency use authorization for its potential vaccine with the US government and said it would be premature to speculate on that possibility. The company said the late-stage Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for its vaccine candidate are still ongoing in Britain and other markets globally and that it did not anticipate efficacy results until later this year.There are no approved vaccines for Covid-19, but AstraZeneca’s shot, called AZD1222, is widely seen as one of the leading candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-hails-fda-s-authorization-of-plasma-treatment-for-covid-19/story-7AvRWRG3pDNHG6iZbbnEQL.html
24-08-2020||World||Federal judge issues stay in Trump challenge of mail balloting in Pennsylvania||A federal judge on Sunday ordered a stay in President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign’s lawsuit seeking to ban drop boxes and other changes to Pennsylvania’s mail-balloting procedures.The Nov. 3 election promises to be the nation’s largest test of voting by mail and the two major parties are locked in numerous lawsuits that will shape how millions of Americans vote this autumn.The Republican president has repeatedly and without evidence said that an increase in mail-in ballots would lead to a surge in fraud, although Americans have long voted by mail. There is perhaps no more consequential lawsuit than the one in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 and is considered essential to his re-election effort.J. Nicholas Ranjan, U.S district judge for western Pennsylvania, said the federal case brought by the Trump campaign would not move forward until similar lawsuits in state courts are completed or unless they are delayed.Justin Clark, Trump’s deputy campaign manager, said the judge’s decision recognized that the issue touched on both state and constitutional issues.“The federal court is simply going to reserve its judgment on this in the hopes that the state court will resolve these serious issues and guarantee that every Pennsylvanian has their vote counted—once,” Clark said. The Trump campaign is seeking to ban ballot drop boxes, which were deployed in the state’s most recent primary and that allow voters to submit absentee ballots and bypass the US Postal Service.The campaign argues the drop boxes were not explicitly authorized in a bipartisan bill passed by the state legislature last year that expanded the state’s mail-balloting procedures.The suit also wants the residency requirement for poll watchers lifted, so that any Pennsylvania voter could serve in that function at any polling location in the state.The judge, a Trump appointee, said the suit involved state laws and he would defer for now to the state courts. “The Court will apply the brakes to this lawsuit, and allow the Pennsylvania state courts to weigh in and interpret the state statutes that undergird Plaintiffs’ federal-constitutional claims,” Ranjan said.The Trump campaign says the ballot drop box invites fraud. The federal judge asked the campaign to provide evidence of actual fraud, but the campaign declined, arguing it did not have to do so in order to win the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-judge-issues-stay-in-trump-challenge-of-mail-balloting-in-pennsylvania/story-i3ZqpQkHF9smNlN7US0GUK.html

The former aide is under arrest in an investigation into bank deposits made at the time amounting to 1.2 million reais ($213,500).Questions about Queiroz have continued to hound the Bolsonaro family in an investigation that has appeared to annoy the president and dent his promise not to tolerate corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-says-he-wants-to-punch-reporter-in-face/story-coTmTwGocjx3KEBsU8FNrN.html
24-08-2020||World||Nepal: Panel suggests full term for PM Oli, complete executive power for Prachanda||A six-member panel formed by the ruling Nepal Communist Party to resolve the bitter intra-party rift has suggested that Prime Minister K P Oli should complete his five-year tenure, while executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ be allowed to exercise full executive power over party affairs, a senior party leader said on Sunday. The task force, formed by Oli and Prachanda on August 15 and later endorsed by NCP’s powerful Central Secretariat on August 17, was led by the party’s General Secretary Bishnu Poudyal. The panel, which submitted its report to Oli and Prachanda on Saturday, includes Standing Committee members Shankar Pokhrel, Janardan Sharma, Bhim Rawal, Surendra Pandey and Pampha Bhusal. Although the details of the report has not been made public, it is expected to pacify the intra-party rift which deepened further after Prachanda and senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal demanded Prime Minister Oli’s resignation. According to senior NCP leader and Standing Committee member Ganesh Shah, the panel in its report has suggested that Prime Minister Oli should remain in power for a full five-year term, whereas Prachanda should have full executive power over the party’s affairs. When Oli became prime minister two-and-a-half years ago in 2018, he and Prachanda had reached a tacit understanding to share the prime minister’s position turn-by-turn. The panel has suggested the top leaders of the party to adhere to one-man-one-post principle and to promote coordination and collaboration between the two top leaders, Shah said. However, the report needs to be ratified in the Standing Committee meeting, which is likely to be convened this week, he said. There is no other way to maintain unity in the party at this moment, said Shanker Pokharel, one of the panel members. However, it is to be seen how the suggestions of the panel will be implemented, Shah said. According to party insiders, Prime Minister Oli is likely to reshuffle his Cabinet as soon as the Standing Committee meeting of the party endorses the panel’s report to strike a power balance with Prachanda. Oli and Prachanda have held about a dozen meetings to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the NCP. A bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” They are also against Oli’s autocratic style of functioning. The differences grew further after Oli said that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. The two leaders are also engaged in tightening their grip within the party with the escalation of the intra-party feud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-panel-suggests-full-term-for-pm-oli-complete-executive-power-for-prachanda/story-MWozXio6D82tSjyCPf5rLN.html

The National Intelligence Agency, however, said that the new system is not associated with any serious health issue.Chang’s claims come months after the North Korean dictator had not made a public appearance amid speculations of his deteriorating health. He was last seen presiding over a Workers’ Party politburo meeting on April 11 before a top security adviser to the South’s President Moon Jae-in downplayed rumours and said Kim Jong Un was “alive and well”.He was then seen cutting the ribbon at the opening of a fertilizer factory on May 2, KCNA reported.However, Chang has claimed that all photographs of Kim released by North Korea in recent months were fake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-in-coma-sister-kim-yo-jong-to-take-over-reports/story-9HaznCncdJ9iK9yoiI1FqM.html
24-08-2020||World||Northern California firefighters dig in ahead of high winds||Three massive wildfires chewed through parched Northern California landscape Sunday as firefighters raced to dig breaks and make other preparations ahead of a frightening weather system. That system was packing high winds and more of the lightning that sparked the huge blazes and scores of other fires around the state, putting nearly a quarter-million people under evacuation orders and warnings. At the CZU Lightning Complex fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains, south of San Francisco, authorities said their effort was hindered by people who refused to heed evacuation orders and those who were using the chaos to steal. Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart said 100 officers were patrolling and anyone not authorized to be in an evacuation zone would be arrested.Also read: In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in California “What we’re hearing from the community is that there’s a lot of looting going on,” Hart said. He said eight people have been arrested or cited and “there’s going to be more.” He and county District Attorney Jeff Rosell expressed anger at what Rosell called the “absolutely soulless” people who seek to victimize those already victimized by the fire. Among the victims was a fire commander who was robbed while helping coordinate efforts on Saturday. Someone entered the commander’s fire vehicle and stole personal items, including a wallet and “drained his bank account,” said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). “I can’t imagine a bigger low-life,” Hart said, promising to catch him and vowing “the DA is going to hammer him.” The Santa Cruz fire is one of the “complexes,” or groups of fires, burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area. They were started by lightning strikes that were among 12,000 registered in the state in the past week. The National Weather Service issued a “red flag” warning through Monday afternoon for the drought-stricken area, meaning extreme fire conditions including high temperatures, low humidity and wind gusts up to 65 mph (105 kph) that “may result in dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior.” In nearly a week, firefighters have gotten no more than the 17% containment for the LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country north of San Francisco. It’s been the most destructive blaze, accounting for five deaths and 845 destroyed homes and other buildings. It and a fire burning southeast of the Bay Area are among the five largest fires in state history, with both burning more than 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers). In Southern California, an 11-day-old blaze held steady at just under 50 square miles (106 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in northern Los Angeles County mountains. Rough terrain, hot weather and the potential for thunderstorms with lightning strikes challenged firefighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/northern-california-firefighters-dig-in-ahead-of-high-winds/story-AwAzvJTMDwETy30CvCPVgP.html
24-08-2020||World||US announces emergency authorization of plasma treatment against Covid-19||American authorities announced on Sunday an emergency authorization for doctors to use blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients as a treatment against the disease that has killed over 176,000 in the US.The move by the Food and Drug Administration comes as President Donald Trump faces intense pressure to curb the contagion that has hobbled the world’s largest economy and clouded his once-promising prospects for re-election in November.The plasma is believed to contain powerful antibodies that can help fight off the disease faster and help protect people from being seriously hurt by it.“This product may be effective in treating COVID-19 and... the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product,” FDA said in a statement.While the treatment has already been used on patients in the United States and other nations, the extent of its effectiveness is still debated by experts and some have warned that it could carry side effects.“Convalescent plasma probably works -- though it still needs to be proven in clinical trials -- but not as a rescue treatment for people who are already severely ill,” said Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.Trump faces tough campaign He said that plasma would likely work much better right after a person was exposed to the virus, when the body is trying to neutralize the infection -- the problem being that plasma supplies are limited, meaning it would be difficult to get enough to treat everyone in early stages of the disease.Trump told reporters the therapy shows “an incredible rate of success” and “will save countless lives”, but this went much further than his own health officials’ cautious welcome of the treatment.Challenged by a reporter to explain the apparent contradiction, Trump passed the question to one of his experts, then ended the press conference.The FDA already allowed convalescent plasma transfusions for coronavirus patients under certain conditions, such as clinical trials and gravely ill people.The Washington Post said that over 70,000 virus patients in the US have received such a transfusion.Trump has been widely criticized for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, which remains the world leader in infections and fatalities.He faces a tough re-election battle against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, with no effective treatment or vaccine expected before the vote on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-emergency-authorization-of-plasma-treatment-against-covid-19/story-JjPcJyuGd8WGQjDUZYL6GM.html
24-08-2020||World||Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu accepts compromise, avoids election||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday that he had agreed to extend contentious budget talks with his main rival, preventing a collapse of his government that would have triggered a fourth national election in under two years.While the decision defused the immediate budget crisis, it did not address the deeper issues that have plagued the power-sharing arrangement between Netanyahu and his bitter rival, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz. Since forming a coalition government in May, the two men have repeatedly feuded, and Netanyahu, facing the distraction of a potentially career ending corruption trial, has repeatedly hinted that he would prefer a new government that might be more lenient toward his legal woes.In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said now was not the time to force the country into an unwanted election. He cited the new opportunities created by his recent historic agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates, combined with the economic and public-health challenges caused by the coronavirus crisis.“Now is the time for unity. Not for elections,” he said.Under their coalition deal, Netanyahu and Gantz had faced a midnight deadline Monday night to agree on a budget. Otherwise, the government would have collapsed and automatically triggered a new vote.Sunday’s budget compromise merely gives the sides an additional 100 days to reach a deal, setting the stage for a similar showdown in December. In the meantime, Netanyahu said it also would allow the government to direct spending to struggling areas of the economy and allow schools to reopen on time next week.“This proposal allows money to begin flowing immediately to the citizens and the economy and it prevents the need for elections,” he said.There was no immediate comment from Gantz or Blue and White.Netanyahu, citing the country’s economic crisis stemming from the coronavirus outbreak, has called for a short-term budget of several months. Gantz says the sides must stick to their original agreement of a two-year budget, especially with most of 2020 already behind them.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said Sunday’s compromise extended a period of uncertainty that has harmed large parts of society.“Another 100 days without a budget?” he said in a statement. “This government is detached from reality, enough!”Netanyahu and Gantz, a former commander of the Israeli military, battled to three stalemates in a series of elections in under a year. With neither man controlling a parliamentary majority and the country facing a burgeoning coronavirus crisis last spring, they agreed to form their partnership.Their parties — Likud and Blue and White — split control of key government ministries and parliamentary committees. In addition to serving as defense minister, Gantz took on the new role of “alternate prime minister,” and the men agreed to rotate the premiership in November 2021, at the halfway point of their partnership.But since taking office, the rivals have clashed over almost every key issue, including the budget, Netanyahu’s pledge to unilaterally annex occupied West Bank territory and this month’s historic agreement to establish official ties with the UAE. Gantz was locked out of the UAE deal, which froze the annexation, and only learned about it after it was completed.But critics, including Gantz, say that Netanyahu’s legal troubles are driving his decision-making process. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a series of scandals in which he is accused of exchanging favors with powerful media figures.In January, his trial is scheduled to move into the witness stage — when a series of former allies are scheduled to testify against him in sessions set to take place three times a week. The testimonies will likely be an embarrassing and time-consuming distraction.A new election could potentially give Netanyahu a parliamentary majority with allies who would allow him to make key appointments, including a new justice minister, national police chief and attorney general, that could influence his legal process and delay or cancel the trial.“The only thing standing between us and another round of elections has nothing to do with the unprecedented economic crisis, but rather with Prime Minister Netanyahu’s demand for an immediate change to the system for appointing senior public officials,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.“At the heart of the changes Netanyahu is pushing for is his demand to grant himself or those in his inner circle with greater influence, if not total control, over these appointments,” he said, calling Netanyahu’s demands a “conflict of interests.” Plesner made the remarks shortly before Netanyahu’s appearance.Yet forcing new elections would also carry great risks. The country would be plunged into chaos during a deep economic and public health crisis. Lockdown measures imposed last spring led to a spike in unemployment, and then easing the lockdown too quickly led to a renewed outbreak in the coronavirus that the government has not yet been able to control.The economic troubles have led to a drop in support for Netanyahu’s Likud party and drawn thousands of people to join anti-Netanyahu protests outside his official residence, calling on him to resign. Recent opinion polls have indicated the country remains deeply divided, with Likud and its allies holding an edge, but not assured of an outright victory with his right-wing allies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-benjamin-netanyahu-accepts-compromise-avoids-election/story-zFIifIZB9TPScAUyioVlGN.html
24-08-2020||World||Iran: UN nuclear chief’s visit to Tehran no link to US push||Iran said Sunday that an upcoming visit this week by the head of the U.N.’s atomic watchdog agency to Tehran has nothing to do with a U.S. push to impose so-called “snapback” sanctions on Iran — even as Tehran acknowledged a recent explosion at a major uranium enrichment site was “sabotage.”The Trump administration last week dismissed near-universal opposition to its demand to restore all U.N. sanctions on Iran, declaring that a 30-day countdown for the “snapback” of penalties eased under the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers had begun.Both U.S. allies and foes have joined forces to declare the action illegal and doomed to failure. The U.S. argues that Iran has violated the restrictions imposed on its nuclear program under the 2015 deal, a charge Tehran has dismissed.Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted on Sunday Iran’s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA, Kazem Gharibadadi, as saying that the visit this week is “neither related to the snapback mechanism nor the U.S. demand.”Gharibabadi said the visit by the IAEA chief Rafael Grossi comes within “the framework of Iran’s invitation.”“We do not allow others to manage Iran,” he said, adding that Iran’s trust in the IAEA has been “damaged in recent months.”He expressed hope Grossi’s visit will lead to building trust. “It is important to assure Tehran that the agency will move based on impartiality, independence and professionalism,” said Gharibabadi.The IAEA said on Saturday that Grossi will head to Tehran to press Iranian authorities for access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material. Gharibabadi said Grossi was due to meet with Iranian officials on both Tuesday and Wednesday.Later Sunday, Iran’s semiofficial Fars news agency quoted the spokesman of the country’s atomic agency, Behrouz Kamalvandi, as saying that “security investigations confirm sabotage” in the July 2 blast at the Natanz nuclear facility. He said details would be released later at the proper time.Iranian officials had initially downplayed the fire, first raising the possibility of sabotage days later, but have been careful not to directly blame the U.S. or Israel, whose officials heavily hinted they had a hand in the fire.Kamalvandi also said the IAEA was seeking access and inspection at two “places” near the capital Tehran and central Iranian city of Isfahan.The landmark 2015 nuclear deal was endorsed by a U.N. Security Council resolution and includes the snapback provision. President Donald Trump pulled America out of the accord in 2018 and imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran.Last week, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a letter to the U.N. Security Council said the U.S. has no right to demand the restoration of U.N. sanctions, arguing that the U.S. lost the right to make demands when it withdrew from the accord.The five countries now in dispute with the U.S. administration — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — remain supporters of the nuclear deal to rein in Iran’s nuclear program and prevent its development of nuclear weapons. The five nations and Iran will meet in Vienna on Sept. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-un-nuclear-chief-s-visit-to-tehran-no-link-to-us-push/story-flRO8oYbTUXkNloPUL1TrK.html

Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death in May of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Earlier on Saturday there were scuffles in downtown Portland between anti-racism protesters and right-wing demonstrators. Participants clad in body armor and helmets traded punches and blasts of pepper spray as police officers mostly looked on, according to video of the clashes posted on social media. President Donald Trump’s administration in July deployed federal forces to deal with the protests in Portland. On Friday, he denounced the demonstrations as “crazy” and said cities run by Democrats had descended into chaos. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler is a Democrat.Portland police said this week that they have declared a riot at least 18 times since May 29.On Sunday they said the 14 people arrested were booked into jail on charges including rioting, assaulting a public safety officer, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-arrest-14-after-portland-rocked-by-clashes-between-demonstrators/story-I0iSESSJijQvJaLfdHNTCN.html
