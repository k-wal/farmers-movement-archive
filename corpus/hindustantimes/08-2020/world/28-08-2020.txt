Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his historic “I Have A Dream” address, a vision of racial equality that remains elusive for millions of Americans.And they are gathering on the heels of yet another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man — this time, 29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Sunday — sparking days of protests and violence that left two dead.“I want to give space for Black people in the crowd to say they are not OK,” said Jumaane Williams, New York City’s public advocate, who addressed march attendees shortly after the program began.“We are like the nameless grandmothers who got in the streets and said, ‘We will make you live up to what America says she is,’” Williams said. “We are here. We’re not going anywhere.”Activist Frank Nitty, who said he walked 750 miles for 24 days from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Washington for Friday’s march, spoke to the audience about persistence in the fight for justice.“Are y’all tired? Because I’m tired,” Nitty said. “They think this is a negotiation, but I came here to demand change. My grandson ain’t gonna march for the same things that my granddaddy marched for. This is a revolution.”March attendee Jerome Butler, 33, of D.C., echoed Nitty’s sentiment.“My hope is that my son doesn’t have to be out here in another 50 years protesting the same thing,” Butler said.Early on, the march was shaping up to be the largest political gathering in Washington since the coronavirus pandemic began. Many attendees showed up wearing T-shirts bearing the image and words of the late Rep. John Lewis who, until his death last month, was the last living speaker at the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which went on to become one of the most famous political rallies in US history, and one of the largest gatherings at the nation’s capital with over 200,000 people advocating for social change.Participants streaming in for the march late Friday morning stood in lines that stretched for several blocks, as organizers insisted on taking temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols. Organizers reminded attendees to practice social distancing and wear masks throughout the program.Martin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights icon and the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organization, the National Action Network, planned Friday’s event, delivered keynote addresses that show the urgency for federal policing reforms, to decry racial violence, and to demand voting rights protections ahead of the November general election.“We’ve come to bear witness, to remain awake, to remember from where we’ve come and to carefully consider where we’re going,” King said. “Whether you’re here in person or watching on (television networks), thank you for joining us for this March on Washington.”“We’re taking a step forward on America’s rocky but righteous journey toward justice,” he added.“We didn’t just come out here to have a show,” Sharpton said. “Demonstration without legislation will not lead to change.”And to underscore the urgency, Sharpton assembled the families of an ever-expanding roll call of victims: Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner, among others.Arbery and Martin both were killed by white men who pursued them with guns.Following the commemorative rally, participants will march to the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and then disperse.Turnout in Washington was expected to be lighter than initially intended due to city-imposed coronavirus pandemic restrictions that limit out-of-state visitors to the nation’s capital. To that end, the National Action Network organized a handful of satellite march events in South Carolina, Florida and Nevada, among others.Robbie Williams, 67, traveled to the march from Covington, Kentucky, and said attending was her way of “speaking to my children and my people.”“My message to my children is to stand up no matter what. And to the police: get some education and read your bibles,” Williams said, adding that she also wants Black communities to honestly confront internal violence and homophobia.Representation of Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and gender-nonconforming people in the movement was addressed by several march speakers, including David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, a Black LGBTQ civil rights organization.“I stand here in the spirit of our brother Bayard Rustin,” he said, referring to the King adviser who helped organize the original march. “Without his brilliance and his commitment to our intersectional social justice, there would not have been a March on Washington.”“If you care about Black people like I do, if you love Black people like I do, you’ve got to love and care about all of us,” Johns said.While participants march in Washington, Sharpton has called for those in other states to march on their US senators’ offices and demand their support of federal policing reforms. Sharpton said protesters should also demand reinvigorated US voter protections, in Lewis’ memory.In June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use of stranglehold maneuvers and end qualified immunity for officers, among other reforms. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after a white police officer in Minneapolis held a knee to the man’s neck for nearly eight minutes, sparking weeks of sustained protests and unrest from coast to coast.In July, following Lewis’ death, Democratic senators reintroduced legislation that would restore a provision of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 gutted by the US Supreme Court in 2013. The law previously required states with a history of voter suppression to seek federal clearance before changing voting regulations.Both measures are awaiting action in the Republican-controlled Senate.In her remarks at the march, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, whose Texas district includes Floyd’s hometown of Houston, referenced a line from the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” address that decries America for giving Black people “a bad check, a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds.’”“Today, we stop the insufficient funds and we put money in the bank,” Lee said, vowing to keep pushing for enactment of the federal legislation.Later in the evening, the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations that make up the broader Black Lives Matter movement, will hold its virtual Black National Convention.The convention will coincide with the unveiling of a new Black political agenda intended to build on the success of this summer’s protests. The platform will deepen calls for defunding police departments in favor of investments to healthcare, education, housing and other social services in Black communities, organizers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-gather-at-march-on-washington-commemorations/story-Pq0ut7gyYQl3eSl0FtAfCO.html
28-08-2020||World||Israel lists first commercial passenger flight to UAE||Israel has listed an El Al flight taking off Monday for Abu Dhabi, which would be Israel’s first commercial passenger flight to the United Arab Emirates after the two countries agreed to a US-brokered deal to normalize relations.The confirmation of the flight comes as the latest concrete sign of a deal that saw Israel agree to halt plans to annex land sought by the Palestinians. It also brought into the open a long-standing relationship between Israel and the UAE that both countries hope now will benefit their economies and strengthen their ties to the US amid tensions with Iran.The website of the Israel Airports Authority listed the flight on Friday. It said the flight would be numbered LY971, a nod to the UAE’s international calling code number. A return flight to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport on Tuesday will be numbered LY972, Israel’s international calling code.Emirati officials and the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The flight was not immediately bookable on the website of El Al, Israel’s flag carrier.However, US officials earlier said the anticipated first flight will include American officials led by President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Other US officials on board will include national security adviser Robert O’Brien, Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and envoy for Iran Brian Hook.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier announced that his national security adviser, Meir Ben-Shabbat, will lead Israel’s delegation. A number of Israeli government ministries will also send representatives, including the directors of the foreign and defense ministries and the national aviation authority, he said.Private jets earlier flew between the two nations as their officials conducted covert talks. In May and June, Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways flew cargo freighters to Ben Gurion carrying aid for the Palestinians to combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Israel and the UAE agreed to normalize relations Aug. 13. By Aug. 16, telephone calls began ringing between the nations, marking the first concrete step of the US-brokered diplomatic accord.The historic deal delivered a key foreign policy victory to Trump as he seeks reelection, and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Palestinians maintain it puts a just resolution to the Middle East conflict even farther out of reach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-lists-first-commercial-passenger-flight-to-uae/story-RTOpJFamakK7xT4TR0qdaL.html
28-08-2020||World||‘He doesn’t understand presidency’: Biden, Harris hit back at Trump||Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for US president, countered President Donald Trump’s attacks on him from the convention with a string of tweets, pointing out the mushrooming Covid-19 cases and infections across the country. Biden held President Trump responsible for the protests that he sought to portray as lawlessness.Kamala Harris, Biden’s vice-presidential nominee, had laid out a more detailed critique of the president’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and his response to the anti-racism protest in a prebuttal. She argued, “Trump doesn’t understand the presidency”.“Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency,” Biden shot back in a tweet, to Trump’s portrayal of them as harbingers of the kind of lawlessness and chaos that will take place on Biden’s watch.Also read: What the conventions reveal for Biden, Trump in final stretch to NovemberTrump has tried to position himself as a law-and-order president has used the anti-race protests to stoke fears about lawlessnesses tying them to the radical left-wing of the Democratic party, who he has argued, will be calling the shots in a Biden administration.In his counter-attack, Biden sought to keep the focus on Trump’s key vulnerability - the Covid-19 epidemic which has killed close to 180,000 Americans and infected 6 million.“From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.,” he wrote in one tweet. “Now, we’re paying the price”.In prepared remarks for the prebuttal, Harris said, Trump had displayed “reckless disregard for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. For the devastation, it would do to our economy. For the damage, it would do to communities of colour who have been subjected to structural racism for generations”.“He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen. It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us. And yet, he has failed. Miserably,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-doesn-t-understand-presidency-biden-harris-hit-back-at-trump/story-HeVbW0UUl2ZUGDdij1l4fJ.html
28-08-2020||World||Cambridge University kicks off vaccine race to fight all coronaviruses||The University of Cambridge on Wednesday confirmed plans to begin trials of a potential new vaccine not only against Covid-19 but all coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans in the future.The new vaccine candidate, DIOS-CoVax2, uses banks of genetic sequences of all known coronaviruses, including those from bats, believed to be the natural hosts of many relatives of human coronaviruses.A vaccine that clears all trials can then be delivered pain-free without a needle into the skin through a spring-powered jet injection.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Our approach involves 3D computer modelling of the SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] virus’ structure. It uses information on the virus itself as well as its relatives – SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses carried by animals that threaten to ‘spill-over’ to humans again to cause future human epidemics,” said Professor Jonathan Heeney, head of the Laboratory of Viral Zoonotics at the University of Cambridge, and founder of DIOSynVax – a Cambridge spin-out company.“We’re looking for chinks in its armour, crucial pieces of the virus that we can use to construct the vaccine to direct the immune response in the right direction. Ultimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from SARS-CoV-2, but also other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans,” he said.Prof Heeney said his team’s strategy involves targeting those domains of the virus’ structure that are absolutely critical for docking with a cell, while avoiding the parts that could make things worse.“What we end up with is a mimic, a synthetic part of the virus minus those non-essential elements that could trigger a bad immune response,” he added.His team have developed libraries of computer-generated antigen structures encoded by synthetic genes that can train the human immune system to target key regions of the virus and to produce beneficial anti-viral responses.These immune responses include neutralising antibodies, which block virus infection, and T-cells, which remove virus-infected cells.This so-called “laser-specific” computer generated approach is able to help avoid the adverse hyper-inflammatory immune responses that can be triggered by recognition of the wrong parts on the coronavirus’ surface.“Most research groups have used established approaches to vaccine development because of the urgent need to tackle the pandemic. We all hope the current clinical trials have a positive outcome, but even successful vaccines are likely to have their limitations – they may be unsuitable for vulnerable people, and we do not know how long their effects will last for, for example,” said Dr Rebecca Kinsley, Chief Operating Officer of DIOSynVax and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge.“Our approach – using synthetic DNA to deliver custom designed, immune selected vaccine antigens – is revolutionary and is ideal for complex viruses such as coronavirus. If successful, it will result in a vaccine that should be safe for widespread use and that can be manufactured and distributed at low cost,” she said.DIOS-CoVax2, which hopes to go into human trials by later this year, is the latest vaccine candidate to be backed by the UK government with 1.9 million pounds in funding as part of a collaboration between DIOSynVax, which is contributing an additional 400,000 pounds to the trial, the University of Cambridge and the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust.The team say their proposed new vaccine can be freeze-dried as a powder and is therefore heat stable, meaning that it does not need to be cold-stored. This makes transport and storage much more straightforward, particularly important in low and middle income countries, and it can be delivered through PharmaJet Tropis intradermal Needle-free Injection System, which delivers the vaccine in less than a 1/10th of a second jet injection.Professor Saul Faust, Director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, said: “It is especially exciting that the clinical trial will test giving the vaccine through people’s skin using a device without any needles as together with stable DNA vaccine technology this could be a major breakthrough in being able to give a future vaccine to huge numbers of people across the world.”The news comes as the University of Oxford revealed that its trials of a potential vaccine against Covid-19 being developed with AstraZeneca could be put before regulators this year if scientists are able to gather enough data.The Oxford vaccine, as it is commonly known, showed early promise in the first human trial when it produced an immune response, underlining its position as one of the leading candidates in the race to help vaccinate humans against the deadly novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-university-kicks-off-vaccine-race-to-fight-all-coronaviruses/story-ZxxOYUFHyj7Ttowos2pRqO.html
28-08-2020||World||6 killed as hurricane Laura slams Louisiana||Hurricane Laura tore through Louisiana on Thursday, killing six people and flattening buildings across a wide swatch of the state before moving into Arkansas with heavy rains. Laura’s powerful gusts uprooted trees - and four people were crushed to death in separate incidents of trees falling on homes. The state’s department of health said late Thursday that there were two more fatalities attributed to the hurricane - a man who drowned while aboard a sinking boat and a man who had carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator in his home. In Westlake, a chemical plant caught fire when hit by Laura, and the flames continued to send a chlorine-infused plume of smoke skyward nearly 24 hours after landfall.Laura caused less mayhem than forecasts predicted - but officials said it remained a dangerous storm and that it would take days to assess the damage. At least 867,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas remained without power on Thursday afternoon.“This was the most powerful storm to ever make landfall in Louisiana,” Governor John Bel Edwards told a news conference. “It’s continuing to cause damage and life-threatening conditions.” Laura’s maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph) upon landfall easily bested Hurricane Katrina, which sparked deadly levee breaches in New Orleans in 2005, and arrived with wind speeds of 125 mph. The NHC said Laura’s eye had crossed into southern Arkansas late Thursday afternoon and was heading to the northeast at 15 mph (24 kph). The storm could dump 7 inches (178 mm) of rain on portions of Arkansas, likely causing flash floods. Laura was downgraded to a tropical depression by the NHC at 10 p.m., and the forecaster said it will move to the mid-Mississippi Valley later on Friday and then to the mid-Atlantic states on Saturday.Chemical plumeLaura’s howling winds leveled buildings across a wide swath of the state and a wall of water that was 15 feet (4.6 m) high crashed into tiny Cameron, Louisiana, where the hurricane made landfall around 1 a.m. A calamitous 20-foot storm surge that had been forecast to move 40 miles (64 km) inland was avoided when Laura tacked east just before landfall, Edwards said. That meant a mighty gush of water was not fully pushed up the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which would have given the storm surge an easy path far inland. Tropical-force winds were felt in nearly every parish across Louisiana - and Edwards warned that the death toll could climb as search and rescue missions increase. Cleanup begins Residents of Lake Charles heard Laura’s winds and the sound of breaking glass as the storm passed through the city of 78,000 with winds of 85 mph and gusts up to 128 mph in the hour after landfall.National Guard troops cleared debris from roads in Lake Charles on Thursday afternoon. There were downed power lines in streets around the city, and the winds tipped a few semi-trucks onto their sides. The windows of the city’s 22-storey Capital One Tower were blown out, street signs were toppled and pieces of wooden fence and debris from collapsed buildings lay scattered in the flooded streets, video footage on Twitter and Snapchat showed. Lake Charles resident Borden Wilson, a 33-year-old pediatrician, was anxious about his return home after evacuating to Minden, Louisiana.“I never even boarded up my windows. I didn’t think to do that. This is the first hurricane I’ve experienced. I just hope my house is fine,” he said in a telephone interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-killed-as-hurricane-laura-slams-louisiana/story-XukGtt1Ovju3sVQaCakZ7I.html
28-08-2020||World||What the conventions reveal for Biden, Trump in final stretch to November||The back-to-back presidential nominating conventions that concluded with Donald Trump’s speech on Thursday showed both sides intend to fight for the sliver of independent and moderate voters that will decide the election, each with a wildly different strategy in the final sprint to Nov. 3.A self-styled showman, Trump used all of his reality-show talents during the Republican convention this week to try to win back supporters alienated by his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with a dire warning of a lawless America if his Democratic rival Joe Biden takes power.That illustrated the Republican strategy for the next two months: change the subject from a pandemic that has killed 180,000 Americans and shackled the U.S. economy, and blame Democrats for the violence on the streets.Republicans largely abandoned talk of the health crisis as if it had abated, in favor of reminding voters of the robust economy that existed beforehand. During the Democratic convention the previous week, Biden put the focus on holding Trump accountable for his actions during the outbreak. “These two conventions have offered very different pictures of reality, in terms of where our country is now and what our future may hold,” said Christopher Devine, an expert in U.S. elections at the University of Dayton in Ohio.Trump’s convention depicted the president as a champion of “law and order,” taking aim at voters who do not approve of his divisive and inflammatory rhetoric but may be jittery about months of protests over racial injustice and police brutality that have sometimes turned violent.“This is their attempt to nail down the base and mobilize them to get out and vote,” said Kathleen Dolan, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.“But I do think he is trying to peel away some of those undecided women, the people who he’s calling the ‘suburban women.’“Biden holds a seven point lead over Trump nationally, about the same position he held before the conventions, according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted Aug. 19-25. But it showed the race for suburban voters narrowing, a worrying sign for the former vice president who had previously expanded his lead with the crucial voting group.Suburban women - a cohort considered key to the election - have become less critical of Trump than they were in June, and Biden’s advantage with this group has narrowed to nine points in the latest poll, compared to a 15-point advantage over Trump in a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll in June.The August poll also showed Biden with a 5-point lead with college-educated white Americans, compared with his 7-point lead in July and an 11-point advantage in June.But in reaching out to suburban voters with unapologetic tough-on-crime messages, while showing little empathy for the protesters who demand racial justice, Trump may have further bolstered Black American support for Biden, already strong.Trump’s message would have been more powerful before the pandemic, said Kyle Kondik, an analyst for the University of Virginia Center for Politics.“It could be successful if Covid is not as much of a focus in the fall as it is now. That seems hard to imagine, but it’s possible,” he said.Pitch to the middleWhile lauding Trump at every turn, his convention was just as much about convincing wavering Republicans or undecided voters that Biden - who ran largely as a centrist candidate in the Democratic primary - would be beholden to the far-left elements of his party.A bevy of speakers accused Biden of turning a blind eye to the crime and violence that have marred mostly peaceful protests over racial justice, sparked by the police killing in May of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis. The latest police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, led to a fresh wave of protests. Ford O’Connell, a Republican consultant close to the Trump campaign, said much of the convention’s programming was directed at voters who “might have soured” on Trump because of his divisive style or were still looking for reasons to support him.First lady Melania Trump expressed sympathy for those who had suffered because of the pandemic, a gesture of solace that her husband has rarely shown, and Vice President Mike Pence offered a more statesmanlike critique of Biden that may have appealed to Republicans weary of the president’s invective. Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist in Virginia not affiliated with the Trump campaign, said the unrest this week in Kenosha, a small city in Wisconsin, may bolster Trump in ways other protests have not.With the pandemic still raging and the economy struggling, “chaos and uncertainty are the best friend he has,” Donovan said. Violence as strategy?Speaking at a fundraiser on Thursday, Biden too suggested Trump welcomed chaos. “The violence you’re seeing is in Donald Trump’s administration, Donald Trump’s America. Did they forget who’s president?” Biden said. “Violence isn’t a problem in Trump’s eyes. It’s a political strategy.”The protests have been a thorny issue for Biden, who would rather keep the focus on the virus. While showing solidarity with demonstrators, he has also criticized the destruction of communities and has not backed the de-funding of police departments as called for by activists in his party.But Jim Messina, who was President Barack Obama’s campaign manager for the 2012 reelection, said Republicans’ fiery rhetoric against protests, which have been mostly peaceful despite sometimes violent clashes, could turn off independents who want an end to the bitter polarization.“Trump has gone so far right that he’s left the middle for the taking,” he said.Biden’s convention underscored profound fears within the party that voter turnout may be depressed by the pandemic as well as Trump’s efforts to limit mail-in voting, which Trump has denounced as prone to fraud despite no such evidence. Former first lady Michelle Obama urged Americans to “vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-the-conventions-reveal-for-biden-trump-in-final-stretch-to-november/story-vqiXgHH4aOTZqBd5igSVqM.html

We value his friendly feelings towards Taiwan and hope he is healthy.”South Korea Presidential Blue House spokesperson Kang Min-seok“We regret the sudden resignation announcement of Prime Minister Abe, who has left many meaningful achievements as Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, and has also especially played a large role for development in South Korea and Japan’s bilateral relations.“We wish the prime minister a quick recovery. Our government will continue cooperation with the new prime minister and the new cabinet for improved ties with Japan.” Kwong Tae-shin, vice chairman of the federation of Korean industries, a South Korea business lobby group“President Moon Jae-in and Abe do not have good personal relationship, which contributed to adverse bilateral ties. When a new leader takes office in Japan, he can give momentum to improving bilateral relations. The two countries acknowledge that unnecessary diplomatic and trade conflicts would not help each other at a time when Covid -19 further adds difficulty to trade and business activities globally.”Marcus Schurmann, CEO, German chamber of commerce and industry in Japan“He did a lot of good with regards just to the fact that he was one of the key promoters for multilateralism and free trade and did a lot to move to Japan back onto the world stage. Japan recovered the visibility and recognition the third-largest economy in the world deserves.“We have FTAs and he also tackled a lot of difficult problems. Just thinking about relations with China, relations also with Russia, and also the difficult relationship with the U.S. at least since Trump came into power.“I do not want to say he failed, but at least what is an unsolved problem is the relationship was Korea.

28-08-2020||World||Coronavirus lockdown brings new misery to long-suffering Gaza Strip||Ahmed Eissa, a father of two living in the Gaza Strip, was already struggling to make ends meet on USD 7 a day, dealing with frequent electricity cuts and worried that another war might break out.Then the coronavirus found its way into the impoverished Palestinian territory, just as Israel was tightening its blockade in a standoff with Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers, and a strict lockdown has confined everyone to their homes.Now Eissa doesn’t know how he will feed his family.“I don’t have savings and I don’t have a job, so no one would lend me money,” he said. “I won’t beg from anyone.” The restrictions imposed by Hamas are aimed at averting what many fear would be an even bigger catastrophe: a wide-scale outbreak in a population of 2 million people confined to a territory where the health care system has been devastated by years of war and isolation.The lockdown was triggered by the discovery earlier this week of the first locally spread cases, after months in which infections were confined to quarantine facilities where all returning travelers were forced to isolate for three weeks. Authorities have not yet determined how the virus made its way into the general population.Israel and Egypt imposed a crippling blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel, which has fought three wars and countless smaller battles with Hamas since the takeover, says the closures are needed to prevent the militants from importing and manufacturing arms. Critics view it as a form of collective punishment.The blockade, the periodic fighting and a longstanding feud between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank have devastated the local economy, which suffers from roughly 50% unemployment.In recent weeks, Hamas-linked groups have sent incendiary balloons and rockets into Israel in a campaign aimed at pressuring it to ease restrictions and allow large-scale development projects. In response, Israel launched airstrikes targeting Hamas military infrastructure, sealed off Gaza’s fishing zone and closed its sole commercial crossing. That forced Gaza’s only power plant to shut down for lack of fuel.Most Gazans now get just four hours of electricity a day, leaving them without refrigeration, air conditioning or electric fans for hours on end as temperatures hover around 32 degrees Celsius (about 90 degrees Fahrenheit).Eissa’s wife, Majda, says it’s “unbearable.” They struggle to sleep at night because of the heat and humidity. Her daughters sleep on the tile floor because it’s cooler. They change rooms, they open and close windows, trying to catch the occasional breeze.The water pump in their building runs on electricity, so the taps run dry when the power goes out.“The dishes and laundry are piling up in the kitchen,” she said. “Everything gets dirty, and I have to keep scrubbing and cleaning using a bottle of water. I can’t bear to stay at home anymore.” Eissa used to buy from fishermen and then resell the fish in local markets, work that he says brought in around 25 shekels ($7) a day. But the fishermen are marooned by the Israeli closures, and he’s not allowed to leave home because of the lockdown to look for other work.On Thursday, his parents, who live downstairs, sent him a pot of stew for lunch.“I don’t know what or how we will eat tomorrow,” he told The Associated Press by phone from his home in the Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. He complained that he has not seen a serious government plan on how to cope with the crisis.In recent days, authorities have detected 80 cases of local transmission and two people have died from Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Hamas has extended the lockdown until Sunday, forcing most businesses to close and setting up checkpoints to limit movement.“We may have to shut down entire neighborhoods and lock up residents in their houses while providing them with what they need,” Tawfiq Abu Naim, the head of Hamas’ security services, told reporters.Many Gazans live day-to-day on meager wages earned at markets, shops, restaurants and cafes, all of which are shuttered.About two thirds of Gaza’s population are refugees whose families fled or were driven out during the 1948 war surrounding the creation of Israel. More than a million receive food aid from the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, but it has been forced to suspend food distribution due to the pandemic and is now providing only health care and basic sanitation.“We are aware that food is even more critical during such a period, and are working hard on finding a modality that will allow us to resume this massive food operation in the very near future in a safe way,” said Matthias Schmale, the UNRWA director in Gaza.UNRWA launched a program to deliver food to people’s homes in March, at the start of the global pandemic, but ended it when an initial lockdown was lifted.The electricity crisis also poses challenges, Schmale said.“If we’re not able to run our generators this would be a major challenge for continuing essential services, and in particular, health,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-lockdown-brings-new-misery-to-long-suffering-gaza-strip/story-tzKVED5Piu9RnZKDUlm8ZN.html
28-08-2020||World||UN chief asks G20 nations, including India, to invest in clean transition as they recover from Covid||UN chief Antonio Guterres on Friday renewed his call on India and other G20 countries to invest in a clean and sustainable transition as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, expressing deep concern over the continued support for polluting fossil fuels by nations across the world. UN Secretary-General Guterres, virtually delivering the 19th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said that clean energy and closing the energy access gap are good business. “They are the ticket to growth and prosperity. Yet, here in India, subsidies for fossil fuels are still some seven times more than subsidies for clean energy,” he said. Coal subsidies in 2019-20 amounted to USD 2.06 billion, with overall subsidies to fossil fuels at USD 11 billion, he said. Guterres praised India for raising the proportion of renewable energy in its total consumption to 24 per cent from 17 per cent despite the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that coal-fired power use has declined by 10 per cent to 66 per cent from 76 per cent. The UN chief said that investments in renewable energy generate triple the number of jobs created by investments in fossil fuels. “With the Covid-19 pandemic threatening to push many people back into poverty, such job creation is an opportunity that can’t be missed,” Guterres said. Apart from issues of job creation and concerns about pollution and climate change, coal power plants are likely to become “stranded assets,” he said. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar presided over the event and delivered the Presidential Address. The UN chief described as “deeply troubling” the continued support for fossil fuels in so many places around the world. “I have asked all G20 countries, including India, to invest in a clean, green transition as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. This means ending fossil fuel subsidies, placing a price on carbon pollution and committing to no new coal after 2020,” Guterres said. The Secretary-General elaborated that in India, 50 per cent of coal will be uncompetitive in 2022, reaching 85 per cent by 2025. “This is why the world’s largest investors are increasingly abandoning coal. They see the writing on the wall. It spells stranded assets and makes no commercial sense. The coal business is going up in smoke,” he said. Guterres said that he is “increasingly concerned” about the several “negative trends” and pointed out that G20 recovery packages show that twice as much recovery money has been spent on fossil fuels as clean energy. “In some cases, we are seeing countries doubling down on domestic coal and opening up coal auctions. This strategy will only lead to further economic contraction and damaging health consequences. “We have never had more evidence that pollution from fossil fuels and coal emissions severely damages human health and leads to much higher healthcare system costs,” Guterres said. India in June launched the auction process for coal blocks for commercial mining. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opened India’s coal sector for private players, and had termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance. Presently, despite being the world’s fourth largest producer, India is the second largest importer of the dry-fuel, Modi had said. “Allowing private sector in commercial coal mining is unlocking resources of a nation with the world’s fourth-largest reserves,” he had pointed out. Modi had said that the launch of the auction process not only marked the beginning of unlocking of the country’s coal sector from the lockdown of decades, but aimed at making India the largest exporter of coal. Guterres lauded the developed economies and many developing nations for leading by example by shifting to green solutions to meet their energy demands amid the pandemic. He cited the example of South Korea, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the European Union for speeding up decarbonisation of their economies in their domestic stimulus and investment plans in response to Covid-19. He noted that these countries are shifting from unsustainable fossil fuels to clean and efficient renewables, and investing in energy storage solutions, such as green hydrogen. Nigeria too has recently reformed its fossil fuel subsidy framework, Guterres said. With outdoor air pollution, largely driven by high-emitting energy and transport sources, leading to damaging pulmonary diseases – asthma, pneumonia and lung cancer, Guterres said researchers in the United States have concluded that people living in regions with high levels of air pollution are more likely to die from Covid-19. “If fossil fuel emissions were eliminated, overall life expectancy could rise by more than 20 months, avoiding 5.5 million deaths per year worldwide. Investing in fossil fuels means more deaths and illness and rising healthcare costs. It is, simply put, a human disaster and bad economics,” he said. The cost of renewables has fallen so much that it is already cheaper to build new renewable energy capacity than to continue operating 39 per cent of the world’s existing coal capacity, Guterres said, adding that this share of uncompetitive coal plants will rapidly increase to 60 per cent in 2022.

The UK’s top two holiday destinations -- Spain and France -- have also been designated as quarantine countries in recent weeks.The transport secretary has drawn criticism for the speed at which new restrictions are brought in, leaving holidaymakers little time to return in order to avoid having to quarantine. Airlines, airports and travel companies have said he’s killing demand in their industry and have called for a program of virus testing at airports to replace quarantine rules.But Shapps told the BBC on Friday that airport testing isn’t a “silver bullet” because it won’t catch many asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, and defended the speed with which the government has been forced to act when reviewing infection data from other countries.“You have to act once these things happen, because we’ve worked very hard to get to a situation of having reasonably low levels at home,” he said. He warned British holidaymakers “to go away with your eyes open” given they may be required to self-isolate on their return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-steps-up-quarantine-enforcement-with-4-200-police-referrals/story-vIYziDqHn6RPWTB3jONy8I.html

28-08-2020||World||Abenomics, stable rule and defence spending: A look at Shinzo Abe’s 3-decade career||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday stepped down from his duties after a record-breaking tenure over health problems.Abe, who is the country’s longest-serving Prime Minister, has been battling with a chronic disease, ulcerative colitis, for many years. He had stepped down from office in 2007 over the issue after he became Japan’s youngest serving Prime Minister at the age of 52 in 2006 since the Second World War. Also read: Japanese PM Abe resigns over worsening healthAmid the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis and a chain of scandals, which included the arrest of former justice minister Katsuyuki Kawai, the public support for Abe has been fading in recent months.Here’s a look at Abe efforts to follow the roadwork his family laid for Japan:* Shinzo Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993 after his father’s death and gained national recognition as he adopted a tough approach towards the doubtful neighbour North Korea as the two nations were engaged in a fight over the kidnapping of Japanese citizens by Pyongyang decades ago.* After becoming the Prime Minister in 2006, he brought in several steps to balance the country’s budget. A year later, before his resignation, he proposed a bill to instil nationalism among the Japanese youth.* In 2007, he also initiated the Qualteral Security dialogue- an informal strategic forum between United States, India, Australia and Japan through summits, military drills and information exchanges.Also read: Yen jumps as Shinzo Abe’s resignation sparks political uncertainty* Five years after stepping down from the office due to health reasons, Shinzo Abe led his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which was ousted in 2009, back to victory in 2012 and was elected as the Prime Minister for a second time by Diet on December 26. From there on, he launched a three-pronged Abenomics strategy to beat persistent deflation and revive economic growth.* Under Abenomics, the first stage was easing of monetary policy to achieve a target of 2% inflation. The second stage was a fiscal policy which comprised providing financial assistance for small businesses, increased defence spending and a reduction in foreign aid. The third and the final stage was structural reforms which included measures such as establishing de-regulated economic zones, facilitating the digital sale of drugs and many more.* Abe boosted defence expenditure and reached out to other nations in Asia to combat China’s growing influence. He persuaded for laws to be formed that allowed Japan to exercise the right of “collective self-defence”.* Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee decided to postpone the 2020 Olympics to next year. However, Abe persuaded that the event should not take place until and unless the situation is contained and athletes and audience can safely be a part of it.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abenomics-stable-rule-and-defence-spending-a-look-at-shinzo-abe-s-3-decade-career/story-DoheeOrtf06DJVTSd9vgHK.html
28-08-2020||World||Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving PM, quits||Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving premier, said on Friday he was resigning because of poor health, ending a stint at the helm of the world’s third-biggest economy during which he sought to revive growth and bolster its defences.“I cannot be prime minister if I cannot make the best decisions for the people. I have decided to step down from my post,” Abe, 65, told a news conference.Abe has battled the disease ulcerative colitis for years and two recent hospital visits within a week had fanned questions on whether he could stay in the job until the end of his term as ruling party leader, and hence, premier, in September 2021.ALSO WATCH | Japan’s longest-serving Premier Shinzo Abe resigns over health issues As news of the resignation spread, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei average fell 2.12% to 22,717.02, while the broader Topix shed 1.00% to 1,599.70. The selling wiped $4.7 billion off Tokyo’s $5.7 trillion stock market value, which had more than doubled during Abe’s tenure.The resignation will trigger a leadership race in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - most likely in two or three weeks - and the winner must be formally elected in parliament. The new party leader will hold the post for the rest of Abe’s term.Whoever wins the party poll is likely to keep Abe’s reflationary “Abenomics” policies as Japan struggles with the impact of the novel coronavirus, but may have trouble emulating the political longevity that may be Abe’s biggest legacy.“The broad picture remains in tact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,” said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments.“Longevity will be a struggle.”On Monday, Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.Also read: How possible successors stack up if Japanese PM Shinzo Abe resigns“As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,” said brokerage employee Naohito Kojima, 55.“There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it’s questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe. He did various diplomatic negotiations and I think the pros outweighed the cons.”Abe’s resignation also comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China and ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.FALLING SUPPORTThe conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his “Abenomics” mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan’s defences and aimed to revise the pacifist constitution.Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere, but Abe had drawn fire for a clumsy early response and what critics see as a lack of leadership as infections spread.In the second quarter, Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record as the pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to avert a deeper recession.Abe kept his promises to strengthen defences, boosting spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad.In a historic shift in 2014, his government re-interpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence or defending a friendly country under attack.But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over a U.S-Japan security pact.Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shinzo-abe-resigns-as-japan-s-prime-minister/story-FjY1dpvamrujzjaO5cPHSK.html
28-08-2020||World||New Zealand PM takes mask making into her own hands ahead of Covid measure||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday she was making her own face covering to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, raising the profile of a public health measure which will become mandatory across the country next week.The Pacific nation of 5 million people had seemed to stop community transmission of Covid-19 due to tough lockdown measures but reintroduced restrictions in its largest city, Auckland, this month following a fresh outbreak.With restrictions to scale back on Sunday, Ardern said in a Facebook post she was taking matters into her own hands before masks become compulsory on public transport across the country the following day.At a meeting with local community health leader Dave Letele, “one of the things we talked about was face coverings, and how to make your own at home,” Ardern, who faces a general election in October, wrote in the post.“I had a go at making one,” she added, alongside a photo of a patch of fabric, scissors and two elastic hair ties.A follow-up video showed her crafting a simple red mask, the colour of her Labour Party.“That’s my first time crafting,” she said. “I’m going to pull out my glitter gun later.”About 150 people have been diagnosed as part of the cluster that originated in Auckland, which is home to 1.7 million people, but daily new case numbers have slowed to single digits this week.On Friday, New Zealand reported five new cases in Auckland and seven more in quarantine after arriving from overseas.The country has so far recorded just under 1,400 Covid-19 cases, including 22 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-takes-mask-making-into-her-own-hands-ahead-of-covid-measure/story-fcKZWOlPPjz2TJFTA5EclJ.html
28-08-2020||World||How possible successors stack up if Japanese PM Shinzo Abe resigns||Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was set to resign, national broadcaster NHK said on Friday, saying he wasnted to avert problems for the government from a worsening health condition. Abe has battled the chronic disease ulcerative colitis for years. If Abe resigned, he would probably stay on until formally replaced, which requires the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to pick a new leader to be formally elected in parliament.Here are details of some likely contenders to take the helm of the world’s third-largest economy. TARO ASOFinance minister Aso, 79, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, has been a core member of Abe’s administration. Without a clear consensus on who should succeed Abe, LDP lawmakers could elect Aso as a temporary leader if Abe resigns.In 2008, Aso was elected LDP leader and hence, premier, in hopes that he could revive the long-dominant party’s fortunes. Instead, the LDP was ousted in a historic election defeat in 2009, languishing in the opposition for the next three years.The grandson of a former premier, Aso mixes policy experience with a fondness for manga comics and a tendency towards gaffes.SHIGERU ISHIBAA hawkish former defence minister and rare LDP critic of Abe, Ishiba, 63, regularly tops surveys of lawmakers whom voters want to see as the next premier, but is less popular with the party’s lawmakers.The soft-spoken security maven has also held portfolios for agriculture and reviving local economies.He defeated Abe in the first round of a party presidential election in 2012, thanks to strong grassroots support, but lost in the second round when only MPs could vote. Then, in a 2018 party leadership poll, Ishiba lost heavily to Abe.He has criticised the Bank of Japan’s ultra-low interest rates for hurting regional banks and called for higher public works spending to remedy growing inequality.FUMIO KISHIDAKishida, 63, served as foreign minister under Abe from 2012 to 2017, but diplomacy remained mainly in the prime minister’s grip. The low-key lawmaker from Hiroshima has been widely seen as Abe’s preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys.Kishida hails from one of the party’s more dovish factions and is seen as less keen on revising the post-war constitution’s pacifist Article 9 than Abe, for whom it is a cherished goal.The BOJ’s hyper-easy monetary policy “cannot go on forever,” Kishida has said.TARO KONODefence Minister Taro Kono, 56, has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history.Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he previously served as foreign minister and minister for administrative reform.He has differentiated his conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to “comfort women”, a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan’s wartime military brothels.YOSHIHIDE SUGASuga, 71, a self-made politician and loyal lieutenant since Abe’s troubled term as premier in 2006 and 2007, was among a band of allies who pushed Abe to run again for the top post in 2012.Back in office, Abe tapped Suga as chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the new imperial era name, “Reiwa”, for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of the new emperor.Suga’s clout was dented somewhat by scandals that toppled two cabinet ministers close to him last October.SHINJIRO KOIZUMIThe name of Koizumi, 39, now environment minister and the son of charismatic former premier Junichiro Koizumi, is often floated as a future premier, but many consider him too young.He shares some of Abe’s conservative views and has paid his respects at Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead.Koizumi has projected a reforming image on the basis of efforts to cut Japan’s backing for coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, but has typically taken care not to offend party elders.KATSUNOBU KATO, YASUTOSHI NISHIMURAAs health minister, Kato, 64, was in the limelight in the early days of Japan’s coronavirus outbreak but then Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, 57, a former trade official, emerged as point person on virus policy.In 2015, Kato, a father of four, was handed the portfolio for boosting Japan’s rock-bottom birth rate, a task that met little success. He is a former official of the finance ministry.SEIKO NODANoda, 59, has made no secret of her desire to become Japan’s first female premier. An Abe critic, the former internal affairs minister, who also held the portfolio for women’s empowerment, fell short of backing to join the race for party leader in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-possible-successors-stack-up-if-japanese-pm-shinzo-abe-resigns/story-ldVdlC0u1Sh2DpKjOOF4kL.html
28-08-2020||World||Trump accepts nomination, calls Biden ‘destroyer of American greatness’||US President Donald Trump on Thursday accepted the Republican party nomination to run for a second term with an expansive criticism of Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger, who, he said, “will be the destroyer of American Greatness” rather than the “savior of America’s soul” he is touting to be.Trump sought to portray Biden as weak on China, immigration, foreign policy and a “Trojan horse” for the radical left wing of the Democratic party that, he argued, reprising a central theme from the Republican party’s case against the former vice-president, will drive the country to utter lawlessness and chaos.The President defended his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was the central criticism of his presidency at the Democratic party’s convention the week before to nominate Biden and Kamala Harris, a historic pick as the first Indian American and Black woman to run for vice-president.Trump framed the November 3 elections as a choice between “two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas” and portrayed the second — Biden’s — as dark and dystopian, as argued by speaker after speaker at the convention, citing the anti-racism protests.Republicans have sought to blunt the Democrats’ criticism of the Trump administration’s widely acknowledged mishandling of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected close to 6 million Americans and killed close to 180,000, by stoking fears of lawlessness citing the protests.“This election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,” Trump said in the speech, at a political event held for the first time on the premises of the White House, which as the “people’s house”, is neutral ground.“Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism,” Trump said, echoing a characterisation of Biden that was first used by vice-president Mike Pence in his acceptance speech Wednesday. The insinuation is that Biden, who has been a lifelong moderate with an ability to reach across the aisle, will be under the influence of the Democratic party’s progressive wing led by Bernie Sanders, an independent senator, and young members of congress such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Ilhan Omar.“If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up for you?”The president spoke for over 70 minutes, covering the entire range of the Republican party’s case against not only Biden but Democratic candidates down the ballot. At stake is not only the White House, but the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-led senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-accepts-nomination-calls-biden-destroyer-of-american-greatness/story-5j4PvkKIbYhA7lhxIAmtaM.html

The Liberal Democratic Party spokesman did not answer the phone.Also read: At India-Japan Summit next month, Modi and Abe to sign off on key military pactConcerns about Abe’s chronic health issues, simmering since earlier this summer, intensified this month when he visited a Tokyo hospital two weeks in a row for unspecified health checkups.Also Watch | Amid China tension, India & Japan talk business as Delhi seeks investmentsAbe, whose term ends in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by the parliament.He had abruptly resigned from his first stint in office in 2007 due to his health, which was fueling concerns about his recent condition.Abe on Monday became Japan’s longest serving prime minister by consecutive days in office, eclipsing the record of Eisaku Sato, his great-uncle, who served 2,798 days from 1964 to 1972.But his second hospital visit on Monday eclipsed festivity for his record and has accelerated speculation and political maneuvering toward a post-Abe regime.Abe has acknowledged having ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager and has said the condition was controlled with treatment. He has not made clear if it is related to his recent health issues or hospital visits.After his recent hospital visits were reported, top officials from Abe’s Cabinet and the ruling party said Abe was overworked and badly needed rest.Also read: Japan PM Shinzo Abe may call off India trip amid protests in Assam over citizenship law: ReportHis health concerns added to speculation that Abe’s days in office are numbered, when his support ratings are already at their lowest levels due to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its severe impact on the economy, on top of a slew of political scandals.Shigeru Ishiba, a 63-year-old hawkish former defence minister and Abe’s archrival, is a favorite next leader in media surveys, though he is less popular within the ruling party.A low-key former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, Defence Minister Taro Kono, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalisation minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely speculated in Japanese media as his potential successors.The end of his scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of “revolving door” politics that lacked stability and long-term policies.When he returned to office in 2012, Abe vowed to revitalise the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his “Abenomics” formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-to-resign-over-his-health-reports/story-Fv6jZTJ8qt1CXD9PsaoGIM.html
28-08-2020||World||National Guard deployed to Wisconsin city as racism protests continue||About 150 National Guard troops deployed to Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Thursday, part of a massive effort to ensure a second night of calm after demonstrations over the police shooting of a Black man that led to the deaths of two people earlier this week.Evening fell in the community on Lake Michigan with tensions rising after police on Thursday afternoon arrested some activists protesting the shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake, who was paralyzed after a white officer shot him seven times in the back.“We’re here to preserve public safety and keeping the peace,” said Major General Knapp of the Wisconsin National Guard. “That is the bottom line.”     The shooting of Blake Sunday night reignited protests in several US cities over the police killings of Black men. The death in May of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck sparked demonstrations across the globe.Right-wing counter-protesters, at times armed, have also come out in Kenosha and elsewhere, claiming they are keeping the peace and trying to stop looting and rioting. In violent clashes in Kenosha on Tuesday, a 17-year-old armed with a long gun killed two anti-racism protesters and wounded a third.The teen, Kyle Rittenhouse of Antioch, Illinois, was charged Thursday with two counts of homicide as well as attempted homicide and recklessly endangering the lives of others.    “I would like to dis-invite those people running around with long guns for no apparent reason,” Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, said Thursday. “Stay home. Let people here protest peacefully.”     Officials said on Thursday that Arizona, Alabama and Michigan would be sending National Guard troops to augment security forces in the city, which until Wednesday night had been the scene of clashes between protesters and police, as well as protesters and members of a mostly white armed militia.As night fell, protests had begun, with added tension over reports that some protesters had been taken into custody during the day. A Reuters witness saw about a dozen law enforcement vehicles surround a van carrying some of the leaders of prior protests, taking the driver into custody.    “We’re all headed over to the jail to find out why,” said Clyde McLemore, president of the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. “We always do peaceful marches and that’s what we intend for tonight.”McLemore and others are calling for criminal charges to be filed against Rusten Sheskey, the officer who fired seven shots point-blank into Blake’s back. Wisconsin state police said Blake’s encounter with local officers began after a woman called for help, saying that her boyfriend was not supposed to be on the premises. Wisconsin’s attorney general, Josh Kaul, said a knife was found on the floor of Blake’s car.Sheskey was suspended for one day in 2017 for a driving-related infraction, but records disclosed so far do not indicate any pattern of excessive force.. Shockwaves from the events in Kenosha were felt across the United States as professional athletes, starting with National Basketball Association players, went on strike and anti-racism protests intensified in other cities. Republican President Donald Trump criticized the boycotts on Thursday, saying the NBA had become “like a political organization.”Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, who is running with former Vice President Joe Biden to unseat Trump in the Nov. 3 election, on Thursday praised the NBA players and addressed the shooting of Blake. “It’s sickening to watch. It’s all too familiar. And it must end,” Harris said in a speech. At a news conference on Thursday, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson blamed Trump for creating a culture in which police were encouraged to use excessive force.Players on strikeThe strike by NBA players, led by the Milwaukee Bucks, triggered a wave of similar boycotts across various professional sports on Wednesday. NBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said games could resume on Friday or Saturday, after players agreed not to boycott the rest of the season.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of the lawyers representing Blake’s family, disputed the attorney general’s report that Blake had a knife and said he posed no threat.They also referred to video footage that showed Rittenhouse, the white gunman who had just fired on protesters, walking past a battery of police without being arrested, saying it showed the stark contrast between how the police treated Blake and self-described militia members bearing firearms.The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday called for the resignations of Sheriff David Beth, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian, arguing they had mishandled the response to Blake’s shooting and resulting unrest.Beth, who in 2018 apologized for saying that five people of color who had been arrested for shoplifting “just need to disappear,” did not respond to a request for comment. Miskinis and Antaramian also did not reply to emails seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-guard-deployed-to-wisconsin-city-as-racism-protests-continue/story-tX2SuusDzN8hoLT2KYIekO.html
28-08-2020||World||China’s missiles warn United States aircraft carriers to stay away||China’s latest volley of missile launches into the world’s most hotly contested body of water served as a warning to two key US targets: aircraft carriers and regional bases.The missiles launched into the South China Sea on Wednesday included the DF-21D and DF-26B, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a person close to the People’s Liberation Army. Those weapons are central to China’s strategy of deterring any military action off its eastern coast by threatening to destroy the major sources of US power projection in the region.“China is signaling to the US, its allies and partners that China has an answer to America’s aircraft-carrier strike groups, an answer that is always available and not dependent on deployment schedules,” said Carl Schuster, an adjunct faculty member of Hawaii Pacific University’s diplomacy and military science program and a former operations director at US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. “In effect, China is saying, ‘If the US puts two carriers in the South China Sea, we send aircraft carrier-killer missiles there.’”The launches show the US the growing cost of any armed conflict, with a high-profile reminder of China’s increasing arsenal of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. President Xi Jinping rolled out the new PLA Rocket Force as part of a massive military parade in October, showcasing a capability that is challenging American military superiority in Asia for the first time since World War II. Researchers at the University of Sydney warned last year that Chinese missiles could wipe out US bases in the “opening hours” of any conflict.A US defense official who asked not to be identified told Bloomberg News that China fired four medium-range ballistic missiles during a series of military exercises this week. They landed in the sea between China’s southern Hainan Island and the disputed Paracel chain near Vietnam, the official said, not far from where US carriers conducted drills in recent weeks to back up the Trump administration’s decision to challenge Beijing’s sovereignty claims.“Conducting military exercises over disputed territory in the South China Sea is counterproductive to easing tensions and maintaining stability,” the Pentagon said in a statement Thursday. China’s “actions, including missile tests, further destabilize the situation in the South China Sea.”The Chinese Defense Ministry reiterated its contention that the exercises weren’t directed at any one nation Thursday, without mentioning the missile launch. Still, ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Wu Qian accused “some US politicians” of trying to provoke a conflict between the two nations, telling a briefing in Beijing that China was “not afraid.”On Thursday, China’s military issued a statement saying it expelled a US Navy guided-missile destroyer that “trespassed” into waters near the Paracel Islands, calling the ship’s move “provocative.”On Thursday, China’s military issued a statement saying it expelled a US Navy guided-missile destroyer that “trespassed” into waters near the Paracel Islands. “We urge the US to stop this kind of provocative acts, to strictly manage maritime and air military operations and strictly restrain its frontline troops, so as to avoid accidents,” said Li Huamin, a spokesperson for the Chinese army’s Southern Theater Command.The missile tests appeared intended for US consumption, rather than a domestic audience, with coverage on the country’s heavily censored internet largely limited to foreign media reports. Earlier this week, China protested an American U-2 spy plane’s flight near the exercise zone in the East China Sea, presumably to glean intelligence about the country’s capabilities.“The aim is to test the capability of the troops,” said Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, who stopped short of confirming the missile test. “You could say it is sending a warning to the US, as the US has increased its military activities in the South China Sea.”While the two nuclear-armed powers have many incentives to avoid a clash, the risk of escalation is growing as the US and its allies seek to push back against a more assertive Beijing. The US has in recent weeks carried out a series military exercises around the region and approved a landmark fighter jet sale to Taiwan -- against the backdrop of a national election President Donald Trump has attempted to focus on China.The US Navy’s recent exercises in the South China Sea have included joint operations by the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike groups last month and separate drills by the Reagan this month. Those moves followed Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s July 13 announcement clarifying US legal opposition to Chinese claims over most of a vital shipping lane, parts of which are also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.The real risk is a US-China conflict over Taiwan escalating to nuclear war, in part because the DF-26 can be armed with both nuclear and conventional warheads, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.“If the US were to see DF-26 missiles mobilizing to strike US aircraft carriers, the president would have to order strikes against missile bases throughout all of China, not just coastal areas,” Lewis said. “The United States would likely be striking China’s nuclear forces. It would be very hard to keep such a conflict limited.”China launched at least one other DF-26 missile in recent weeks, in what the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper characterized as a response to the US carrier operations. The paper had earlier touted its “carrier-killer” missiles on Twitter -- drawing a terse rebuttal from the US Navy, which noted that the warships were nonetheless “still there.”Although China has yet to prove the ability to sink a moving warship, the cost of losing a $10 billion aircraft carrier, the troops and hardware on board -- and all the American military prestige they represent -- would be immeasurable. That threat is causing Pentagon planners to consider less conspicuous ways of projecting force, with an internal Defense Department study recommending reducing the country’s carrier fleet to nine from 11 now, Defense News reported in April.The PLA’s missile arsenal is among the many factors driving the US’s shifting security posture in Asia, with the Pentagon cycling B-1 bombers to and from Guam, where they’re more vulnerable to attack. Concern about the threat also contributed to the US’s decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and seek three-way arms talks with China.Even before this week’s launches, China had quietly ramped up tests of ballistic missiles, in an apparent attempt to gauge their operational capabilities. The country fired off in excess of 100 ballistic missiles last year, more than three times North Korea’s record tally, Kyodo News reported in February, citing people familiar with the matter.China possesses what former Pacific Commander Harry Harris has called “the largest and most diverse missile force in the world,” with scores of different weapons in development. The DF-21D can travel more than 1,500 kilometers (900 miles), while the DF-26 can deliver warheads an estimated 4,000 kilometers, far enough to reach Guam.There are “real questions” about whether China’s carrier-killers actually work, said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The latest tests may provide the US a chance to better understand their performance.“The People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force has a busy testing schedule and this was likely operational training,” Panda said. “But certainly it’ll be a reminder to folks in Washington that China’s military continues to modernize and can deny access to the US Navy in parts of the Asia-Pacific.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-missiles-warn-united-states-aircraft-carriers-to-stay-away/story-hr1v8S1CCiKJ1IOhpdxFVN.html
28-08-2020||World||Joe Biden will be destroyer of American greatness: Donald Trump||Seeking another four years in the White House, US President Donald Trump has slammed Democratic rival Joe Biden’s record as a “shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals” and said his victory will endanger the nation and destroy the American greatness.Speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, Trump, 74, said that no one will be safe under a Biden administration.Launching a blistering attack on his November challenger, Trump said: “Joe Biden is not the saviour of America’s soul.” “He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness.” “Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history,” Trump said in his acceptance speech after the Republican Party re-nominated him as its presidential candidate.Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are being challenged by Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris in the November 3 election.“Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs,” Trump alleged.During the 2016 campaign, Trump had pledged to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump later replaced it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump said that despite all of the American greatness as a nation, everything that the US has achieved is now endangered.“This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas,” he said.“This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades,” he said.Trump told Americans that their vote will decide whether they protect law-abiding Americans, or whether they give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten the citizens.“And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it,” he said.Referring to the last week’s Democrat National Convention, Trump said that Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice.“So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?” he asked.“In the left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,” he said. Trump alleged that for 47 years, Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain – and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.“Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars,” he alleged.“Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defence,” he said.Trump alleged that as vice president Biden supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry.“He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing (Qasem) Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as “a positive development” for America and the world. That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win,” he said.“China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused,” Trump said.He called Biden a Trojan horse for socialism. “Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” he said, referring to violent protests there.On November 3, he urged his countrymen to send the Democrats led by Biden a thundering message they will never forget! “Joe Biden is weak”.“He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-will-be-destroyer-of-american-greatness-donald-trump/story-rsqio1DotvSPrFx03NCAZM.html
28-08-2020||World||Singapore battles record dengue outbreak with more mosquitoes||From the high balcony of a Singapore public housing block, an environment official steadies his mosquito launcher, the latest contraption authorities have devised to combat a record outbreak of the tropical disease dengue.With the click of a button and a whirr of a fan, a hatch opens and 150 lab-reared male mosquitoes are sent flying, off in search of a female companion with whom they can mate but not reproduce.The dengue virus, which in rare cases can be fatal, is carried and spread to humans by infected mosquitoes.But Singapore’s specially bred mosquitoes carry a bacteria that prevents eggs from hatching, and “compete with the wild type,” leading to “a gradual reduction of the mosquito population,” said Ng Lee Ching, the official heading the Wolbachia project, named after the bacteria.Some areas with high mosquito populations have seen up to 90% declines using this technique, she added.Singapore - a tiny Southeast Asian island nation of 5.7 million people - has recorded more than 26,000 dengue cases this year, surpassing the previous annual record of around 22,000 in 2013 with four months still remaining.Twenty people have died of the disease this year, which can cause extreme fever that leads to internal bleeding and shock. By comparison, only 27 people have died of the coronavirus in the city-state out of more than 56,000 infections.A new strain of the disease, combined with unseasonably wet weather and coronavirus lockdowns that left construction sites and other mosquito breeding grounds undisturbed, are all seen as factors behind the dengue outbreak.That has put the onus on traditional deterrents like fogging, fining people for flouting anti-mosquito regulations like leaving plant pots full of stagnant water, and deploying novel techniques such as the Wolbachia project.In government laboratories, scientists breed the bacteria-carrying mosquitoes in rows of pallets - separating the male pupae for release in the worst-hit dengue areas. Wolbachia mosquitoes can’t transmit diseases such as dengue, and only female mosquitoes bite humans. When male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with females that don’t carry the bacteria, none of the resultant eggs will hatch. The strategy has been successful in Australia but some experts say it might have its limits in dense urban areas such as Singapore. “You’ve got to flood the island with these mosquitoes, and people get annoyed,” said Paul Tambyah, senior consultant at Singapore’s National University Hospital.“They’re not going to grab the mosquito and examine and see whether it’s a male or female. They’re going to swipe them away, and that kind of defeats the purpose,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-battles-record-dengue-outbreak-with-more-mosquitoes/story-r0OuSVw6jLxLfb9iSnQdcM.html
28-08-2020||World||California, Florida, New York, Texas will not follow new US Covid-19 testing plan||Several large US states are not heeding new federal health officials’ calls to reduce Covid-19 testing of some exposed to the virus, joining a broad rebuke of the Trump administration by public health leaders.Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and New York all plan to continue to test asymptomatic people who have been exposed to Covid-19, despite new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggesting that such tests may not be needed. “The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,” a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services in a statement. “There’s not a planned change at this point.”California and New York made similar statements. The Florida Department of Health said asymptomatic testing was continuing while the new CDC recommendations were evaluated, and Texas also said it would evaluate. The CDC said this week that people exposed to Covid-19 but not symptomatic may not need to be tested, shocking doctors and politicians and prompting accusations the guidance was politically motivated.Even before the CDC guidance, coronavirus testing in the United States had dropped. The United States tested on average 675,000 people a day last week, down from a peak in late July of over 800,000 people a day.Nationally, cases have fallen for five weeks in a row but infections are surging again in the U.S. Midwest with four states reporting record one-day increases in cases on Thursday as the U.S. death toll climbed above 180,000. The CDC had previously recommended testing of all people who had close contact with someone who was diagnosed with Covid-19. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state of New York would not be abiding by the new guidance and challenged the assertion that politics played no role in the change.“This 180-degree reversal of Covid-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the (CDC’s) reputation,” Cuomo said in a joint statement, along with the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut, who also said their states would not be following the CDC’s guidance. Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said there was no political pressure from the administration. He said that testing asymptomatic patients too early could produce false negatives and contribute to the virus’s spread. CNN and The New York Times reported on Wednesday that U.S. public health officials were ordered by high-level members of the Trump administration to push forward with the changes. CDC Director Robert Redfield issued a statement on Thursday that “everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,” but “everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.”Globally, many nations advocate early testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that resources permitting, people exposed to the novel coronavirus should be tested even if they do not show immediate symptoms of infection.European governments have used broad testing and isolation to control the virus. France, for instance, recommends that anyone who thinks they need a test should get one and in Germany, people with close contact of 15 minutes or more with a person with Covid-19 are advised to have a test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-florida-new-york-texas-will-not-follow-new-us-covid-19-testing-plan/story-1hWa1cYDqYLqKj5xSZJwTL.html
28-08-2020||World||Bill Gates’ nuclear venture plans reactor to complement solar, wind power boom||A nuclear energy venture founded by Bill Gates said Thursday it hopes to build small advanced nuclear power stations that can store electricity to supplement grids increasingly supplied by intermittent sources like solar and wind power.The effort is part of the billionaire philanthropist’s push to help fight climate change, and is targeted at helping utilities slash their emissions of planet-warming gases without undermining grid reliability.TerraPower LLC, which Gates founded 14 years ago, and its partner GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, plan to commercialize stations called Natrium in the United States later this decade, TerraPower’s President and Chief Executive Chris Levesque said.The project has not previously been reported.Levesque said the companies are seeking additional funding from private partners and the U.S. Energy Department, and that the project has the support of PacifiCorp, owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, along with Energy Northwest and Duke Energy.If successful, the plan is to build the plants in the United States and abroad, Levesque said. By 2050 “we would see hundreds of these reactors around the world, solving multiple different energy needs,” Levesque said. The 345-megawatt plants would be cooled by liquid sodium and cost about $1 billion (760 million pounds) each. Nuclear power is a top source of virtually emissions-free electricity, but many plants are shutting in the United States because of high costs and competition from solar and wind. Critics of advanced nuclear have also warned that smaller nuclear is even more expensive than conventional. The new plants, however, are designed to complement a renewable power because they will store the reactor power in tanks of molten salt during days when the grid is well supplied. The nuclear power could be used later when solar and wind power are low due to weather conditions.Molten salt power storage has been used at thermal solar plants in the past, but leaks have plagued some of the projects. Levesque said the Natrium design would provide more consistent temperatures than a solar plant, resulting in less wear and tear. Gates, chairman of TerraPower’s board, said in a statement that Natrium innovation was “extremely difficult” but its team had “the expertise, commercial experience, and the resources necessary” to develop viable reactors.Levesque said Natrium plants would first be built in the United States and other developed countries, but could later spread to countries that do not have yet have nuclear power. Nonproliferation experts have warned that advanced nuclear projects could become targets for attack because their uranium fuel would be more highly enriched and more easily converted to fissile material than conventional fuel. Levesque said the plants would reduce proliferation risks because they reduce overall nuclear waste. Gates had initially hoped to build an experimental nuclear plant near Beijing with state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. But last year, TerraPower was forced to seek new partners after the Trump administration restricted nuclear deals with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-nuclear-venture-plans-reactor-to-complement-solar-wind-power-boom/story-fwjwmnZXq43UebVUNEoDKK.html
28-08-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi, White House call on Covid-19 aid ends without a breakthrough||A telephone call on coronavirus economic relief between US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and an adviser to President Donald Trump ended on Thursday with no breakthrough, and Pelosi said talks would not resume until the Trump administration agreed to $2.2 trillion in aid.Pelosi and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows spoke by phone for about 25 minutes, the first chance in weeks to resume stalled Covid-19 aid negotiations. But the two sides soon appeared to be as far apart as ever. “This conversation made clear that the White House continues to disregard the needs of the American people as the coronavirus crisis devastates lives and livelihoods,” Pelosi said in a statement following her conversation with Meadows. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We’re willing to come down - meet them in the middle - that would be $2.2 trillion, and when they’re ready to do that we’ll be ready to discuss and negotiate the particulars,” the top Democrat in Congress told reporters.“But we can’t go any less because we have to meet the needs of the American people. We will not shortchange them, we will not nickel and dime them.”Asked in an interview on Fox News about the talks, Meadows said he sought funding for enhanced unemployment benefits, help for small businesses and money for schools and daycare. “What did we get from her is 25 minutes of nothing,” he said.Meadows and Pelosi are two of the four negotiators who were involved in talks on legislation to help Americans and businesses suffering from a coronavirus pandemic that has now killed nearly 180,000 people. The others are Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The talks broke down on Aug. 7, with the sides far apart on major issues including the size of unemployment benefits for tens of millions of people made jobless by the pandemic, aid for state and local governments and funding for schools and food support programs. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in May passed a $3.4 trillion coronavirus relief bill, but Pelosi offered to reduce that sum by $1 trillion. The White House, which had proposed $1 trillion in aid, rejected the offer. Democrats have since demanded that the White House agree to “meet in the middle.” The Pelosi-Meadows phone call came hours before Trump was due to accept his party’s nomination on Thursday evening for a second term. Some Democrats have said they did not expect the White House to resume negotiations in earnest until after this week’s Republican National Convention. On Wednesday, Meadows said in an interview with Politico that he was not optimistic negotiations would resume soon.US airlines have warned that massive layoffs will be coming without further aid during the pandemic.They are hoping a fresh stimulus bill will extend for six months $25 billion in payroll aid that expires on Sept. 30 under legislation approved earlier this year.The head of the union representing American Airlines pilots, who are facing 1,600 furloughs, sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging action to extend the package and prevent tens of thousands of layoffs on Oct 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-white-house-call-on-covid-19-aid-ends-without-a-breakthrough/story-TwF0QEyvBhkO6TpUOM64NM.html

They even stole my shoes,” said Hernandez, who now wears women’s sneakers that he was given.He was later separated from his wife and children, who were taken by volunteers to a Christian shelter in the state of Hidalgo, north of the capital.Millions of jobs lost The coronavirus has killed more than 60,000 people in Mexico and ravaged its economy, the second-largest in Latin America.More than a million formal jobs have been wiped out, according to the Mexican Institute of Social Security.The informal sector, which employs more than half of all workers, was hit even harder.Around 12 million Mexicans stopped working in April after quarantine measures were introduced, official figures showed, although the situation has since improved as the economy gradually reopens.The authorities estimated that 2.8 million people were out of work in June.Those with no safety net are in danger of falling into a new life for which they are unprepared.“These stories are very hard,” said Luis Enrique Hernandez, whose non-profit group El Caracol helps Mexico City’s homeless.People who are used to living on the street “learn to survive, but these people don’t,” he said.Gabriel Contreras eked out a living helping on street stalls until the virus arrived and he was thrown out of the cheap hotel where he was staying.“They told me that I couldn’t live there anymore, because I might bring the virus back from the street,” the 38-year-old said. Soaring poverty The economic crisis has taken a heavy toll on Mexico’s poor, whose numbers are rapidly swelling.The number of people living in poverty could climb to 62.2 million in 2020 -- almost half the population -- from 52.4 million in 2018, according to Mexico’s National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy.Across the region, the pandemic is expected to impoverish 45 million people, raising the total to 231 million, around 37 percent of the population, according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America.While Hernandez is still unemployed, Contreras recently began working at a pizzeria that hires homeless people.The two men sleep in a small room paid for by El Caracol in the working-class neighborhood of Nezahualcoyotl in the urban sprawl surrounding Mexico City.Their neighbors, 35-year-old Claudia Garcia and her husband Alberto, used to sell ice creams, but their merchandise was confiscated due to a lack of permits a few months ago.After the hostel where they were staying for 900 pesos (around $40) a week was closed because of the pandemic, they began living in a park, where someone tried to rape her.“It was very difficult because one day you’re sleeping in your bed and the next in the grass, in the street,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-deepens-mexico-s-homeless-crisis/story-0mqdSOr9pBrpaOHTCPTZ0J.html

Seoul has also mandated that masks to be worn in both indoor and outdoor public places, and has ordered places like churches, nightclubs, karaoke bars and other high-risk venues closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-stops-short-of-toughest-coronavirus-measures-despite-case-rise/story-BL61CoiDREIgsAym0zsnTP.html

We have definitions of contacts, and who contacts are of confirmed cases, and make recommendations that contacts, if feasible, should be tested regardless of the development of symptoms,” Van Kerkhove told a news briefing.“The focus, though, is on those that do develop symptoms.”Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies programme, said there was a rationale for testing asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people, in particular where clusters of infections were emerging, but that broad population testing was costly and unrealistic. “It absorbs huge amounts of resources,” Ryan said. “So we need to focus on testing the right individuals, we need to focus on maximizing the testing in the clusters, and we need to focus on the quality of the testing, and the speed of the turnaround.”WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said an international mission the agency is organising to travel to China to investigate the virus’s origin would go to Wuhan, where the first infections were detected late last year. Tedros added that an advance team that went to Beijing in July had been in touch with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/those-exposed-to-covid-19-but-without-symptoms-should-be-tested-who/story-exxNDIjNhk0i0ATEhjwR5K.html

The New Zealand government argues that Australia should take responsibility for them turning to crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-mosque-shooter-can-serve-life-term-in-homeland-australian-pm-morrison/story-tzd4nnJy1oRN00TPCBUVtK.html

But despite a trail of demolished buildings, entire neighbourhoods left in ruins and more than 875,000 people without power, a sense of relief prevailed that Laura was not the annihilating menace forecasters had feared.“It is clear that we did not sustain and suffer the absolute, catastrophic damage that we thought was likely,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said. “But we have sustained a tremendous amount of damage.”He called Laura the most powerful hurricane to strike Louisiana, meaning it surpassed even Katrina, which was a Category 3 storm when it hit in 2005.The hurricane’s top wind speed of 150 mph (241 kph) put it among the strongest systems on record in the US Not until 11 hours after landfall did Laura finally lose hurricane status as it plowed north and thrashed Arkansas, and even by Thursday evening, it remained a tropical storm with winds of 40 mph (65 kph).The storm came ashore in low-lying Louisiana and clobbered Lake Charles, an industrial and casino city of 80,000 people. On Broad Street, many buildings had partially collapsed, and those that didn’t were missing chunks. Windows were blown out, awnings ripped away and trees split in half in eerily misshapen ways. Police spotted a floating casino that came unmoored and hit a bridge. At the local airport, planes were overturned, some on top of each other.In front of the courthouse was a Confederate statue that local officials had voted to keep in place just days earlier. After Laura, it was toppled.“It looks like 1,000 tornadoes went through here. It’s just destruction everywhere,” said Brett Geymann, who rode out the storm with three family members in Moss Bluff, near Lake Charles. He described Laura passing over his house with the roar of a jet engine around 2 a.m.“There are houses that are totally gone. They were there yesterday, but now gone,” he said.Not long after daybreak gave the first glimpse of the destruction, a massive plume of smoke visible for miles began rising from a chemical plant. Police said the leak was at a facility run by Biolab, which manufactures chemicals used in household cleaners such as Comet bleach scrub and chlorine powder for pools.Nearby residents were told to close their doors and windows and turn off air conditioners. State and federal aircraft headed into the skies over the coast to look for signs of any other industrial damage.The fatalities included a 14-year-old girl and a 68-year-old man who died when trees fell on their homes in Louisiana, as well as a 24-year-old man who died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator inside his residence. Another man drowned in a boat that sank during the storm, authorities said.No deaths had been confirmed in Texas, which Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said would amount to “a miracle.” Chevellce Dunn considered herself among the fortunate after a night spent huddling on a sofa with her son, daughter and four nieces and nephews as winds rocked their home in Orange, Texas. Left without power in sweltering heat, she didn’t know when power might be restored.“It ain’t going to be easy. As long as my kids are fine, I’m fine,” Dunn said.President Donald Trump planned to visit the Gulf Coast this weekend to tour the damage.More than 580,000 coastal residents evacuated under the shadow of a coronavirus pandemic and calls for masks and social distancing to combat its spread. It was the largest evacuation order since the pandemic began and many people followed it, filling hotels and sleeping in cars. Although not everyone fled from the coast, officials credited those who did leave for minimizing the loss of life.Forecasters had warned that the storm surge of 15 to 20 feet would be “unsurvivable” and could push 40 miles inland. Edwards said the storm surge wound up being measured in the range of 9 feet to 12 feet — still bad, but far from the worst forecast. He was hopeful that damaged homes could quickly be made habitable.The priority, Edwards said, was search and rescue, followed by efforts to find hotel or motel rooms for those unable to stay in their homes. Officials in Texas and Louisiana have both sought to avoid traditional mass shelters for evacuees over fears of spreading Covid-19, and Edwards was concerned that the storm would inhibit coronavirus testing as schools and universities are reopening.Bucky Millet, 78, of Lake Arthur, Louisiana, considered evacuating but decided to ride out the storm with family due to concerns about the coronavirus. He said a small tornado blew the cover off the bed of his pickup and made him think the roof on his house was next.“You’d hear a crack and a boom and everything shaking,” he said.The force of Laura’s winds blew out every window of the living room in the Lake Charles house where Bethany Agosto survived the storm with her sister and two others. They sought safety in a closet when the hurricane was at its worst.“It was like a jigsaw puzzle in this closet. We were on top of each other, just holding each other and crying,” Agosto said.The storm was so powerful that it could regain strength after turning east and reaching the Atlantic Ocean, potentially threatening the densely populated Northeast.Laura hit the US after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.It was the seventh named storm to strike the US this year, setting a new record for US landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.Laura was tied with five other storms for fifth most powerful US hurricane, behind the 1935’s Labor Day storm, 1969’s Camille, 1992’s Andrew and 2004’s Charley, Klotzbach said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-thrashes-louisiana-but-damage-is-less-than-predicted/story-3QISa3NcS1sW5dsCSHz6VK.html
28-08-2020||World||Court panel allows federal execution of Kansas girl’s killer||A panel of federal appeals court judges is letting the US government proceed with the planned execution of a man who kidnapped, raped and killed a 10-year-old Kansas girl.The three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Thursday evening acted to let the execution of Keith Dwayne Nelson go forward Friday afternoon as scheduled. The court acted less than 24 hours after a lower court judge had halted his execution, saying the law requires the government to get a prescription for the drug it plans to use.In an opinion early Thursday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan said a federal law that regulates drugs requires the government to get a prescription for the lethal injection drug pentobarbital, which it plans to use.But in a brief, unsigned order Thursday evening, the panel of three appeals court judges acted to let the execution go forward, saying “there are insufficient findings and conclusions that irreparable injury will result from the statutory violation found by the district court.” The panel included two judges appointed by President Barack Obama, Cornelia Pillard and Robert Wilkins, and Neomi Rao, who was appointed by President Donald Trump.Nelson attorney Dale Baich in an email to The Associated Press: “We are carefully reviewing the order and considering the options available to us.”Nelson’s execution is scheduled to be the fifth carried out this year by the federal government at the death chamber of the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. The executions followed the Trump administration’s announcement last year that it would resume executing death row inmates for the first time since 2003.Nelson was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to the 1999 kidnapping, rape and killing of Pamela Butler. The 10-year-old was rollerblading in front of her Kansas home when Nelson abducted her. He later raped her before strangling her to death with a wire.Chutkan’s 13-page opinion putting Nelson’s execution on hold came hours after the government carried out the execution of Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row, despite objections from many Navajo leaders. With Mitchell’s execution, the federal government has now carried out more executions in 2020 than it had in the previous 56 years combined. Two more executions are scheduled for September. All of the executions have been carried out using pentobarbital.Though the inmates who were put to death by the federal government have sought to halt their executions, challenging the drug’s use, among other things, the Supreme Court has sided with federal officials, in two cases reversing lower court orders keeping the government from carrying out scheduled executions.Chutkan, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said in her opinion that it is “undisputed that a prescription is required to dispense pentobarbital in the ordinary course.”“It is also undisputed,” she wrote, “that the government has not obtained a prescription — nor does it intend to — for the use of pentobarbital in Nelson’s execution.”But Chutkan said that under previous court decisions, when pentobarbital is being used for an execution it is still subject to the requirements in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act so a prescription is required.The government has argued that pentobarbital is not subject to the act when used for lethal injections.Pentobarbital depresses the central nervous system and, given in a high dosage, causes the heart to stop. It doesn’t have widespread medical uses, though is often used by veterinarians to anesthetize or euthanize animals.For three federal executions in the early 2000s, the government used different drugs, but pharmaceutical companies later refused to allow those drugs to be used in executions, forcing the federal and many state governments to seek an alternative. Attorney General William Barr last year approved reworked execution protocols that called for using pentobarbital alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-panel-allows-federal-execution-of-kansas-girl-s-killer/story-nMfubaklIEgKvQ7Xppo3KO.html
28-08-2020||World||Teenager in Wisconsin shootings charged with six criminal counts||Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager arrested and charged in the shootings in Wisconsin that led to the death of two people and injury of another, faces six criminal counts, according to a court document released on Thursday.The charges against Rittenhouse in Kenosha County include first degree intentional homicide in the death of Anthony Huber, who was carrying a skateboard when he was gunned down. A conviction on that charge alone carries a life sentence.Also read: Police shooting lays bare Wisconsin’s deep partisan divideRittenhouse, 17, is being held in Illinois where he lives. He has a court hearing on Friday for his requested extradition to Kenosha. The public defender assigned to his case in Lake County, Illinois has declined to comment.The charges were detailed in a criminal complaint released by Kenosha County’s clerk of courts. The document is the first detailed disclosure of the case against Rittenhouse for his role in the violence that erupted on Tuesday night when armed militia members clashed with protesters in the city.The protests started after Jacob Blake was shot multiple times in the back by a police officer on Sunday afternoon.Rittenhouse was also charged with causing the death of Joseph Rosenbaum, a 36-year-old demonstrator who he shot in the parking lot of a used car dealer just before midnight on Tuesday, according to the complaint, which draws on multiple cell phone videos and witness accounts.Also read: Police shooting of Black man stirs unrest in Wisconsin cityOne video records Rittenhouse saying “I just killed somebody” after shooting Rosenbaum, the complaint says.Rittenhouse was carrying a Smith & Wesson AR-15 style rifle and “was not handling the weapon very well,” one witness states in the complaint. “The recovered magazine for this rifle holds 30 rounds of ammunition,” the complaint says.The complaint says one video shows Huber, with a skateboard in his right hand, approaching Rittenhouse when he was on the ground. Huber appears then to try and grab the gun from Rittenhouse with his left hand before Rittenhouse fires.“Huber staggers away, taking several steps, then collapses to the ground. Huber subsequently died from this gunshot wound,” the complaint says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenager-in-wisconsin-shootings-charged-with-six-criminal-counts-complaint/story-zMAuMFjDn0LiK8s5nl9ElL.html
28-08-2020||World||Another UK honour for Indian-origin spy Noor Inayat Khan||Noor Inayat Khan, the Indian-origin British spy who worked as an undercover radio operator in Nazi-occupied France in 1943, was captured and killed in the Dachau concentration camp in 1944 at the age of 30, is to be honoured through another London landmark on Friday.The Bloomsbury home of Khan – 4, Taviton Street – will be marked prominently with a ‘blue plaque’ by English Heritage, a charity organisation that manages and cares for over 400 historic monuments, buildings and sites.Founded in 1866, the ‘blue plaques’ scheme celebrates links between notable figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked. Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross and the French Croix de Guerre, and in 2012 Princess Anne unveiled her bust in Gordon Square Gardens.Born in Moscow in 1914 to a Sufi teacher and an American mother, Khan was educated in London and Paris. She worked for the Special Operations Executive in Paris in 1943 during the Second World War.Khan evaded capture by the Nazis and continued to send messages to London for far longer than expected, but was betrayed, arrested and interrogated, but refused to give up secrets. She has been described as “one of the silent heroes of the Second World War”.The blue plaque will be unveiled on Friday by Khan’s biographer, journalist-writer Shrabani Basu, which will be webcast on Facebook at 7 pm UK time, English Heritage said.Basu, said: “When Noor Inayat Khan left this house on her last mission, she would never have dreamed that one day she would become a symbol of bravery. She was an unlikely spy. As a Sufi she believed in non-violence and religious harmony. Yet when her adopted country needed her, she unhesitatingly gave her life in the fight against fascism”.“It is fitting that Noor Inayat Khan is the first woman of Indian origin to be remembered with a Blue Plaque. As people walk by, Noor’s story will continue to inspire future generations. In today’s world, her vision of unity and freedom is more important than ever,” she added.Several Indians have been honoured through ‘blue plaques’ over the years on London houses and venues with which they were associated, including Rammohun Roy, Mahatma Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel and B R Ambedkar.Anna Eavis of English Heritage said: “We’re so pleased to be able to continue unveiling our 2020 blue plaques with this virtual ceremony after a very quiet few months. I am particularly delighted to start with Noor Inayat Khan, whose courage was unfaltering even in the face of such extreme danger.”According to a brief account of Khan’s work, on June 16, 1943, she was flown to France to serve as a wireless operator for the largest Resistance organisation in Paris. Soon after her arrival, the network collapsed and the Gestapo made multiple arrests.Khan chose to stay in order to keep communications open with her French comrades; she was by this time the only transmitting agent in Paris. By keeping on the move and changing her appearance, she was able to evade the Germans for three-and-a-half months while continuing to transmit messages.As Paris became increasingly dangerous, she prepared to leave for England in mid-October. She may well have succeeded had she not been betrayed on October 14 and taken with her transmitter to the Gestapo’s Paris headquarters.She escaped at least twice only to be recaptured and, after refusing to agree not to try again, became the first agent to be sent to Germany ‘for safe custody’. At Pforzheim Prison she was considered highly dangerous and kept in isolation with only short periods out of chains but despite beatings refused to cooperate.On September 11, 1944 she was sent with three other female agents on the 250-mile journey to the Dachau concentration camp. Evidence given at the War Crimes trial and by surviving prisoners revealed that Khan was singled out for a night of torture and then, like her comrades, was shot in the head.Some witnesses said that the women were still alive when they were cremated on the morning of September 13, 1944. Khan had revealed nothing to her captors, not even her real name, and her last word was said to have been ‘Liberté!’She was awarded the Croix de Guerre with Gold Star on January 16, 1946 and the George Cross on April 5, 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-uk-honour-for-indian-origin-spy-noor-inayat-khan/story-idy1Cn7HDm8ZQ5sQoUVbUO.html
28-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un says Typhoon Bavi caused little damage: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Typhoon Bavi had caused only minimal damage to the country after making landfall early on Thursday, state news media KCNA reported on Friday.Kim, who visited South Hwanghae province southwest of Pyongyang, had issued an alert to prevent crop damage and casualties from the typhoon, which made landfall near the capital, dumping heavy rains and uprooting trees.“He said that the scale of damage from Typhoon No. 8 is smaller than expected, adding that he had worried a lot and he feels it is fortunate to have that amount of damage,” said KCNA, referring to Kim’s remarks.North Korea, which has also been stepping up efforts to combat the novel coronavirus, had referred to Typhoon Bavi as the No. 8 storm.Kim’s visit came after the KCTV state television showed scenes of damage from the storm. Heavy rains earlier this month that caused flooding and damaged crops have raised concerns about food supplies in the isolated country.Kim praised party officials for taking measures to reduce casualties and minimize damage from the storm. The state news agency did not give further details on the scale of the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-says-typhoon-bavi-caused-little-damage-report/story-uzeJbliZa8ZWMgPfzzGwGM.html
28-08-2020||World||China’s missiles warn US aircraft carriers to stay away||China’s latest volley of missile launches into the world’s most hotly contested body of water served as a warning to two key US targets: aircraft carriers and regional bases.The missiles launched into the South China Sea on Wednesday included the DF-21D and DF-26B, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a person close to the People’s Liberation Army. Those weapons are central to China’s strategy of deterring any military action off its eastern coast by threatening to destroy the major sources of US power projection in the region.“China is signaling to the U.S., its allies and partners that China has an answer to America’s aircraft-carrier strike groups, an answer that is always available and not dependent on deployment schedules,” said Carl Schuster, an adjunct faculty member of Hawaii Pacific University’s diplomacy and military science program and a former operations director at US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. “In effect, China is saying, ‘If the U.S. puts two carriers in the South China Sea, we send aircraft carrier-killer missiles there.’”The launches show the US the growing cost of any armed conflict, with a high-profile reminder of China’s increasing arsenal of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. This is challenging American military superiority in Asia for the first time since World War II. President Xi Jinping rolled out the new PLA Rocket Force as part of a military parade in October, showcasing a capability that researchers at the University of Sydney warned could wipe out U.S. bases in the “opening hours of a conflict.”A US defense official who asked not to be identified told Bloomberg News that China fired four medium-range ballistic missiles during a series of military exercises this week. They landed in the sea between China’s southern Hainan Island and the disputed Paracel chain near Vietnam, the official said, not far from where US carriers conducted drills in recent weeks to back up the Trump administration’s decision to challenge Beijing’s sovereignty claims.The Chinese Defense Ministry reiterated its contention that the exercises weren’t directed at any one nation Thursday, without mentioning the missile launch. Still, ministry spokesman Senior Colonel Wu Qian accused “some U.S. politicians” of trying to provoke a conflict between the two nations, telling a briefing in Beijing that China was “not afraid.”The tests appeared intended for US consumption, rather than a domestic audience, with coverage on the country’s heavily censored internet largely limited to foreign media reports. Earlier this week, China protested an American U-2 spy plane’s flight near the exercise zone in the East China Sea, presumably to glean intelligence about the country’s capabilities.“The aim is to test the capability of the troops,” said Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, who stopped short of confirming the missile test. “You could say it is sending a warning to the U.S., as the U.S. has increased its military activities in the South China Sea.”While the two nuclear-armed powers have many incentives to avoid a clash, the risk of escalation is growing as the US and its allies seek to push back against a more assertive Beijing. The US has in recent weeks carried out a series military exercises around the region and approved a landmark fighter jet sale to Taiwan -- against the backdrop of a national election President Donald Trump has attempted to focus on China.The US Navy’s recent exercises in the South China Sea have included joint operations by the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike groups last month and separate drills by the Reagan this month. Those moves followed Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s July 13 announcement clarifying U.S. legal opposition to Chinese claims over most of a vital shipping lane, parts of which are also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.China launched at least one other DF-26 missile in recent weeks, in what the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper characterized as a response to the US. carrier operations. The paper had earlier touted its “carrier-killer” missiles on Twitter -- drawing a terse rebuttal from the US Navy, which noted that the warships were nonetheless “still there.”Although China has yet to prove the ability to sink a moving warship, the cost of losing a $10 billion aircraft carrier, the troops and hardware on board -- and all the American military prestige they represent -- would be immeasurable. That threat is causing Pentagon planners to consider less conspicuous ways of projecting force, with an internal Defense Department study recommending reducing the country’s carrier fleet to nine from 11 now, Defense News reported in April.The PLA’s missile arsenal is among the many factors driving the US’s shifting security posture in Asia, with the Pentagon cycling nuclear-capable B-1 bombers to and from Guam, where they’re more vulnerable to attack. Concern about the threat also contributed to the US’s decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia and seek three-way arms talks with China.Even before this week’s launches, China had quietly ramped up tests of ballistic missiles, in an apparent attempt to gauge their operational capabilities. The country fired off in excess of 100 ballistic missiles last year, more than three times North Korea’s record tally, Kyodo News reported in February, citing people familiar with the matter.China possesses what former Pacific Commander Harry Harris has called “the largest and most diverse missile force in the world,” with scores of different weapons in development. The DF-21D can travel more than 1,500 kilometers (900 miles), while the DF-26 can deliver warheads an estimated 4,000 kilometers, far enough to reach Guam.There are “real questions” about whether China’s carrier-killers actually work, said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The latest tests may provide the US a chance to better understand their performance.“The People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force has a busy testing schedule and this was likely operational training,” Panda said. “But certainly it’ll be a reminder to folks in Washington that China’s military continues to modernize and can deny access to the U.S. Navy in parts of the Asia-Pacific.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-missiles-warn-us-aircraft-carriers-to-stay-away/story-ZxpmQppvPeUpzrVcp17KsM.html
28-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Infected UK low-wage earners to be paid to stay home||Individuals infected by coronavirus who are employed or self-employed and unable to work from home are to be paid £130 (approx. Rs 13,000) for their 10-day period of self-isolation from September 1, the Boris Johnson government announced on Thursday.The opposition Labour criticised the amount, saying it is “nowhere near far enough”, while other critics alleged it is a “slap in the face” of those infected. As of Wednesday evening, there have been 41,465 deaths and 328,846 cases in hospitals and care homes the UK.The payment will be trialled in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham in north England, where infections have risen in recent weeks, before being rolled out across the country, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Health secretary Matt Hancock said eligible individuals who test positive will receive £130 for their 10-day period of self-isolation. Other members of their household, who have to self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to a payment of £182 (approx. Rs 18,000).Non-household contacts advised to self-isolate will also be entitled to a payment of up to £182, tailored to the individual length of their isolation period. The payment will be available to people receiving state financial benefits such as Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit.Hancock said: “The British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus. Self-isolating if you have tested positive for Covid-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks”.“This new payment scheme will help people on low incomes and who are unable to work from home to continue playing their part in the national fight against this virus”.However, Mohammed Iqbal, leader of the Pendle borough council, told The Guardian: “I welcome the fact that there is a financial package in place but the figures that the government has introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive.”Jim McMahon, Labour MP for Oldham West & Royton, said it was nowhere near enough to replace the lost income of people such as taxi drivers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers and security operators.Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said the amount was “nowhere near far enough” and would “leave people without enough to live on”, adding: “The health secretary has already said that he couldn’t live on statutory sick pay at £95 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infected-uk-low-wage-earners-to-be-paid-to-stay-home/story-51SKEnbjGhLEIVGwmooHXN.html
28-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says India 2nd largest country to conduct Covid-19 tests after US||President Donald Trump has said that the US has conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests, much more than any other country with India being the second largest. Trump, in his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention which re-nominated him as the Republican Party’s presidential candidate, said that the US has conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is India. “We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma,” he said on Thursday night. “You saw that on Sunday night when we announced that we’ll save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate. And you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 per cent since April,” Trump said. Trump delivered his speech to a group of over 1,000 supporters on the South Lawn of the White House. Many did not wear face masks and were seated close together. The US is among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world, Trump said. “The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don’t hear that. They don’t write about that. They don’t want to write about that. They don’t want you to know those things. “All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 per cent greater increase and excess mortality than the United States,” said the president. In recent months, the United States and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. “They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude,” he said. Criticising his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden, Trump said unlike the former vice president, his administration focuses “on the science, the facts and the data” to handle the coronavirus pandemic. “If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.,,,,” Trump, who had earlier dismissed the pandemic as not a major health issue for the country, said. Many Americans, including him, sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease, Trump said. “As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that had been so tragically taken. So unnecessary. “In their honour, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilisation since World War II. Invoking the Defence Production Act, we produced the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle,” Trump added. More than 180,000 people have died from the coronavirus pandemic since the start of the outbreak in the US, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 5.8 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide, making America the worst-hit country in the world after the disease emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year. Trump repeatedly claimed there would be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and also implied it could be available sooner.“We are delivering life-saving therapies, and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,” Trump said at one point.“We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.“Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available,” Trump said.“We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year,” Trump assured, “and together we will crush the virus.” “Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticise,” Trump said. “When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died,” he said. According to the India’s Union Health Ministry data, India’s Covid-19 tally stands at 33,87,500 while the death toll at 61,529. A cumulative total of 3,94,77,848 samples have been tested up to August 27 with 9,01,338 samples being tested on Thursday in India, according to the ministry’s data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-india-2nd-largest-country-to-conduct-covid-19-tests-after-us/story-72TiUspnCzJMokmA8q99GL.html
