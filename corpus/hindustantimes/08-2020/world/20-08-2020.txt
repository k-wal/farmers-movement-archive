The 44-year-old critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin has faced multiple legal problems, and had supported opposition candidates in upcoming regional elections.Also read: Russia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny in coma after alleged poisoningGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel. speaking at a joint news conference with Macron, said Germany also will insist on transparency regarding Navalny’s illness and expressed support for him.“Obviously Germany will let him have all the medical help that is needed also in German hospitals,” Merkel said. “But that must of course be a wish expressed from there.” “What is also very important is that it will be clarified very urgently how it could come to the situation,” Merkel added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-offers-to-help-hospitalised-alexei-navalny-after-alleged-poisoning/story-WisS3rksutZLh2b35Cv85I.html
20-08-2020||World||Record melt: Greenland lost 586 billion tons of ice in 2019||Greenland lost a record amount of ice during an extra warm 2019, with the melt massive enough to cover California in more than four feet (1.25 meters) of water, a new study said.After two years when summer ice melt had been minimal, last summer shattered all records with 586 billion tons (532 billion metric tons) of ice melting, according to satellite measurements reported in a study Thursday. That’s more than 140 trillion gallons (532 trillion liters) of water.That’s far more than the yearly average loss of 259 billion tons (235 billion metric tons) since 2003 and easily surpasses the old record of 511 billion tons (464 billion metric tons) in 2012, said a study in Nature Communications Earth & Environment. The study showed that in the 20th century, there were many years when Greenland gained ice.“Not only is the Greenland ice sheet melting, but it’s melting at a faster and faster pace,” said study lead author Ingo Sasgen, a geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.Last year’s Greenland melt added 0.06 inches (1.5 millimeters) to global sea level rise. That sounds like a tiny amount but “in our world it’s huge, that’s astounding,” said study co-author Alex Gardner, a NASA ice scientist. Add in more water from melting in other ice sheets and glaciers, along with an ocean that expands as it warms — and that translates into slowly rising sea levels, coastal flooding and other problems, he said.While general ice melt records in Greenland go back to 1948, scientists since 2003 have had precise records on how much ice melts because NASA satellites measure the gravity of the ice sheets. That’s the equivalent of putting the ice on a scale and weighing it as water flows off, Gardner said.As massive as the melt was last year, the two years before were only on average about 108 billion tons (98 billion metric tons). That shows that there’s a second factor called Greenland blocking, that either super-charges that or dampens climate-related melting, Gardner said.In the summer, there are generally two factors in Greenland’s weather, Gardner said. Last year, Greenland blocking — a high pressure over Canada that changes the northern jet stream — caused warm southern air to come up from the United States and Canada and flow into Greenland, forcing more melting.In 2017 and 2018 without Greenland blocking, cooler Arctic air flowed from open ocean into Greenland, making summer milder, he said.This year, Greenland’s summer melt has been not as severe, closer to normal for recent times, said Ruth Mottram, an ice scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, who wasn’t part of Sasgen’s research.Mottram and several other outside scientists said Sasgen’s calculations make sense. In her own study this month in the International Journal of Climatology, she found similar results and also calculated that Greenland coastal regions have warmed on average 3 degrees (1.7 degrees Celsius) in the summer since 1991.“The fact that 2019 set an all-time record is very concerning,” said New York University ice scientist David Holland, who wasn’t part of either study.___Follow AP’s climate coverage at https://www.apnews.com/Climate___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

20-08-2020||World||Trump, Iraqi leader discuss IS, US troops and Iran||President Donald Trump and the prime minister of Iraq met Thursday to discuss ways to confront Iranian aggression in the region, threats from Islamic State sleeper cells and the president’s desire to shrink the US military’s footprint in the country.There are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq now. Last month, the top US general for the Middle East said he believed the US will keep a smaller but enduring presence in the country. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of US Central Command, said after he met with Iraq’s new prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, that he believes the Iraqis welcome the US and coalition troops, especially in the ongoing fight to keep IS fighters from taking hold of the country again.McKenzie would not say how many US troops might stay. But he said Iraqi conventional forces now operate on their own. US and coalition forces continue to conduct training and counterterrorism operations, including with Iraqi commandos. Any final decisions, he said, would be coordinated with the Iraqi government.Al-Kadhimi, who is backed by the United States, assumed office in May when Baghdad’s relations with Washington were precarious following the US killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport.Al-Kadhimi has often had to walk a tightrope due to the US-Iran rivalry. Asked if he was bringing any messages from Tehran following a recent visit there, al-Kadhimi told The Associated Press before he left for Washington: “We do not play the role of postman in Iraq.”The US recognizes the cultural and religious ties that exist between Iran and Iraq, but the administration wants to decrease Iran’s destabilizing influence, often exercised by pro-Iranian militias, on the political and security in Iraq.Al-Kadhimi’s administration inherited a myriad of crises. State coffers in the crude oil-dependent country were slashed following a severe drop in prices, adding to the woes of an economy already struggling with the aftershocks of the global coronavirus pandemic. The US wants to make sure the Baghdad central government’s limited resources also find their way to the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.State violence used to quell the mass protests that erupted in October brought public trust in the government to a new low. Tens of thousands of Iraqis marched decrying rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment, leading to the resignation of the previous premier, Adel Abdul-Mahdi.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met Wednesday with Iraq’s foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said the US was committed to helping Iraq regain and maintain security, despite Trump’s oft-stated desire to reduce and then eliminate American troops’ presence there. Armed groups are not under the full control of the Iraqi prime minister, Pompeo said. He said those groups should be replaced by local police as soon as possible and that the US could and would help.The Iraqi prime minister told Pompeo that Iraq currently does not need direct military support on the ground, and that the levels of help will depend on the changing nature of the threat. Three years since Iraq declared victory over IS, sleeper cells continue to stage attacks across the country’s north.Pompeo and the Iraqi foreign minister expressed hope that as the security situation improves, there will be greater economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the energy sector.On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette announced energy agreements worth up to $8 billion between the Iraqi minsters of oil and electricity and five US companies — Honeywell, Baker Hughes, GE, Stellar and Chevron. Brouillette said US private investment will help Iraqi’s energy sector and stressed a need for Iraq to reduce its dependence on energy from Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-iraqi-leader-discuss-is-us-troops-and-iran/story-8b9baQYyCrznLrQpx9ayMM.html
20-08-2020||World||Time for world to show solidarity with Lebanese people, says UN||The head of the UN refugee agency says it’s time for the international community to show solidarity with the Lebanese people by offering assistance to a country that has hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees for decades. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi also said the UNHCR is making its capacity and expertise as a humanitarian agency available to the Lebanese people and is ready to assist the country as part of a broader international response. Lebanon has been going through multiple crises, including widespread corruption, political divisions and economic difficulties, and Grandi said the international community should find long-term interventions to assist. “All of this is a bigger package than the humanitarian package, and this package needs to be addressed by the international community,” he told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday night. Grandi, on his first official mission since March, when lockdowns were imposed in Europe due to the pandemic, is visiting Lebanon two weeks after a catastrophic explosion at the Port of Beirut destroyed a large part of its capital Beirut. The August 4 blast killed a least 180 people, injured about 6,000 and left nearly 300,000 people with major damage to their homes. It was the most destructive single incident in Lebanon’s history, leaving losses worth between $10 and $15 billion. There are 30 still missing after the explosion. Among those killed were 43 Syrians — a reflection of the country being host to the largest number of refugees per capita — and Grandi said some refugees are among those still missing. More than 1 million Syrian refugees are in Lebanon, having fled the war next door. Grandi, who toured the site of the explosion on Wednesday, also said he is very concerned about the impact of Lebanon’s worsening economic crisis on Syrian and other refugees in the country. “The time has come to also show the Lebanese when they are in the hour of need that the international community responds,” he said. The tiny country now faces a surge in new coronavirus cases, made worse in the aftermath of the explosion, which knocked several Beirut hospitals out of service, including two who were hosting patients with Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Grandi said so far the number of refugees who have tested positive for the virus is relatively small. “Where we are worried, and we are worried in Lebanon as well, is the economic impact, because as we know the lockdowns have created a lot of new poverty among the most vulnerable in society” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-world-to-show-solidarity-with-lebanese-people-says-un/story-4dFqu91qnfiynSJTq06gKL.html
20-08-2020||World||Ex-Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon charged in border wall scheme||Former White House adviser Steve Bannon was arrested Thursday on charges that he and three others ripped off donors to an online fundraising scheme “We Build The Wall.”The charges were contained in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court.Federal prosecutors alleged that Bannon and three others “orchestrated a scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of donors” in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign that raised more than $25 million to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.Multiple messages were left seeking comment from a spokeswoman for Bannon and his lawyer.According to the indictment, Bannon promised that 100% of the donated money would be used for the project, but the defendants collectively used hundreds of thousands of dollars in a manner inconsistent with the organization’s public representations.The indictment said they faked invoices and sham “vendor” arrangements, among other ways, to hide what was really happening.We Build the Wall originally promoted a project for 3 miles of fence posts in South Texas that was ultimately built and largely funded by Fisher Industries, which has received about $2 billion in funding for wall contracts. Tommy Fisher, CEO, didn’t respond to calls for comment.Trump recently criticized that section of wall after it showed signs of erosion, saying it was “only done to make me look bad,” even though it was built by his supporters.Bannon led the conservative Breitbart News before being tapped to serve as chief executive officer of Trump’s campaign in its critical final months, when he pushed a scorched earth strategy that included highlighting the stories of former President Bill Clinton’s accusers. After the election, he served as chief strategist during the turbulent early months of Trump’s administration.The blunt-spoken, combative Bannon was the voice of a nationalistic, outsider conservatism, and he pushed Trump to follow through on some of his most contentious campaign promises, including his travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. But Bannon also clashed with other top advisers, and his high profile sometimes irked Trump. He was pushed out in August 2017.Bannon, who served in the Navy and worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before becoming a Hollywood producer, has been hosting a pro-Trump podcast called “War Room” that began during the president’s impeachment proceedings and has continued during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-donald-trump-adviser-steve-bannon-charged-in-border-wall-scheme/story-k9wxa6Sd4HZu15FQ6JNB9H.html
20-08-2020||World||China, US say talks on implementing trade pact coming soon||Chinese and US trade envoys will hold a meeting by phone “in the near future” to discuss an agreement aimed at resolving a tariff war, a Commerce Ministry spokesman said Thursday.The spokesman, Gao Feng, gave no details of the timing at a ministry news briefing.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday that the talks are part of the process of implementing the US-China trade deal, though he did not say when they would actually happen. He attributed any delay to “scheduling issues.”“It’s part of the process, part of the governance process of this large trade deal,” Kudlow said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” “It was on again, off again, that’s all that was, was scheduling issues. It’s a normal review.”Under the “Phase 1” trade agreement signed in January, both governments agreed to suspend potential additional penalties on each other’s goods in a fight that erupted in 2018 over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus.The truce called for talks to be held after six months, but those were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. A meeting scheduled for last week was to be held online but was postponed.“Both parties have agreed to hold a call in the near future,” Gao said.Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, said the administration has “many huge complaints about China, many,” but that both sides are engaged on the deal. He said China has been buying “a ton” of commodities, mostly agricultural goods, and that the US trade representative believes China is “following their script.”“So far, so good,” Kudlow said.The two governments have rolled back some penalties but most of the punitive tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods remain in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-say-talks-on-implementing-trade-pact-coming-soon/story-C8aum1L5AO6XnoDAEVrpqN.html
20-08-2020||World||Democratic nominee for US vice-president Kamala Harris makes history||Kamala Harris made history on Wednesday after being officially nominated by the Democratic party as its nominee for vice-president. She is the first Indian American and Black woman — actually, the first woman of colour — to be fielded for the second highest political office in the US by a major political party.Harris accepted the nomination as a tribute to her Indian-born mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US to pursue her interest in breast cancer research, met and married Donald J Harris, an immigrant from Jamaica, during the civil rights movement, and raised her and her sister as a single mother.“How I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman—all of five feet tall—who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California,” Harris said in a semi-virtual speech, from a room with some reporters.“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America,” she added.“I do so, committed to the values she taught me.”And, in an unmistakable acknowledgement of her Indian-ness at this highest point of public recognition in her life, Harris used a typical word from Tamil, her mother tongue, for aunts when talking about her expansive vision for the campaign: “Family is my uncles, my aunts—my chitthis,” she said.Harris was introduced by her younger sister Maya Harris, who is a lawyer and a political operative; Maya’s daughter Meena Harris, also a lawyer by profession; and step daughter Ella Emhoff, who is a student at Parsons School of Design in New York City, according to her LinkedIn profile.Harris was scheduled to deliver her acceptance speech before former President Barack Obama, who was to headline Night 3 of the Democratic convention, but was given the prime slot at the former president’s request, who wanted her be the star of the evening, in a symbolic passing-of-the-torch to the next generation of Democratic leaders.Obama used his rescheduled speaking slot to launch an uncharacteristically pointed attack on his successor. “I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care.“But he never did. For close to four years now, he’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves.”Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for Democrats to go out and vote citing her own failed run because many people either did not vote or had not realized how “dangerous” Trump can be. “This can’t be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election,” she said. “If you’re voting by mail, request your ballot now, and send it back as soon as you can. If you vote in person, do it early.”President Trump responded to the attacks in real time with a string of angry tweets in all-caps. “WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER, AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN?” he said in one of them.Harris accepted the nomination in a speech steeped in her personal story of being raised, along with her younger sister, by a strong-willed mother to be “proud, strong Black women … (and to)… be proud of our Indian heritage”.Harris invoked her mother again to frame her historic run as Joe Biden’s running mate. She said she accepted the nomination committed to the values taught to her by her mother. “To the word that teaches me to walk by faith, and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans—one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a Beloved Community—where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from, or who we love.”That nation “feels distant” today, she said, naming the president she and Biden are running to unseat for the first and only time in her 15-minute long speech, “Donald Trump’s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods,” she said, attacking the administration’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-nominee-for-us-vice-president-kamala-harris-makes-history/story-JCR2j9kv6bly884mTpCKsN.html
20-08-2020||World||55-year jail term for brother of Manchester terror attack bomber||Hashem Abedi, brother of the 2017 Manchester terror attack in which 23 people were killed, was on Thursday sentenced to at least 55 years in jail following a two-day hearing attended by relatives of those killed, most of whom were young attending a music concert by a teen pop music idol.Abedi, 23, will not be considered for release for 55 years, the judge said, adding that he was equally responsible for the attack as his brother, Salman Abedi, who died after detonating a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb after US singer Ariana Grande’s concert.Justice Jeremy Baker said: “Although Salman Abedi was directly responsible for detonating the explosive device that evening, it is clear that the defendant had taken an integral part not only in the planning of such an event but also in participating in its preparation”.“I am satisfied that, as the prosecution opened its case to the jury, the defendant and his brother were equally culpable for the deaths and injuries which were caused by the explosion…The defendant should clearly understand that the minimum term which he will serve in relation to the offences of murder is 55 years in custody”.“He may never be released, as that will only occur if and when the Parole Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he should be confined. Even if he is released, he will remain on licence and subject to recall for the remainder of his life”, the judgement said.The judge noted that the two Libya-origin brothers gathered material needed for the improvised explosive device over six months preceding the attack. The explosive material was used in the device was Triacetone Triperoxide, known as TATP.“Neither of these materials was purchased by the two brothers in their own names, rather they were purchased in the names of members of their family or friends who were unaware of the reason why these purchases were being made”, the judgement noted.Hashem persuaded close acquaintances to purchase chemicals that could be used to manufacture explosives, sourced metal drums that were used to build bomb prototypes and bought a white Nissan Micra car that was used to store bomb components in Manchester while the brothers were in Libya.He also acted as his brother’s driver, travelling with Salman between addresses where the brothers manufactured explosives. The Greater Manchester Police said the judgement marked the end of a three-year quest for justice.Ian Hopkins, GMP chief constable, said: “Of course, for the families and friends of those twenty two souls whose lives were brutally cut short that night in May 2017, the pain will never fully diminish”.“I can only hope it brings some small measure of comfort to them that Abedi will spend the vast majority of the rest of his life behind bars – where he belongs”.During the court hearing, many relatives of the victims broke down as they recalled the incident and how they discovered that their children had died. Hashem, who was expected to be present in the court, refused to attend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/55-year-jail-term-for-brother-of-manchester-terror-attack-bomber/story-q4SOn4kELRSS86zbiaukyL.html
20-08-2020||World||Russia to begin Covid-19 vaccine trials on 40,000 people next week||Mass testing of Russia’s first potential Covid-19 vaccine to get domestic regulatory approve will involve more than 40,000 people and will be overseen by a foreign research body when it starts next week, backers of the project said on Thursday.These were the first details on the shape and size of the upcoming late-stage trial of the vaccine given by its developers, who are aiming to allay concerns among some scientists about the lack of data provided by Russia so far.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe vaccine, called “Sputnik V” in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, has been hailed as safe and effective by Russian authorities and scientists following two months of small-scale human trials, the results of which have not been made public yet.But Western experts have been more sceptical, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been seen to be taken and proved a success.“A range of countries is running an information war against the Russian vaccine,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that is backing the vaccine, told a briefing.The vaccine data will be published in an academic journal later this month, he said.Russia has received requests for up to a billion doses of the vaccine from around the world and has capacity to produce 500 million doses per year via manufacturing partnerships, he said.A director at Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed the vaccine, said 40,000 people would be involved in the mass testing at more than 45 medical centres around Russia.The data is being provided to the World Health Organization (WHO), Dmitriev said, and to several countries that are considering participating in the late-stage trial, including the United Arab Emirates, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.Sputnik V has already received approval from domestic regulators, leading President Vladimir Putin and other officials to name Russia the first country to license a Covid-19 vaccine.The registration took place, however, ahead of the start of the large-scale trial, commonly known as a Phase III trial, considered by many as a necessary precursor to registration. At least four other potential Covid-19 vaccines are currently in Phase III trials globally, according to WHO records.Two-shot inoculationBut Russia’s early registration of the vaccine will permit it to begin administering it to people in high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers, alongside the late-stage trial, from October, Dmitriev said.He said the process would be conducted on a voluntary basis and participants would have regular medical check-ups.The trial itself will be supervised by a foreign clinical research organisation, Dmitriev said, ensuring the data collection is fully in line with international standards. He did not give details of the research organisation.The Sputnik V vaccine will involve a two-shot jab, using two different vectors of the human adenovirus. As this vector had a significant track record of use in previous vaccines, it had more historic data supporting its safety than some other potential Covid-19 vaccines, Dmitriev said.This has been echoed by researchers outside Russia. Ian Jones, a virologist at Britain’s Reading University, said of the Russian vaccine: “I think there is enough general background data on recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines to assume the vaccine itself will be safe at the usual doses.”Russian researchers have said that early trials showed the vaccine eliciting a significant immune response, but how long protection would last remains unclear.“Each person may react differently,” the head specialist in infectious diseases at the Russian Health Ministry, Vladimir Chulanov, was cited as saying in an interview by Gazeta.Ru on Thursday.“Some may develop very strong protective immunity, while others may not. In such cases, (coronavirus) infection may be possible, but the illness should, theoretically, have light symptoms. And in general the share of such people will be very small.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-begin-covid-19-vaccine-trials-on-40-000-people-next-week/story-s986H29oqnWLjSlfZZ882N.html

20-08-2020||World||PLA to deploy robot cooks, reduce oily and deep fried diet to cut food wastage||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will deploy AI-driven robot cooks, eschew luxury cooking, cut down on deep-fried dishes and oily diets to reduce food wastage and introduce frugality in food habits of soldiers and officers, a state media report said on Thursday.These measures and the introduction of advanced cooking techniques including “high-energy saving stoves” and more steamed dishes are part of the PLA’s response to President Xi Jinping’s “clean plate campaign” clarion call – a renewed effort to reduce food wastage in China.Xi’s campaign comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has battered the Chinese economy into contraction this year, and the worst floods in years.Chinese official media, Xinhua, quoted Xi calling the issue of food waste “shocking and distressing” and said it was important to “…maintain a sense of crisis regarding food security”.The PLA has been among the first to respond to the boss’s campaign. Besides being the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), Xi is the head of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is the armed forces’ administrator.A report published in the PLA Daily said the PLA’s effort will be to “…create an atmosphere of shame in waste and pride in saving”.The focus will be to “Avoid over-processing and luxurious cooking, increase the number of cooked vegetables, reduce the variety of fried vegetables, and reduce the consumption of edible oil”.The CMC’s Logistic Support Department will oversee the changes, the report said.New technologies will be adapted to cook in a “green, intelligent” way, the report added.It includes exploring the “…application of advanced cooking equipment “…such as high-efficiency energy-saving stoves, universal steaming ovens, cooking robots, improve the mechanization and intelligent-level meal preparation, reduce cooking labour intensity, and reduce cooking energy consumption.”For the 2-million strong PLA, the improvement in nutrition has been gradual.“From 1978 to 2000, the PLA improved the nutrition standards mainly by raising the percentage of meat and vegetables in the personnel’s diet to help them meet the needs of training and fighting,” the state-run China Daily reported earlier.“Since 2000, the CMC has been focusing more on balanced nutrition. Over the past decade, the PLA has prepared different menus for officers and soldiers deployed at different posts to fully protect their health, and the ingredients for every dish are selected to ensure balanced nutrition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-to-deploy-robot-cooks-reduce-oily-and-deep-fried-diet-to-cut-food-wastage/story-blOwQJAzyzOTXvFzSYa07M.html
20-08-2020||World||India likely to be key topic at Chinese, Pak FM strategic meet in Hainan||Fraught ties with India, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and the Covid-19 pandemic will likely be key topics of discussion at a strategic dialogue between Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi and Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the sunny south China province of Hainan on Thursday and Friday.The Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday formally announced that minister Wang, who is also the state councilor, will host Qureshi for the two-day second round of China-Pakistan strategic foreign ministers’ dialogue in Hainan, beginning today.Qureshi’s visit will be one of the first high-profile diplomatic visits to China as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic; the Indonesian FM Retno Marsudi is already here on a two-day visit, which began Wednesday.The two top diplomats from China and Pakistan will meet at a time when both Beijing and Islamabad’s ties with New Delhi have taken a nosedive over the Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh, and (with Pakistan) on the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and terrorism.“This time the strategic dialogue is highly relevant and the two sides will take the opportunity to discuss anti-epidemic cooperation, bilateral ties and other regional and international issues of mutual interest,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian announced at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.“We believe this dialogue will help to enhance our strategic mutual trust, deepen our practical cooperation and strengthen our close coordination on international and regional affairs,” Zhao emphasised.The last China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue was held in March, 2019. Zhao said it had led to consensus on several matters and played an important role in the development of bilateral relations.Zhao added that this dialogue mechanism is a platform for the two “iron brothers” to coordinate exchanges in various fields, discuss policy suggestions on the bilateral ties and enhance coordination and communication on international and regional issues.Also Read: Qureshi heads to Beijing after Imran Khan’s ‘Pak future with China’ remarkTackling the Covid-19 pandemic will also be in focus, Zhao added.Wang and Qureshi will discuss the progress of the CPEC, the flagship project under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ambitious connectivity venture that aims to connect China with Asia and Europe through infrastructure like highways and ports.“Indeed, the CPEC has not progressed as planned, with several large projects shelved and others still uncompleted. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to slow things down further, even though Pakistan on Thursday approved the costliest project to date, a $6.8 billion upgrade to railway lines,” an analysis in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said in the first week of August.The bilateral meeting comes in the backdrop of Beijing in July, for the first time, urging Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan to carry “four-party cooperation” in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and continue to build projects under the BRI including the CPEC.Presiding over a virtual meeting with ministers from the three countries on July 27, Wang said the four should work together to extend the CPEC to Afghanistan.The four countries should “…Give full play to geographic advantages, strengthen exchanges and connections between the four countries and Central Asian countries, and maintain regional peace and stability,” Wang said.Wang and Qureshi are also likely to discuss ways in which China could play a bigger role in war-torn Afghanistan’s peace process.Interestingly in a television interview this week, Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “It should be clear that our future is connected with China… China also needs Pakistan very much. China is our only friend which has remained politically steadfast with Pakistan during good and bad times,” PM Khan had said.In the same interview with Pakistan’s Dunya News, Khan said Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit Pakistan later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-be-key-topic-at-chinese-pak-fm-strategic-meet-in-hainan/story-rDbd275NgmE68w8chRDCKI.html
20-08-2020||World||Democrats pound their message: To oust Trump, you must vote||Former President Barack Obama warned that American democracy could falter if President Donald Trump is reelected, a stunning rebuke of his successor that was echoed by Kamala Harris at the Democratic Convention as she embraced her historic role as the first Black woman on a national political ticket.Obama, himself a barrier breaker as the nation’s first Black president, pleaded with voters Wednesday night to “embrace your own responsibility as citizens — to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.”Throughout their convention, the Democrats have summoned a collective urgency about the dangers of Trump as president. In 2016, they dismissed and sometimes trivialized him. Now they are casting him as an existential threat to the country. The tone signals anew that the fall campaign between Trump and Joe Biden, already expected to be among the most negative of the past half-century, will be filled with rancor and recrimination.Yet on the third night of the Democrats’ four-day convention, party leaders also sought to put forward a cohesive vision of their values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change and tighten gun laws. They drew a sharp contrast with Trump, portraying him as cruel in his treatment of immigrants, disinterested in the nation’s climate crisis and in over his head on virtually all of the nation’s most pressing challenges.Democrats also demonstrated a hope that Biden, a 77-year-old white man, can revive the coalition that helped put Obama into office, with minorities, younger voters and college-educated women blunting Trump’s lock on many white and rural voters.The evening marked a celebration of the party’s leading women, including remarks from Hillary Clinton, the first woman to become a major ticket presidential nominee; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who challenged Biden during the primary and is now supporting his campaign.Harris, a 55-year-old California senator and the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, addressed race and equality in a personal way Biden cannot when he formally accepts his party’s presidential nomination on Thursday.“There is no vaccine for racism. We have got to do the work,” Harris said, her words emphatic though she was speaking in a largely empty arena near Biden’s Delaware home.“We’ve got to do the work to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law,” she added. “None of us are free until all of us are free.”Just 76 days before the election, Biden must energize the disparate factions that make up the modern Democratic Party — a coalition that spans generation, race and ideology. And this fall voters must deal with concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic that has created health risks for those who want to vote in person — and postal slowdowns for mail-in ballots, which Democrats blame on Trump.Democrats hope that Harris and Obama in particular can help bridge the divide between those reassured by Biden’s establishment credentials and those craving bolder change.The pandemic forced Biden’s team to abandon the traditional convention format in favor of an all-virtual affair that has eliminated much of the pomp and circumstance that typically defines political conventions. It was completely silent, for example, as Harris took the stage to make history at the Chase Center in downtown Wilmington. She was flanked by American flags but no family, and her audience consisted of a few dozen reporters and photographers.After two nights that featured several Republicans, the proceedings on Wednesday emphasized core Democratic values on areas like climate change and gun violence that particularly resonate with younger voters.On guns, Biden wants to repeal a law shielding firearm manufacturers from liability lawsuits, impose universal background checks for purchases and ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines. On climate, Biden has proposed a $2 trillion plan to invest in clean energy and end carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2035, even though his proposals don’t go as far as activists’ preferred Green New Deal.Wednesday night, former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords reflected on her own journey of pain and recovery from a severe brain injury nearly a decade after being shot while meeting with constituents. She urged America to support Biden.“I struggle to speak, but I have not lost my voice,” Giffords said. “Vote, vote, vote.”It’s Trump’s turn next. The Republican president, who abandoned plans to host his convention in North Carolina and in Florida, is expected to break tradition and accept his nomination from the White House lawn.In the meantime, he’s seeking to take attention from Biden. Trump will stop near his Democratic rival’s birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. He’s also participating in a prime-time interview with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity.Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 rival, implored Democrats to turn out in larger numbers in November to block his reelection.“For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.’ ‘I wish I could go back and do it over.’ Or worst, ‘I should have voted,’” said Clinton, the first woman nominated president by a major party. “Well, this can’t be another woulda coulda shoulda election.”“Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line,” she added, “because they are.”Obama spoke harshly of Trump, too.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” Obama said, speaking from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, a backdrop chosen to reinforce what the former president sees as the dire stakes of the moment.“I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president,” Obama continued, describing Biden as his brother. “I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously.”Obama confidants say that the former president’s support for Biden is unequivocal, but he worries about enthusiasm among younger voters, particularly younger voters of color. Democrats concede that one of the reasons Trump won the presidency in 2016 was because those voters didn’t show up in the same large numbers as when Obama was on the ballot.Beyond the carefully scripted confines of the virtual convention, there were modest signs of tension between the moderate and progressive wings of Biden’s Democratic Party.In particular, some progressives complained that pro-Biden Republicans such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich have been featured more prominently than the party’s younger progressive stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Climate activists also complained that the party appeared ready to drop a provision in the platform that calls for an end to fossil fuel industry subsidies and tax breaks.Sen. Warren, a favorite of progressives for demanding bold change, spoke for around five minutes.And While Warren urged people to vote for Biden and gave a hearty endorsement for several of his economic and child care plans, she hinted that she would not retreat from her push for a more progressive agenda should her party retake the White House.“We all need to be in the fight to get Joe and Kamala elected,” Warren said. “And after November, we all need to stay in the fight to get big things done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-pound-their-message-to-oust-trump-you-must-vote/story-aMCxMq0yxJuu8DWJhafs3L.html
20-08-2020||World||Russia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny in coma after alleged poisoning||Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny is in a coma and on a ventilator in a hospital intensive care unit after falling ill from suspected poisoning that his allies believe is linked to his political activity.The 44-year-old foe of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin felt unwell on a flight back to Moscow from Tomsk, a city in Siberia, and was taken to a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Twitter.“He is in a coma in grave condition,” she said on Twitter.She also told the Echo Moskvy radio station that during the flight Navalny was sweating and asked her to talk to him so that he could “focus on a sound of a voice.” He then went to the bathroom and lost consciousness.Yarmysh said the politician must have consumed something from tea he drank at an airport cafe before boarding the plane early Thursday.“Doctors are saying the toxin was absorbed quicker with hot liquid,” she tweeted, adding that Navalny’s team called police to the hospital.Anatoliy Kalinichenko, deputy chief doctor of the Omsk hospital where the politician is being treated, told reporters that Navalny was in grave, yet stable condition. Kalinichenko said doctors are considering a variety of diagnosis, including poisoning, but refused to give details, citing a law preventing doctors from disclosing confidential patient information.State news agency Tass reported that police were not considering deliberate poisoning, citing an anonymous source in law enforcement who said “it is not unlikely that he drank or consumed something yesterday himself.”Yarmysh on Twitter bristled at that suggestion: “Of course. It’s just the tea was bad. This is what the state propaganda is going to do now — yell that there was no deliberate poisoning, he (did something) accidentally, he (did something) himself.”Last year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from prison where he was serving a sentence following an administrative arrest, with what his team said was suspected poisoning. Doctors then said he had a severe allergic attack and discharged him back to prison the following day.Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption has been exposing graft among government officials, including some at the highest level. Last month, he had to shut the foundation after a financially devastating lawsuit from Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin.Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko accused Navalny last week of organizing unprecedented mass protests against his re-election that have rocked Russia’s ex-Soviet neighbor since Aug. 9. He did not, however, provide any evidence and that claim was one of many blaming foreign forces for the unrest.Like many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging one eye.The most prominent member of Russia’s opposition, Navalny campaigned to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was barred from running.He set up a network of campaign offices across Russia and has since been putting forward opposition candidates in regional elections, challenging members of Russia’s ruling party, United Russia. One of his associates in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia’s Far East that has been engulfed in mass protests against the arrest of the region’s governor, was detained just last week after calling for a strike at a rally.In the interview with Echo Moskvy, Yarmysh said she believed the suspected poisoning was connected to this year’s regional election campaign.Vyacheslav Gimadi, a lawyer with Navalny’s foundation, said the team is requesting Russia’s Investigative Committee open a criminal probe.“There is no doubt that Navalny was poisoned because of his political stance and activity,” Gimadi said in a tweet on Thursday.Navalny is not the first opposition figure to come down with a mysterious poisoning. In 2018, Pyotr Verzilov, a member of Russia’s protest group Pussy Riot, ended up in an intensive care unit after a suspected poisoning and had to be flown to Berlin for treatment. Opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was hospitalized with poisoning symptoms twice — in 2015 and 2017. Both said they believed they were poisoned for their political activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-in-coma-after-alleged-poisoning/story-4Nl6uwySMK5wfj8UIQDEgI.html
20-08-2020||World||China says Taiwan hacking allegations are ‘malicious slander’||China on Thursday branded as “malicious slander” accusations from Taiwan about hacking attacks linked to the Chinese government, further adding to tensions between Beijing and Taipei.Taiwan has been urging its people to be alert for what officials call “omnipresent infiltration” from China, ranging from Beijing-backed media campaigns to cyberattacks, against the island that China considers its territory.This week, Taiwan said hacking groups connected to the Chinese government had attacked at least 10 government agencies and some 6,000 email accounts of government officials in an “infiltration” to steal important data.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian poured scorn on the allegation.“The criticisms from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities are malicious slander, pure and simple,” Zhao told reporters, referring to Taiwan’s ruling party. “China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity, and is one of the victims of hacking attacks.”The Chinese government routinely denies involvement in hacking and says it punishes those who do it.The hacking allegations come during a period of growing strains between the island and China.China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-taiwan-hacking-allegations-are-malicious-slander/story-GUv7qjWulEDAc8zDfRBRaM.html
20-08-2020||World||Hong Kong government slams United States’ decision to suspend treaties||The Hong Kong government on Thursday condemned the US’s decision to suspend bilateral extradition and tax exemption treaties with the semi-autonomous Chinese city, saying it was being used as a pawn in geopolitics.On Wednesday, the US suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, becoming the latest country to do so after Canada, Australia and Britain suspended such agreements. The US also suspended a bilateral agreement with Hong Kong on the reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships.“The US’ unilateral decision reflects its disrespect for bilateralism and multilateralism under the current administration and should be condemned by the international community,” the statement said.“The HKSAR Government strongly objects to and deplores the US’ action, which is widely seen as a move to create troubles in China-US relationship, using Hong Kong as a pawn.” The government said that the bilateral agreements were not preferential treatment given to Hong Kong, but were negotiated in good faith to benefit both parties.Also read: United States suspends extradition and tax agreements with Hong KongHong Kong has faced mounting international pressure over the implementation of a national security law, approved by Beijing, which has been viewed as an attack on the “one country, two systems” framework under which the city has been governed since its return to China in 1997.Jeffrey Bader, a former US diplomat, said the actions taken so far are unlikely to dissuade China.“Hong Kong is an issue that’s going to be with us for quite some time, and in a frustrating way,” said Bader.“It’s part of China and things that are internal to China, even if they have an international dimension, like Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the Chinese have a demonstrated disdain for outside opinion and are inflexible in reaction to it.” Separately on Thursday, lawmakers from Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party also said they planned to hold a poll and debate to determine whether they will continue serving in the legislature another year, following the postponement of elections due to the coronavirus outbreak.Opinions within the pro-democracy camp differ on whether lawmakers should boycott the extension of their term or stay to have a voice in the legislature. Lawmakers in favor of boycotting say staying sets a precedent to delay elections.“The public opinion is still very divided, we want the solidarity of the people,” said James To, a member of the Democratic Party, at a news conference. “We would prepare at least one debate in order … to have a comprehensive range of arguments and points so that the whole society can decide.” The elections were to be held in September but have been postponed a year after the city’s virus outbreak grew again.Democratic Party lawmakers did not specify a time frame or details of the public poll.Several pro-democracy lawmakers have already spoken out against serving another year in the legislature.Ray Chan, chairman of the People Power party, said on Twitter he would boycott the “illegitimate” extension and that accepting the appointment would mean accepting the authority of city leader Carrie Lam’s government and would allow Beijing to “arbitrarily change the term” of legislators.“It’ll open the floodgate for all kinds of meddling for years to come,” said Chan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-government-slams-united-states-decision-to-suspend-treaties/story-4jUaVO1rWabKZ8lihnzp6K.html
20-08-2020||World||North Korea to unveil new economic plans in January party meeting||North Korea will hold a rare ruling party congress in January where leader Kim Jong Un will announce a new five-year plan to develop the country’s dismal economy ravaged by US-led sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic, state media said Thursday.The plans were confirmed Wednesday during a plenary meeting of the Workers’ Party’s decision-making Central Committee where Kim acknowledged economic shortcomings caused by “unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects and the situation in the region surrounding the Korean Peninsula.” The report by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency didn’t directly mention nuclear diplomacy with the United States, which has stalled over disagreements in exchanging sanctions relief and denuclearization steps.The Workers’ Party last convened for a full congress in 2016, which was its first in 36 years, where Kim announced his initial five-year national development plan, which included goals for improving power supply and increasing agricultural and manufacturing production.Entering the plan’s final year, Kim during the Central Committee’s last plenary meeting in December declared a “frontal breakthrough” against sanctions while urging his nation to stay resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance.But experts say the Covid-19 crisis has clearly derailed some of Kim’s major economic goals after North Korea imposed a lockdown that significantly reduced trade with China — its major ally and economic lifeline — and likely hampered its ability to mobilize its workforce.It’s also possible Kim could use the party congress, which would take place after the US presidential election in November, to announce a new foreign policy approach toward the United States and rival South Korea.Kim’s economic setbacks have left him with nothing to show for his high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump, whom he first met in June 2018 in Singapore, where they issued an aspirational statement on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.Their diplomacy deteriorated last year in Vietnam, after their second meeting, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The North has recently said it has no immediate intent to resume talks with Washington, vowing not to gift Trump with meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.Some experts say the North would likely avoid serious negotiations with the United States before the election as it wouldn’t want to make any major concessions when there’s a chance US leadership could change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-to-unveil-new-economic-plans-in-january-party-meeting/story-JeHE4z3eCFPXXZfJNa64FK.html
20-08-2020||World||Angela Merkel hosts Greta Thunberg for talks on climate crisis||German Chancellor Angela Merkel hosted Greta Thunberg and other leading Fridays for Future activists in Berlin on Thursday for talks on the EU’s climate goals, with the campaigners expected to condemn “political inaction”.Merkel said Swedish 17-year-old Thunberg and her co-campaigners Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgium’s Anuna De Wever and Adelaide Charlier had requested the meeting and she was “pleased” to welcome them to the chancellery.The activists warned ahead of the talks that they were dismayed at the lack of progress in fighting climate change despite lofty promises by European governments.“When it comes to action we are still in a state of denial. The climate and ecological crisis has never once been treated as a crisis,” they wrote in a letter published in Germany’s Der Spiegel and Britain’s The Guardian on Wednesday.“We will tell Merkel that she must face up to the climate emergency -- especially as Germany now holds the presidency of the European Council. Europe has a responsibility to act.”The meeting comes exactly two years after Thunberg, then 15, started skipping school to strike outside the Swedish parliament to dramatise the need for action against global warming.The strike movement has since spread across the world and Merkel has repeatedly expressed her admiration for the masses of young people demonstrating on Fridays for more climate protection.But the activists say nothing concrete has changed.“Effectively, we have lost another two crucial years to political inaction,” they wrote, calling on countries to urgently halt all fossil fuel investments.Despite its green reputation abroad, Germany is struggling to meet its own climate targets as the country remains heavily reliant on coal because of its decision to phase out nuclear energy after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.Europe’s top economy was widely expected to miss its goal of reducing climate-heating greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent this year compared with 1990 levels.But a government report on Wednesday said the coronavirus could unexpectedly help it meet the target after all, after the pandemic wrecked economic activity and lowered demand for polluting coal. Germany has promised to abandon coal-generated power by 2038, a date considered far too late by climate activists.The European Union as a whole aims to achieve carbon neutrality -- or net zero greenhouse emissions -- by 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-hosts-greta-thunberg-for-talks-on-climate-crisis/story-ioE8qPBjOXBe6ji7gRcU2M.html
20-08-2020||World||Qureshi heads to Beijing after Imran Khan’s ‘Pak future with China’ remark||Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi is leaving for Beijing for ‘strategic level’ discussions with his Chinese counterparts on Thursday, days after Prime Minister Imran Khan underscored that Pakistan’s future is connected with that of its long-time ally China.Qureshi will be accompanied by a team of diplomats including foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood, people familiar with the development said.Qureshi is scheduled to meet China’s foreign minister and state councillor Wang Yi. On the agenda, according to reports in China and Islamabad, are discussions linked to belt and road projects, bilateral ties and preparations for President Xi Jinping’’s visit to Pakistan expected later this year. Qureshi is also expected to seek support for Pakistan’s stand on Kashmir and discuss the India-China standoff in east Ladakh.PM Imran Khan had underscored the importance of ties with China this week when he, in a television interview, insisted that reports about breakdown in relations with Saudi Arabia were “baseless”. On China, PM Khan said, Pakistan was strengthening ties with China. “It should be clear that our future is connected with China… China also needs Pakistan very much,” he said.“China is our only friend which has remained politically steadfast with Pakistan during good and bad times,” PM Khan had said.Like when Saudi kingdom signalled its displeasure by demanding that Pakistan return $ 1 billion out of a $ 3 billion loan extended by Riyadh in 2018, Pakistan had turned to China. Also Watch | ‘Pakistan is the nerve centre of terrorism’: India’s envoy to United NationsQureshi’s visit to Beijing comes at a time he has been under attack in Islamabad, both from within and without the Imran Khan government, for his broadside at Saudi Arabia for not convening the Organisation of Islamic Conference, or OIC meeting of foreign ministers on Kashmir.Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa made a quick visit to Saudi Arabia this week in an effort to smooth relations between Islamabad and Riyadh.Qureshi had threatened to approach other Muslim countries for a conference on Kashmir outside the OIC platform if Saudi Arabia did not play ball, a remark that did not go down well in Riyadh that last year prevailed upon Pakistan at the last minute to absent itself from a joint attempt by Turkey and Malaysia to create a new forum of Islamic countries. Foreign ministers of Malaysia, Turkey, Qatar, Iran, and Indonesia attended this meeting.People familiar with the development in New Delhi said China has been pushing Pakistan to play a lead role in the OIC with support of Turkey and Malaysia.Gen Bajwa, according to diplomats in New Delhi and Riyadh, is learnt to have conveyed Imran Khan’s regret at Qureshi’s comment and asked Saudi Arabia to agree to a meeting of the smaller group within the OIC, formally called the OIC contact group on Kashmir. From all available indications, Gen Bajwa didn’t get far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qureshi-heads-for-beijing-today-after-imran-khan-s-pak-future-with-china-remark/story-14n7ENI2yVovD5SzXdKcTI.html
20-08-2020||World||Indian-Americans describe Kamala Harris’ nomination as quantum leap forward for the community||Several prominent Indian-Americans have applauded Kamala Harris formally becoming the Democratic Party nominee to be the US vice-president, describing it as a historic moment in American politics and a quantum leap forward for the community. Harris, 55, scripted history on Wednesday by becoming the first Black and Indian descent individual to be nominated as a vice-presidential candidate of a major political party.“Kamala’s story is the American story. Her acceptance of the vice-presidential nomination is a quantum leap forward for Indian-Americans, showing that we are taking our place in American history books,” said Neil Makhija, executive director of IMPACT, a leading Indian American advocacy organisation.After four years of incendiary anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from the White House, this milestone is a welcome moment that immigrant communities of all backgrounds can celebrate, he said.“Asian Americans are the fastest-growing bloc in the country, and Kamala’s candidacy is energising and mobilising our communities in a way that will have lasting reverberations for decades to come,” Makhija said.Eminent Indian-American and Democratic fundraiser Frank Islam said that Kamala Harris is not only a great choice from an electoral standpoint but also a morally sound choice.“Kamala Harris is galvanising the African American community, Indian Americans and women in general,” he said.“In 2016, America had a chance to elect a woman as the commander in chief. Now the country gets to elect a woman of colour — an African American and Indian American woman — as its Vice President. I am confident that this time around, America will get it right,” Islam said.Describing it as “truly historic moment for Indian-Americans” community leader Ajay Bhutoria from California said that it gives the community great pride and joy to be able to witness this important moment in history.“No matter where your parents come from, no matter what race, religion you belong to, if you work hard and have the right values and character you can rise to become the vice president and one day the President of the United States. Everything is possible for people who work hard in this country. Merit is recognised and rewarded,” he said.“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have the experience and leadership to lead us out of the economic and healthcare crisis which the Trump administration has burdened us with,” Bhutoria said. “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the right partners who will move America forward and bring India and the US closer. Under their leadership Indo US relations will be Stronger Together!” he added. This was a historic moment for the entire community, a profound reminder of just how far the diaspora has travelled in American public life in such a short amount of time, Ronak D Desai, a scholar at Harvard University’s Lakshmi Mittal South Asia Institute, said. Although this is the latest milestone for the Indian-American community, it will certainly not be the last, he said.“Senator Harris proudly declared that her Indian heritage is an integral part of who she is, that her progress is the community’s progress and that her story is the story of both the American dream and the Indian diaspora. It is so utterly remarkable and yet so familiarly common at the same time,” Desai said.The story of Dr Shyamla Gopalan, Harris’ mother, and the ways she shaped her daughter is a poignant one that resonates deeply with the Indian-American community, he said, adding her journey is the community’s journey. “And her daughter represents the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of so many within the community,” Desai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-describe-kamala-harris-nomination-as-quantum-leap-forward-for-the-community/story-m0zvXoKXWmPwlS3xJEkEnM.html
20-08-2020||World||‘He spied on my campaign, and got caught’: Trump tweets all-caps rebuke to Obama||The third night of the Democratic National Convention in the United States proved to be the most fiery one. And President Donald Trump was also tuned in.His Twitter account suggested so, as Trump live-tweeted his rebuke to predecessor Barack Obama for his comments on his presidency.“I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously; that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did,” Obama said in his criticism of Trump’s tenure.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t,” Obama added.“He spied on my campaign, and got caught,” Trump said on Twitter in all caps. “Why did he refuse to endorse slow Joe until it was all over, and even then was very late? Why did he try to get him not to run??” the US President went on. HE SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GOT CAUGHT!Obama listed failures of Trump administration because he didn’t take his job seriously. “170,000 Americans dead.

Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.”“Tonight, I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of dark times and build it back better,” said Obama.After avoiding direct criticism for most of Trump’s first term, the scathing broadsides from Obama constituted an unusually harsh assessment of one president by another. His assertion that Trump, a Republican, is incapable of meeting the demands of the presidency echoed the remarks from his wife, Michelle Obama, on Monday, that Trump “simply cannot be who we need him to be.”Thursday was also the day when Indian-origin US senator Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be Joe Biden’s runnin mate for the November presidential election.Harris is the first Black woman on a major party presidential ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-spied-on-my-campaign-and-got-caught-trump-tweets-all-caps-rebuke-to-obama/story-y2XmRaTxGyjlDuG5OkDUSO.html
20-08-2020||World||Trump touts convalescent plasma as a coronavirus treatment||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday touted the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid-19 and suggested a reported decision by regulators to put on hold an emergency authorization for its use could be politically motivated.“I’ve heard fantastic things about convalescent plasma,” Trump told a briefing.An emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of blood plasma as a coronavirus treatment has been put on hold over concerns the data backing it was too weak, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.“It could be a political decision,” Trump said.“You have a lot of people over there that don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3,” he said, referring to the presidential election.“I’ve heard numbers way over 50% success. And people are dying and we should have it approved if it’s good and I’m hearing it’s good. I heard from people at the FDA that it’s good,” he said.The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. People who survive an infectious disease such as Covid-19 are left with blood plasma containing antibodies the body’s immune system created to fight off a virus. This can be transfused into newly infected patients to try to aid recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-touts-convalescent-plasma-as-a-coronavirus-treatment/story-7rp0apmFaFfsI9c6uhPZpN.html
20-08-2020||World||Iraq PM to meet Trump with US troops on the agenda||Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi will meet US President Donald Trump for the first time in Washington on Thursday, with the presence of American troops in the country at the top of his agenda.The meeting comes as attacks on American targets by pro-Iranian fighters have been on the rise, and with Tehran and Washington competing for influence in Iraq, the gulf between pro-Iranian factions and Baghdad’s US-friendly premier is growing.Kadhemi, who took office in May, faces challenges from factions of the Hashed al-Shaabi, a coalition of Iraqi Shiite paramilitary groups with close ties to Iran.The Hashed al-Shaabi is officially integrated into the Iraqi state, and its political representatives have called for the expulsion of the 5,000 US troops deployed in the country as part of anti-jihadist efforts.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that “armed groups not under the full control of the prime minister have impeded our progress,” calling for them to “be replaced by local police as soon as possible.”Pompeo -- who was speaking at a press conference with Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein -- appeared to be referring to Shiite paramilitary groups, though he did not identify them by name.Asked about the plan for cutting the 5,000 US troops now in Iraq, Pompeo said he had no numbers and urged people “not to focus on that.”On the troop issue, a senior administration official said: “There are no hard fast timelines, and there are no hard fast numbers but that certainly would be part of the discussion, as we evaluate what Iraq security requirements are, and what the United States believes it can do.”The official described “armed groups” as “a persistent problem that challenges Iraqi security, has threatened US forces’ interests in the region, and certainly it’s a challenge to Iraq sovereignty.”“We think that Iraq’s internal security needs are best met by forces that are, first and foremost, under the sovereign control the government of Iraq,” the official said.Pro-Iranian factions were hit hard by Washington’s assassination in January of one of their top chiefs, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a strike that also killed top Iranian commander General Qasem Soleimani.ATTACKS ON THE RISEThe Hashed al-Shaabi denies any connection to a recent spate of anti-US attacks, but videos and claims on social media hint at its involvement, through groups operating under other names.Kadhemi has angered armed groups by seizing border posts where they ran lucrative smuggling networks and imposed taxes on traders.Attacks have risen in recent weeks, with the Iraqi army reporting another rocket attack on Tuesday evening targeting Baghdad airport, where US troops are based. The projectile did not cause damage or casualties, the army said.From October to the end of July, Iraqi armed factions carried out 39 rocket attacks against American interests in the country.But after the White House earlier this month confirmed that Trump would meet Kadhemi, the pace intensified.Between August 4 and 18, 14 bomb and rocket attacks targeted Iraqi logistics convoys for the US military, bases housing US soldiers and the US embassy.While the impact has been limited, the attacks have served as a show of strength.After an attack on a convoy in Iraq’s south, a man was arrested in possession of bombs and a Hashed al-Shaabi military ID card that allowed him to cross checkpoints without a search, an intelligence source told AFP.At the end of June, 14 fighters from the Hezbollah Brigades, a Hashed al-Shaabi faction, were arrested for attacks on Americans.Three days later, 13 were released on the decision of a Hashed military judge.Kadhemi over the weekend hosted Iranian commander Esmail Qaani, Soleimani’s replacement, telling him that “no country” could interfere in Iraqi-US relations, a source close to the discussions told AFP.The relationship between Baghdad and Tehran, meanwhile, must be “state-to-state and not via militias,” the source quoted him as saying, adding that groups that “draw their strength from Iran” had bombed Iraqi targets and embezzled money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-pm-to-meet-trump-with-us-troops-on-the-agenda/story-hYWqv0pHsQvaXJG0bR7q0J.html
20-08-2020||World||Taiwan says China behind cyberattacks on government agencies, emails||Taiwan said on Wednesday hacking groups linked to the Chinese government had attacked at least 10 government agencies and some 6,000 email accounts of government officials in an “infiltration” to steal important data.Democratic Taiwan has been urging its people to be alert for what officials call “omnipresent infiltration” from China, involving from Beijing-backed media campaigns to cyberattacks, against the island that China considers its territory.“Chinese hacking groups have been infiltrating government agencies and their information service providers for a long time,” said the deputy director of the Taiwan Investigation Bureau’s Cyber Security Investigation Office, Liu Chia-zung.“They were aiming to acquire important government documents and data,” Liu told reporters. “Some government data might have been leaked. This has posed a great threat.”The attacks, which started as early as 2018, targeted at least 10 government agencies and the email accounts of some 6,000 officials, Liu’s office said, adding it had not been able to identify what data has been stolen as the hackers had concealed their tracks.Among those who were attacked and infiltrated by two Chinese hacking groups were at least four Taiwan tech companies that had been providing information services to the government, the office said.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government routinely denies involvement in hacking and says it punishes those who do it.Liu said Taiwan believed the two hacking groups involved, Blacktech and Taidoor, were backed by the Chinese Communist Party. They targeted loopholes in the systems provided by the Taiwan government’s information service providers, he said.Government agencies should increase scrutiny of their providers, Liu said.He said his office was investigating service supply chains to see if any Taiwan companies or individuals have worked with the Chinese hackers.News of the hacking comes during a period of heightened tension between the island and China.China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-china-behind-cyberattacks-on-government-agencies-emails/story-4jk4Qe9lcdeI8poCSUuSTP.html
20-08-2020||World||Virtual prayer and meditation session held for Hindu delegates at Democratic convention||The ongoing Democratic National Convention on Wednesday organised a virtual prayer and meditation session for Hindu delegates and members attending the four-day event.The session was led by Anurima Bhargava, vice chair, US Commission on International Religious Freedom, Harini Krishnan, Indian classical vocalist and South Asians For Biden state director, Neel Gonuguntla, South Asians For Biden state director and community leader, and Ajay Tejasvi, AAPI Faith Leadership Council and Art of Living instructor.Murali Balaji, South Asians For Biden communication team and community leader, and Ajay Bhutoria, AAPI Leadership Council For Biden and National Finance Committee member, also led the prayer session.“The DNC’s inclusion and recognition of Hindus at the convention is particularly meaningful on the day that Senator Kamala Harris -- who has Indian heritage -- accepts her nomination as vice presidential candidate,” Dewan said.“Today, meditation has become an essential tool for mental health. In the midst of the many challenges that modern life throws at us, it is important find a sense of calm and clarity of thought to truly be successful in life,” Tejasvi added.Speaking on the occasion, Bhutoria said that earlier this year, he had hosted Dr Jill Biden at his home in California and had presented her a statue of Lord Ganesha.“I Pray to Lord Ganesha and Hanumanji to remove all obstacles from the path of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to get elected,” he said.“We want to be able to worship in temples, gurdwaras, mosques and churches without the fear of racism and hate crimes. We want to leave a better planet for our next generation, to grow our small businesses, and for our family and friends to be welcome here as immigrants,” Bhutoria said.“So, I am in this fight with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to restore the soul of our nation for all of us. Joe Biden is and will be the best friend of India and Indo-Americans. US and Joe Biden share the same values - ‘Family is most important and it all starts with the family’,” he said.“One of my favorite pictures of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden is at Raj Ghat, paying homage to Mahatma Gandhi during his four-day India trip under the Obama–Biden Administration,” Bhutoria added.“South Asians for Biden recognises that Hindus will be instrumental in getting the Biden-Harris ticket elected in November,” Dewan said.“Leaders like Harini Krishnan, Dr Murali Balaji, and Neelima Gonuguntla, who were among the individuals who led the DNC’s prayer event, will be crucial in persuading the Hindu faith community that Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris are the best choice this November,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virtual-prayer-and-meditation-session-held-for-hindu-delegates-at-democratic-convention/story-qEQu3zgVFFX1wcVF0TteJM.html
20-08-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine won’t be mandatory in US, says Anthony Fauci||Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top infectious diseases official, said Wednesday the government wouldn’t make any future Covid-19 vaccine obligatory for the general public -- though local jurisdictions could make it mandatory for some groups, like children.“You don’t want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We’ve never done that,” said Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, during a video talk organized by George Washington University.“You can mandate for certain groups of people like health workers, but for the general population you can’t” he added, citing the example of the National Institutes of Health, where health workers can’t treat patients without a flu shot.Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison hours earlier announced that coronavirus vaccines, once approved, would be mandatory for everyone in his country, barring medical exemptions.But the United States’ decentralized system of government, and anti-vaccine sentiments that have been building for decades, had in any case made a program of mandatory immunization unlikely.“It would be unenforceable and not appropriate,” said Fauci.This however doesn’t prevent states from making a vaccine mandatory for children to attend school, as is already the case for certain diseases such as measles, though some are exempt for medical or religious reasons.At any rate, the administration of President Donald Trump has pre-ordered hundreds of millions of vaccine doses from six companies, and these will be distributed for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-won-t-be-mandatory-in-us-says-anthony-fauci/story-qmrv1BZxA2vQDWKGrlDA8I.html
20-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris to get vice presidential nod, make history at Democratic convention||US Senator Kamala Harris will make history when she accepts the Democratic nomination for vice president on Wednesday, saying the country is at an inflection point and “we can do better” than four more years of President Donald Trump.The first Black woman and Asian-American on a major U.S. presidential ticket, Harris can be expected to unleash her prosecutorial skills at the Democratic National Convention as Joe Biden’s running mate in the November 3 election.Former U.S. President Barack Obama also will speak, telling the convention that Trump’s failures as his successor had led to 170,000 people dead from the coronavirus, millions of lost jobs and America’s reputation badly diminished in the world, according to excerpts of his speech released by organizers.On the third day of a four-day convention, Harris will aggressively press the case against Trump and for Biden, likely speaking directly to millions of women, young Americans and voters of color, constituencies Democrats need if Biden is to defeat the Republican Trump.“We’re at an inflection point. The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It’s a lot. And here’s the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more,” Harris says in excerpts of her prepared speech.As the largely virtual proceedings began, Harris made a brief surprise appearance to urge Americans to develop a plan for voting and thwart any voter suppression efforts that could hinder casting a ballot.Democrats have been alarmed by Trump’s frequent criticism of mail-in voting, and by cost-cutting changes at the U.S. Postal Service instituted by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump supporter, that could delay mail during the election crunch.DeJoy said recently he would delay those changes until after the election.“Why is there so much effort to silence us? When we vote, things change,” Harris said. “Each of us need a plan, a voting plan.” She offered a number where people could text to get help voting.In excerpts made available ahead of time, Obama, whose vice president was Biden from 2009-2017, says he had hoped that Trump would take the job seriously, come to feel the weight of the office, and discover a reverence for American democracy.“Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs gone. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before,” Obama was expected to say.The coronavirus has complicated life with many Americans expecting to cast votes by mail to avoid crowds at the polls. Trump has repeatedly and without evidence attacked mail voting as susceptible to fraud, though voting by mail is nothing new in American political life.Speaking at a virtual fundraiser on Wednesday with elected officials from Pennsylvania, Biden repeated his calls for unifying the country.“This moment requires us to sort of rise together and get everyone we know involved, remember who we are as a nation, to build back a better future. That’s what America always does in a crisis,” Biden said.CHILD OF IMMIGRANTSIn her speech later, Harris will have an opportunity to outline her background as a child of immigrants from India and Jamaica who as a district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator from California and now vice-presidential candidate shattered gender and racial barriers.She gained prominence in the Senate for her exacting interrogations of Trump nominees, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General Bill Barr.Biden, 77, named Harris, 55, as his running mate last week to face incumbents Trump, 74, and Vice President Mike Pence, 61. She will deliver her speech from an austere hotel ballroom in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.Obama will speak to the convention live from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. He will speak about how he worked closely with Biden, his vice president, to lead the country out of the last recession, according to the excerpts.The first two nights of the four-day Democratic convention showcased elder statesmen and rising stars in the party who said Biden’s election would repair a pandemic-battered United States and put an end to the chaos of Trump’s four years in office.But the party comprises a range of ideological positions.Some on the left complained that Republicans like former Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is backing Biden, a moderate Democrat, over Trump, were given more air time than the party’s own progressive wing.U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leading progressive voice from New York, had one minute for her remarks on Tuesday night.The Republican National Convention, also largely virtual, takes place next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-get-vice-presidential-nod-make-history-at-democratic-convention/story-8z57eCxEmbsOEFmvKMrrtN.html
20-08-2020||World||California wildfires chase people from homes into smoky air||Crews worked in blistering heat Wednesday to beat back wildfires that ignited across Northern California, sending thousands of people from their homes into smoky air and killing a pilot on a firefighting mission.Hundreds of fires are burning across California, including including 23 major fires or groups of fires that Gov. Gavin Newsom blamed on “this extraordinary weather we’re experiencing and all of these lightning strikes.” He said the state has recorded nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours and knows of 367 fires.Ash and smoke filled the air in San Francisco, which is surrounded by wildfires burning to the north, east and south. The LNU Lightning fire is made up of several fires in five counties north of San Francisco, including in Vacaville, and had consumed 72 square miles (186 square kilometers).Police and firefighters went door-to-door before dawn in a frantic scramble to warn residents to evacuate as flames encroached on Vacaville, a city of about 100,000 between San Francisco and Sacramento. At least 50 structures were destroyed, including some homes, and 50 were damaged.“This is an incredibly emotional and stressful time for most of us who’ve endured a number of wildfires over the last few years,” said Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick.John Gardiner, 60, stayed up all night after receiving an alert from a neighbor of oncoming fire just before midnight. His house and neighbors’ homes were still safe, but he worried that could change with crews anticipating hot winds.“It was incredible — things swirling, winds just whipping through like a howling, ripping sound and then you could hear explosions going off,” he said. “You can taste smoke in your mouth.”Victoria Gregorich, 54, said her family loaded up the car and left their Vacaville home after deputies came around 12:30 a.m. to tell them to evacuate. The fire destroyed her greenhouse, but the house was spared. Her neighbors were not so lucky.“It’s devastating,” she said. “I just thank God we have our home.”Elvis Castaneda, 28, and his father, Silverio, spent the night moving ranching equipment to a safer location, removing vegetation and making firebreaks with their tractor around friends’ properties.“We couldn’t see the flames, but the sky was pretty orange, and we knew it was coming our way,” Elvis Castaneda said.He said he drove home at 3 a.m. and started packing documents, photos, passports and his guns after hearing that his girlfriend’s family, who live 2 miles (3 kilometers) away, were told to evacuate and move all their farm animals to safety. He got the order to leave after dawn Wednesday.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement that the helicopter that crashed was fighting a wildfire in the central part of the state and the pilot was the only one aboard.In eastern San Francisco Bay, a cluster of 20 separate lightning-sparked fires called the SCU Lightning complex was threatening about 1,400 structures in rugged terrain with dense brush. The fires have torched 133 square miles (344 square kilometers).To the south of San Francisco in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, about 22,000 people were ordered to evacuate because of a fire burning in dense wooded parkland that threatened communities, Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox said.About 22 fires are part of the complex and most had been burning in relatively remote, dense brush until strong winds overnight Tuesday pushed them into more populated areas, merging some of the fires together.Resources are strapped, he said, given the number of fires burning in California.“We’re in the unfortunate position where firefighters are going to be spending several days out on the fire line,” he said. “It’s grueling, it’s exhausting.”Christopher Godley, Sonoma County’s emergency management director, also conceded that resources are thin.“It’s difficult to second-guess what the fire commanders are doing with their aircraft. But it’s not like last year when we saw just a huge wealth of resources flowing into the county,” he said. “It is what it is.”The cluster of wine country fires threaten an area that only last year grappled with another massive blaze that forced 200,000 to flee — a task made more complicated this year because of the pandemic.South of Carmel, nearly 50 miles (80 kilometers) of scenic Highway 1 along the coast was closed due to fires.In Southern California, an 8-day-old blaze grew to more than 40 square miles (100 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in northern Los Angeles County mountains.Chewing through century-old fir, oak and pine, the fire continued to be a threat to 4,570 structures after destroying a dozen. Dangerously hot weather and rough terrain challenged firefighters’ efforts to increase containment, currently estimated at 38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-wildfires-chase-people-from-homes-into-smoky-air/story-ARLpYep5DRoumtDCKNNGgJ.html
20-08-2020||World||Closing colleges amid Covid-19 outbreaks ‘could cost lives’, says Donald Trump||President Donald Trump has blasted universities that have cancelled in-person classes amid coronavirus outbreaks, saying the move could ultimately cost lives rather than saving them.Raising the issue at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, Trump said the virus is akin to the seasonal flu for college students and that students pose a greater safety threat at home with older family members than on college campuses. He cited no evidence to support either contention, and the White House did not respond to a request for information about on what Trump based his remarks.Also read: Trump administration rescinds foreign students orderHealth experts have said the novel coronavirus appears to be deadlier than the seasonal flu and more easily transmitted. In addition, most college students are 18 and older and thus considered adults, who are more susceptible to coronavirus illnesses than children.“It’s significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans,” Trump said.While older adults face greater risks from Covid-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last month that otherwise healthy young adults can experience lingering symptoms, including cough, fatigue and body aches, for two to three weeks.Trump’s comments follow recent suspensions of in-person instruction at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at the University of Notre Dame. UNC announced Monday that, after a surge in cases during the first week of classes, all undergraduate courses would shift online. A day later, Notre Dame canceled campus classes for two weeks amid a sharp increase in cases.Also read: Amid Covid-19 crisis, Donald Trump tells schools to ‘reopen or you may lose federal funds’Those schools’ struggles have prompted some other colleges to backtrack on plans for campus classes. Michigan State University told students Tuesday to stay at home for the fall term, citing rising virus cases and the recent experiences of “other institutions.” Clusters of cases at UNC, Notre Dame and elsewhere have been tied to off-campus parties, in some cases at fraternity houses. In his comments Wednesday, Trump did not address health risks tied to students’ off-campus behavior.Trump has said for weeks that schools and colleges must reopen and that they can do so safely. He has threatened to cut funding to schools that don’t reopen, and he threatened to revoke schools’ and colleges’ tax exempt status. The White House says schools are key to the nation’s economic recovery, and Trump has said students need to be in school and on campus to learn.“There’s nothing like campus. There’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board,” Trump said Wednesday.He said there are simple measures universities can take to open safely. “Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness,” he said. “Universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors.” Some colleges, however, say the risks of reopening are too great.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closing-colleges-amid-covid-19-outbreaks-could-cost-lives-says-donald-trump/story-3v8yj88BGgrTihTkOmOKFI.html
20-08-2020||World||Helicopter pilot killed fighting California wildfire||A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday when his aircraft crashed while fighting one of hundreds of wildfires raging in California after lightning storms.California was hit by nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours, sparking 367 fires, with over 50 structures destroyed in Northern California’s wine country where thousands fled their homes, authorities said. In central California, a helicopter was on a water dropping mission in Fresno County about 160 miles (258 km) south of San Francisco when the aircraft crashed, killing the pilot who was the only person aboard, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement.To the north of San Francisco, a group of fires covering over 46,000 acres (18,615 hectares) near the city of Vacaville raced through hills and mountains, destroying 50 homes and other structures.The city of 100,000, about 30 miles southwest of Sacramento, was under a partial evacuation order after flames from the LNU Lightning Complex fire burned west side homes, leaving dead livestock among the properties or wandering around, a Reuters photographer said.To the south, police gave communities west of Fairfield, a city of 117,000, about 30 minutes notice of mandatory evacuations, the Daily Republic newspaper reported. “We are experiencing fires the like of which we haven’t seen in many, many years,” California Governor Gavin Newsom told a press conference, adding that he had requested 375 fire engines from out of state.Fanned by “red-flag” high winds, fires sparked by dry-lightning from rainless thunderstorms are sending flames racing through vegetation parched by a record-breaking heat wave and low humidity. The blazes follow devastating fires across Northern California in 2017 that killed 44, wiped out numerous wineries and destroyed nearly 9,000 homes and other structures.A group of fires called the SCU Lightning Complex, centered about 20 miles east of Palo Alto, more than doubled in size overnight and is now burning over 85,000 acres. The CZU August Lightning Complex, meanwhile, has grown to over 10,000 acres and forced evacuations around 13 miles south of Palo Alto.To the west, drought stricken Colorado faced its second-largest wildfire in history on Wednesday. The Pine Gulch blaze has produced its own weather system with thunder and lightning as it burned across 125,100 acres. It covers an area larger than the city of Denver, in remote mountain terrain about 20 miles north of Grand Junction, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/helicopter-pilot-killed-fighting-california-wildfire/story-fJ5jFsh62vsV5boKIOPW9K.html
20-08-2020||World||Trump pushes UN to renew Iran sanctions in blow to nuclear deal||President Donald Trump said he would call on the United Nations Security Council to restore all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, an attempt to kill off the 2015 nuclear agreement and force Tehran back to the negotiating table.“Mark it down, Iran will never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Wednesday. “We paid a fortune for a failed concept, a failed policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.”The move will set the Trump administration on a collision course with other world powers, including key allies, who say the US doesn’t have the authority to reimpose international sanctions and that they won’t go along. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo will formally propose the “snap back” of sanctions at the UN on Thursday.While many nations are wary of Iran, the US has been almost totally isolated at the UN in its most recent efforts to raise pressure on the Islamic Republic, abandoned by even close allies such as France and the U.K.An effort last week to indefinitely extend an expiring, 13-year-old arms embargo on Iran was defeated in historic fashion: 11 members of the Security Council abstained, with just the Dominican Republic joining the US as China and Russia vetoed the measure.The State Department referenced that rebuke in a statement after Trump spoke on Wednesday.“Secretary Pompeo’s notification to the Council follows its inexcusable failure last week to extend the arms embargo on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and anti-Semitism,” according to the statement. It added that the snapback would extend the arms embargo by default.Since taking office, the Trump administration has used increasingly tough sanctions and diplomatic pressure to try to convince European allies to quit the 2015 nuclear deal, saying Iran used the revenue it got from eased sanctions to finance conflicts from Syria to Yemen without permanently ending Tehran’s ambitions for a nuclear weapon.The president long called the agreement reached during the Obama administration the “worst deal ever,” and his announcement came just hours before President Barack Obama was due to speak at the Democratic convention.Trump has repeatedly said he believes that ending the deal under tough restrictions will convince Iran’s leaders to enter talks on a bigger, better accord that will help foster peace across the entire Middle East.The sanctions did deal a crippling economic blow to Tehran. European allies supportive of the nuclear deal struggled to find a way around the US restrictions, depriving Iran of investment and causing its currency to plunge and widespread shortages of basic goods. But President Hassan Rouhani’s government stood firm and repeatedly ruled out any talks while under the force of what they called “blackmail.”Under the unique “snapback” process outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal, once the US submits its complaint, the Security Council has 30 days to vote on a resolution to continue Iran’s sanctions relief, a move the US could then proceed to veto. If such a resolution is not adopted, UN sanctions that were eased in return for constraints on Iran’s nuclear program would theoretically be restored, effectively killing the Iran nuclear deal.“Any US attempt to reimpose sanctions will be controversial, given the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and likely to create deadlock at the Security Council,” International Crisis Group analysts wrote in a report on Wednesday. “The administration’s goal is clear: Kill the deal or make it that much harder for a successor administration to rejoin it.”The process, as enshrined in a UN resolution, appears straightforward, but every other party to the multinational deal, including America’s European allies, say the US can’t invoke the process from an accord it already quit. They argue that snapback was a right given to the deal’s participants, and since the US said it is no longer a part of the accord, its move will be seen as invalid.Europe will not “support unilateral proposals leading to the return of sanctions,” French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said in June. “They would only deepen divisions in the Security Council and beyond and would not be likely to improve the situation on the ground of nuclear nonproliferation.”Yet the US has a different legal interpretation, arguing that UN Resolution 2231 lists the US as a participant for purposes of snapping back sanctions.The resolution describes the US as a participant of the nuclear agreement and “includes no provision for altering that definition based on the future behavior or activities of the defined parties,” Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has helped guide the Trump administration’s Iran sanctions policies, wrote. “Therefore, the United States remains” a participant “in perpetuity, as defined by” the resolution, he added.Pompeo vowed to hold countries like Russia and China accountable if they refuse to go along with the US declaration that the nuclear deal is void and, instead, move ahead with sales of advanced weapons to Iran once the arms embargo expires in October.“Absolutely,” Pompeo said Wednesday when asked in a Fox News interview whether the US would sanction those countries. “We’ve already done that when we see any country violate our current sanctions, the current American sanctions, we’ve held every nation accountable for that. We’ll do the same thing with respect to the broader UN Security Council sanctions as well.”A Debate Since 2015Supporters of the agreement say it took Iran off a path toward nuclear weapons, but since the day it was reached critics said the deal provided the Tehran government with economic benefits in the short-term without any long-term guarantee that the nation wouldn’t eventually decide to restart its nuclear program.In the years after the accord was reached, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly affirmed that the Iranians were abiding by the accord. But after the US quit the deal and began reimposing sanctions, Iran starting abandoning parts of the agreement, stockpiling enriched uranium beyond agree upon levels but saying it would reverse course if the US returned to the accord.The dispute between the US and the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council could plunge the body into a crisis with no clear path toward a resolution.“It will be one of the worst crises to face the UN Security Council in a generation because the council will be hopelessly divided, without any clarity on how to move forward,” said Richard Nephew, who was the lead sanctions expert for the Obama administration team that negotiated the accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pushes-un-to-renew-iran-sanctions-in-blow-to-nuclear-deal/story-nfMyuosox5NTcyt37s0VuL.html
20-08-2020||World||Trump praises QAnon conspiracists, appreciates support||President Donald Trump praised the supporters of QAnon, a convoluted, pro-Trump conspiracy theory, and suggested he appreciates their support of his candidacy.Speaking during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday, Trump courted the support of those who put stock in the conspiracy theory, saying, “I heard that these are people that love our country.” It was his first public comment on the subject.QAnon has ricocheted around the darker corners of the internet since late 2017, but has been creeping into mainstream politics more and more. The baseless theory centers on an alleged anonymous, high-ranking government official known as “Q” who shares information about an anti-Trump “deep state” often tied to satanism and child sex trafficking.Trump insisted he hadn’t heard much about the movement, “other than I understand they like me very much” and “it is gaining in popularity.” Trump has retweeted QAnon-promoting accounts, and shirts and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans are not uncommon at his rallies.Pressed on QAnon theories that Trump is allegedly saving the nation from a satanic cult of child sex traffickers, Trump claimed ignorance, but asked, “Is that supposed to be a bad thing?” “If I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it,” Trump said.Trump’s comments came a week after he endorsed Marjorie Taylor Greene, who won her GOP House primary runoff in Georgia last week. Greene called the QAnon conspiracy theory “something worth listening to and paying attention to” and called Q a “patriot.” Trump praised her as a “future Republican Star.” Trump has a long history of advancing false and sometimes racist conspiracies, including last week, when he gave credence to a highly criticized op-ed that questioned Democrat Kamala Harris’ eligibility to serve as vice president even though she was born in Oakland, California.Asked about the matter, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris, a Black woman and US-born citizen whose parents were immigrants, does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious,” but later he and his campaign indicated they were not making an issue of the claim. Constitutional lawyers have dismissed it as nonsense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-praises-qanon-conspiracists-appreciates-support/story-hEiLa410WuEdOspCjAs6pI.html
20-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Rise in kids attacking parents in UK lockdown||A ‘pressure cooker’ environment in British homes during lockdown has seen a ‘significant’ rise in children and adolescents attacking parents in already volatile households, a new study by experts at the University of Oxford and Manchester said on Wednesday.Parents told researchers that lockdown pressures had made the problem worse. Being confined at home with a young person was described by one parent as having a ‘cabin fever effect’, while another said lockdown had created a ‘pressure cooker’ environment.The police said more such incidents had been reported by parents during lockdown, but the study says parents suffering such violence are usually reluctant to call the police for fear of adverse consequences for the children and adolescents in police cells.Rachel Condry, professor of criminology at Oxford, says: “Parents are often reluctant to report their child, fearing the consequences of criminalisation….and when they do seek help, it is often not forthcoming.”“Violence can be serious and sustained. Parents describe living in fear of their own child, often for years. It can range from criminal damage in the home and verbal abuse to some of the most serious forms. One mother told us her son ‘beat me so badly that if the police did not come when they did, I would not be alive’.”The situation has been compounded by school and college closures, lack of other services and increased expectations about engaging remotely and home schooling. One parent told the research team, “Everything is amplified, there’s no escape, and it’s not just the person being hurt who’s affected, it’s everyone that sees and hears it. The other children are traumatised by seeing us hurt.”Caroline Miles of the University of Manchester noted that many children who are violent towards their parents have safeguarding needs of their own, having experience trauma of some kind themselves, and/or have mental health problems, learning difficulties, or additional needs.“These children are likely to have found the lockdown especially challenging and may have lost much of their external support network”, she adds.The study called for increased planning and support from central government and local authorities, to prevent young people being criminalised and families being left to cope alone.The study of 104 families, 47 social workers and several police forces took place between April and June 2020, involving an online survey with open-ended questions to ask parents who had experienced violence from a child aged 10-19 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-rise-in-kids-attacking-parents-in-uk-lockdown/story-BEuuNTlrcxFsvhxo4nVPyH.html

She was previously found guilty of one count of failing to disclose information regarding terrorist activity.Her brother Mohuissunnath, who was previously sentenced to life imprisonment, was recorded at home telling his sister that he was “doing another attack”, and asking her for help to practice stabbing people – information which she did not report to police.Commander Richard Smith of the Counter Terrorism Command, said: “There is no acceptable reason for listening to someone say they are planning to kill innocent people, and watching them practice how they will do that, then not reporting it to police”.“Sneha Chowdhury willfully kept her brother’s horrific secret, but not every case has to end this way. If relatives report indications that a loved one is becoming radicalised early on, there is an opportunity for authorities to intervene and help them before they become too deeply entrenched. All it takes is a phone call.”The Woolwich Crown Court jury had earlier found her brother guilty of preparation of acts of terrorism, for a plot to carry out an attack at a tourist hotspot in London; dissemination of a terrorist publication; and possession of information useful to terrorism, for having a guide to carrying out terror attacks on his phone.He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment on July 9, and must serve a minimum of 25 years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sister-who-knew-of-brother-s-terror-plot-jailed/story-DHRbJCCjsEv4FuUya90LdJ.html

Ahead of a Sept. 11 hearing in San Francisco federal court to weigh the request, the Justice Department cited the coronavirus pandemic to argue that Trump properly relied on his “broad authority to suspend the entry of certain aliens.“Their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States in light of the significant economic harm the Covid-19 pandemic continues to inflict on the nation,” the US said in the filing.The groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, sued in July, arguing Trump exceeded his authority when he temporarily halted access to several employment-based visas, affecting hundreds of thousands of people seeking to work in the US The groups say the restrictions will drive talented workers away from the US and to competitors.The president’s order freezes new H-1B and H-4 visas, used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intra-company transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs, including au pairs, through the end of the year.The case is US Chamber of Commerce v. US Department of Homeland Security, 20, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-fight-over-h-1b-visas-donald-trump-points-to-presidential-authority/story-ycW8NCikx8jd2MCbu0CIYJ.html

She said that slogan has become so painful to her it amounted to “emotional abuse.”“It’s not okay to repeat my son’s dying words because it’s all you think you can do ... that hurts me,” the mother said in the posting calling off a march that had been set for Sunday. A separate rally honoring Elijah McClain and other African-Americans slain by law enforcement will go on as scheduled on Saturday at the state capitol in nearby Denver, organizers said.Last week, the McClain family filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against Aurora police officers who applied a carotid chokehold on Elijah McClain, and paramedics who injected him with the powerful sedative ketamine.Elijah McClain was approached and subdued by three policemen on Aug. 24, 2019, responding to a report he was acting suspiciously, though he had committed no crime. He went into cardiac arrest after the encounter and died at a hospital days later.Local prosecutors declined to file charges against police or paramedics, citing an autopsy listing the cause of death as undetermined.The autopsy said that combined with the chokehold, ketamine could have contributed to his death. The family’s lawsuit disputes that he met criteria for injection with the drug. Following a public outcry, Colorado’s attorney general launched two investigations, and the US Justice Department has initiated a civil rights inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mother-of-black-man-who-died-after-encounter-with-police-in-colorado-cancels-rally/story-flxIh0wez2ELXAXN5XsDbI.html
