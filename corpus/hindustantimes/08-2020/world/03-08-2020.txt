03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says TikTok must sell US operations by September 15 or close||President Donald Trump said TikTok will have to close its U.S. operations by Sept. 15 unless there’s a deal to sell the social media network’s American operations.He said that he’s okay with the idea of Microsoft Corp. buying TikTok -- as the company has said it’s negotiating to do -- and that there would have to be a substantial payment to the U.S. as part of the deal.Trump set off a furious scramble over the fate of the Chinese-owned app on Friday, when he said he would ban the company’s operations through an executive action on Saturday. But the weekend passed without any official move from the White House, after the president spoke with Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella about his company’s efforts to purchase the viral video application.Microsoft said in a blog post that it was aiming to complete a deal for TikTok’s operations in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, no later than Sept. 15. The White House had insisted upon that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. It could prove an uphill climb, with key details for the deal -- including price -- still not worked out, people familiar with the discussions said.The White House has said it’s concerned that TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., could be compelled to hand over American users’ data to Beijing or use the app to influence the 165 million Americans, and more than 2 billion users globally, who have downloaded it. And Trump has looked to ratchet up pressure on China ahead of November’s election, frustrated by slow implementation of the trade pact inked earlier this year and the spread of the coronavirus for which he blames China.Trump RallyTeenagers opposed to the president have also used the app to disrupt the president’s campaign activities, including signing up for tickets to the president’s first rally since the beginning of the pandemic, in Tulsa. Attendance at the late June event was far below expectations, and Trump hasn’t held another rally since.In its blog post, Microsoft pledged to add more security, privacy and digital safety protections to the TikTok app and ensure that all private data of Americans be transferred back to the U.S. and deleted from servers outside the country. The company also said it may invite other American investors to take minority stakes in the company.“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns,” the company said. “It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.”Still, U.S. lawmakers and administration officials have favored shutting down the application altogether to send a message to China after Beijing restricted American companies like Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. White House adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said in a pair of interviews with CNN and Fox News that he wasn’t sure Microsoft was the right company to buy TikTok’s U.S. operations, saying it had helped China construct its internet firewall.“Should we trust any company that operates in China?” Navarro told Fox News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-tiktok-must-sell-us-operations-by-september-15-or-close/story-wu95VrlxrOT3cdahAJ2EJM.html
03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump bars US government agencies from outsourcing to foreign workers||President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday that bars federal government agencies from displacing American nationals and citizens with foreign workers. It also calls for prohibiting American employers from using H-1B workers to displace Americans in outsourcing contracts. Indians have been largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme. The White House said in a statement the order will “create a policy where Federal agencies will focus on United States labor in lucrative Federal contracts” as it will be :unfair” for federal government agencies to “ replace perfectly qualified Americans with workers from other countries”.All federal agencies will conduct an internal audit following to order to ensure “only United States citizens and nationals are appointed to the competitive service.”.The executive order also enjoins upon the department of labor, which is responsible for ensuring the fairness of the process of hiring foreign workers, to “finalize guidance to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers’ job sites to displace Americans workers”, in what is called third-arty locations, essentially the practice of outsourcing using foreign workers on H-1B.“President Trump’s actions will help combat employers’ misuse of H-1B visas, which were never intended to replace qualified American workers with low-cost foreign labor,” said the White House.The is a follow-up of the April 2017 “Buy American, Hire American” executive order that unleashed a series of ongoing steps and measures bringing unprecedented scrutiny and tightening of the H-1B visa programme that has been in the crosshairs of the administration’s immigration hardliners.Indian hired by US companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon and US subsidiaries of Indian IT forms Infosys, TCS and Wipro are the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 that are issued every year.A response is awaited from Nasscom, which represents the Indian IT industry.The immediate provocation for the Monday order is the decision in May for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest federally owned power provider, to outsource 20% of its highly skilled tech workers to Accenture, Capgemini and CGI, that are based in Ireland, France and Canada respectively.The White House said TVA’s action could lead to the firing of 200 highly-skilled American tech workers, who will be replaced by “low-wage, foreign workers hired on temporary work visas.” and cost the local economy tens of millions of dollars in the coming 5 years.“So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board,” Trump said at a White House event to sign the order, where he also said he was pushing for the firing of the TVA CEO Jeff Lyash. “If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words ‘you’re fired. You’re fired’.”The Trump administration said outsourcing of hundreds of workers was “especially detrimental in the middle of a pandemic”, which has led to millions of job-losses. Trump has also suspended the H-1B visa programme — as well as Green Cards — to ensure Americans get the first shot at jobs becoming available now as the economy struggles to get back to normalcy, from record job losses.It also sought to frame the practice of outsourcing, with a new twists, asa “national security risk”, if linked to IT jobs that involve sensitive information. The reference was probably to the country’s growing estrangement from China, which the Trump administration has accused of theft of intellectual property rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-bars-us-government-agencies-from-outsourcing-to-foreign-workers/story-ifzkwfjOBL1Uq3zYFqtaeL.html
03-08-2020||World||Donald Trump takes disciplinary action against TVA leadership||President Donald Trump said Monday that he had fired the chair of the Tennessee Valley Authority claiming it has betrayed American workers.Trump told reporters at the White House that he was formally removing the authority’s chair of the board and another member of the board and threatened to remove other board members if they keep hiring foreign labor.The TVA is a federally owned corporation created in 1933 to provide flood control, electricity generation, fertilizer manufacturing and economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region that was hard hit by the Great Depression. The region covers most of Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Kentucky as well as small sections of Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.He said the TVA board must immediately hire a new chief executive officer that “puts the interests of Americans first.”U.S. Tech Workers, a nonprofit that wants to limit visas given to foreign technology workers, took out an ad to persuade Trump to stop the TVA from outsourcing much of its information technology division. The group, led by Kevin Lynn, criticized the TVA for furloughing its own workers and replacing them with contractors using foreign workers with H-1B visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-takes-disciplinary-action-against-tva-leadership/story-OdhBwVByFlPY4QYhIjNwCN.html

03-08-2020||World||Sorry, boomers: Millennials and younger are new US majority||Sorry, boomers. Millennials and their younger siblings and children now make up a majority of the U.S. population.A new analysis by the Brookings Institution shows that 50.7% of U.S. residents were under age 40, as of July 2019.The Brookings’ analysis of population estimates released this summer by the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the combined millennial, Generation Z and younger generations numbered 166 million people. The combined Generation X, baby boomer, and older cohorts represented 162 million U.S. residents.“To many Americans — especially baby boomers themselves — this news may come as a shock. For them, the term “millennial” has been associated with a youthful, often negative, vibe in terms of habits, ideology, and politics,” William Frey, a senior fellow at Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, wrote in the analysis. “Now, the oldest millennial is 39, and with their numbers exceeding those of baby boomers, the millennial generation is poised to take over influential roles in business and government.”Those under age 40 are more diverse than the older cohorts, with almost half identifying as being part of a racial or ethnic minority. Past surveys show that the younger generations split from the older generations on issues such as immigration reform, criminal justice reform and environmental protection, and the pandemic and recent racial justice protests are likely to galvanize the younger groups to promote an array of progressive causes, Frey wrote.Millennials typically are defined as being born between 1981 and 1996. Baby boomers, long considered a primary driver of demographic and social change in the U.S. because of their large numbers, were born between the end of World War II and the arrival of the Beatles in the U.S. in 1964.Squeezed between the boomers and millennials, Generation Xers were born in the late 1960s and 1970s. Members of Generation Z were born after 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sorry-boomers-millennials-and-younger-are-new-us-majority/story-UeAVKvjCrrAmVjzou3MkMJ.html

Officials fear children could become coronavirus carriers, infecting relatives at home. Students will not return to classrooms until the government’s version of a stoplight to evaluate the pandemic’s risk is safely at green.In remote indigenous communities, instruction will be carried on government radio. Some 140 million free textbooks will be distributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-school-year-to-begin-with-instruction-on-television/story-2lJC1tZoLI9FzIhsta0XkJ.html
03-08-2020||World||Anxious WHO implores world to ‘do it all’ in long war on Covid-19||The World Health Organization warned on Monday that there might never be a “silver bullet” for Covid-19 in the form of a perfect vaccine and that the road to normality would be long, with some countries requiring a reset of strategy.More than 18.14 million people around the world are reported to have been infected with the disease and 688,080​ have died, according to a Reuters tally, with some nations that thought they were over the worst experiencing a resurgence.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and WHO emergencies head Mike Ryan exhorted nations to rigorously enforce health measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, hand-washing and testing.“The message to people and governments is clear: ‘Do it all’,” Tedros told a virtual news briefing from the U.N. body’s headquarters in Geneva. He said face masks should become a symbol of solidarity round the world.“A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection. However, there’s no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be.”The WHO head said that, while the coronavirus was the biggest health emergency since the early 20th century, the international scramble for a vaccine was also “unprecedented”.But he underscored uncertainties. “There are concerns that we may not have a vaccine that may work, or its protection could be for just a few months, not more. But until we finish the clinical trials, we will not know.”“THE WAY OUT IS LONG”Ryan said countries with high transmission rates, including Brazil and India, needed to brace for a big battle: “The way out is long and requires a sustained commitment,” he said, calling for a “reset” of approach in some places.“Some countries are really going to have to take a step back now and really take a look at how they are addressing the pandemic within their national borders,” he added.Asked about the U.S. outbreak, which White House coronavirus experts say is entering a “new phase”, he said officials seemed to have set out the “right path” and it was not the WHO’s job to do so.The WHO officials said an advance investigation team had concluded its China mission and laid out the groundwork for further efforts to identify the origins of the virus.The study is one of the demands made by top donor the United States which plans to leave the body next year, accusing it of being too acquiescent to China.A larger, WHO-led team of Chinese and international experts is planned next, including in the city of Wuhan, although the timing and composition of that was unclear. Ryan said China had already given some information but knowledge gaps remained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anxious-who-implores-world-to-do-it-all-in-long-war-on-covid-19/story-2Hs7NNpsO9oEXjSX99NQ9N.html
03-08-2020||World||Beijing accuses US of harassing Chinese students, researchers||China on Monday accused the United States of “monitoring, harassing and willfully detaining” Chinese students and researchers in the U.S.Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin’s comments follow the denial of a bail request in California for a university researcher accused of lying about her ties to China’s military and governing Communist Party to gain access to the United States.Wang also criticized the Trump administration for imposing sanctions on a major paramilitary organization in the country’s western Xinjiang region and on two officials for alleged human rights abuses against ethnic and religious minorities.Wang said China had no intention of helping Juan Tang escape from the United States, but did not otherwise comment directly on the accusations against her.However, he said China urges the U.S. to “handle the case fairly in accordance with the law and ensure the safety and legitimate rights and interests” due to Tang.“For some time, the U.S., with ideological prejudice, keeps monitoring, harassing and willfully detaining Chinese students and researchers, and making presumptions of guilt against Chinese researchers,” Wang said.“The U.S. actions have seriously violated the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and severely disrupted the normal cultural and personnel exchanges between China and the U.S., which amounts to outright political persecution,” he said.In denying bail, U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Barnes said Tang, 37, would have reason to leave the country if released. Tang has been held without bail since July 23 when she was arrested after she left the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco to seek medical care for her asthma.Tang, who has a doctorate in cellular biology, entered the United States on Dec. 27, 2019, to work at the University of California, Davis, as a visiting researcher in the Department of Radiation Oncology, Alexandra Negin, an assistant federal public defender, said in her filing asking the court for her release on bail. The lab closed because of the coronavirus pandemic and Tang had been preparing to return to China, Negin said.Tang and three other scientists living in the U.S. face charges of lying about their status as members of China’s People’s Liberation Army, or PLA. All were charged with visa fraud, the Justice Department said.Tang was the last of the four to be arrested after the Justice Department accused the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco of harboring a known fugitive.Negin said Tang went to the consulate to seek help and remained there after FBI agents questioned her at her Davis apartment on June 20 and executed a search warrant, seizing her passport and visa.Agents found photographs of Tang in a uniform of the civilian cadre of the PLA and also reviewed articles from China that identified her military affiliation. Negin argued that the evidence against Tang is based on old photographs from when she was a student at a medical school run by the military and documents that were translated on apps.Wang said the U.S. State and Treasury Department penalties targeting the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps “seriously interfered in China’s internal affairs and violated the basic norms of international relations.”The sanctions hit the corps, its commander and former political commissar for alleged abuses against Uighur Muslims, including mass arbitrary detentions, forced labor and torture. They freeze any assets the targets may have in U.S. jurisdictions, and perhaps more significantly, bar Americans from doing business with them,Wang repeated China’s assertion that it has been acting against violence, terrorism and separatism and that “Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, ethnic groups, or religions at all.”China has used that in an attempt to deflect international condemnation of its internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in prison-like camps that it calls re-education and job training centers, along with other abuses.The corps acts like a parallel government in the vast, resource-rich region, operating its own schools, courts and a large network of businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-accuses-us-of-harassing-chinese-students-researchers/story-S54MxY1laLe2tsLdeH9wfM.html
03-08-2020||World||Afghan troops retake prison attacked by IS group; 29 killed||Afghan forces said they retook a prison in the country’s east on Monday afternoon, following an hours-long battle a day after the facility was targeted by the Islamic State group in an attack that killed 29 people. The prison is believed to be holding hundreds of IS members.The attack highlighted the challenges ahead for Afghanistan, even as U.S. and NATO forces begin to withdraw following America striking a peace deal with the Taliban.Defense Ministry spokesman Fawad Aman said the prison was taken back in the afternoon. The fighting also left at least 50 wounded.Even as Afghan troops seized the prison in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, some 115 kilometers (70 miles) east of Kabul, IS militants continued to fire on Afghan security forces from a nearby neighborhood.Sporadic gunfire rang out from nearby residential buildings in central Jalalabad, an area of high security near the provincial governor’s office.As security forces swept through the prison, they found the bodies of two Taliban prisoners apparently killed by the Islamic State group, showing the tensions between the two militant factions battling each other in eastern Afghanistan.The 29 dead included civilians, prisoners, guards and Afghan security forces, said Attaullah Khogyani, the provincial governor’s spokesman.The attack began Sunday, when an Islamic State suicide bomber drove a car laden with explosives up to the prison’s main gate, detonating the bomb. Islamic State militants opened fire on the prison’s guards and poured in through the breach.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province and headquartered in Nangarhar province, later claimed responsibility for the attack.Some of the 1,500 prisoners held at the prison in Jalalabad escaped during the fighting. Khyogyani said about 1,000 prisoners who earlier escaped had been found by security forces across the city. It wasn’t immediately clear if any prisoners were still at large.The attack came a day after authorities said Afghan special forces killed a senior Islamic State commander near Jalalabad. Several hundred prisoners in Jalalabad are believed to be Islamic State members.While the Islamic State group has seen its so-called caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria eliminated after a yearslong campaign, the group has continued fighting in Afghanistan. The extremists also have battled the Taliban in the country, whom the U.S. overthrew following the 2001 American-led invasion after the Sept. 11 attacks.The Taliban’s political spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, told The Associated Press that his group was not involved in the Jalalabad attack. The U.S. struck a peace deal with the Taliban in February. A second, crucial round of negotiations between the Taliban and the political leadership in Kabul has yet to start.The Taliban had declared a three-day cease-fire starting last Friday for the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. The cease-fire expired at 12 a.m. Monday, though it wasn’t immediately clear if it would be extended as the U.S. pushes for an early start to intra-Afghan negotiations that have repeatedly been delayed since Washington signed the peace deal with the Taliban.“We have a cease-fire and are not involved in any of these attacks anywhere in the country,” Shaheen said.The Taliban also had denied being involved in a suicide bombing in eastern Logar province late Thursday that killed at least nine people and wounded 40.Afghanistan has seen a recent spike in violence, with most attacks claimed by the local IS affiliate.___Faiez reported from Kabul, Afghanistan. Associated Press writer Kathy Gannon in Islamabad contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-troops-retake-prison-attacked-by-is-group-29-killed/story-qr7qwaDfJ7ciIYxwauJH2L.html
03-08-2020||World||Pak army tries to corner Supreme Court’s tough judge. It is worried about 2023||Prime Minister Imran Khan and the army’s joint effort to embarrass and oust Supreme Court judge Qazi Faez Isa is driven by the establishment’s 2023 worry when the judge, who has taken a tough line on the army, is slated to be elevated as the country’s Chief Justice. Justice Isa, who was elevated to Pakistan’s top court in 2014, riled the army brass and Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf by his verdicts that have been unsparing of the establishment and Pakistan’s deep state.A 10-judge bench of the Supreme Court on June 19 cancelled a May 2019 presidential reference to the Supreme Court Judicial Council that wanted action against Justice Isa, accusing him of concealing foreign properties of his wife and children in his declaration of assets. But the bench didn’t close the case and ordered the Federal Board of Revenue to probe the charge and send its report to the top court.Last month, Justice Isa’s wife Sarina Isa filed her statement with the Federal Board of Revenue in compliance with the top court order.But she isn’t giving up. Sarina Isa has also challenged this part of the top court’s order, according to a report in Dawn newspaper. It is the fourth review petition filed against the 7-3 majority verdict that ordered tax authorities to probe three offshore properties owned by her and her children. Three bar associations including Pakistan’s Supreme Court Bar Association have filed separate petitions backing the outspoken judge known for his impeccable integrity.Justice Isa, who has mostly let his verdicts do the talking, was equally unsparing when he challenged the presidential reference, wondering why his wife - an independent taxpayer - was treated as his dependent when she paid as much tax as Prime Minister Imran Khan or more.Pakistan watchers say Justice Isa - son of a leading Pakistani politician and a close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah - got on the wrong side of Pakistan’s deep state when he ticked off the powerful armed forces, which have ruled for nearly half of Pakistan’s history and have resumed a more active role in politics in recent years.“The involvement of ISI and of the members of the Armed Forces in politics, media and other ‘unlawful activities’ should have stopped,” the Supreme Court bench, which comprised Qazi Faez Isa along with Justice Mushir Alam said in the February verdict.The judgment ordered the government to prosecute those spreading hate, besides telling the defence minister and the Army chief to initiate action against armed forces for violating their oath. It was a reference to Punjab Rangers director General Major General Azhar Naveed and then head of internal security section of ISI, Major General Faiz Hamid, in negotiating with the cleric to end the Faizabad protest led by a hardline Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik’s that paralysed the capital Islamabad in 2017 .It wasn’t a first for Justice Isa. In 2016, an inquiry commission headed by Justice Isa to investigate a terrorist attack on a hospital in Quetta that killed dozens of lawyers, had severely criticised security agencies and asked the government to act against extremist organisations.Pakistan watchers in Delhi say the army was determined to carry out its plan to remove Justice Isa since he could challenge the authority of Pakistan Army and possibly become one of the power centers in the country when he takes over as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2023.It is not a coincidence that Farogh Naseem, lawyer of former President Gen Pervez Musharraf, who was inducted as law minister at the request of the army in 2018, prepared the reference against Justice Isa, putting the government on a collision course with a segment of the judiciary.“There is a historical context to why the army wants Justice Isa out,” said a Pakistan watcher in the Indian government.Gen Musharrafwas the last Pakistan ruler to have gone this far to browbeat the judiciary back in 2007 when he tried to pressurise then Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry to resign, drew up a presidential reference and then suspended him.Gen Musharraf had to reinstate Chief Justice Chaudhary after thousands of lawyers hit the streets but imposed Emergency a few months later in November 2007 and cracked down on judges and lawyers. His government was routed in the next election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-tries-to-corner-supreme-court-s-tough-judge-it-is-worried-about-2023/story-0YFjzadavRHw7sDrpW5RlO.html

The death toll in the U.S. has reached about 155,000, and cases are rising in numerous states.Dunn’s East Baton Rouge district has asked employees to begin work this week, while students are set to begin virtual classes next week. School officials have said they hope to begin in-person classes after Labor Day.“My family works. I have no one I can take her to and say, `OK, at 12 o’clock you are going to have to start working online with her for school,’” Dunn said.Parents in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee are among those who will be the first to navigate the new academic year as schools open up in parts of those states this week.In Indiana, where schools reopened last week for the first time since a pandemic-driven nationwide shutdown in March, a student at Greenfield-Central Junior High School tested positive for the coronavirus on the first day back to class.School Superintendent Harold Olin said the student was tested days earlier and attended class before receiving the results. The student was isolated in the school clinic, while school nurses worked to identify other youngsters or staff who may have had close contact with the student.“This really does not change our plans,” Olin said. “We knew that we would have a positive case at some point in the fall. We simply did not think it would happen on Day One.”Schools in Hawaii were supposed to reopen Tuesday, but the teachers union led a move to delay that until Aug 17.Most schools in the state are planning a hybrid approach, with students alternating between in-person classes and online instruction. Some schools will have full in-person instruction for lower grade levels, but only a few schools will offer a full-time, in-person return.Many school districts around the country had offered parents a choice of at least some in-person classes or remote instruction. But an uptick in Covid-19 cases in many states has prompted districts to scrap in-person classes at least for the start of the school year, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington.Dunn said she hopes her daughter will be able to attend in-person classes at her school after Labor Day. But even if she does, that will not ease Dunn’s mind completely.“I’m definitely going to worry,” she said. “I will send her to in-person classes, but if I hear of the spread of COVID at the school, then I’d have to rethink it all over again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parents-struggle-as-schools-reopen-amid-coronavirus-surge/story-CdG6oVkGQDaEWFF96DKQZI.html

03-08-2020||World||Covid-19: UK ramps up tests, vaccine delivery plan||A test to detect coronavirus in 90 minutes and a ‘fill and finish’ partnership with pharma major Wockhardt for vaccine delivery were unveiled on Monday, as a senior scientist criticised ‘shroud of secrecy’ in the Boris Johnson government’s decision-making. Business secretary Alok Sharma announced the agreement with Wockhardt that follows similar previous partnerships to secure early access to millions of vaccine doses from AstraZeneca for the University of Oxford vaccine, BioNTech/Pfizer alliance, Valneva and GSK/Sanofi.The agreements have been reached in the hope that various vaccine trials, including the Oxford candidate vaccine, will be conclusively proved to be effective against the virus later this year. There have been 46,201 deaths and 304,695 cases in the UK as of Sunday.The 18-month agreement with Wockhardt based in north Wales to carry out the ‘fill and finish’ stage of the manufacturing process involves dispensing the manufactured vaccine substance into vials ready for it to be distributed.Sharma said: “Ensuring the UK has the capability to research, develop and manufacture a safe and effective vaccine is critical in our fight against coronavirus. Today we have secured additional capacity to manufacture millions of doses of multiple Covid-19 candidates, guaranteeing the supply of vaccines we need to protect people across the UK rapidly and in large numbers”.Announcing the 90-minute test, health secretary Matt Hancock said it is part of two new tests – one for coronavirus and another for flu – that will be rolled out to increase testing capacity before winter sets in, when flu and other season-related ailments occupy the National Health Service.The tests, he said, do not require a trained health professional to operate them, meaning they can be rolled out in more non-clinical settings.Hancock said: “Millions of new rapid coronavirus tests will provide on-the-spot results in under 90 minutes, helping us to break chains of transmission quickly. The fact these tests can detect flu as well as Covid-19 will be hugely beneficial as we head into winter, so patients can follow the right advice to protect themselves and others”.Meanwhile, Nobel laureate Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute in London, alleged that important decisions throughout the pandemic had been made in what he called a “black box” of scientists, civil servants and politicians, calling for more transparency and scrutiny.He told The Guardian that the alleged failure to be more open about pivotal decisions, and the basis on which they were reached, meant it had been impossible to challenge emerging policy, a situation that put public trust at risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-ramps-up-tests-vaccine-delivery-plan/story-KhaganetLBV3kwcZOszqhN.html
03-08-2020||World||British woman who stabbed her husband to death avoids gallows, jailed for 42 months||A British woman accused of stabbing her husband to death at their Malaysian resort home avoided the gallows and was sentenced to 42 months in jail on Monday after she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.Lawyer Sangeet Kaur Deo said prosecutors reduced the murder charge against Samantha Jones, 51, to culpable homicide, which is murder without intent, after the defense appealed to the attorney-general’s office.A conviction for murder carries a mandatory death sentence by hanging.“I was scared, and he was so angry,” Kaur quoted Jones as telling the court as she sought a lighter penalty before sentencing. “I miss him terribly. What I did that night was unintended. I tried to stop him, I did not know it would happen like this.”In addition to the 42-month jail sentence, Kaur said Jones was also fined 10,000 ringgit ($2,368).“She is very relieved having come to terms with what happened that night and for the court ... to understand what happened that night. She didn’t intend for this to happen,” the lawyer told reporters later at the end of the hearing.Wearing handcuffs and a surgical mask, Jones was earlier escorted by police into the courthouse in Alor Setar in northern Kedah state for the start of the trial. She was charged nearly two years ago after police found a blood-stained kitchen knife in the couple’s home where John William Jones was found dead on Oct. 18, 2018.The 63-year-old victim, who was drunk at the time, had a 15-centimeter (six-inch) wound in his liver, according to prosecutors. Police have said Jones confessed she stabbed her husband in the chest during a heated argument.The couple moved to tropical Langkawi island 11 years ago under the Malaysia My Second Home program, which gives foreigners long-stay visas.The lawyer said the couple, who had been married for 17 years, were devoted to each other but Jones was struggling with physical violence by her husband.“Unfortunately Samantha found herself at the receiving end of abuse. She supported John through various therapies to address certain problems that he had, none of which worked obviously, until that unfortunate night when things took a turn for the worst,” Kaur said.“She has accepted the fact that she needs to serve the sentence. She acknowledged the fact that a life is lost and I think she is looking forward to her own recovery because this was indeed a traumatizing event for her,” the lawyer added.Kaur said Jones, who has spent 20 months in detention, could be released as early as the end of next year with one-third off the sentence for good behavior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-woman-who-stabbed-her-husband-to-death-avoids-gallows-jailed-for-42-months/story-ylSYaV2K5N6Heq2rpn8PeL.html
03-08-2020||World||Thousands remain evacuated from Southern California wildfire||Evacuation orders remained in place early Monday for thousands of people after a wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles exploded in size and forced crews to battle flames in triple-digit heat.The Apple Fire in Riverside County consumed more than 31 square miles (about 80 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.As of Monday morning, it was 5% contained. The cause was under investigation.Officials allowed flames to run up the side of Mount San Gorgonio, an 11,000-foot (3,350-meter) peak, because it wasn’t safe to let crews work in such steep, rugged terrain, said Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the US Forest Service.“We don’t want to put firefighters in a dangerous situation,” Cox told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. “It’s burning in a straight line up a mountain.” The blaze began as two adjacent fires reported Friday evening in Cherry Valley, an unincorporated area near the city of Beaumont about 85 miles (137 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.Flames leapt along brushy ridge tops and came close to homes while firefighters attacked it from the ground and air.One home and two outbuildings were destroyed, Cal Fire said. No injuries were reported.Evacuation orders and advisories were issued for about 8,000 people in mountain, canyon and foothill neighbourhoods. Campgrounds and hiking trails were closed in the San Gorgonio Wilderness area of the San Bernardino National Forest.A huge smoke plume was visible for miles around and contributed to poor air quality.The mercury hit 109 degrees (43 Celsius) Sunday in nearby Palm Springs. The National Weather Service said “dangerously hot conditions” were expected to continue because of high pressure over much of Southern California.To the north, the Pond Fire in San Luis Obispo County was 10% contained Sunday after burning more than 2 square miles of (6 square kilometres) brush east of Santa Margarita. The blaze destroyed two structures but officials said it was unclear whether they were homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-remain-evacuated-from-southern-california-wildfire/story-C7vhtlGdvRSfwVKok9FiBO.html

It will take six months just to tune the organ, and its music isn’t expected to resound again through the medieval Paris monument until 2024, according to the state agency overseeing Notre Dame’s restoration.Amazingly, the 8,000-pipe organ survived the April 2019 fire that consumed the cathedral’s roof and toppled its spire. But the blaze coated the instrument in toxic lead dust that must now be painstakingly removed.And while the organ didn’t burn, it did suffer damage from a record heatwave last summer and has been affected by other temperature variations it’s been exposed to since the 12th-century cathedral lost its roof, the agency said.Experts stared removing the organ’s keyboards Monday and will then take out its pipes in a dismantling process that will last through the end of this year, according to the restoration agency. The pieces will be placed in special containers inside the huge cathedral, where the cleaning and restoration will take place.The general who leads the agency said the organ, which dates from 1733, will next play again on April 16, 2024, marking five years since the fire.President Emmanuel Macron hopes the cathedral can reopen in time for the 2024 Olympics in Paris. But it’s taken more than a year to clear out dangerous lead residue and scaffolding that had been in place before the fire for a previous renovation effort, and reconstruction of the landmark has yet to begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/notre-dame-cathedral-s-organ-getting-4-year-long-cleaning/story-CznBmzRyJu6NA7MFElPcPL.html
03-08-2020||World||Unusual coalition taking shape in Canada; Hong Kongers, Tibetans and others protest against China||From agitated Hong Kongers and members of the Tibetan diaspora to angry Indians after the Galwan Valley face-off and even progressive Iranians, an unusual coalition is taking shape in Canada to collectively protest against the Chinese government in cities across the country.A series of such protests have taken place since late June when the Regional Tibetan Youth Congress in Toronto staged a protest near the Chinese Consulate in solidarity with India and against China’s actions in Ladakh. Since then, protests have occurred in Vancouver, more in Toronto and Montreal.On Saturday, a rally was organized in downtown Toronto and among those who participated was Gloria Fung, president of Canada-Hong Kong Link - a platform for 15 groups countering China’s moves in Hong Kong including a recent national security law.Also read: Finger Area in focus as India, China hold talks“I do not support China’s move towards India, that’s the reason why I participated in this rally. I would like us to show our solidarity to each other because we are facing a common threat,” she said of her presence at the Toronto rally.The Hong Kongers have been agitating against China for the past couple of years and held a major rally in Toronto last August, as did Tibetan immigrants to Canada. Sunny Sonam, vice-president of RTYC in Toronto, said they had to take advantage of the reality that the world was “right now focused on China” partly due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and because of its actions in Hong Kong and the Galwan Valley. And while the Tibetan community has held many protests over the years against the Chinese occupation of the plateau, their cause is getting a lift because of the current circumstances, as he said, “Because of that, Tibetan people are getting more attention.”Other disparate groups have also joined in these marches and demonstrations against China in Canada, including Taiwanese and Vietnamese-origin Canadians, even Bangladeshi minorities. Toronto-based Salman Sina of the International Human Rights Centre in Canada helmed protests in July in the city and this Sunday in Montreal. A refugee from Iran, Sina said of his motivation, “As human rights defenders, we are seeing what’s going on with the Uighurs, Tibetans and Hong Kong because of China. I decided to unite people suffering because of the Chinese regime. Unity is better than division. We have a common cause.”Such protests also have resonance in Canada because two citizens, including a former diplomat, have spent more than 600 days in prison in China in what Ottawa has described as “hostage diplomacy” by Beijing in retaliation against the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei in Vancouver in late 2018.As Fung prepares for a large protest in August in Toronto, she is hopeful there will be greater cooperation and collaboration between these groups going ahead, as she said, “We hope to invite other communities and civil society organisations to come together for a unified voice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unusual-coalition-taking-shape-in-canada-hong-kongers-tibetans-and-others-protest-against-china/story-295gw5XBUz01lc5pmZvQWP.html
03-08-2020||World||Who should be the first in line for Covid-19 vaccine? Experts debate||The entire world is racing to find a vaccine for the coronavirus disease which has affected millions of people. There are nearly 100 vaccine candidates which are in different phases of research and trials.The researchers from Oxford University recently shared the results of their vaccine candidate’s human trials. But now, a debate has been raging on: Who gets to be first in line for a Covid-19 vaccine?There is no set protocol or guidelines for now to decide on how to ration doses. For experts, it is a vexing issue.“Not everybody’s going to like the answer,” said Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. “There will be many people who feel that they should have been at the top of the list,” he recently told one of the advisory groups the government asked to help decide.Traditionally, first in line for a scarce vaccine are health workers and the people most vulnerable to the targeted infection.But Collins gave it a new spin. He wants people where an outbreak is hitting hardest to be given priority.And then there are volunteers who are helping various pharmaceutical firms in human trials of the vaccine. Moderna and Pfizer began tests last week that eventually will include 30,000 volunteers each. AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax are next in line to go for human trials and will require a large number of volunteers.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has also given a suggestion: The vaccine should be given to most critical health, national security and other essential workers. Next in line would be those over 65 who live in long-term care facilities, or those of any age who are in poor health - or who also are deemed essential workers. The general population would come later. And then, there is of course the rich vs poor divide.The World Health Organisation (WHO) is also facing this dilemma as it wants to fairly distribute the Covid-19 vaccine to poor countries.Last month, eight world leaders came together demanding equitable access to coronavirus disease vaccine when it is developed. Leaders of Canada, Spain, New Zealand, South Korea, Ethiopia and three other countries sought cooperation from various countries in manufacturing and distributing a Covid-19 vaccine.They jointly published an oopnion piece in the Washington Post where the leaders called vaccine as the “most powerful public health tool”. They also said that vaccine distribution, if managed successfully, will be a “cornerstone of strengthening multilateralism for the future”.For now, health experts are devising innovative strategies to make the Covid-19 vaccine available to as many people as possible. Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s effort to speed vaccine manufacturing and distribution, is working out how to rapidly transport the right number of doses to wherever vaccinations are set to occur.Drive-through vaccinations, pop-up clinics and other innovative ideas are all on the table, said CDC’s Dr Nancy Messonnier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-will-be-the-first-in-line-for-covid-19-vaccine-experts-debate/story-6FGrW9t6LdjnuRCBIw3KAL.html

The tests will help “break chains of transmission quickly,” he said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageJohnson’s government, which has been criticized for locking down too slowly at the start of the UK outbreak, is making preparations for flare-ups in the fall and winter. Ministers have been reviewing possible responses and The Sunday Times reported they war-gamed sealing off London from the rest of the country in a meeting last week.A report published Monday by the Institute for Government and the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy said cuts to budgets since Johnson’s Conservatives came to power in 2010 meant vital services were understaffed and poorly equipped when the virus hit the UK in February. Ministers had failed to learn the lessons of pandemic simulation exercises, it said.“Greater investment in staff, buildings and equipment would have left services far better placed to respond to coronavirus,” Nick Davies, program director at the IFG said in a statement. “The government must learn from these mistakes, reflect on where public services are least resilient, and ensure key services are better prepared for either a second wave of coronavirus or any future pandemic.”‘Major incident’Ministers are seeking to damp down spikes of the virus while rebooting the economy, which is facing its worst recession in 300 years. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick denied newspaper reports that the government plans to close pubs and said curbs on the movements of everyone over the age of 50 is “not something being actively considered.”The reports came days after Johnson reintroduced restrictions in northwest England and postponed the planned easing of nationwide lockdown measures. On Sunday evening, emergency and public services organizations in Greater Manchester declared a “major incident” to improve their response to a surge in infections.Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said the government should make it clear that Asian communities in the northwest are at the center of the renewed outbreak in the area.“British Asians -- a diverse group -- are more likely to work in frontline jobs and live in larger multi generational households,” he said on Twitter. “These factors put them at risk. Let’s be honest about it to protect the most vulnerable.”Range of optionsPossible measures if infection rates spike elsewhere include locking down the capital and tightening quarantine rules on those flying into the UK, the Sunday Telegraph reported. There could be travel curbs in and out of the M25 highway encircling Greater London and a ban on overnight stays if there’s a surge in cases, the Sunday Times said.Johnson’s office said the reports were “speculation” but Jenrick said it is right for ministers to keep responses to all possible scenarios under review.“You’d expect the government to be considering the range of all the options,” Jenrick, who said he wasn’t aware of the plan to seal off London, told Times Radio on Sunday. “We don’t want to do anything that’s a blanket approach across the country; our strategy is to manage this in a localized way with targeted action.”Oxford Nanopore Technologies said its initial order from the government is for 450,000 of its LamPORE tests, which use DNA and RNA sequencing to detect the virus. There is potential to scale up to millions of tests per month, the company said in a statement.DnaNudge said it will provide 5.8 million tests along with processing equipment in a deal worth about 161 million pounds ($211 million). The technology allows doctors and nurses to quickly determine whether patients are infected in emergency settings and before undergoing surgery, cancer care and other procedures, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-buys-fast-covid-19-tests-in-readiness-for-winter-resurgence/story-iPXwwb3qZmHvuLyziAXJSI.html

Trump said on Friday he was planning to ban TikTok in the United States after dismissing the idea of a sale to Microsoft.But following a discussion between Trump and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the Redwood, Washington-based company said in a statement that it would continue negotiations to acquire TikTok from ByteDance, and that it aimed to reach a deal by Sept. 15.It was not immediately clear what changed Trump’s mind. Several prominent Republican lawmakers put out statements in the last two days urging him to back a sale of TikTok to Microsoft.The negotiations between ByteDance and Microsoft will be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a US government panel that has the right to block any agreement, the sources added.“Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President’s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury,” Microsoft said in a statement.ByteDance and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Under the proposed deal, Microsoft said it would take over TikTok’s operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It said it would ensure that all private data of TikTok’s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States.Microsoft may invite other American investors to acquire minority stakes in TikTok, the company added.

Facebook issued a statement saying it complied due to the threat of criminal liability for an employee in Brazil.But it called the new order “extreme”. The company said it would appeal to the full court.Facebook also argued it had complied with the previous order by “restricting the ability for the target Pages and Profiles to be seen from IP locations in Brazil”.Moraes also had ruled Twitter should block the accounts. While Twitter said then the decision was “disproportionated” under Brazil’s freedom of speech rules and that it would appeal, the targeted profiles were disabled.Moraes is overseeing a controversial probe into whether some of Bolsonaro’s allies are running a social media network aimed at spreading threats and fake news against Supreme Court justices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-shuts-pro-bolsonaro-accounts-following-sc-s-order/story-pD64yTcgUyrps5jTvr0UOI.html

Declaring a “state of disaster”, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said Melbourne would move to Stage 4 restrictions until September 13 given “unacceptably high” levels of community transmission.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe harshest rules in Australia to date will see city residents face a curfew from 8 pm to 5 am for the next six weeks. Only those carrying out essential work, or seeking or providing care, will be allowed out. Six months after the UN health agency declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 680,000 people.Even as South Africa accounted for more than half of diagnosed infections in Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the fatality rate is lower than the global average. Health authorities had been expecting a surge in cases after the gradual loosening of a strict lockdown that was imposed at the end of March.An emergency WHO committee reviewing the pandemic “highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of the outbreak, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts”.“WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” it said in its latest statement.

03-08-2020||World||TikTok acquisition talks on hold||Negotiations for Microsoft to buy the US operations of Chinese-owned TikTok are on hold after President Donald Trump threatened to bar the social media app and came out against the sale, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.Trump has pledged to get tough on the massively popular video-sharing app, which US officials have said could be a tool for Chinese intelligence -- a claim the firm, owned by Chinese internet giant ByteDance, has repeatedly denied.Also read: What US ban on Chinese app TikTok would meanWhile there has been no sign yet of the ban he threatened on Friday to impose, his words were reportedly already adding to uncertainties for TikTok.“Before Mr. Trump’s remarks, the two sides believed the broad strokes of a deal could be in place by Monday,” the paper reported on a possible TikTok-Microsoft sale, citing unnamed sources.It also said Trump’s threats and opposition to the deal had prompted TikTok to make further concessions, including adding up to 10,000 jobs in the US over the next three years.TikTok defended itself on Saturday, with its general manager for the US, Vanessa Pappas, telling users that the company was working to give them “the safest app,” amid US concerns over data security. “We’re not planning on going anywhere,” Pappas said in a message released on the app.TikTok, especially popular with young audiences who create and watch its short-form videos, has an estimated one billion users worldwide. It has grown even faster as the coronavirus pandemic has pushed people physically away from each other, but into close contact online. Earlier media reports had suggested Trump would require that the app’s US operations be divested from ByteDance, but he instead announced a ban.Trump’s announcement drew criticism from some in the tech sector, including former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, who questioned whether the move was spurred by national security concerns.“A 100 percent sale to an American company would have been considered a radical solution two weeks ago and, eventually, mitigates any reasonable data protection concerns,” he wrote on Twitter.TikTokers employed the apps’ signature short-form videos to poke fun at Trump.One clip that was liked over 300,000 times shows a young woman stacking bricks and smearing orange paint on her face, apparent digs at the president’s skin tone and controversial pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico.“Me trying to convince Trump to let us keep TikTok”, read the text on the post.- ‘For the long run’ -The American Civil Liberties Union cried foul over the possibility of a ban on the app.“Banning an app that millions of Americans use to communicate with each other is a danger to free expression and is technologically impractical,” said the ACLU’s surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, Jennifer Granick.“With any Internet platform, we should be concerned about the risk that sensitive private data will be funneled to abusive governments, including our own,” Granick said in a statement. “But shutting one platform down, even if it were legally possible to do so, harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance.”Pappas said she was “proud” of TikTok’s 1,500 US employees, and also noted the “additional 10,000 jobs” the company plans on creating in the US in the next three years.“When it comes to safety and security, we’re building the safest app because we know it’s the right thing to do,” she said. “So we appreciate the support. We’re here for the long run, and continue to share your voice here and let’s stand for TikTok.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-acquisition-talks-on-hold/story-JdbiQVmDScQC6tQjMccVtM.html

The return clears the way for another SpaceX crew launch as early as next month and possible tourist flights next year.Test pilots Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode the SpaceX Dragon capsule back to Earth less than a day after departing the International Space Station and two months after blasting off from Florida. The capsule parachuted into the calm gulf waters off the coast of Pensacola, hundreds of miles from Tropical Storm Isaias pounding Florida’s Atlantic coast.Watch: NASA astronauts’ dramatic return to Earth on SpaceX capsule Also read: US astronauts prepare for SpaceX-NASA return home from ISS“Welcome back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX,” the company’s Mission Control said.The astronauts’ ride home in the capsule dubbed Endeavour was fast, bumpy and hot, at least on the outside.The spacecraft went from a screaming orbital speed of 17,500 mph (28,000 kph) to 350 mph (560 kph) during atmospheric reentry, and finally to 15 mph (24 kph) at splashdown. Peak heating during descent was 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,900 degrees Celsius). The anticipated top G forces felt by the crew: four to five times the force of Earth’s gravity.A SpaceX recovery ship with more than 40 staff, including doctors and nurses, moved in following splashdown, with two smaller, faster boats leading the way. To keep the returning astronauts safe in the pandemic, the recovery crew quarantined for two weeks and were tested for the coronavirus.SpaceX expected it to take a half-hour for the ship to arrive at the capsule and additional time to lift it out of the water onto the deck. The astronauts had plenty of seasick bags if needed while waiting in the bobbing capsule. A flight surgeon was going to be the first to look into the capsule, once the hatch swung open. After medical exams, the astronauts were expected to fly home to Houston for a reunion with their wives and sons.The last time NASA astronauts returned from space to water was on July 24, 1975, in the Pacific, the scene of most splashdowns, to end a joint US-Soviet mission known as Apollo-Soyuz. The Mercury and Gemini crews in the early to mid-1960s parachuted into the Atlantic, while most of the later Apollo capsules hit the Pacific. The lone Russian “splashdown” was in 1976 on a partially frozen lake amid a blizzard following an aborted mission; the harrowing recovery took hours.Also read: SpaceX ready for defining moment with first humans on rocketSpaceX made history with this mission, which launched May 30 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. It was the first time a private company launched people into orbit and also the first launch of NASA astronauts from home turf in nearly a decade. Hurley came full circle, serving as pilot of NASA’s last space shuttle flight in 2011 and the commander of this SpaceX flight.Musk monitored the descent and splashdown from SpaceX Mission Control in Hawthorne, California.NASA turned to SpaceX and also Boeing to build capsules and ferry astronauts to and from the space station, following the retirement of the shuttles. Until Hurley and Behnken rocketed into orbit, NASA astronauts relied on Russian rockets. SpaceX already had experience hauling cargo to the space station, bringing those capsules back to a Pacific splashdown.“This is the next era in human spaceflight where NASA gets to be the customer,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said from Johnson Space Center in Houston shortly before the astronauts’ return.SpaceX needs six weeks to inspect the capsule before launching the next crew around the end of September. This next mission of four astronauts will spend a full six months aboard the space station. Hurley and Behnken’s capsule will be refurbished for another flight next spring. A Houston company run by a former NASA official, meanwhile, has partnered with SpaceX to send three customers to the space station in fall 2021.Boeing doesn’t expect to launch its first crew until next year. The company encountered significant software problems in the debut of its Starliner capsule, with no one aboard, last year. Its capsules will touch down in the US Southwest desert.By beating Boeing, SpaceX laid claim to a small US flag left at the space station by Hurley and the rest of the last shuttle crew. The flag — which also flew on the first shuttle flight — was carefully packed aboard the Dragon for the homecoming.Also on board: a toy dinosaur named Tremor, sent into space by the astronauts’ young sons.The boys recorded a wake-up call for their fathers Sunday morning, urging them to “rise and shine” and “we can’t wait to see you.”“Don’t worry, you can sleep in tomorrow,” said Behnken’s 6-year-old son Theo, who was promised a puppy after the flight. “Hurry home so we can go get my dog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-two-nasa-astronauts-makes-dramatic-splashdown-in-gulf-of-mexico-to-end-test-flight/story-1vT5VlKdR5yWU6FKYz2sBK.html

Ajmal Omer, a provincial council member, and Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, also confirmed the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but both the Taliban and the local Islamic State group’s affiliate are active in eastern Afghanistan. The IS affiliate is headquartered in Nangarhar province. Sunday’s attack comes a day after the Afghan intelligence agency said a senior IS commander was killed by Afghan special forces near Jalalabad.The Taliban’s political spokesman Suhail Shaheen told The Associated Press, “We have a cease fire and are not involved in any of these attacks anywhere in the country,” but said he was not aware of the details of the Jalalabad attack. The Taliban declared a three-day cease-fire starting Friday for the major Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.The Taliban had also denied involvement in a suicide bombing in the eastern Logar province late Thursday, which killed at least nine people and wounded at least 40, authorities said.Afghanistan has seen a recent spike in violence, with most attacks claimed by the local IS affiliate.Efforts to get peace talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government underway have stalled after the Taliban and the U.S. signed a deal in February, seen as a blueprint to ending Afghanistan’s decades of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-car-bomb-gunmen-attack-prison-in-east-afghanistan/story-pXs8urBF8DhHvEbMbBnPbK.html

The BLA is engaged in a struggle for self-determination for ethnic Baloch people and has been declared a terrorist organization by Pakistan, UK and US.While Beijing has assured Pakistan of full backing to get the BLA declared as global terrorist organisation by the UNSC, Islamabad has developed cold feet as it feels that the matter should be handled internally and any move to UN will only internationalise the Baloch issue.According to intelligence inputs based on diplomatic interlocution between the two iron brothers, while China has thanked Pakistan for supporting the Xi Jinping regime on South China Sea and Hong Kong, it has assured Islamabad full coordination and support over the Kashmir issue to Islamabad. It is understood that both sides have decided to counter what they call is India’s growing threat.Beijing and Islamabad are currently engaged to sort out serious financial crisis faced by Pakistan while simultaneously considering Imran Khan government’s request for raising the Kashmir issue at the forthcoming UNGA session next month. When Pakistani interlocutors raised the issue of BLA and East Turkestan Islamic Movement (a Uighur militant group active in Xinjiang and Wakhan corridor), the Chinese diplomats wanted Islamabad to get BLA sanctioned through UNSC 1267 committee. While Islamabad did not want to internationalize the issue by going to UN, it has conveyed to Beijing that suppression of BLA is top focus of the Imran Khan government.The Chinese are putting pressure on the Imran Khan government as the BLA are totally opposed to the CPEC corridor and the use of Gwadar port for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) navy and merchant ships. The BLA in the past two years have not only attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi but also the Karachi Stock Exchange as well as a luxury hotel in Gwadar in a bid to hit at the Chinese developers of the port.The CPEC port with initial investment of US $46 billion is key to China having a dedicated corridor to Arabian Sea to feed the markets of Africa and Middle-East, where Beijing has already prepared grounds by pumping in money. With Indian Navy sitting on mouth of Malacca Straits through intensive monitoring of the 10 degree and six degree sea lanes bisecting the Andamans and Nicobar Islands, the CPEC provides an alternative route to Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden and at the same time consolidates China’s strangle hold on client state Pakistan.Many China watchers believe that the crux of India’s problem with PLA aggression in East Ladakh is that the Chinese PLA wants a second road via Karakoram Pass to link Tibet and Pakistan in case the Indian Army targets the Karakoram highway that runs via Khunjerab Pass linking Xinjiang to Gwadar port.In pursuit of its long term economic vision, China clearly wants to avoid dependency on Malacca Straits and would prefer its goods to be transported through the Pakistani Karakoram corridor as even the other developing Kyaukpyu port corridor through Myanmar opens up in Bay of Bengal apart from being in the restive Rakhine state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-cpec-in-mind-china-wants-iron-brother-pakistan-to-pitch-bla-as-terror-group-in-un/story-GcOrzYG3gwqqAutSTlPqHL.html

With the president running behind Democrat Joe Biden in polls ahead of November’s election, Trump’s move would showcase actions to support jobs. The administration also remains in talks with Democrats about extending extra jobless benefits.Trump called TVA Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lyash’s outsourcing decision “disastrous and heartless.” Trump said the board must remove Lyash, or he’ll do it. He also said he’ll remove some board members, including Chairman James Thompson.After being handed a note during the White House event, Trump said that he got a call from Lyash and that the TVA chief had indicated a “willingness to reverse course” on the announced layoffs. The TVA didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Historical TensionsThe TVA’s board has defied Trump before. Last year, it voted 6-1 to shutter a coal plant in Kentucky that the president had pushed to keep open. The Paradise Fossil Plant Unit 3 got most of its coal from mines operated by a longtime and vocal Trump supporter, Robert Murray.Then-TVA CEO Bill Johnson said the decision was about economics, and keeping rates as low as feasible.Read More: Trump’s Love for Coal Not Enough to Save Money-Losing PlantTrump’s new executive order requires federal agencies to give preference to U.S. residents and green card holders for contract positions, just as they would for full-time roles, the official said on condition of anonymity. The order also will prompt a study to determine how many federal jobs are held by foreign visa holders.The Trump administration is working on other changes to the H-1B visa program that may be announced in coming weeks, the official also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-limit-us-contractors-use-of-foreign-workers/story-iVe4QKegjwnQ8lFJ7dcdYK.html
