Altaf Hussain called people to come forward to foil this conspiracy of Army and Pakistan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-isi-planning-to-declare-karachi-federal-territory-with-china-s-support-mqm-leader-altaf-hussain/story-SU5qMnWkCKR3qWRO8piGRM.html

I can do it with an executive order or that,” he said referring to emergency economic powers.Earlier in the day, he had said he was weighing other “options”. ByteDance, the parent company could be forced to divest TikTok by the powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the New York Times reported Friday. Negotiations are under way.The president could also issue an executive order invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which he referred to, to bar certain apps, such as TikTok, from American apps stores.Or, he could add TikTok’s parent company to an “entity list” barring it from buying Americans products without a license.The decision is expected over the weekend.The Trump administration has been weighing some kind on action against Chinese apps, as stated earlier by the president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a part of administration’s broader effort to force the Chinese government to “change their behavior”.Among other thing, the Trump administration has led a growing international boycott of Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE, calling them a national security threat. It has also announced a slew of sanctions and trade restrictions over Tibet, Hong Kong and Uighurs of Xinjiang province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-weighing-tiktok-ban-and-couple-of-options/story-YrbsB8hbTRevg9AhAsFQ4J.html
01-08-2020||World||Mexico third worst-hit in coronavirus deaths; storm could hinder US response||Mexico now has the third most Covid-19 deaths in the world, behind Brazil and the United States, where a hurricane bearing down on the East Coast on Saturday is threatening to complicate efforts to contain the virus.Hurricane Isaias’ imminent arrival forced the closure of some outdoor testing sites even as Florida reached a new daily high in deaths, and other states in the path of the storm prepared emergency shelters that comply with social-distancing measures.“We had to put safety first,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Friday.Meanwhile, Mexican health officials on Friday reported 688 new deaths, pushing the country’s confirmed total to over 46,600. That put Mexico just ahead of the United Kingdom, which has more than 46,100, according to the tally by Johns Hopkins University.Some countries are seeing hopeful signs: China reported a more than 50% drop in newly confirmed cases in a possible indication that its latest major outbreak in the northwestern region of Xinjiang may have run its course.However, in Hong Kong and elsewhere, infections continue to surge. Hong Kong reported more than 100 new cases as of Saturday among the population of 7.5 million. Officials have reimposed dining restrictions and mask requirements.Tokyo on Saturday saw its third day straight of record case numbers, the metropolitan government said. Nationwide, Japan’s daily count of cases totaled a record 1,579 people Friday, the health ministry said. The growing numbers have alarmed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as well as other regional leaders.And Vietnam, a former success story, is struggling to control an outbreak spreading in its most famous beach resort. A third person died there of coronavirus complications, officials said Saturday, a day after it recorded its first-ever death as it wrestles with a renewed outbreak after 99 days with no local cases.All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week. Thousands of visitors had been in the city for summer vacation and are now being tested in Hanoi and elsewhere.Twelve additional cases were confirmed on Saturday, all linked to Da Nang Hospital. Officials tightened security and set up more checkpoints to prevent people from leaving or entering the city, which has been in lockdown since Tuesday.A makeshift hospital was set up, and doctors have been mobilized from other cities to help.“I want to be tested, so I can stop worrying if I have the virus or not,” said Pham Thuy Hoa, a banking official who returned to the capital from Da Nang.In South Korea, prosecutors arrested the elderly leader of a secretive religious sect linked to more than 5,200 of the country’s approximately 14,300 confirmed cases. He has denied charges of hiding members and underreporting gatherings to avoid broader quarantines.The global pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of this year’s Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, with as few as 1,000 pilgrims already residing in Saudi Arabia taking part, down from 2.5 million last year.Poverty brought on by the pandemic is also making it harder for many to join in the four-day Eid al-Adha, or “Feast of Sacrifice,” in which Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.“I could hardly buy food for my family,” Somali civil servant Abdishakur Dahir said. “We are just surviving for now. Life is getting tougher by the day.”The Saudi Health Ministry said there have been no cases of Covid-19 among this year’s pilgrims. All were tested, their movements monitored with electronic wristbands and required to be quarantined before and after.Meanwhile, India recorded its steepest spike of 57,118 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking its coronavirus caseload close to 1.7 million, with July alone accounting for nearly 1.1 million infections.The country’s Civil Aviation Ministry delayed resumption of international flights by another month until Aug. 31. But it will continue to allow several international carriers from the United States, Europe and the Middle East to operate special flights to evacuate stranded nationals.In France, travelers entering from 16 countries where the virus is circulating widely now must undergo virus tests upon arrival at airports and ports. The country is not permitting general travel to and from the countries, which include the United States and Brazil. The testing requirement therefore only applies to people entering under limited circumstances, including French citizens who live in these countries. Those who test positive as of Saturday must quarantine for 14 days.As autumn approaches, nations around the world are grappling with how to safely reopen schools.A scientist advising the British government on the coronavirus pandemic says pubs in England may have to be closed to allow schools to reopen in September. Graham Medley, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC that there may have to be a “trade off.”In Utah, the Salt Lake City School District Board of Education announced that its schools will start the year with all online-only classes in response to an increasing number of confirmed cases in the city. Just days after public schools around Indiana reopened their doors, at least one student and one school staff member in districts around Indianapolis have tested positive for the virus.The debate over school openings came as Dr. Anthony Fauci dismissed a tweet by President Donald Trump claiming the US global lead in coronavirus cases is because of increased testing.Fauci said the scale of the US outbreak is the result of multiple factors, including some states opening up too quickly and disregarding federal guidelines.On Friday, the head of the World Health Organization predicted the effects of the pandemic will be felt for “decades to come.”“Most of the world’s people remain susceptible to this virus, even in areas that have experienced severe outbreaks,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in London. “Although vaccine development is happening at record speed, we must learn to live with this virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-third-worst-hit-in-coronavirus-deaths-storm-could-hinder-us-response/story-mDZYf8Ypu95WXbhXCME0TL.html
01-08-2020||World||Fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest surge in July, worst in recent days||The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.Brazil’s space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019. Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August – a 12-year high for that month.Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August. Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO’s fire tracking project.The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said.Criminals generally extract valuable wood from the jungle before setting fire to the land to increase its value for farming and ranching. Natural fires are very rare in the Amazon.Deforestation hit an 11-year high in 2019 and has soared a further 25% in the first half of 2020.Earlier this month, scientists with U.S. space agency NASA said higher surface temperatures in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean in 2020 were drawing moisture away from the southern Amazon.“As a result, the southern Amazon landscape becomes dry and flammable, making human-set fires used for agriculture and land clearing more prone to growing out of control and spreading,” NASA said on its website.Fires are also worsening in the Pantanal, the world’s largest wetlands, adjacent to the southern Amazon. In July, the number of blazes there more than tripled to 1,684 compared to the same month a year ago, according to INPE data, the most for that month since records began in 1998.

01-08-2020||World||Hurricane Isaias moves toward Covid-stricken Florida coast||Hurricane Isaias edged closer to Florida on Saturday, adding to woes for a state grappling with record cases of Covid-19, and potentially causing $3 billion in economic losses if it rakes the eastern seaboard.With winds rising to 85 miles (137 kilometers) per hour as it pushed through the Bahamas, Isaias has triggered a hurricane warning along Florida’s coast and spurred the governor to declare a state of emergency. Covid testing sites will be shut until Aug. 5, while NASA may have to delay the return flight of two astronauts from the International Space Station planned for Sunday.After wringing out heavy rains across the Bahamas through Saturday, Isaias’s eye could clip Florida overnight into Sunday.“For those living on the East Coast, prepare now,” Governor Ron DeSantis said in a tweet. “Have 7 days of food, water, medicine & other supplies in case you lose power.”Florida’s daily Covid-19 death toll rose to a record earlier this week. Officials in Florida’s coastal counties are distributing sandbags and telling residents to shelter in place.Isaias’s eye will make its closest approach to Florida’s coast on Sunday and “it’s still very worrisome that it can brush or move inland anywhere from West Palm Beach to Daytona,” said Rob Miller, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. The eye wall, with some of the storm’s strongest winds, could actually buffet the coast without Isaias ever officially making landfall.Isaias probably won’t get much stronger than it is now, but it could still cause financial hardship to the U.S. East Coast.“If it does a sweep by Florida and deposits tropical-storm-force winds inland, hits North Carolina and Massachusetts on the way to Nova Scotia, it could hit $3 billion in total economic impacts,” said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research.Flooding is likely to spread through North Carolina and into Virginia as the storm moves north, the center said. That could have an impact on cotton crops in North Carolina, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with Maxar.Isaias could weaken to a tropical storm by the time it comes ashore near Cape Fear, North Carolina, late Monday, Miller said. It will likely then emerge back into the Atlantic to make a second landfall in New England.Nine storms have formed across the Atlantic in 2020, the National Hurricane Center said. It’s the fastest start to any season in records going back to 1851, Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said in a tweet.A tropical depression off Africa briefly looked like it could become the 10th storm, but it has since fallen apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-isaias-moves-toward-covid-stricken-florida-coast/story-Mg0bNhydg8Ogr2JqlUOW2M.html
01-08-2020||World||Iran says it detains leader of California-based exile group||Iran on Saturday said it had detained a leader of a little-known California-based opposition group for allegedly planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people and wounded over 200 others.Iran’s Intelligence Ministry also alleged Jamshid Sharmahd of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran planned other attacks around the Islamic Republic amid heightened tensions between Tehran and the U.S. over its collapsing 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.It remains unclear how Sharmahd, whom Iran accused of running the opposition group’s Tondar militant wing, ended up detained by intelligence officials. Requests for comment sent by email to the Glendora-based Kingdom Assembly of Iran were not immediately answered and a telephone number for the group no longer worked.Iranian state television broadcast a report on Sharmahd’s arrest, linking him to the 2008 bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada Mosque in Shiraz. It also said his group was behind a 2010 bombing at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s mausoleum in Tehran that wounded several people.The report also alleged without providing evidence that Tondar, or “Thunder” in Farsi, also plotted attacks on a dam and planned to use cyanide bombs at Tehran’s annual book fair.The Kingdom Assembly of Iran, known in Farsi as Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran, and Tondar seek to restore Iran’s monarchy, which ended when the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country in 1979 just before its Islamic Revolution. The group’s founder disappeared in the mid-2000s.Authorities did not elaborate on how they apprehended Sharmahd, though Iranian intelligence operatives in the past have used family members and other tricks to lure targets back to Iran or friendly countries to be captured. An alleged Iranian government operative who allegedly tried to hire a hitman to kill Sharmahd disappeared in 2010 before facing trial in California, likely having returned to Iran.While overshadowed by other exiled opposition groups, Iran reportedly brought up the Kingdom Assembly multiple times while negotiating the terms of the 2015 deal, which saw Tehran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.A statement attributed to Tondar claimed the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist in 2010 by a remote-control bomb, though it later said it wasn’t responsible. Suspicion long has fallen on Israel for a string of assassinations targeting scientists amid concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, which the West fears could be used to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran long has maintained its program is for peaceful purposes.Sharmahd’s reported arrest comes as tensions remain inflamed by President Donald Trump’s 2018 decision to unilaterally withdraw America from the nuclear deal. A series of incidents last year were capped by a U.S. drone strike in January killing a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Iran responded by launching a ballistic missile attack on U.S. soldiers in Iraq that injured dozens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-detains-leader-of-california-based-exile-group/story-W4gn1Tg6bbKEumRQWvWEbK.html

I would have never thought it would have made such a powerful impact,” he said.Gupta has run Bhangracise for over 15 years, holding regular dance fitness classes in Manchester, Birmingham and Reading, and has also performed at the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. He also taught professional dancers about bhangra on BBC’s popular ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ show.With lockdown shutting down physical classes, the dance enthusiast decided to post an online video, which attracted over 100,000 views, and he has since been running free dance workouts three times a week for thousands of people across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-honours-indian-origin-dancer-for-online-bhangra-classes-during-lockdown/story-CO0xradh1zm6ttk3YI34hK.html
01-08-2020||World||Want to push for continued advancement of China-Nepal ties: Xi Jinping||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday said he wants to push for a continued advancement of ties with Nepal amidst Beijing’s sustained forays to shore up pro-China Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli’s grip on power in the backdrop of intra-party feud in the ruling communist party. In an exchange of congratulatory messages with his Nepalese counterpart Bidhya Devi Bhandari on the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, Xi asserted that he was ready to work to bring greater benefits to the two peoples of the two neighbouring countries. The Chinese President said that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Nepal relations and is willing to work with his Nepali counterpart Bhandari to push for the continued advancement of the bilateral relationship. Xi, also General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China, said that since the establishment of the diplomatic ties, the two countries have always respected each other, treated each other as equals, enhanced political mutual trust and deepened mutually beneficial cooperation. Noting that he and Bhandari exchanged visits last year and elevated the bilateral ties to a strategic partnership of cooperation featuring ever-lasting friendship for development and prosperity, Xi said the two sides have stood together through thick and thin in the fight against the Covid-19 and have written a new chapter of friendship between China and Nepal, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and his Nepalese counterpart Oli too exchanged greetings. China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. Besides the investments, China’s ambassador to Kathmandu Hou Yanqi has made open efforts to garner support for Oli, who faced a massive rebellion in his party headed by co-chair of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’. Hou met Prachanda and other leaders seeking their backing for Oli but the rebellion against the prime minister has not subsided. China attaches high importance to Oli continuing in power as during his brief tenure in 2016, he widened China-Nepal ties by signing the transit trade treaty with Beijing to reduce the dependence of his land-locked country on India. Nepal’s ambassador to China Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, in an article published in the state-run China Daily on Friday, said that the “cooperation under the BRI is of great significance for both Nepal and China. “Our leaders stressed the need to intensify implementation of the memorandum of understanding on cooperation under the BRI under the framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network”. The construction of tunnels from Jilong in Tibet to Kathmandu, development of the three North-South corridors in Nepal-Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali - and the Nepal-China electric power cooperation plan are some of the landmark projects in the areas of infrastructure and industry that were agreed to be initiated in Nepal during President Xi’s state visit to Nepal” last year, he said. Last month, Oli alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power. The internal feud in the NCP intensified after Prachanda and senior leader Madhav Nepal asked for Oli’s resignation following his controversial remarks against India as well as his autocratic style of functioning. Oli and Prachanda factions are currently engaged in holding internal consultations, though the date for the formal meeting of the powerful Standing Committee is yet to be fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/want-to-push-for-continued-advancement-of-china-nepal-ties-xi-jinping/story-yg5xvjah3xW3UzAyLqSjkI.html

Further, the Indian Consulate in Dubai can now accept passport applications from expatriates living across the UAE, the Gulf News reported. Earlier, each emirate had its individual centre for verification. The passport renewal forms will be processed on the same day as it is received, Consul General of India in Dubai Dr Aman Puri told the newspaper. Puri said some applications could take longer to process. “It would take a longer time, an average of two weeks, if there is any need for special approvals like police verification or any other clearance from India,” he explained. Last year, the Indian mission here issued over 2 lakh passports, the highest count for an Indian mission across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-indian-expats-in-uae-can-renew-passport-in-just-two-days-report/story-kfUnstaflTI88j5SYvMDIJ.html

The country’s watchdog had given the go-ahead to run the plant in February.“Teams succeeded in loading nuclear fuel, carrying out comprehensive tests and successfully completing the operation,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the ruler of Dubai, said in a tweet. “The goal is to operate four nuclear power plants that will provide a quarter of the country’s need for electricity in a safe, reliable and emission-free way.”Built and run by a joint venture with Korea Electric Power Corp., the Barakah plant can now move toward full commercial operation over the next several months. Other Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt are also moving toward adopting nuclear power despite questions about cost and safety.The UAE is aiming to have the four civilian reactors in operation by 2023. The plants, located along a sparsely populated strip of desert on the Persian Gulf coast, are estimated to cost a total $25 billion. The government expects them to produce as much as 5.6 gigawatts of energy once they’re fully commissioned, or about a fifth of the country’s current installed generating capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-starts-operation-of-arab-world-s-first-nuclear-power-reactor/story-W7PVK7L507fDxA4SV6OVbN.html
01-08-2020||World||China condemns Germany’s Hong Kong extradition suspension||China has condemned Germany’s decision to suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong, accusing Berlin of a “serious breach of international law.”Germany’s foreign minister announced the suspension Friday following the disqualification of 12 pro-democracy candidates from legislative elections and a subsequent decision to postpone the elections. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam cited a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory in postponing the vote.The Chinese Embassy in Berlin expressed “strong indignation and firm opposition to the wrong remarks of German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas” in a statement posted on its website and dated Friday.Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States also have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong last month after the central government in Beijing imposed a new national security law on the city. The move raised fears that Hong Kong’s freedoms and local autonomy are being taken away.Germany’s Maas described the election decisions as “a further infringement of the rights of Hong Kong’s citizens.”The Chinese Embassy said the actions were justified and consistent with the “one country, two systems” framework under which Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Chinese control in 1997.“The German side’s erroneous remarks on Hong Kong and the suspension of the extradition treaty with Hong Kong are a serious breach of international law and basic norms governing international relations and gross violation of China’s internal affairs,” the embassy statement said. “We firmly oppose them and reserve the right to react further.”Germany currently holds the European Union’s rotating presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-condemns-germany-s-hong-kong-extradition-suspension/story-Ooqf5LDx6lFSiwo4lqlkBI.html

01-08-2020||World||Russia preparing mass vaccination against coronavirus for October||Russia’s health minister is preparing a mass vaccination campaign against the novel coronavirus for October, local news agencies reported on Saturday, after a vaccine completed clinical trials.Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the Gamaleya Institute, a state research facility in Moscow, had completed clinical trials of the vaccine and paperwork is being prepared to register it, Interfax news agency reported.He said doctors and teachers would be the first to be vaccinated. “We plan wider vaccinations for October,” Murashko was quoted as saying.A source told Reuters this week that Russia’s first potential Covid-19 vaccine would secure local regulatory approval in August and be administered to health workers soon thereafter.The Gamaleya Institute has been working on an adenovirus-based vaccine.Yet the speed at which Russia is moving to roll it out has prompted some Western media to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before science and safety.The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has likened what he said was Russia’s success in developing a vaccine to the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the world’s first satellite.On Saturday, Russia reported 95 additional deaths from the novel coronavirus, taking its total to 14,058.Officials reported 5,462 new cases, raising the total to 845,443.More than 100 possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the Covid-19 pandemic. At least four are in final Phase III human trials, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data, including three developed in China and another in Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-preparing-mass-vaccination-against-coronavirus-for-october/story-clLqJlwapo7t3ExAHE6dxL.html
01-08-2020||World||US says unlikely to use China, Russia coronavirus vaccine as race heats up||America’s top infectious diseases official has raised concerns over the safety of Covid-19 vaccines being developed by China and Russia as the world scrambles for answers to a pandemic the WHO warned will be felt for decades.Six months after the World Health Organization declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 679,000 people and infected at least 17.9 million, according to an AFP tally.As countries across Western Europe announced new lockdowns and reported historic economic slumps, the UN health body said the pandemic was a “once-in-a-century” crisis and its fallout would be felt for decades.Several Chinese companies are at the forefront of the race to develop an immunity to the disease and Russia has set a target date of September to roll out its own vaccine.But US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said it was unlikely his country would use any vaccine developed in either country, where regulatory systems are far more opaque than they are in the West.“I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone,” he told a US Congressional hearing on Friday.“Claims of having a vaccine ready to distribute before you do testing, I think, is problematic, at best.”As part of its own “Operation Warp Speed,” the US government will pay pharma giants Sanofi and GSK up to $2.1 billion for the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, the companies said.In east Asia, territories which saw success in tackling the early wave of the coronavirus are now confronting worrying new spikes. Japan’s Okinawa declared a state of emergency Saturday after a record jump in cases on the island -- many linked to US military forces stationed there -- while Hong Kong opened a new makeshift hospital to house Covid-19 patients.The finance hub had been a poster child for tackling the coronavirus, with local transmissions all but ended by early summer. But since July daily cases have risen to record highs, partly brought in by the tens of thousands of people who were exempted from a mandatory quarantine imposed on most arrivals.- Fresh lockdowns -France, Spain, Portugal and Italy all reported huge contractions in their economies for the April-June quarter, while Europe as a whole saw gross domestic product fall by 12.1 percent. In a sign of the trade-offs being forced on European governments, Britain imposed new lockdowns Friday on millions of households in northern England.With large Muslim populations in those areas, the ban was painfully timed, on the eve of the Eid-al-Adha festival. Meanwhile, in the United States -- the world’s biggest economy and hardest-hit nation -- jobless Americans were bracing for an end to extra unemployment payments after Congress failed to reach a deal on extending benefits.It came just a day after the US posted a second-quarter GDP drop of 9.5 percent from the same period a year ago, the worst it had ever recorded.- Sect leader arrested -Fresh off a bout of Covid-19, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday nearly everyone will probably end up catching the new coronavirus, urging Brazilians to “face up to it” and saying there was nothing to fear.His comments came as Brazil’s death toll closes on 100,000 and as Latin America’s biggest airline LATAM said it was laying off at least 2,700 crew over the coronavirus.In South Korea the elderly leader of a secretive sect at the center of the country’s early coronavirus outbreak was arrested Saturday for allegedly hindering the government’s effort to contain the epidemic.People linked to Lee Man-hee’s Shincheonji Church of Jesus accounted for more than half of the South’s coronavirus cases in February and March, when the country was enduring one of the worst early outbreaks in the world.The South has since been returning largely to normal, appearing to have brought the outbreak under control with an extensive “trace, test and treat” program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-unlikely-to-use-china-russia-virus-vaccine-as-race-heats-up/story-20kMO6JMO9CzU8WpHeWdpK.html
01-08-2020||World||Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate||As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.The campaign hasn’t finalized a date for naming a running mate, but three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans said a public announcement likely wouldn’t happen before the week of Aug. 10. That’s one week before Democrats will hold their convention to officially nominate Biden as their presidential nominee.Biden said in May that he hoped to name his pick around August 1 and told reporters this week that he would “have a choice in the first week of August.” He notably stopped short of saying when he would announce that choice.Running mates are often announced on the eve of a convention. As he prepares to make his choice, a committee established to vet possible running mates has provided Biden with briefing materials. Biden will likely soon begin one-on-one conversations with those under consideration, which could be the most consequential part of the process for a presidential candidate who values personal connections.The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice. The deliberations remain fluid, however, and the campaign has reviewed nearly a dozen possible running mates.“For Joe Biden, this is crunch time. After all the vetting, all the investigations into the prospective nominees, it’s now up to Joe. It’s personal,” said former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted for vice president in 2008. “It’s now about his gut feeling.”Representatives for Biden declined to comment for this story.The selection amounts to the most significant choice Biden has confronted in his nearly five-decade political career. He has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.Given the historic significance of the moment, some are urging Biden not to let the announcement linger too long.“My sense is that the VP himself, having been through this process, is aware of and mindful of not letting people hang out there too long,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “There certainly seems to be a bit of a media frenzy, and I think we have to be aware that at a point, it becomes unfair to the candidates being considered.”As a decision looms, the camps are jockeying for position.Harris’ allies mobilized this week after Politico reported that the co-chair of the vetting committee, former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, was concerned about Harris’ tough debate stage performance and that she hasn’t expressed regret.Several California elected officials and labor leaders initiated a call with the vetting team to emphasize that Harris has strong support among labor and political leaders in her home state. The call was organized by Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and included the mayors of Oakland, Long Beach and Stockton and former Gov. Gray Davis.“A group of us really felt we needed to organize and speak out and correct the record because she has tremendous support,” Kounalakis said.Beyond emphasizing their strong relationships with Harris, they also pushed back against the idea that Harris wouldn’t be a loyal partner.Harris, while not directly addressing her vice presidential prospects, told a group of young Black women Friday that it’s common for Black women to face resistance when they exercise their power.“There will be a resistance to your ambition. There will be people who say to you: ‘You are out of your lane,’“ she said during the digital summit. “They are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be. ... I’ve had that experience my entire career.”Biden has sought feedback on his pick from former President Barack Obama, who has provided advice but has insisted the choice is his to make, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.Biden allies say his wife, Jill, and sister, Valerie Biden Owens, are likely to play a key role in the decision, as they have with many of Biden’s biggest political decisions throughout his career. Jill has held online campaign events and fundraisers with virtually all the potential contenders in recent weeks, as has Biden himself, effectively offering the contenders a try-out opportunity with the presumptive Democratic nominee.On Thursday night, Bass joined Biden for a virtual fundraiser that raked in $2.2 million. She has also taken steps to build her national profile, including providing interviews to multiple outlets over the past week.On Friday night, Biden held a virtual fundraiser with Elizabeth Warren, who has also been considered as a running mate. Biden said the event raised more than $1.7 million from over 50,000 grassroots donors. That’s about a quarter of the $6 million the Massachusetts senator brought in during her first online fundraiser for the former vice president last month that appealed to higher-dollar donors.“We’ve known each other a long time. Her fearless work for a just America has transformed lives and inspired millions, including me,” Biden said. “She is something else. You all know her.”Warren said, “This is a time of unprecedented crisis.”“But I wake up every single day with a heart full of hope and here is why: Vice President Biden is meeting the moment,” she added. The two talked for nearly an hour but did not mention the vice presidential selection process.Some Biden donors have already begun to plan prospective fundraising events ahead of the formal announcement. Biden’s team expects his running mate to contribute immediately to his fundraising operation. Of the finalists, Harris is thought to be the most formidable traditional fundraiser, while Warren’s ability to attract small-dollar donations from the party’s progressive base is also viewed as a major asset.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-nears-final-decision-on-running-mate/story-oCKlHPblSpyXbButYXlkoN.html
01-08-2020||World||Vietnam reports third death, more cases linked to hospital||A third person died of coronavirus complications in Vietnam, officials said Saturday, a day after it recorded its first-ever death as it struggles with a renewed outbreak after 99 days with no local cases.All three died in a hospital in Da Nang, a hot spot with more than 100 cases in the past week, more than half of them patients.The Health Ministry said the latest fatalities included a 68-year old woman who was treated for blood cancer and a 61 year-old man who suffered septic shock and chronic kidney failure. The country’s first Covid1-19 death was a 70-year-old who was admitted with a kidney illness.Da Nang is Vietnam’s most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city.Fifteen other patients with Covid-19 are in critical condition, officials said. All have other underlying illnesses. On Saturday morning, the Health Ministry confirmed 12 more cases, all linked to the hospital.Vietnam had been seen as a global success story in combating the coronavirus with zero deaths and no confirmed cases of local transmission for 99 days. But a week ago an outbreak began at Da Nang Hospital. It has spread to six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, forcing authorities to reimpose virus restrictions.Experts worry the actual number of cases could be far higher. Before the latest outbreak it had a total of only 416 cases.In Hanoi, where two people have tested positive after returning from Da Nang, over 100 clinics have been set up with test kits to detect the virus. Hanoi has tested a third of the 54,000 people returning from Da Nang.“I want to be tested so I can stop worrying if I have the virus or not. It is for me and for the community,” said Pham Thuy Hoa, a banking official who recently went to Da Nang for a family vacation. “Since coming back, my family and I have quarantined ourselves at home. I did not go to work or see others. We must be responsible for the entire community.”In Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s southern hub, five people who returned from Da Nang have tested positive for the virus. The city is testing some 20,000 other returnees.As the number of case continues to increase, Da Nang has tightened security and set up more checkpoints to prevent people from leaving or entering the city, which has been in lockdown since Tuesday.The city on Friday began setting up a makeshift hospital in a sports auditorium and doctors have been mobilized from other cities to help.Hoi An, an ancient town and top tourist destination known for its charming old houses 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Da Nang, stopped allowing visitors on Thursday because of the outbreak. Its pedestrian streets, adorned with lanterns, were empty and nonessential services and gatherings were banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-reports-third-death-more-cases-linked-to-hospital/story-cA4LbHurrmaG9gp0KGZo3O.html

01-08-2020||World||Foreign threats loom ahead of US presidential election||As the November 3 presidential vote nears, there are fresh signs that the nation’s electoral system is again under attack from foreign adversaries.Intelligence officials confirmed in recent days that foreign actors are actively seeking to compromise the private communications of “US political campaigns, candidates and other political targets” while working to compromise the nation’s election infrastructure. Foreign entities are also aggressively spreading disinformation intended to sow voter confusion heading into the fall.There is no evidence that America’s enemies have yet succeeded in penetrating campaigns or state election systems, but Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential campaign confirmed this week that it has faced multiple related threats.The former vice president’s team was reluctant to reveal specifics for fear of giving adversaries useful intelligence.Because of such secrecy, at least in part, foreign interference largely remains an afterthought in the 2020 contest, even as Republicans and Democrats alike concede it poses a serious threat that could fundamentally reshape the election at any moment. Biden’s campaign is increasingly concerned that pro-Russian sources have already shared disinformation about Biden’s family with President Donald Trump’s campaign and his Republican allies on Capitol Hill designed to hurt the Democratic candidate in the days leading up to the election.When asked directly, the Trump campaign refused to say whether it had accepted materials from any foreign nationals related to Biden. Trump was impeached last year after being caught pressuring Ukrainian leaders to produce damaging information about work Biden’s son did in the region, even though repeated allegations of corruption against the Bidens have been widely discredited.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a key Trump ally and chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, denied having accepted any damaging materials on Biden from foreign nationals even after at least one Ukranian national, Oleksandr Onyshchenko, told The Washington Post he had shared tapes and transcripts with Johnson’s committee and Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. House Democrats announced Friday they have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents he turned over to Johnson’s panel.“It does a disservice to our election security efforts when Democrats use the threat of Russian disinformation as a weapon to cast doubt on investigations they don’t like,” Johnson spokesperson Austin Altenburg said.The 2020 campaigns and party committees have been receiving regular briefings from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, whose director, Bill Evanina, released a rare public statement last week confirming Russia’s continued work to meddle in the US election.Evanina said that Russia, as part of an effort to weaken the US and its global standing, has been spreading disinformation to undermine confidence in American democracy and “to denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment’ in America.”The threat is not limited to Russia. China, a target of escalating condemnation across the Trump administration in recent weeks, has been looking for ways to affect American policy, counter criticism of Beijing and pressure political figures it views as opposed to Chinese interests, Evanina said, while Iran has been involved in circulating disinformation and anti-American content online.Trump’s team reported no specific foreign threats against the president’s campaign, but campaign general counsel Matthew Morgan highlighted the Republican Party’s years long effort to install various voter ID requirements across the country — including photo verification, signature matching and witness requirements — as an important tool to block foreign interference.“Contrary to their narrative, the Democrats’ efforts to tear these safeguards apart — as they sue in 18 states across the nation — would open our election system up to foreign interference,” Morgan said. “That’s why we’re fighting back — to protect the sanctity of our election system.”Despite Morgan’s argument, there is no evidence of significant voter fraud in US politics, whether by American voters or foreign nationals.And there is no evidence, as Trump repeatedly charges, that an increased reliance on mail balloting this fall leaves the electoral system particularly vulnerable to outside meddling. The president pointed to those baseless claims this week to suggest delaying the election, something that can’t be done without support in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans alike rejected the notion.There is ample evidence, however, that foreign powers are trying to sow confusion by spreading misinformation in addition to seeking to hack into political campaigns, as Evanina said last week.Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, a Republican, described Trump’s warnings about mail voting “absurd” and “ridiculous.”“He should be far more forceful and far more direct in condemning foreign interference,” Ridge said in an interview. “The enemy is not within.”Foreign interference played a significant role in the 2016 election, of course.US intelligence agencies determined that Russian operatives seeking to boost Trump’s campaign hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s servers and later shared damaging messages with WikiLeaks while running a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord among American voters.All told, the Justice Department charged 25 Russian nationals in a covert effort to spread disinformation on social media and in the hacking of Democratic emails. While Trump has downplayed the threat of Russian meddling, he authorized a 2018 cyberattack against the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency.Lest there be any doubt about continued foreign interference in 2020, US officials confirmed this week that Russian intelligence services have been using a trio of English-language websites to spread disinformation about the politically charged coronavirus pandemic.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview that foreign adversaries “never stopped trying to interfere with our election process.”He noted that the foreign meddling includes some new tactics compared to 2016. He noted, for example, that the Internet Research Agency is operating under a different name.Warner declined to be more specific about 2020 interference, which has been discussed in classified briefings. He said he has a “huge concern” that voters don’t appreciate the true nature of the threat.“The idea that we could be headed into Labor Day without the American public being officially put on notice seems grossly inappropriate,” Warner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-threats-loom-ahead-of-us-presidential-election/story-wWgOmM8IUUtYHzS6SlcJmI.html

According to Johns Hopkins Covid-19 tally, the United States has the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in the world with 153,314 patients losing their battle with the contagion. Brazil comes on the second spot with over 90,000 deaths followed by Mexico (46,688) and the United Kingdom (46,204). When it comes to the total number of coronavirus cases, India stands third on the global tally after the United States and Brazil. However, the government has maintained that India’s recovery rate, around 64 percent, in coronavirus patients is among the best in the world and continues to improve. So far, over 10 lakh patients in India have recovered or been discharged from hospitals. At present, India has over five lakh active cases of Covid-19 across the country. India’s Covid-19 death rate stands at around 2.15 percent, among the lowest in the world.

01-08-2020||World||As Democrat Biden’s running mate search nears end, contenders jockey for position||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is expected to interview the finalists to be his running mate in the coming days, according to a person familiar with the process, as allies of the top contenders redoubled their efforts to push Biden toward their favored choice.The announcement is not likely to come next week, according to two other people familiar with the matter. Biden and his vice presidential selection will formally accept the party’s nomination at the Democrats’ national convention, scheduled for Aug. 17-20, and he is expected to announce his pick before it begins.US Representative Karen Bass, a Black lawmaker from California who was not seen as a candidate early on, has risen to the top tier alongside two other Black women, Senator Kamala Harris and former national security adviser Susan Rice, according to Democratic officials and Biden allies.A half dozen other women also remain under consideration, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth, US Representative Val Demings, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.A campaign spokesman declined to comment on the search.Biden’s choice, the most weighty of his political career, has drawn an unusual amount of attention given his age. If he defeats Republican President Donald Trump in November’s election, he would be 78 on inauguration day next January, the oldest US president in history, and it is possible he may only seek one four-year term.Supporters of each candidate have privately lobbied Biden. Just this week, more than a dozen California officials, labor leaders and business officials spoke with the people leading Biden’s vetting committee to back Harris, according to a person familiar with the matter.The call was set up by the state’s lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, after she saw reports questioning whether Harris’ presidential ambitions made her less suited for the No. 2 role.Harris, for her part, used a Friday appearance at Black Girls 2020, an online conference for young Black women, to seemingly push back against that complaint, which some critics saw as misogynistic.“There will be resistance to your ambition,” she said. “But don’t you let that burden you.”The controversy prompted Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, to write on Twitter this week, “Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win.”Biden himself was prepared to defend Harris at a campaign event on Tuesday, where a photograph captured a notecard in his hand listing talking points praising her talents.Bass has emerged as an alternative to her fellow Californian Harris, which has led to numerous comparisons between the two.In an interview on “The Breakfast Club” radio show on Friday, Bass expressed frustration at that trend.“Why don’t you compare Whitmer with Warren?” she said. Both Whitmer and Warren are white. In a preview of the intense scrutiny that awaits Biden’s eventual pick, Bass was the subject of numerous news stories on Friday noting her rising prospects.While some highlighted her popularity among party leaders, others focused on her 2016 comments about the late Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro, which some critics felt were too respectful, and her visits to Cuba in the 1970s with a leftist group to build homes.Bass has said she would not use the same words again today.A top donor to Harris’s erstwhile presidential campaign, who spoke anonymously to discuss the issue candidly, said Bass’ history could be a problem for Biden in Florida, where Cuban-Americans are a key demographic, and suggested Trump would seek to exploit it.Rice, meanwhile, was seen to have acquitted herself well during television appearances in recent days despite having little experience of retail politics, and her time in the White House with Biden is an advantage for a candidate who values personal relationships, according to one Biden ally.In a televised interview on Wednesday, Rice castigated Trump for failing to question Russian President Vladimir Putin about reports that Moscow paid bounties for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.Warren hosted a grassroots fundraiser with Biden on Friday that raised over $1.7 million from more than 50,000 people, a reminder of her strong small-dollar fundraising prowess.“America is crying out for leadership,” she said. “What has Donald Trump done in response? He’s ignored science, he’s fanned the flames of racism and he has employed tactics from the playbooks of fascists and dictators.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-democrat-biden-s-running-mate-search-nears-end-contenders-jockey-for-position/story-U9DFMpKA6447gqIFNNRAYO.html

Now it grounds them: ReportNepal welcomes the “China-proposed vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and actively participates in the cooperation on the co-building of the Belt and Road,” she said.Separately, Premier Li Keqiang talked about enhanced “mutual trust and friendship” between China and Nepal with his counterpart, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.China is willing to work with Nepal to strengthen all-round cooperation in various fields and high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Inititiave, and lift bilateral relations to new levels, Li said.Oli, in his congratulatory message, said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, bilateral relations have seen a sustained, stable and sound development.The exchange of gushing pleasantries between Nepal and China comes amid Kathmandu finding itself right in the middle of the broader Sino-India rivalry in the region.In June, Nepal revised map of the country, including three areas it disputes with India within its own boundary.The two countries dispute the Lipulekh pass, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas at the India-Nepal border.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had recently opened the 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass.It was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.The understanding in New Delhi is that Kathmandu’s new belligerence over an old dispute was at the tacit behest of China.Indian Army chief Gen. MM Naravane had remarked that Kathmandu was objecting to the newly built road by India near the disputed area at the behest of “someone else”.In June, a politically embattled Oli had alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power.Oli stoked another controversy recently by claiming that the “real” Ayodhya is not in India but in Nepal.Last Monday, in its latest effort to strengthen partnership with south Asian countries, China urged Nepal besides Pakistan and Afghanistan to carry a “four-party cooperation” in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and continue to build projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) including the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) and the trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity project with Kathmandu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-treats-nepal-as-an-equal-in-gushing-exchange-on-65th-year-of-ties/story-c5XTFPVlIllXUrwNQMuX7L.html

State Rep. Gary Knopp, who represented the area, was alone in one of the planes. The other plane was carrying four tourists from South Carolina, a guide from Kansas and a pilot from Soldotna, the troopers said.All seven victims were pronounced dead at the site except for one person who died while being transported to a hospital, according to the troopers.Crash debris fell on a highway, which was shut down briefly out of safety concerns.The Federal Aviation Administration identified one of the planes as a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.Knopp, 67, was a Republican and a member of the state House bipartisan majority. Several colleagues expressed condolences.“I’m devastated and shocked to learn of the crash that claimed Gary Knopp’s life,” House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent, said in a statement. “Gary was a one-of-a-kind leader and a true Alaskan who worked tirelessly for his district in the Legislature. He will be missed by many.”The other victims were identified as pilot Gregory Bell, 67, guide David Rogers, 40, and the South Carolina visitors: Caleb Hulsey, 26; Heather Hulsey, 25; Mackay Hulsey, 24; and Kirstin Wright, 23.The last fatal midair collision in Alaska happened in May of 2019 near Ketchikan. Six people were killed when two planes ferrying cruise ship passengers on sightseeing expeditions struck each other.

However, Canada’s economic struggles are far from over, as StatCan noted in a release, “While May’s gains offset some of the March and April declines, economic activity remained 15% below February’s pre-pandemic level.”It also put out a flash estimate of a 12 percent decline in real GDP in the second quarter of 2020, which if it holds, will be a historic fall for the country. Real GDP is the gross domestic product corrected for inflation.Also read: Mexico now has third highest Covid-19 death toll in the worldOverall, 17 out of 20 industrial sectors posted increases in May and both goods-producing and service-producing industries rose.

01-08-2020||World||Trump releases his 2019 financial disclosure||President Donald Trump’s 2019 financial disclosure shows revenue declined slightly at some of his iconic resorts even before the coronavirus slammed hospitality businesses.Revenue at his Florida golf resort Mar-a-Lago dipped to $21.4 million from $22.7 million a year earlier, according to documents released Friday. At his hotel at the Old Post Office near the White House, revenue was $40.5 million, down from $40.8 million.The 78-page report, which Trump filed after getting an extension on its due date, provides a partial view of the president’s assets and debts, including revenue from his golf properties, bank accounts and investment transactions.The disclosure covers a period of time before the coronavirus pandemic prompted his properties to shut down or lose business.Another major Trump property, Trump’s Doral golf course in Florida, fared better, with revenue rising to $77.2 million from $76 million. Trump backed away from a plan to host the 2020 Group of Seven meeting at the resort after facing heavy criticism for the plan.Trump also reported at the request of the Office of Government Ethics that his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani provided free counsel in 2018 and 2019, a time when he was facing the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.“Mr. Giuliani is not able to estimate the value of that pro bono publico counsel; therefore, the value is unascertainable,” the report said.Trump’s report contends Giuliani’s legal help, however, is not a reportable gift, and Trump reported no other gifts.Trump also reported $13.5 million from the sale of a mansion in Beverly Hills, California. The Washington Post reported last year the house was sold to a firm linked to an Indonesian billionaire for nearly double what Trump paid for it.Trump’s disclosure forms mostly reflect the revenue from properties and royalties he receives on real estate around the world.But he also has other sources of income, including more than $100,000 a year in royalties from the book “The Art of the Deal.” He also has a pension from the Screen Actors Guild that paid him nearly $78,000 last year and another from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists that paid him more then $8,700.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-releases-his-2019-financial-disclosure/story-IFQWPJv9DcSKdP9C8wfnnO.html

The company has denied allegations that it shares user data with the Chinese government.The move comes as Trump has ratcheted up tensions with China during the coronavirus pandemic and stalled trade negotiations between the two nations.The company’s operations in the US has been under review by the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to enforce the action, insisting, “I have that authority.”___Miller reported from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-ll-act-to-ban-tiktok-in-us-as-soon-as-saturday/story-a051T6GXlQ6ADPV36LYYLM.html
01-08-2020||World||Report says Microsoft in talks to acquire TikTok’s US ops, Donald Trump considers ‘banning’ app||Technology giant Microsoft is in advance talks to acquire TikTok’s US operations, according to a media report Friday, even as President Donald Trump said his administration is considering to ban the popular Chinese-owned video app. “We’re looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House. India has banned as many as 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, a move welcomed by both the administration and the lawmakers. “We may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening, so we’ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot alternatives with respect to TikTok,” Trump said in response to a question. The Wall Street Journal Friday night reported that Microsoft, headed by Indian-American Satya Nadella, is in advanced talks to acquire the US operations of TikTok. The deal could run into billions of dollars. “A deal could be completed by Monday, according to people familiar with the matter, and the talks involve representatives from Microsoft, Bytedance and the White House. Talks are fluid, and a deal may not come together,” The Wall Street Journal reported. China-based Bytedance is the parent company of TikTok. In recent weeks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused TikTok of collecting personal information of Americans. “India has banned 106 Chinese apps, including TikTok, that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security,” he told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. Media reports also said the Trump administration will soon order ByteDance to divest of its ownership of TikTok’s US operations. “In its current form, TikTok represents a potential threat to personal privacy and our national security. I applaud the Trump Administration for taking this critical step, but we must do more than simply remove ByteDance from the equation,” Senator Marco Rubio said. “Moving forward, we must establish a framework of standards that must be met before a high-risk, foreign-based app is allowed to operate on American telecommunications networks and devices,” Rubio said, adding he is preparing legislation to do just that. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers calling for the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Zoom and TikTok for reported violations of Americans’ civil liberties and of their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). “Based on numerous reports, we are extremely concerned that Zoom and TikTok have disclosed private information about Americans to the PRC and engaged in censorship on behalf of the Chinese government,” the Senators said. “As tens of millions of Americans turn to Zoom and TikTok during the Covid-19 pandemic, few know that the privacy of their data and their freedom of expression is under threat due to the relationship of these companies to the Chinese government,” they wrote. “Of particular concern, both Zoom and TikTok have sought to conceal and distract from their meaningful ties to China, holding themselves out as American companies. This concealment is alarming – Chinese tech firms are notoriously bound to draconian intelligence laws, media regulations, and extrajudicial pressure that compels them to censor and spy for China’s state security services,” the Senators said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-says-microsoft-in-talks-to-acquire-tiktok-s-us-ops-donald-trump-considers-banning-app/story-ZzGWPweTdG3ceTjpnfDc9K.html

01-08-2020||World||Japan acted like Covid-19 had gone. Now it’s spread everywhere||After initial success, Japan is facing a reality check on the coronavirus.The country garnered global attention after containing the first wave of Covid-19 with what it referred to as the “Japan Model” -- limited testing and no lockdown, nor any legal means to force businesses to close. The country’s finance minister even suggested a higher “cultural standard” helped contain the disease.But now the island nation is facing a formidable resurgence, with Covid-19 cases hitting records nationwide day after day. Infections first concentrated in the capital have spread to other urban areas, while regions without cases for months have become new hotspots. And the patient demographic -- originally younger people less likely to fall seriously ill -- is expanding to the elderly, a concern given that Japan is home to the world’s oldest population.Experts say that Japan’s focus on the economy may have been its undoing. As other countries in Asia, which experienced the coronavirus earlier than those in the West, wrestle with new flare ups of Covid-19, Japan now risks becoming a warning for what happens when a country moves too fast to normalize -- and doesn’t adjust its strategy when the outbreak changes.While Japan declared a state of emergency to contain the first wave of the virus, it didn’t compel people to stay home or businesses to shut. That was ended in late May and officials quickly pivoted to a full reopening in an attempt to get the country’s recessionary economy back on track. By June, restaurants and bars were fully open while events like baseball and sumo-wrestling were back on -- a stark contrast to other places in the region like Singapore which were re-opening only in cautious phases.Japan’s haste may have been premature, say experts.“This is the result of the government prioritizing economic activity by getting people to move around again over infection control,” said Yoshihito Niki, a professor of infectious diseases at Showa University’s School of Medicine.A panel of experts, praised for showing leadership during the first wave, was dissolved in a political mix-up, while a much-derided campaign to encourage domestic travel began just as infections started to surge.Proper StrategyCountries throughout the Asia-Pacific are experiencing second waves, many -- like Hong Kong, Australia and Vietnam -- after being standard bearers for virus containment the first time around. They’re providing a window into the future for places just emerging from their first outbreaks, or continuing to battle through them, like the USA number of factors contributed to Japan’s resurgence, according to public health experts. The state of emergency may have been lifted too early, before infections had sufficiently slowed. That also resulted in an ill-defined reopening plan -- leaving officials slow to take steps when new infection hotspots first emerged in nightclubs late in June. As cases increased, officials continued to talk down the dangers and insist they were mainly confined to nightlife spots.“The government should have had a proper strategy to contain the transmission as promptly as possible,” said Kenji Shibuya, a professor at King’s College London and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization. “Both Hong Kong and Australia acted very quickly and are trying to contain it as fast as possible, with expanded testing and aggressive social distancing including local lockdowns. Japan is making things worse by just waiting and seeing.”Although Japan understood earlier than many Western countries that the virus was more likely to spread through droplets in the air, and warned residents to avoid crowded, unventilated conditions, it wasn’t enough to change individual behavior as the restrictions were lifted. While people have continued to wear masks throughout the pandemic, the current infections have largely occurred in situations where face coverings aren’t typically worn, like group dining and drinking events.Unlike New Zealand, Japan never spoke of eliminating the pathogen. Experts tried to encourage a “new way of living” and spoke of an era in which people lived with the virus. But the messaging from central and regional governments was mixed, with local officials in Tokyo warning against travel even as the national government encouraged it, and both sides bickering over who was to blame.The national government continues to argue that the situation this time is different. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga reiterated Friday that another state of emergency isn’t required. The death rate in Japan remains low by almost any standards, and the medical system isn’t over-burdened -- a key factor public health officials use to judge success of virus containment. The country has fewer than 100 people in critical care due to Covid-19.But treatment won’t bring the current spread to a halt.“Hospitals can treat the infected,” said Koji Wada, a public health professor at the International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. “But only the government, through public health measures, can reduce the number of infected people.”When Shigeru Omi, the head of the current panel of experts advising the government, told officials to delay the domestic tourism push, he was ignored. The “Go To Travel” campaign then turned into a public relations nightmare, as Japan’s rural residents grew angry over the potential of infections being brought to the countryside by city-dwellers. Eventually, Tokyo was excluded from the campaign in a last-minute about-face.‘Last Chance’What impact the tourism campaign had on spreading the virus won’t be known for weeks. Experts are now more concerned over the upcoming traditional Obon holiday period in mid-August, when many young Japanese return home to pay respect to the dead and spend time with often-elderly relatives.In a sign that the situation can no longer be ignored, local officials are starting to backtrack on economic re-opening. Osaka has asked people to refrain from dining in groups of five or more. In Tokyo, restaurants, bars and karaoke shops have been asked to shorten operating hours. Governor Yuriko Koike has threatened to declare another state of emergency for the capital. Okinawa has already done so.“The central government hasn’t shown clear guidance and a clear strategy on what to do about Covid-19, and is pushing the responsibility to the local government,” said Haruka Sakamoto, a public health researcher at the University of Tokyo. “In ordinary times, the government is very centralized, and usually prefectures don’t have strong opinions.”Some think the steps don’t go far enough. Haruo Ozaki, the head of the Tokyo Medical Association, called on Thursday for the government to revise legislation so it can legally force businesses to close.“This is our last chance to mitigate the spread of infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-acted-like-the-virus-had-gone-now-it-s-spread-everywhere/story-0Pma2p4sNETbBfLybUhnSO.html
01-08-2020||World||Canada’s drive-in movie fest features films from 8 nations worst-hit by Covid-19||As the Covid-19 pandemic has shuttered cinemas, a unique international film festival has taken place in the city of Toronto, bringing moviegoers out for the communal film experience, by opting for a retro medium for doing so – the drive-in theatre.The 12-day Lavazza Drive In Film Festival, which concluded on Friday night, was held with a view to getting the city’s film buffs out of their homes, sitting in their cars, watching films alongside others, and given how the coronavirus crisis has impacted everything including the world of entertainment, the theme for the event was Together Beyond The Pandemic, Sharing Films From The Most Affected Countries. Eight countries were featured in the festival - Canada, India, USA, UK, France, Brazil, Russia, China and Italy.The Drive In Film Festival came into existence out of a sense of “disappointment”, said its Director of Programming Carlo Coen. It is backed by the organisers of the annual Italian Contemporary Film Festival, held each June. This year, of course, that was impossible. “We could not leave such a gap,” Coen said, and thought of the option of the drive in. “It is a safe situation to be in your own car,” Coen said.The venue selected was Ontario Place, in Toronto as it could accommodate up to 185 vehicles at a time. While the organisers have put together the Italian festival each year, Coen said they agreed that “This had to be international because of the very nature of the need we had, to gather Torontonians together. We Wanted to emphasize this recovery from a health emergency, by representing the countries hit worst.”The response, Coen said, was “wonderful, amazing”, with most of the screenings selling out in advance, evidencing the appetite filmgoers had to watch movies on a large screen rather than on their devices, or TVs, as they had done for nearly four months. Coen said, “People really want to go out, want to go beyond this idea of watching films at home. Cinema is meant to enjoyed by many people together rather than at home.”The Indian film selected was the 2019 comedy Bala, directed by Amar Kaushik and starring Ayushmann Khurrana.Obviously, the festival came with its own operating restrictions given the time in which it was being held: Physical distancing had to be observed at all times, with a minimum of two metres between individuals when outside their vehicles, vehicles had to be parked two metres apart, people were told not to leave their vehicles unless absolutely necessary, and only individuals from the same household could occupy the same vehicle. Refreshments could be offered using the festival app and delivered to the car.As ICFF starts preparing for its regular Italian festival, which has been postponed to November, the Drive In version could witness a repeat performance by becoming an annual event in itself, as Coen said, “We would love to do that, if the circumstances allow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-drive-in-movie-fest-features-films-from-8-nations-worst-hit-by-covid-19/story-cHKrQQBcqATqP5dj5UHF5J.html

01-08-2020||World||Trump says he’ll sign order cutting drug prices ‘very soon’||President Donald Trump said he plans to sign a “very inclusive” health-care plan “very soon” -- perhaps as soon as Sunday -- that will result in Americans paying significantly less for pharmaceutical drugs.“I want what’s right for the people,” he said at a press briefing in Florida on Friday. “We’re going to bring our drug prices down to levels that nobody ever thought possible.”Trump described on Friday a “favored nations” plan under which his administration would take the country that has the lowest drug prices as the yardstick for what Americans should be charged.While he provided few other details, on July 24, Trump announced plans for executive orders to lower prescription drug prices under Medicare by linking them to rates paid in other countries and allowing Americans to buy medication imported from Canada.He’s been seeking to repair his standing on health-care issues, particularly with senior voters. Polls have shown sentiment is souring over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act without having a ready replacement.‘Winning Solution’McLaughlin & Associates, a consulting and polling firm, produced a memo on July 29 for Republican leaders saying that “price transparency is a winning issue in key battleground states.”The memo, coauthored by the firm’s chief executive officer, John McLaughlin, said Republicans need to show what they stand for on health care. Voters got the message that the Republicans want to repeal Obamacare but they don’t know what the party supports, according to the memo.“You can’t beat something with nothing,” according to the memo. “We now have an alternative that is a winning solution -- one that received broader and deeper public support than Medicare for All.”Republicans in “tough races” are backing transparency legislation and it’s popular with voters, according to the McLaughlin memo, whose second author is David Kochel of Redwave Communications, a consulting firm in Des Moines, Iowa.“As veterans of dozens of local, state and national campaigns, we’ve rarely seen an issue with such compelling numbers across partisan lines,” the memo says.The memo says the measure can be passed into law under legislation whose authors include Republican Senators Mike Braun of Indiana and Chuck Grassley of Iowa. There’s a companion bill in the House.Trump Ties Medicare Drug Cost to Rates Paid by Other NationsThe pharmaceutical industry was sharply critical of Trump’s orders on drug prices. Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said he was “disappointed” by them, especially given the industry’s focus on finding treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus.“They pose enormous distraction at a time when the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential Covid-19 vaccine or treatment,” Bourla said on a July 28 earning call with investors. “The international price index is radical. Not only is it imposing socialized medicine to America, it also will create uncertainty and could lead to job losses.”Trump agreed that his plan had upset the industry, saying at the Florida briefing, “the pharmaceutical companies aren’t exactly in love with Donald Trump and they’ll advertise.”The order tying prescription-drug prices to international benchmarks won’t go into effect until Aug. 24 to give drugmakers time to come up with alternative measures for lowering costs, Trump said in the July 24 announcement.(Updates with McLaughlin memo from fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-ll-sign-order-cutting-drug-prices-very-soon/story-onhOdFG5qyjBF0VgLvOSRM.html
01-08-2020||World||Teenager among 3 charged for hacking prominent Twitter accounts, Bitcoin scam||A British man, a Florida man and a Florida teen were identified by authorities Friday as the hackers who earlier this month took over Twitter accounts of prominent politicians, celebrities and technology moguls to scam people around the globe out of more than $100,000 in Bitcoin.Graham Ivan Clark, 17, was arrested Friday in Tampa, where the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office will prosecute him as adult. He faces 30 felony charges, according to a news release. Mason Sheppard, 19, of Bognor Regis, UK, and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, were charged in California federal court.In one of the most high-profile security breaches in recent years, hackers sent out bogus tweets on July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.The tweets offered to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.“There is a false belief within the criminal hacker community that attacks like the Twitter hack can be perpetrated anonymously and without consequence,” U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California said in a news release. “Today’s charging announcement demonstrates that the elation of nefarious hacking into a secure environment for fun or profit will be short-lived.”Although the case against the teen was also investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren explained that his office is prosecuting Clark in Florida state court because Florida law allows minors to be charged as adults in financial fraud cases such as this when appropriate. He added that Clark was the leader of the hacking scam.“This defendant lives here in Tampa, he committed the crime here, and he’ll be prosecuted here,” Warren said.Security experts were not surprised that the alleged mastermind of the hack is a 17-year-old, given the relative amateur nature both of the operation and the hackers’ willingness afterward to discuss the hack with reporters online.“I think this is a great case study showing how technology democratizes the ability to commit serious criminal acts,” said Jake Williams, founder of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec. “I’m not terribly surprised that at least one of the suspects is a minor. There wasn’t a ton of development that went into this attack.”Williams said the hackers were “extremely sloppy” in how they moved the Bitcoin around.Williams said it did not appear that the three used any services that make cryptocurrency difficult to trace by “tumbling” transactions of multiple users, a technique akin to money laundering.He also said he was conflicted about whether Clark should be charged as an adult.“He definitely deserves to pay (for jumping on the opportunity) but potentially serving decades in prison doesn’t seem like justice in this case,” Williams said.Twitter previously said hackers used the phone to fool the social media company’s employees into giving them access. It said hackers targeted “a small number of employees through a phone spear-phishing attack.”“This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems,” the company tweeted.After stealing employee credentials and getting into Twitter’s systems, the hackers were able to target other employees who had access to account support tools, the company said.The hackers targeted 130 accounts. They managed to tweet from 45 accounts, access the direct message inboxes of 36, and download the Twitter data from seven. Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders has said his inbox was among those accessed.Internal Revenue Service investigators in Washington, D.C., were able to identify two of the hackers by analyzing Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain — the ledger where transactions are recorded — including ones the hackers attempted to keep anonymous, federal prosecutors said.Spear-phishing is a more targeted version of phishing, an impersonation scam that uses email or other electronic communications to deceive recipients into handing over sensitive information.Twitter said it would provide a more detailed report later “given the ongoing law enforcement investigation.”The company has previously said the incident was a “coordinated social engineering attack” that targeted some of its employees with access to internal systems and tools. It didn’t provide any more information about how the attack was carried out, but the details released so far suggest the hackers started by using the old-fashioned method of talking their way past security.British cybersecurity analyst Graham Cluley said his guess was that a targeted Twitter employee or contractor received a message by phone asking them to call a number.“When the worker called the number they might have been taken to a convincing (but fake) helpdesk operator, who was then able to use social engineering techniques to trick the intended victim into handing over their credentials,” Clulely wrote Friday on his blog.It’s also possible the hackers pretended to call from the company’s legitimate help line by spoofing the number, he said.Fazeli’s father said Friday he hasn’t been able to talk to his son since Thursday.“I’m 100% sure my son is innocent,” Mohamad Fazeli said. “He’s a very good person, very honest, very smart and loyal.”“We are as shocked as everybody else,” he said by phone. “I’m sure this is a mix up.”Attempts to reach relatives of the other two weren’t immediately successful. Hillsborough County court records didn’t list an attorney for Clark, and federal court records didn’t list attorneys for Sheppard or Fazeli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenager-among-3-charged-for-hacking-prominent-twitter-accounts-bitcoin-scam/story-QTHhmKESWOPTRJdkdjYDMK.html
01-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says US ‘may be banning’ China-owned video app TikTok||President Donald Trump said Friday that his administration is weighing action against TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national-security and censorship concerns. Trump’s comments came after published reports that the administration is planning to order China’s ByteDance to sell TikTok. There were also reports Friday that software giant Microsoft is in talks to buy the app. “We are looking at TikTok,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We may be banning TikTok. We may be doing some other things. There a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening. So we’ll see what happens.” Reports by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources said the administration could soon announce a decision ordering ByteDance to divest its ownership in TikTok.Also read: After Chinese apps and contractors, India puts restrictions on colour TV imports There have been reports of US tech giants and financial firms being interested in buying or investing in TikTok as the Trump administration sets its sights on the app. The New York Times and Fox Business, citing an unidentified source, reported Friday that Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok. Microsoft declined to comment. TikTok issued a statement Friday saying that, “While we do not comment on rumours or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok.” ByteDance launched TikTok in 2017, then bought Musical.ly, a video service popular with teens in the US and Europe, and combined the two. A twin service, Douyin, is available for Chinese users. TikTok’s fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and US tech giants like Facebook and Snapchat see it as a competitive threat. It has said it has tens of millions of US users and hundreds of millions globally. But its Chinese ownership has raised concerns about the censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government, and the potential for sharing user data with Chinese officials.Also read: Pompeo tells US senators ‘tide is turning’ against China, cites India’s actions TikTok maintains it doesn’t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and it would not give the Chinese government access to US user data even if asked. The company has hired a US CEO, a former top Disney executive, in an attempt to distance itself from its Chinese ownership. US national-security officials have been reviewing the Musical.ly acquisition in recent months, while US armed forces have banned their employees from installing TikTok on government-issued phones. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the US was considering banning TikTok. These national-security worries parallel a broader US security crackdown on Chinese companies, including telecom providers Huawei and ZTE. The Trump administration has ordered that the US stop funding equipment from those providers in US networks. It has also tried to steer allies away from Huawei because of worries about the Chinese government’s access to data, which the companies have denied it has. The Trump administration has stepped in before to block or dissolve deals on national-security concerns, including stopping Singapore’s Broadcom from its $117 billion bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm in 2018 in an effort to help retain US leadership in the telecom space. It also told China’s Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. to sell off its 2016 purchase of gay dating app Grindr. Other countries are also taking action against TikTok. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing privacy concerns, amid tensions between the countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-may-be-banning-china-owned-video-app-tiktok/story-GKHkPIGWQjylfxg006Tr9H.html
01-08-2020||World||US Congressman condemns Chinese aggression in Ladakh||A senior US Congressman on Friday condemned the Chinese Army’s acts of aggression in India’s Ladakh region resulting in deadly clashes between the two countries along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), alleging that Beijing aims to redraw the settled border by force. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the LAC in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died. “I rise to condemn action taken by the People’s Republic of China, or PRC in Ladakh region of India that led to deadly clashes between the two countries on June 15,” Congressman Frank Pallone said on the floor of the US House of Representatives on Friday.Today, I condemned the recent Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control in the Ladakh region of India. I call on China to end its military aggression. This conflict should only be settled through peaceful means. pic.twitter.com/kqxciAHKX1 “Since -- the truth is -- 1962, the PRC and India have been divided by a 2,100-mile-long Line of Actual Control. In the months leading to this clash, the PRC military reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers along this boundary... that clearly meant to re-draw long standing settled borders by force and aggression,” Pallone said. This intention of encroachment and escalatory tactics used by the PRC are consistent with the other provocative actions its forces have taken throughout south and southeast Asia, the Democratic Congressman from New Jersey said. To counter this, the House of Representatives has passed an amendment that calls on China to cease the military aggression and urges immediate diplomatic action to prevent further escalation of conflict, Pallone said. “I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Congress to help bolster our vital relationship with India,” the Congressman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-condemns-chinese-aggression-in-ladakh/story-GEosYrmC0FgH8W6ZSlXl7N.html

01-08-2020||World||Nepal PM Oli’s ‘irritating’ remarks against India ‘undiplomatic’, says CPN leader||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has committed three “mistakes” with his recent “undiplomatic” and “irritating” anti-India statements, a senior leader of the ruling communist party has said, amidst mounting pressure on the embattled premier who is facing calls for resignation. Last month, prime minister Oli alleged that India was conspiring with his political rivals to throw him out of power. His remark came over a week after Nepal approved a bill to redraw the country’s map demarcating the Lipulekh mountain pass, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura – the area at the centre of the dispute between India and Nepal – under its territory. The embattled prime minister stoked another controversy this month by claiming that the “real” Ayodhya lies not in India but in Nepal and that Lord Ram was born in Thori in southern Nepal. Reacting to Oli’s remarks, Spokesperson of Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) and member of the powerful Central Secretariat Narayankaji Shrestha described the prime minister’s statements as “undiplomatic. “Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has committed a blunder by making irritating remarks against India, at a time when there is a need for resolving the border issue through dialogue(with the southern neighbour,” he said. “It was a mistake on the part of Prime Minister Oli to make irritating remarks by mentioning India’s national symbol while claiming the disputed lands of Kalapani and Lipulekh,” the spokesperson told Himalayan TV in an interview. Prime minister Oli has committed three blunders in dealing with India, though the claim made by the government on Kalapani and other territories by issuing a new map was commendable, he said. The first mistake was speaking about India’s symbol Satyamev Jayate in an irritant manner, the second mistake is to blame India for hatching conspiracy to topple his government, which is baseless, and thirdly he committed a mistake by claiming that Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Ram lies near Birgunj of Nepal, Shrestha said. The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory and warned the country to not resort to any “artificial enlargement of territorial claims”. Differences have also emerged between Oli and Nepal Communist Party’s Executive Chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” over the party’s leadership. The internal feud in the CPN intensified after Prachanda and senior leader Madhav Nepal asked for Oli’s resignation following his controversial remarks against India. Oli had accused Prachanda and Nepal of hatching a conspiracy to topple his government after the new map of Nepal was issued by the government with the inclusion of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh areas. Senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, have criticised Oli for his baseless anti-India remarks. Oli and Prachanda factions are currently engaged in holding internal consultations, though the date for the formal meeting is yet to be fixed. Oli has turned down the dissident group’s demand for resignation. The growing differences between the two factions have led to ideological polarisation in the party, which many observers believe may result in a split in the largest communist party, which was united just one and a half years ago with the merging of CPN-Maoist Centre merging and CPN-UML. Meanwhile, 201 members of the Central Committee of the CPN, close to executive “Prachanda”, have asked the leadership to convene the 441-member Central Committee meeting to resolve the internal feud gripping the ruling party, senior leader of the party Ganesh Shah said. The Standing Committee meeting of the party has been repeatedly postponed due to the prime minister’s absence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-s-irritating-remarks-against-india-undiplomatic-cpn-leader/story-TckiprleuYlYrXyfIKAi3L.html
01-08-2020||World||Australia to make Facebook, Google pay for news to protect independent journalism||Australia will force US tech giants Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to pay Australian media outlets for news content in a landmark move to protect independent journalism that will be watched around the world. Australia will become the first country to require Facebook and Google to pay for news content provided by media companies under a royalty-style system that will become law this year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said. “It’s about a fair go for Australian news media businesses. It’s about ensuring that we have increased competition, increased consumer protection, and a sustainable media landscape,” Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne.“Nothing less than the future of the Australian media landscape is at stake.” The move comes as the tech giants fend off calls around the world for greater regulation, and a day after Google and Facebook took a battering for alleged abuse of market power from US lawmakers in a congressional hearing.Following an inquiry into the state of the media market and the power of the US platforms, the Australian government late last year told Facebook and Google to negotiate a voluntary deal with media companies to use their content. Those talks went nowhere and Canberra now says if an agreement cannot reached through arbitration within 45 days the Australian Communications and Media Authority would set legally binding terms on behalf of the government.Google said the regulation ignores “billions of clicks” that it sends to Australian news publishers each year.“It sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian government will intervene instead of letting the market work,” Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement.“It does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age.”Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.UNFAIR AND DAMAGINGMedia companies including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, lobbied hard for the government to force the US companies to the negotiating table amid a long decline in advertising revenue. “While other countries are talking about the tech giants’ unfair and damaging behaviour, the Australian government ... (is) taking world-first action,” News Corp Australia Executive Chairman Michael Miller said in a statement.A 2019 study estimated about 3,000 journalism jobs have been lost in Australia in the past 10 years, as traditional media companies bled advertising revenue to Google and Facebook which paid nothing for news content.For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, according to Frydenberg. Other countries have tried and failed to force the hands of the tech giants.Publishers in Germany, France and Spain have pushed to pass national copyright laws that force Google pay licensing fees when it publishes snippets of their news articles.In 2019, Google stopped showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, while Germany’s biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, allowed the search engine to run snippets of its articles after traffic to its sites to plunged.($1 = 1.3887 Australian dollars)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-for-news-in-world-first/story-PO28u4cxF7b0M5S7U0RpKI.html
01-08-2020||World||Fury as Conservative MP blames non-whites for UK coronavirus surge||An MP of the ruling Conservative Party on Friday blamed Muslims and non-white communities for allegedly not obeying lockdown rules that led to a surge in cases and curbs being reimposed in north England, sparking fury among many who demanded an apology.Craig Whittaker, MP for the Calder Valley in west Yorkshire, one of the areas affected by the recent surge, told LBC radio that Muslim and non-white communities referred to as BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) have not been obeying lockdown rules.He said: “What I have seen in my constituency is that there are sections of the community that are not taking the pandemic seriously.” Asked if he was referring to the Muslim community, he responded: “Of course”.“If you look at the areas where we’ve seen rises and cases, the vast majority - but not by any stretch of the imagination all areas - it is the BAME communities that are not taking this seriously enough.“We have areas of high multiple occupancy - when you have multiple families living in one household. It doesn’t specifically have to be in the Asian community, but that is the largest proportion”.“Look at the areas. You’ve got Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees. Bradford and Kirklees have two of the largest populations in West Yorkshire.” Asked to clarify if he was referring to immigrants, he said: “Immigrant and Asian population.”The remarks prompted a flood of criticism as well as some praise on social media for Whittaker “for saying what needs to be said.” Many pointed out that several non-white doctors and nurses had passed away after being infected while treating patients. Some posted images of large crowds on beaches in Bournemouth and elsewhere, violating lockdown rules, and of events with gatherings without social distancing.Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy remarked after Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a briefing on delaying lockdown easing due to a rise in cases: “Absolutely grim to hear the PM failing to correct these stupid, divisive remarks”.“We’ve just had a huge rise in cases in Greater Manchester in a borough with one of the lowest BAME populations. Time to stop the blame game and give us all proper advice to follow”, she tweeted.Nadia Whittome, another Labour MP of Indian heritage, added: “Can’t you people take a day off from scapegoating us for your own mistakes? This made up nonsense is designed to make us angry with each other instead of a government that did too little, too late”.Areas under local lockdowns and new curbs include cities with large non-white populations, such as Leicester and towns in north England. The Johnson government has set up inquiries to explore the disproportionate ways in which non-whites have been affected by the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fury-as-conservative-mp-blames-non-whites-for-uk-coronavirus-surge/story-aagZq9BRrOYpdG7dVpsUBL.html
01-08-2020||World||Facebook, Google told they must pay Australian media for news||Australia’s government has ordered Facebook and Google to share revenue generated from news articles in what it says is a world-first move -- opening up another front in the regulatory and political pushback against the digital giants.The two companies will have to negotiate with traditional media on remuneration in good faith, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Friday. If no agreement is reached there will be a binding arbitration process and penalties for breaching the code will be up to A$10 million ($7 million), he said.The move is about ensuring a “level playing field” for Australian media companies, Frydenberg said. The draft code, which is open to consultation until Aug. 28 before being legislated later this year, will initially only apply to Google and Facebook but could be extended to other digital companies in the future.Traditional media firms have long complained their content is being exploited by digital platforms without due compensation. As newspapers and broadcasters hemorrhage jobs, their complaints have garnered more political support.Regulators in other jurisdictions -- as well as investors -- are watching closely to see how the code works in practice. Should watchdogs in other markets follow Australia, it would chip away at two of the most wildly successful business models of the 21st century, built largely on content free-for-alls.“There is a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and the major digital platforms,” Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which drafted the code, said in a statement. “We wanted a model that would address this bargaining power imbalance and result in fair payment for content, which avoided unproductive and drawn-out negotiations, and wouldn’t reduce the availability of Australian news on Google and Facebook.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-google-told-they-must-pay-australian-media-for-news/story-ictGnqJqurkKDyyV6uyJkJ.html
