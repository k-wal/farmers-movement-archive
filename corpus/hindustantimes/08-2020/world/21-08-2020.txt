Many of the fires were sparked by lightning strikes from brief thunderstorms — nearly 12,000 since last weekend — as a high-pressure area over the West brought a dangerous mix of triple-digit weather and monsoonal moisture pulled from the south.Some fires doubled in size within 24 hours, fire officials said.And while some evacuations were lifted in the small city of Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, other areas expanded their evacuation areas. The University of California, Santa Cruz, was evacuated, and a new fire burning near Yosemite National Park also prompted evacuations.Santa Cruz itself, a coastal city of 65,000, wasn’t affected. But Mayor Justin Cummings urged residents Thursday evening to be prepared to evacuate by gassing up their vehicles and packing important documents, medicines and other belongings.“Prepare early so that you are ready to go at a moment’s notice,” Cummings said.More than 64,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, which make up part of Silicon Valley and hug the coast south of San Francisco.With firefighting resources tight, homes in remote, hard-to-get-to places burned unattended. Cal Fire Chief Mark Brunton pleaded with evacuees to quit battling fires on their own, saying that just causes more problems for professionals.“We had last night three separate rescues that pulled our vital, very few resources away,” he said.An anxious Rachel Stratman, 35, and her husband, Quentin Lareau, 40, waited for word Friday about their home in the Forest Springs community of Boulder Creek after evacuating earlier this week. She knows one house has burned but has received conflicting information about the rest of the neighborhood.“It’s so hard to wait and not know,” she said. “I’m still torn if I want people to be going back to the area and videotaping. I know they cause the firefighters distraction, but that’s the only way we know.”The couple are in a San Jose hotel with medication she needs after undergoing a transplant surgery last month. She collected her mother’s ashes and some clothes while her husband closed windows and readied the home before they evacuated Tuesday.“I kept looking at things and kept thinking I should grab this or that, but I just told myself I needed to leave. I didn’t bring any official documents and I didn’t bring my house deed or car title. No passport,” she said.The ferocity of the fires was astonishing so early in the fire season, which historically has seen the largest and deadliest blazes when gusty, dry winds blow in the fall.But the death toll already had reached at least six since the majority of blazes started less than a week ago, with four deaths claimed by fires burning in wine country north of San Francisco.The bodies of three people were found in a home that burned in Napa, Henry Wofford, spokesman for the Napa County Sheriff’s Office, told the San Francisco Chronicle. In Solano County Sheriff Thomas A. Ferrara reported the death of a male resident there.Separately, a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker was found dead Wednesday in a vehicle in the Vacaville area Wednesday. In central California, a pilot on a water-dropping mission in western Fresno County died Wednesday morning when his helicopter crashed.At least two other people were missing and more than 30 civilians and firefighters have been injured, authorities said.Smoke and ash billowing from the fires also fouled the air throughout California’s scenic central coast and in San Francisco. The fires have destroyed at least 175 buildings.Tim and Anne Roberts had gone to the beach with their two children on Monday to avoid the smoke at their home in Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County. They packed a change of clothes, their children’s school supplies and their passports — just in case.They learned Wednesday that their house had burned. Birth certificates, legal documents and family heirlooms are gone. But in photos of the ruins, they were surprised by how many redwoods, oaks and fruit trees were still standing.“It’s a strange sort of comfort,” Tim Roberts said.The good news for Brookdale resident Larissa Eisenstein Thursday afternoon was that her five chickens, Kelly and The Nuggets, had been safely relocated into a stranger’s yard in a safer, neighboring community.The chicken evacuation came a day after Eisenstein, a Silicon Valley tech worker, had been forced to leave them behind during an overnight evacuation. She fled with her cats Mochi and Mini, driving from one hotel to the next only to find they were full before landing in a safe place where they could get some rest.The bad news Thursday was that the fire was burning down her wooded street as she adjusted to the idea that her worldly possessions may now be limited to photos of her parents, some jewelry she had grabbed, and fresh tomatoes from her garden.“After I got the cats, I realized there was very little important to me, and the priority is to try to remember how lovely things can be,” she said. “I’ve had a wonderful garden this year.”Although temperatures were predicted to ease slightly on Friday, they were also expected to be hot enough so that firefighters will not be able to count on cool evening weather aiding them. Erratic winds also could drive the fires unpredictably in multiple directions, state fire officials said.Winds gusting to 20 mph (32 kph) over ridge tops could challenge overnight firefighting efforts in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, said the incident commander, Cal Fire Assistant Chief Billy See. More firefighters were sent to battle the complex of fires, but “it’s still not enough,” See said.“We’re still drastically short for a fire of this size,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-fires-claim-6-lives-threaten-thousands-of-homes/story-kr1CtlgeoiHDthx7vWRfOK.html
21-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris’ dual identities challenge America’s race labels||It was just 20 years ago that the UScensus began to allow Americans to identify as more than one race. And now, the country is on the threshold of seeing the name of Kamala Harris -- proud daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother -- on the national ballot.Harris’ historic nomination for vice president on the Democratic ticket is challenging America’s emphasis on identity and labels.While her dual heritage represents several slices of the multicultural and multiracial experience, many have puzzled over how to define her — an issue people of diverse backgrounds have long had to navigate.Harris has long incorporated both sides of her parentage in her public persona, but also has been steadfast in claiming her Black identity, saying her mother -- the biggest influence on her life -- raised her and her sister as Black because that’s the way the world would view them.“My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives,” Harris said in a Wednesday night speech at the Democratic National Convention to accept her party’s nomination. “She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.”A 2015 Pew Research Center study found that multiracial people in the USwere growing at a rate three times faster than the general population. A majority said they were proud of their mixed-race background, but had been subjected to racial slurs or jokes. And about 25% said they were bothered by people making assumptions about their racial background.Harris herself has lamented how others feel a need to define her, despite how comfortable she is in her own skin.“I didn’t go through some evolution about who am I and what is my identity,” she said in a June interview with the Los Angeles Times’ “Asian Enough” podcast. “And I guess the frustration I have is if people think that I should have gone through such a crisis and need to explain it.”For others from multiracial backgrounds, however, the journey can be fraught. On her Instagram account, Amanda Neal proudly declares that she’s “HELLA BLACK, HELLA PINAY,” referring to the demonym for a woman of Filipino descent. But the 30-year-old voice instructor in Chicago says it’s taken much time and self-reflection to fully embrace both sides of her racial identity.As a young girl, Neal said people often tried to make her choose one identity over the other because her mother is an immigrant from Philippines and her father is an African American who grew up in Chicago and Hawaii. And she said some Filipino relatives told her to avoid sounding or acting “too Black.”“It turned into an anti-Blackness that I didn’t even know I had,” she said.Sheila SatheWarner’s two sons are Black and Asian, just like Harris. SatheWarner is Indian American, and her husband is of African Caribbean descent via St. Croix.While one boy looks more Indian and the other more Black, SatheWarner said she has stressed their Black heritage, much like Harris’ mother. She encourages them to embrace the natural texture of their hair and reminds them to never play with toy guns for fear of them being targeted by police.“We’ve always talked to them about both their heritages. We have been committed to visiting St. Croix,” said SatheWarner, a middle-school principal from Alameda, California. “They are both Black.”The subject is inextricably linked to the “one drop rule,” a legal principle rooted in slavery that anyone with even a drop of Black lineage could not own land or be free. Today, it manifests itself in the way people visually categorize others and the social hierarchy between races, said Sarah Gaither, a Duke University professor studying race who herself is Black and white.No one carries the same experience or should serve as “identity police,” said Gaither, who stressed the importance of allowing multiracial, multicultural people to define for themselves who they are, and accepting that a biracial person’s identity may evolve.Officially, the US census claims that about 3.5% of USresidents identified as two or more races in 2018, up from 2.4% in 2000. But when Pew conducted its own survey, its number increased five-fold when accounting for people who identified as one race but said that at least one of their parents was a different race or multiracial, as well as people who had at least one grandparent of a different race than themselves or their parents.And though respondents were allowed to identify as more than one race in the UScensus beginning in 2000, the race category options still are not all-encompassing.People of Middle Eastern or North African descent have long struggled with what to pick. Advocates had unsuccessfully pushed for a separate category for the 2020 census, but the Census Bureau for now encourages people in those categories to identify as white. And even though Hispanic identity isn’t a race, Latinos often aren’t sure how to answer the race question and select “some other race” on census forms.Aside from the way they outwardly present, how multiracial people are raised and conditioned by their families, their exposure to certain relatives and the makeup of their community surroundings also are important factors in how they identify.Former President Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan and mother was white, identifies as Black, while Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, whose father is white and mother is Black, has indicated a preference for being identified as biracial.Then there’s pro golfer Tiger Woods, who coined the term “Cablinasian” because his mixed-race parents were of white, Black, Asian and native American ancestry. Woods’ unorthodox choice has offended some African Americans, who view it as a rejection of his Black identity.For most of his childhood, Benjamin Beltran identified with his dad’s roots as a Filipino growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, with few other Asian Americans. At times, that made his white mother worry he was forgetting her ancestry, which traces to Scotland and Ireland. Still, most people assume he is Latino.The 26-year-old college administrator living in Washingon, D.C., said he started shifting to identify as multiracial and biracial when he began hanging out with more Asian Americans in college, because he found his life experience was not quite syncing with his former preferred label.“What I think is really cool is her identity is not simple,” Beltran said of Harris. “It’s complex and it’s nuanced and it’s reflective of more and more Americans in this day and age.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-dual-identities-challenge-america-s-race-labels/story-iCJgAGk1DgOgOOEFV5XfIL.html
21-08-2020||World||Judge rebuffs Donald Trump again on tax records; appeals under way||A federal judge turned down President Donald Trump’s newest move Friday to keep New York City prosecutors from getting his tax records, but Trump’s lawyers have already asked higher courts to step in.The developments came a day after US District Judge Victor Marrero ruled — as he had before in a case that has been to the US Supreme Court and back — that Manhattan’s top prosecutor could subpoena the records for a criminal investigation. Trump’s lawyers immediately appealed Thursday’s ruling.They also asked Marrero to delay enforcement of the subpoena while the appeal plays out. Marrero said no to that Friday.“The president has not demonstrated that he will suffer irreparable harm” if the records are turned over for a grand jury probe that would keep them secret, he wrote.However, Trump’s lawyers had already noted in a court filing Thursday that they were making the same request of an appeals court and the Supreme Court. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.’s office has agreed to hold off enforcing the subpoena for a week.Messages seeking comment were sent Friday to Trump’s lawyers. Vance’s office declined to comment.Marrero has refused multiple times to block the subpoena. The US Supreme Court last month upheld one of his rulings, finding that the presidency in itself doesn’t shield Trump from Vance’s investigation.But the high court returned the case to Marrero’s courtroom to allow Trump’s lawyers to raise other concerns about the subpoena. They did, arguing that it was issued in bad faith, might have been politically motivated and amounted to harassment.Vance’s attorneys countered that they were entitled to extensive records to aid a “complex financial investigation,” citing public reports of “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.”Those arguments led to this week’s flurry of rulings and appeals.Trump blasted the long-running quest for his financial records Thursday as a “continuation of the most disgusting witch hunt in the history of our country.”Vance, a Democrat, began seeking the Republican president’s tax returns from his longtime accounting firm over a year ago, after Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that the president had misled tax officials, insurers and business associates about the value of his assets.Congress is also pursuing Trump’s financial records, though the Supreme Court last month kept a hold on the banking and other documents that Congress has been seeking and returned the case to a lower court.Trump’s ongoing appeal makes it unlikely that Vance’s office could get Trump’s tax returns at least before November’s presidential election. In any event, because the records are being sought as part of a confidential grand jury investigation, they would not automatically be made public.The president has said he expects the case to end up back before the Supreme Court.Trump is the only modern president who has refused to release his tax returns. Before he was elected, he had promised to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-rebuffs-donald-trump-again-on-tax-records-appeals-under-way/story-YJXce33St0A5CJLXMHnl8M.html
21-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says Democrats’ convention was ‘gloomiest’ in history||President Donald Trump said Friday that where Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden sees “American darkness,” he sees “American greatness.”Anxious for his turn in the spotlight after the four-day Democratic National Convention, Trump is hitting his opponent hard.“Over the last week, the Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history,” Trump said in a speech to the GOP-aligned Council for National Policy in Arlington, Virginia. “They spent four straight days attacking America as racist, a horrible country that must be redeemed. ”Trump in recent speeches has drawn his own stark images of unrest and violence in American cities and has positioned himself as a defender of law and order. Biden, in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday night, portrayed Trump as someone who tries to divide Americans. “United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America,” Biden said.Trump and the Democrats agreed on one thing. Just as the Democrats had repeatedly contended Thursday night, Trump declared, “The future of our country and indeed our civilization is at stake on Nov. 3.”He chided the Democrats, saying their convention did not address the threat from China or bringing safety to Democratic-run cities. “Joe Biden grimly declared a season of American darkness,” Trump said.Vice President Mike Pence, interviewed Friday, said the Republican National Convention next week will focus on what Trump has accomplished, including on the economy and with his coronavirus response.Pence promised a heavy focus on GOP support for law and order and said the Democrats had failed to acknowledge violence plaguing some U.S. cities.“We’re going to make sure that the American people see the choice here,” Pence said.Both Trump and Pence have blamed outbreaks of violence on a radical left, which they have sought to associate with Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris.Trump made clear after the death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, and the protests that sprang up around the country calling for changes to policing that he sides with law enforcement.Pence said Friday, “We don’t have to make a choice between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American families. We have done both from the beginning of this administration. We’re going to continue to do both.”“Get ready to hear a lot about that next week,” he said.Pence appeared on morning TV talk shows to counter Democrats and promote the Republican viewpoint hours after Democrats wrapped their four-day convention. Biden and Harris accepted the Democratic Party nominations for president and vice president, respectively.Republicans plan to nominate Trump and Pence at their four-day celebration.Pence promised a “great lineup of leaders” next week along with a “great number of voices from all across the country to talk about what this president has done.” Among known speakers are Trump, Pence and first lady Melania Trump.The Democrats argued at their convention that Trump is unfit to lead the country for another four years. Former President Barack Obama, a frequent target of Trump’s broadsides, warned that democracy itself is at risk under Trump.Pence said, “I didn’t watch much of it and, frankly, I couldn’t watch much of it. There was so much negativity, nothing but ad hominem attacks.”Pence appeared Friday on Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, ABC, CBS and CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-democrats-convention-was-gloomiest-in-history/story-OgB8BabDScDCXi5I5d0OyK.html

21-08-2020||World||Contact with Kamala Harris came to ‘abrupt halt’ after custody battle, says father||Donald Harris, the father of Indian-origin Senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has said that close contact with his daughters “came to an abrupt halt” after a contentious custody battle, according to a media report. The New York Times report said that the Jamaican-born economics professor expressed regret that the custody battle brought an end to the contact with his daughters. Harris’ mother Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer biologist came from India to the US at the age of 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer.Also read: The importance of Kamala Harris | Opinion In her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris spoke fondly and profusely about her mother but had limited words for her father. She said her mother met her father, who had come from Jamaica to study economics, at the University of California Berkeley, and “the two fell in love in that most American way—while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s”. “My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage,” Harris, 55, said in her acceptance speech on Wednesday. “When I was 5, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work—packing lunches before we woke up— and paying bills after we went to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen table—and shuttling us to church for choir practice,” said the Indian-American Senator from California. “She made it look easy, though I know it never was. She taught us to put family first—the family you’re born into and the family you choose,” Harris said. The New York Times article said that her father Donald,81, is long retired from teaching and has remained mostly silent even as his daughter “has stepped into the national spotlight.” The report cited a 2018 essay by Donald, in which he says his early, close contact with his daughters “came to an abrupt halt” after a contentious custody battle. “This early phase of interaction with my children came to an abrupt halt in 1972 when, after a hard-fought custody battle in the family court of Oakland, California, the context of the relationship was placed within arbitrary limits imposed by a court-ordered divorce settlement based on the false assumption by the State of California that fathers cannot handle parenting…Nevertheless, I persisted, never giving up on my love for my children or reneging on my responsibilities as their father,” he wrote. The report said that his only recent comments about her, published on a Jamaican website run by an acquaintance, “express a combination of pride in his daughter and bitterness over their estrangement”. “He scolded her in a letter, which has since been removed from the site, for joking in an interview that, growing up in a Jamaican family, it was natural that she had smoked marijuana,” the report said. “Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty,” Harris’ father wrote in the letter, according to the report. The report added that the divorce between Harris’ parents was bitter. Harris recalls inviting both her parents to her high school graduation, “even though I knew they wouldn’t speak to each other,” and initially fearing that her mother would not show up, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/contact-with-kamala-harris-came-to-abrupt-halt-after-custody-battle-says-father/story-O4b5YqarQJYtViXGJjZ6SN.html

21-08-2020||World||China tells Pakistan it opposes ‘unilateral’ steps that complicate situation in Kashmir||China has told Pakistan it opposes any “unilateral” action that complicates the situation in Kashmir, after Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi briefed his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi of his country’s concerns regarding the situation in the Indian state. The Kashmir issue, as was widely anticipated, figured in the second strategic dialogue of the Chinese and Pakistani foreign ministers in the southern province of Hainan on Friday. Qureshi arrived in China on Thursday for the talks against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. “The Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the situation in Jammu & Kashmir, including its concerns, position and current urgent issues,” said a joint statement issued at the end of the two-day strategic dialogue. “The Chinese side reiterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left over from history between India and Pakistan, which is an objective fact, and that the dispute should be resolved peacefully and properly through the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation,” it said. China and Pakistan believe a “peaceful, stable, cooperative and prosperous South Asia was in common interest of all parties”, the statement said. It added: “Parties need to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect.” There was no immediate response to the joint statement from Indian officials. India has traditionally bristled at China’s efforts to raise the Kashmir issue on Pakistan’s behalf, describing it as interference in its internal affairs. China had issued a similar statement immediately after India scrapped Kashmir’s special status in August last year. Since then, it has sought to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Pakistan’s behalf several times, but without much success. The dialogue between Wang and Qureshi took place at a time when the ties of both Beijing and Islamabad with New Delhi are at an all-time low, over the border tensions in eastern Ladakh, and India’s decision last year to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The joint statement was issued soon after President Xi Jinping was quoted as saying that China and Pakistan are “good brothers” and “good partners”, and that the economic corridor between the two countries, which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), is key to forging even closer ties between Beijing and Islamabad. In a recorded message addressed to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi, Xi said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), “a landmark project” under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is of “great importance to promoting in-depth development of the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and forging a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future”. India has consistently opposed CPEC because it passes through PoK. Beijing has paid little attention to New Delhi’s reservations about trade and transit corridor and pumped in money and resources to building infrastructure such as power plants and highways. CPEC is among the new irritants and concerns for India’s ties with China, but Beijing has refused to address this issue, arguing it is only an economic project. State-run Xinhua news agency released Xi’s statement, which said: “China and Pakistan are good brothers and partners who share special friendship.” He added the frequent meeting of political parties from both sides is conducive to steadily advancing the construction of CPEC and high-quality cooperation under BRI. According to the joint statement, both sides also “agreed on continuing their firm support on issues concerning each other’s core national interests”. Beijing told Islamabad that China “firmly supports Pakistan in safeguarding its territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, independently choosing a development path based on its national conditions, striving for a better external security environment and playing a more constructive role on international and regional affairs”. In a statement released separately, Wang said China and Pakistan had agreed on cooperation in research and development of a Covid-19 vaccine. Fu Xiaoqiang, an expert on South Asia at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told state media that India has a narrow approach to China-Pakistan friendship. “India has adopted a hostile attitude toward the cooperation between China and Pakistan and believes China and Pakistan will soon unite against India. It’s a rather ‘narrow-minded’ perspective that does not conform to India’s position of a big country in South Asia,” Fu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tells-pakistan-it-opposes-unilateral-steps-that-complicate-situation-in-kashmir/story-dCkWXOqrTD65W7YfjvEt9J.html

21-08-2020||World||Pakistan a ‘good brother,’ says Xi Jinping, claims CPEC corridor will help forge closer ties||China and Pakistan are “good brothers” and “good partners”, President Xi Jinping said on Friday adding that the economic corridor between the countries, which passes through territory claimed by India, holds great importance in forging closer ties between Beijing and Islamabad.In a recorded message addressed to his Pakistani counterpart, Arif Alvi, Xi said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), “a landmark project” under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is of “great importance to promoting in-depth development of the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and forging a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future”.New Delhi has consistently opposed the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir; Beijing has paid little attention to New Delhi’s serious reservations about the CPEC and has pumped in money and resources in building infrastructure projects under the flagship economic corridor.The CPEC is among the new irritants and concerns for New Delhi in its ties with Beijing, which China has refused to address, arguing it is only an economic project.Xi’s effusive message for Alvi was released at the end of the two-day 2nd China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue held in the southern Chinese province of Hainan on Friday.Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi co-hosted the meet.In his message to Alvi, Xi was effusive about ties between the two “iron brothers” – a phrase often repeated by both countries to describe the snug bilateral ties.Xi said he appreciates that Alvi sent a congratulatory letter to the opening of the Second Conference of the CPEC Political Parties Joint Consultation Mechanism, which fully demonstrated that Alvi attaches great importance to and supports the China-Pakistan relationship and construction of the CPEC.The consultation was held simultaneously with the foreign ministers’ dialogue.The official news agency Xinhua released Xi’s statement.“China and Pakistan are good brothers and partners who share special friendship,” Xi said.He said the frequent meeting of political parties from both sides is conducive to steadily advancing the construction of the CPEC as well as high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.“Since the COVID-19 epidemic broke out, the global fight has fully demonstrated that mutual support, solidarity and cooperation present a sure way for humanity to defeat this novel coronavirus,” Xi said.“China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future, jointly promote regional solidarity and cooperation, and safeguard the good momentum of peace and development in the region,” the Chinese President added.Fu Xiaoqiang, an expert on South Asian issues at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told state media on Friday that India has a narrow approach to Sino-Pakistan friendship.“India has adopted a hostile attitude toward the cooperation between China and Pakistan and believes that China and Pakistan will soon unite against India; it’s a rather ‘narrow-minded’ perspective that does not conform to India’s position of a big country in South Asia,” Fu told state media. Wang and Qureshi met at a time when the ties of both Beijing and Islamabad with New Delhi are at an all-time low over the Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh, and (with Pakistan) on the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and terrorism.“This time the strategic dialogue is highly relevant and the two sides will take the opportunity to discuss ani-epidemic cooperation, bilateral ties and other regional and international issues of mutual interest,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian announced at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.The first China-Pakistan foreign ministers’ strategic dialogue was held in March, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-a-good-brother-says-xi-jinping-claims-cpec-corridor-will-help-forge-closer-ties/story-3PwmQMHHVeRiTvPDVofsiO.html

Three people were arrested, police said in their statement.The violence came a day after protesters clashed with federal agents for the first time since July in a demonstration that also targeted the ICE building. Two people were arrested and several officers suffered minor injuries.Violent demonstrations have happened in Oregon’s largest city for more than two months following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.On Thursday police released information that showed during more than 80 nights of protests in Portland authorities declared riots more than 17 times and arrested more than 500 people.The riot declarations allow police to use tear gas, flash bang grenades and other non-lethal weapons to try to break up crowds.Portland police define riots as events “when six or more persons engage in tumultuous and violent conduct and thereby intentionally or recklessly creating a grave risk of causing public alarm, excluding persons who are engaged in passive resistance,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portland-clashes-rage-again-outside-us-immigration-building/story-g7yUV7yyN1L5XkkNHKnw9J.html
21-08-2020||World||Spain seeks to shut brothels to curb coronavirus contagion||Spanish Equality Minister Irene Montero has asked regions to order the closure of brothels in a bid to prevent new coronavirus outbreaks, a week after the government shut most nightlife establishments and imposed various other restrictions.The ministry has sent a letter asking “regions to specifically act on places where prostitution is exercised, like brothels”, she told radio station RNE on Friday.Brothels operate in a legal grey area in Spain, which makes regulating their activities tricky, a ministry spokesman said.Prostitution is tolerated in Spain while sexual exploitation and pimping are illegal. Many brothels operate in the country as hotels or other lodging establishments.Montero said the same rules that apply to nightclubs should be imposed on brothels, while her ministry was working on regulation to protect people from sexual exploitation.She did not specify whether she was considering an outright ban on prostitution, as some people advocate, or to regulate the activity and give legal protection to sex workers.With more than 377,000 total cases and nearly 29,000 deaths, Spain is grappling with one of Europe’s most severe coronavirus epidemics, marked by a recent new increase in infections.Nightlife venues and informal parties have been linked to several clusters of infection since Spain emerged from a strict lockdown at the end of June.At least one cluster had been linked to prostitution, according to the equality ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-seeks-to-shut-brothels-to-curb-coronavirus-contagion/story-u4HLiTDUfMQmvYjHJ6wQ3K.html

There has been no word from Keita since Tuesday, when he dissolved parliament and then resigned after being detained at gunpoint, deepening the crisis facing a country struggling to fend off an insurgency by Islamist militants. The human rights team was given access to Keita and other detainees, the UN peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSMA, said on Twitter. It provided no details on what was said or on the condition of the captives.The streets of the capital Bamako were calm for the third straight day on Friday ahead of a mass rally planned by an opposition coalition that led protests against Keita before the coup and has since embraced the mutineers.Junta leaders have promised to oversee a transition to elections within a “reasonable” amount of time. But the military overthrow has dismayed international and regional powers, who fear it could further destabilise the former French colony and West Africa’s entire Sahel region.A coup in 2012 helped hasten a takeover of northern Mali by al Qaeda-linked militants, and al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates are active in the north and centre of the country. A delegation from the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to arrive soon in Bamako, after the bloc held an emergency summit on Thursday aimed at reversing the coup. The mission, led by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, intends “to negotiate the immediate release of the president and also ensure the restoration of constitutional government,” Jonathan’s spokesman said, adding that the timing of the visit is not yet confirmed.ECOWAS has already suspended Mali’s membership, shut off borders and halted financial flows to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-team-meets-detained-mali-president-as-coup-supporters-plan-to-rally/story-du4NNLmBRS5bF74aHDhOjM.html
21-08-2020||World||Russian doctors say ‘no trace’ of poison in Alexei Navalny, refuse evacuation||Doctors treating Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny said Friday there was no evidence to back claims he was poisoned, as aides accused authorities of risking his life by refusing to allow his evacuation to Germany for treatment.Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner who is among President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, was in a coma in intensive care in the Siberian city of Omsk after he lost consciousness while on a flight and his plane made an emergency landing on Thursday.Aides say they believe he was poisoned and that something was put in his tea at an airport cafe.Doctors treating him in Omsk said Friday that tests had shown no trace of any poison and that Navalny was in no condition to be moved, despite the arrival of an air ambulance sent to take him to Germany.“So far no poison has been identified in the blood and urine, there is no trace of its presence,” Anatoly Kalinichenko, the deputy head doctor of the hospital, told journalists in Omsk.“We do not believe that the patient suffered poisoning,” he said, adding that doctors “practically” had a full diagnosis that had been communicated to Navalny’s family.Kalinichenko said Navalny’s condition was “unstable”, making it too dangerous to move him.Navalny’s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said the refusal was a ploy to hide the poisoning and put his life at risk.- ‘Play for time’ -“The ban on the transportation of Navalny is needed only to play for time until the poison in his body can no longer be traced,” she said on Twitter.“Every hour of delay creates a critical threat to his life.”Navalny’s team said earlier that the hospital in Omsk was ill-equipped and his doctor, Anastasia Vasilyeva, said she had asked for the Kremlin’s help to transfer him to a European clinic.An air ambulance dispatched by a German charity to bring Navalny to Berlin for treatment had landed in Omsk, after Chancellor Angela Merkel extended an offer of treatment.Foreign leaders including Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have voiced concern for Navalny, who has faced repeated physical attacks and prosecutions in more than a decade of opposition to Russian authorities.The US embassy in Moscow said in a tweet on Friday that if the poisoning claim proved true it would represent “a grave moment for Russia, and the Russian people deserve to see all those involved held to account”.Navalny lost consciousness shortly after his plane took off on Thursday from Tomsk in Siberia, where he was working to support opposition candidates ahead of regional elections next month.Yarmysh said he had seemed “absolutely fine” before boarding the flight and had only consumed a cup of tea at the airport.She said she was sure he had suffered from an “intentional poisoning” and put the blame on Putin.“Whether or not he gave the order personally, the blame lies with him,” she said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said claims of poisoning were “only assumptions” unless tests proved otherwise.He wished Navalny a “speedy recovery” after pledging Kremlin help to secure him treatment abroad if needed.Navalny has made many enemies with his anti-corruption investigations, which often reveal the lavish lifestyles of Russia’s elite and attract millions of views online.- Previous poisonings -He has suffered physical attacks in the past, including a 2017 incident where he endured chemical burns to his eye after green dye was splashed on his face.Last year Navalny said he suspected poisoning when he suffered rashes and his face became swollen while serving a short jail term after calling for illegal protests. He has been the target of multiple criminal probes and spent numerous stretches in police cells for organising illegal protests, while his Anti-Corruption Foundation was regularly raided by police and investigators.The latest incident follows several infamous poisonings of Kremlin critics in the past.Britain named two Russian spies as suspects after Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in the city of Salisbury in March 2018.Former Russian security service agent Alexander Litvinenko was fatally poisoned with radioactive polonium in a cup of tea in London. Russia refused to extradite chief suspect Andrei Lugovoi, who became a nationalist MP after the 2006 attack.Several other opposition figures have suffered severe illnesses in Russia that they blamed on poisoning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctors-say-no-trace-of-poison-in-alexei-navalny-refuse-evacuation/story-wNZLk75xLfBx8DrBznAdwL.html

21-08-2020||World||Two tropical storms expected to form at opposite ends of Caribbean||Two newly formed tropical depressions at opposite ends of the Caribbean were expected to become tropical storms Friday, with forecasters projecting potential tracks for both that could take them toward the United States, possibly as hurricanes.Tropical Storm Genevieve in the Pacific, meanwhile, continued to weaken as it remained offshore from Mexico’s southern Baja California peninsula while sweeping the coast with strong winds and rain that carried the threat of dangerous flooding.The two tropical depressions formed Thursday, and tropical storm watches were posted for several islands at the eastern end of the Caribbean while a tropical storm warning was posted at the Honduras-Nicaragua border region at the western side of the sea. A hurricane watch was posted for the southern coast of Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula.The US National Hurricane Center said Tropical Depression 13 was likely to become a tropical storm Friday and then skirt the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The early, still uncertain track showed it potentially being near Florida by Monday as a hurricane.Friday morning, the system was centered about 305 miles (490 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and it was headed briskly to the west-northwest at 21 mph (33 kph).Tropical Depression 14 was forecast to graze the Atlantic coast of Honduras, then curve northward to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula possibly at hurricane strength and then potentially head for the Texas or Louisiana coast by Tuesday, again possibly strengthening into a hurricane. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Friday.Friday morning, it was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) north-northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). It was headed west-northwest at 12 mph (19 kph).Genevieve, which had been a powerful Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Tuesday, had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday as it moved northwestward in the Pacific off Mexico’s Los Cabos tourist resorts. The hurricane center said the storm was expected to continue weakening through the night, likely becoming a tropical depression by Friday evening.The hurricane center said Genevieve’s maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph (85 kph) Friday morning, and it was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo San Lazaro. It was moving to the west-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).The storm knocked out power and phone service to a large part of the Los Cabos area, flooded streets in poor neighbourhoods and toppled palms in the tourist zone. High surf claimed two lives Tuesday as the storm approached the area.Baja California Sur state officials said 15,000 foreign tourists were in the state, most in the Los Cabos region, which earlier had almost been emptied of visitors by pandemic restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-tropical-storms-expected-to-form-at-opposite-ends-of-caribbean/story-ZedtgYphlxj5NSU0siajuK.html

The reports emerging from Pyongyang say that the move is directed towards reducing strain on Kim and help him avoid any blame in case of failures.Ha Tae-keung, an Opposition party lawmaker on parliament’s intelligence committee, told reporters that Kim was helping to run the regime with mandated authority from her brother.Ha said that Kim still holds the absolute power.Kim Yo Jong won fame ahead of her brother’s 2019 summit with US President Donald Trump in Vietnam, when her efforts to ensure everything went well included holding an ashtray for the North Korean leader at a train station on his journey.More authority on economic and military policy has also been delegated to several other senior officials, although at a lower level, South Korean officials said.Kim Yo Jong’s rising powerHer prominence in the campaign against South Korea this year highlighted a substantive policy role that goes beyond being merely Kim’s assistant, analysts say.She issued her first public statements to spray criticism at the neighbouring nation, and the North’s state media portrayed her as playing a decision-making role.In July, she offered personal views on diplomacy with the United States in an unusual statement in state media, saying her brother had given her special permission to watch recordings of that country’s Independence Day celebrations.Kim’s most trusted advisorThe first statement issued in Kim Yo Jong’s name came only in March this year, but in weeks and months after that, she has been at the forefront of Pyongyang’s denunciations of defectors in the South sending leaflets across the border.Officially, she is only an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, but Kim Yo Jong is one of her brother’s most trusted advisors and among the most powerful women in the isolated regime.Born in 1988, according to the Unification ministry, Yo Jong is one of three children born to Kim’s predecessor Kim Jong Il and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father’s death in 2011.Her existence was barely known to the wider world until his funeral, when she was seen standing right behind Kim Jong Un on state television, looking tearful and ashen-faced.But more recently she has seemed to be constantly at her brother’s side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-yo-jong-north-korea-s-most-powerful-woman-and-now-de-facto-second-in-command/story-YXyGKZnLzZPZPma8dheSKP.html
21-08-2020||World||In letter to UNSC, Iran says US has no right to demand restoration of sanctions||Iran’s foreign minister in a letter to the UN Security Council said the US has no right to demand the restoration of UN sanctions against Iran, the Foreign Ministry’s website said Friday.Mohammad Javad Zarif said the US lost the right to make demands in 2018 when it withdrew from the nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers. He also said America’s unilateral pullout violated a UN resolution that required signatories to avoid any damage to the deal.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday officially informed the UN it is demanding the restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, but allies and opponents declared the US action illegal and doomed to failure.Pompeo insisted the United States has the legal right to “snap back” UN sanctions even though President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers that was endorsed by the Security Council.He said UN sanctions will continue the arms embargo on Iran, set to expire on Oct. 18, as well as prohibit ballistic missile testing and nuclear enrichment that could lead to a nuclear weapons program — which Tehran insists it is not pursuing.The US insistence on snapping back international sanctions against Iran sets the stage for a contentious dispute. The US demand could be ignored by other U.N. members — calling into question the Security Council’s ability to enforce its own legally binding decisions.Zarif said the term “snapback” was never mentioned in the deal or in the UN resolution that supported the deal. “The US intentionally has applied the word to suggest speed and (an) automatic” return of sanctions, he said.The Trump administration wants to reimpose all international sanctions that had been eased under the nuclear deal. Other nations claim the US has no standing to make the demand because the Trump administration pulled the US out of the deal.Under the agreement, Tehran received sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The “snapback” mechanism was created in the event Tehran was proven to be in violation of the accord.Zarif said the Security Council should stop the US’s unilateral “misuses” of council resolutions, saying “the people of Iran expect the council to force the US to be accountable” for its “damages” to Iran.The US imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran and sent the country’s economy into free fall following its pullout from the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-letter-to-unsc-iran-says-us-has-no-right-to-demand-restoration-of-sanctions/story-H9PqFRNmzlcQOLjdHOGUoK.html
21-08-2020||World||A simple guide to US elections 2020||The race for the White House has begun and the outcome of the 2020 US general election will have an impact around the world. On November 3, 2020, Americans will head to the polls and render their verdict on the Donald Trump presidency. A record number of Americans are expected to cast mail-in ballots this year because of the pandemic. Democrats have accused Trump of trying to sabotage the US Postal Service to help his re-election bid, while the president has already begun to try to sow public doubt about any outcome that results in a Joe Biden victory.Here’s your quick guide to the US presidential election 2020:•Election Day, as set by the US law, is always the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year it is November 3. The presidential election starts with a primary process for the major political parties, Republicans and Democrats, to pick their nominees (Donald Trump and Joe Biden this year). •Unlike many other countries, the US political system is dominated by just two parties, so the president always belongs to one of them. The Republicans are the conservative political party in the US and their candidate in this year’s election is President Donald Trump. The Democrats are the liberal political party and their candidate is Joe Biden.•The winner is not always the candidate who wins most votes. The candidates compete to win electoral college votes. Each state gets a certain number of electoral college votes based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs, so the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more.•Anyone who is a US citizen and 18 years of age or over, is eligible to vote in the presidential election. However, lots of states have passed laws requiring voters to show identification documents to prove who they are before they can vote. •It can take several days for every vote to be counted, but it becomes clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning.•The new president is officially sworn into office on January 20 in a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC. After the ceremony, the new president makes their way to the White House to begin their four-year term in office.•Most Americans vote for president and Congress, but November ballots will also include state and local elections, so they will differ from city to city and state to state. Every person voting in a US state can vote for president. But the options will be different depending on the state. Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be on every ballot, but there will be other smaller party options that vary depending on a state’s rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-simple-guide-to-us-elections-2020/story-InaqFLCTNEdNG6NTYeySHL.html
21-08-2020||World||Joe Biden’s elusive quest for ‘Biden from Mumbai’ continues||When Joe Biden was elected as one of the youngest US senators in 1972, one of the first letters that he received was from Mumbai, with the sender having the same last name as his. About five years ago, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee learned that there are five Bidens living in Mumbai, but is probably yet to make a connection with them. The ‘Biden from Mumbai’, then known as Bombay, had congratulated Biden on his election as the senator from Delaware and told him that they were related to each other. Biden, then 29, wanted to follow up on the letter and get in touch with the ‘Biden from Mumbai’. However, his family and active life in politics meant that this wish remained a wish, something he still wants to fulfil nearly five decades later. The wish may have remained unfulfilled, but the 77-year-old Biden never misses a chance to narrate the ‘Biden from Mumbai’ story when he meets Indian-Americans and the Indian leaders. The former vice president assures them that he too has an India connection, however, distant it might be. In his address to the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, on July 24, 2013, during his maiden visit to India as the Vice President of the US, he went off-script to narrate his story of the ‘Biden from Mumbai’. “It’s an honour to be back in India and to be here in Mumbai. Off script for a second here, I was reminded - I was elected to the United States Senate when I was a 29-year-old kid back in 1972, and one of the first letters I received and I regret I never followed up on it. Maybe, some genealogist in audience can follow up for me, but I received a letter from a gentleman named Biden - Biden, my name - from Mumbai, asserting that we were related,” Biden had told the audience amidst peals of laughter. “Seriously. Suggesting that our mutual, great, great, great, something or other worked for the East India Trading Company back in the 1700s and came to Mumbai,” Biden said. A few years later at another speech in Washington DC, Biden said that their forefathers were same, who worked for the East India Company and visited India then. “He (Biden from Mumbai) went back to our mutual great, great, great grandfather, 1848, who was a British captain in the East India Tea Company. And he married I believe an Indian woman. And he settled in India,” Biden said in his address to the US India Business Council on September 21, 2015. “And so I was thinking about it, if that’s true, I might run here in India for office. I might be qualified (to run for elected office in India). But I’ve never followed up on it (the letter from Biden from Mumbai),” Biden told the Mumbai audience in 2013, who could not stop laughing at it. “But now that I’m back for the multiple times, I’m going to follow up to find out whether there is a Biden and whether we’re related. I hope he’s in good standing if we are,” he said, evoking bouts of laughter from the audience. In the Washington DC event hosted by US Indian Business Council, Biden said that a day after his Mumbai speech, a journalist gave him a list of five Bidens living in Mumbai. “The next day the press, I guess trying to prove that I was probably making this up - because I never followed up. It was right after I got elected, and then some things happened in my family, and I never followed up. One reporter stood up and gave me the names of five Bidens in Mumbai,” he said. “So, show me more respect,” Biden has told the Washington DC audience while asserting his Indian connection “You know what I mean? I didn’t realise I had so many... And I haven’t actually followed up and embarrassed the Bidens in Mumbai. But the point is, it makes it even clearer what a small, small world this is and how this global economy is suited for, quite frankly, the two largest democracies in the world,” Biden said in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-elusive-quest-for-biden-from-mumbai-continues/story-UBGz9ZKHCEO5UBbZNIpUrO.html
21-08-2020||World||Joe Biden praises tough Kamala Harris in Democratic nomination acceptance speech||As Joe Biden accepted the Democratic Party nomination for the White House on Thursday, he praised his running mate Kamala Harris during his acceptance speech, describing the senator from California as a “powerful voice” in the US as he pointed out to her “American story.” Harris is the first Indian-American and Black woman to get a major party’s vice presidential nomination. The 55-year-old former California attorney general got the nomination on the third day of the virtual Democratic National Convention on Wednesday.“It will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone. And I am not going to have to do it alone. I will have a great vice president at my side,” Biden said in his acceptance speech on Thursday.The 77-year-old Biden talked about Harris’ diverse family, her parents are Jamaican and Indian, heritage and her perseverance to “overcome every obstacle she has ever faced.” “Her story is the American story. She knows about all of the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants. The left out and the left behind. She has overcome every obstacle she has ever faced,” he said on the last day of the four-day Democratic National Convention.“No one has been tougher on big banks and the gun lobby. No one has been tougher on calling out the current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, it’s failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I both draw from our families. That is where we get our strength. For Kamala, it is Doug, and their families. For me, it is Jill, and ours,” Biden said.Introducing herself as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants at the virtual convention on Wednesday, Harris fondly remembered her Chennai-born mother who she said taught her two daughters to “be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people” and to believe that “the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.”“One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice,” Biden said.“I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it’s the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job — it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone,” he said.Later, Harris said in a tweet that Biden will be an incredible president. “Tonight, Joe Biden spoke to the moment. Just like he’ll do as president for our country,” she tweeted.“You’re going to make an incredible president. America, we need your help to make that happen. As Joe Biden reminds us, character, compassion, decency—they’re all on the ballot in November. Who we are and who we want to be are on the line,” she also said in a fund-raising email and tweet.Soon after Biden concluded his speech, Harris and her husband Douglas Emhoff joined him and his wife Jill Biden. The couples stepped onto an outside stage and embraced as they watched the fireworks light up the sky.Biden delivered his speech inside a largely empty arena in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, at the conclusion of a Democratic convention held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 170,000 Americans.Before Biden stepped off, reporters shouted: “How do you feel?”. he pulled down his face mask and yelled: “Welcome to Wilmington!”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-praises-tough-kamala-harris-in-democratic-nomination-acceptance-speech/story-8zHisPcyIHYvQCuK01ZFkL.html

Some said the mask made them feel safe, while others said social pressures to wear the masks were also a factor. “I think I can take off my mask anytime, but I’ll need to see if others accept it. Because I’m afraid that people would be scared if they see me not wearing mask,” one 24-year old Beijing woman surnamed Cao told Reuters. It’s the second time Beijing’s health authorities have relaxed guidelines on mask wearing in the capital, which has largely returned to normal after two rounds of lockdowns brought it to a standstill.Beijing’s municipal Centers for Disease Control first said residents could go without masks in outdoor areas in late April, though the rules were swiftly reversed in June after a new outbreak in a large wholesale market in the city’s south. China has reported no new locally transmitted cases on the mainland for five days after successfully controlling flare ups in the capital, Xinjiang and elsewhere. Experts say the key to the country’s success in controlling the disease has been the strict enforcement of local rules, including wearing masks, mandatory home quarantine and participating in mass testing.Authorities reported 22 imported cases in the mainland on for Aug. 20, and has closed its borders to most non-Chinese citizens. The country has reported a total of 84,917 cases since the outbreak began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-health-authorities-allow-residents-to-go-mask-free-as-covid-19-cases-drop/story-6UYU3UpEpJEo5ka0Kk5m6N.html

Navalny is fighting for his life after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison. Doctors treating him, at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk, have not yet confirmed that diagnosis, but said it is one of several versions they are considering.Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, cited a head doctor as saying on Friday that his condition was unstable and that the hospital deemed his relatives’ desire to move him to another facility insufficient to justify such action. A German air ambulance with a team specialised in treating coma patients was due to land in Omsk at around 0600 GMT, she said. “The ban on transporting Navalny in an attempt on his life being carried out right now by doctors and the deceitful authorities that have authorised it,” Yarmysh wrote on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-hospital-refuses-to-move-kremlin-critic-navalny-after-suspected-poisoning-report/story-wPWv5qEceizCDL7esgPd7N.html

21-08-2020||World||Fight with South Korea outbreak church fuels rebound for Moon Jae-In||South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s approval rating rose for the first time in three months after he took on a church at the center of a new coronavirus wave -- a jump similar to one in March when he confronted a separate sect over an outbreak.Moon’s support surged 8 percentage points to 47% in a weekly tracking poll released Friday from Gallup Korea -- the highest level since mid-July and up from a record low last week. The rebound may be temporary with many respondents faulting Moon for not doing enough to tackle runaway housing prices, an issue that had driven a recent decline in his approval rating.The jump came after the Moon administration implemented measures against the Sarang Jeil Presbyterian Church, which has been connected to the latest surge in infections. South Korea this week saw its biggest daily tally since March and the flareup has raised concerns that the country -- once seen as successfully containing the virus -- could be losing control.Moon’s administration has been lauded globally for containing outbreaks without a lockdown, relying on rapid testing and contact-tracing. His progressive camp scored a landslide victory in paramilitary elections in April, showing to political leaders around the world that effective virus management can translate into votes.Authorities said they would charge the pastor of Sarang Jeil for violating public health laws, accusing him of breaking self-quarantine rules and failing to provide lists of parishioners for testing. Almost 4,000 members of the church have been gathering for recent services, despite government requests to stop. The pastor has tested positive for the virus, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified health official.Moon pledged to “take decisive actions, including coercive measures” against the church. He has also said the outbreak linked to Sarang Jeil was the biggest challenge faced by health officials since a similar incident involving the Shincheonji sect five months ago briefly made South Korea the country with the second-most infections in the world.As of Thursday, 739 people linked to the Sarang Jeil church were confirmed positive for the virus, health authorities said. Thousands of members gathered for a weekend rally in central Seoul, sparking a new backlash and raising worries those attending could spread infections to more parts of the country. So far, at least 60 of those who took part have tested positive, according the country’s health ministry.Sarang Jeil pastor Jun Kwang-hoon, a critic of Moon, took out advertisements in major newspapers trying to stem public anger. In them, he said he was being mistreated by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fight-with-south-korea-outbreak-church-fuels-rebound-for-moon-jae-in/story-CAg0WKShuYJflysKpJPvGI.html
21-08-2020||World||In moving speech, boy says Joe Biden helped him overcome stutter||Even in a week filled with emotional endorsements of Joe Biden, Brayden Harrington’s stands out.The 13-year-old boy sat in his home, speaking to a cellphone camera and reading, carefully, from a piece of paper. He looked up and told the world how the former vice president, by speaking about his own experience, had helped him overcome a difficult challenge.“We stutter,” Brayden said in a video that aired Thursday, shortly before Biden accepted his party’s presidential nomination on the final night of the Democratic National Convention. The Concord, New Hampshire, teen got stuck briefly on the “s” sound and bravely worked his way through the word. His face showed strain but also determination to force out the sound.“It’s really amazing to hear that someone became vice president” despite stuttering, Brayden said. “He told me about a book of poems by Yeats that he would read out loud to practice.”Biden has spoken frequently about how overcoming a stutter was one of the hardest things he’s done in life. Brayden and Biden met at a February CNN town hall in Concord, where Biden spoke about overcoming a severe childhood stutter. He’s talked frequently publicly through the years about the anger and frustration of being mocked by classmates and a nun in Catholic school — and how that motivated him to work to overcome it.“It has nothing to do with your intellectual makeup,” he said at the town hall.After the event, Biden invited Brayden backstage to talk more about learning to control a stutter. Biden noted that he’d practiced by speaking as he looked at himself in the mirror. He also gave the boy a speech he’d prepared for delivery, complete with markings he’d made on its pages that showed where he had time to take breaks and pauses so that the words would come out more smoothly.Brayden held up that speech for convention viewers on Thursday.“I’m just trying to be a kid,” Brayden said. “And in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me feel more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole life. Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us.”“Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to,” he added.Biden has talked about his stutter frequently on the presidential campaign trail and how it sometimes returns on certain words, especially if he’s tired.After he talked about it during a Democratic primary debate in December — and even started to make the sounds of a stutter — then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders ridiculed Biden on Twitter. The tweet was later deleted and Sanders apologized. Biden said afterward that he had no regrets “because I know what it’s like to be humiliated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-moving-speech-boy-says-joe-biden-helped-him-overcome-stutter/story-0T3hCSK5T4yO7dvI9OzPAM.html
21-08-2020||World||Joe Biden accepts Democratic nomination, vows to end ‘season of darkness’||Joe Biden accepted the Democratic party nomination for president Thursday, the last day of the first ever virtual convention held in the shadow of a raging Covid-19 epidemic, with a promise to heal and unite the nation and help it “overcome this season of darkness”.Biden, a former vice-president and six-term senator before that, directly criticized President Donald Trump for his handling of the epidemic that has infected more than 5 million Americans and killed 170,000 and the cratering of the economy.Biden said Trump had “cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division.”Biden offered himself as a contrast: “Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness. …(and) United we can, and will, overcome this season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.”Calling the upcoming elections in November 3 “life-changing” with the potential to determine America’s future for a long time, the Democratic nominee laid out his case for the White House in stark terms: “Character is on the ballot. Compassion is on the ballot. Decency, science, democracy. They are all on the ballot.”Biden accepted the party’s nomination in a speech from a hall in Wilmington, Delaware. He was joined by wife Jill Biden on the stage after he finished, and by his running mate Kamala Harris and her spouse Doug Emhoff. They stood socially distant before walking out for celebratory fireworks.Biden waited 32 years for this moment, having first run for the party nomination in 1987. He had dropped out then even before the primaries over plagiarism allegations. He tried again in 2008, but pulled out after a poor showing in the first of the nominating contests, the Iowa caucus.The 2020 race did not start well either. He fared poorly in the first two nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire. He did somewhat better in Nevada, the third contest and went to South Carolina, the fourth, with the fate of his campaign in balance. He crushed it with the overwhelming support of the state’s Black Democrats and went on to sweep the Super Tuesday contests, winning 11 of the 14 states, toppling Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner. He never looked back.Also Read: In moving speech, boy says Joe Biden helped him overcome stutterBiden turned the Democratic presidential ticket historic with his pick for running mate: Kamala Harris. She is the first Indian American and Black woman to run for vice-president. In fact, she is the first woman of color to run for this high office.She accepted her nomination on Wednesday with a rousing tribute to her Indian-born mother and values inherited from her.Biden leads Trump by 7.6 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls nationally and by 8.8 points in FiveThirtyEight’s weighted average of national polls. He also leads the incumbent in all the swing states.Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak is his key vulnerability in his re-election bid — 58% of Americans disapprove of it in a new high, according to a CNN poll. And 68% felt embarrassed by the US response to it. The United States is the country hit the hardest by the virus.Also Read: Joe Biden says would implement Covid-19 plan on ‘Day 1’ if electedDemocrats have thus chosen to attack Trump singularly on Covid-19. “Just judge this president on the facts,” said Biden in his acceptance speech. “5 million Americans infected with Covid-19.

More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in 6 small businesses has closed this year.”President Trump will make his case for a second term at the Republican party convention starting Monday, which might, or not, be a mix of in-person and virtual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-accepts-democratic-nomination-vows-to-end-season-of-darkness/story-MdE2jZ0bdhEjrU2jrGmfTN.html
21-08-2020||World||Pfizer virus vaccine on track for regulatory review in October||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE said the Covid-19 vaccine they are jointly developing is on track to be submitted for regulatory review as early as October, as they released additional data from an early-stage study.The companies said the vaccine was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants. The companies are continuing to analyze data from the Phase 1 trials in the U.S. and Germany, they said in a statement.The confirmation of their October goal, first announced last month, would make the vaccine one of the fastest-moving in the world. Some analysts expect a vaccine to be approved for use by November in the U.S., a move which may give President Donald Trump a new foothold in the election.Pfizer and BioNTech last month clinched a $2 billion deal to supply an initial 100 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. Governments around the world are looking to lock up supplies of still-experimental candidates in hope of stabilizing local economies and stopping spread of the virus that’s taken almost 800,000 lives globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-virus-vaccine-on-track-for-regulatory-review-in-october/story-87xnL2SaM4m0tdk3ah162I.html
21-08-2020||World||US demands restoration of UN sanctions against Iran||The Trump administration on Thursday formally notified the United Nations of its demand for all UN sanctions on Iran to be restored, setting off an immediate confrontation with Russia and other Security Council members, including America’s European allies, who called the US move illegal.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered the notification to the president of the UN Security Council, citing significant Iranian violations of the 2015 nuclear deal, a requirement to “snap back” UN sanctions.“The United States will never allow the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism to freely buy and sell planes, tanks, missiles and other kinds of conventional weapons ... (or) to have a nuclear weapon,” Pompeo told a UN press conference.He said the US action will extend the arms embargo, which is set to expire Oct. 18, and also prohibit Iran from ballistic missile testing and enrichment of nuclear material.Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, shot back on Twitter: “Looks like there are 2 planets. A fictional dog-eat-dog one where US pretends it can do whatever it wants without ‘cajoling’ anyone, breach and leave deals but still benefit from them, and another one where the rest of the world lives and where intl law and diplomacy reign.”At the heart of the dispute is President Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal between six global powers and Iran.The US maintains that under the Security Council resolution endorsing the agreement it retains the right as an initial party to invoke the provision to “snap back” sanctions. Russia, China, Britain, France and virtually all other council members say the Trump administration does not have the right since it is no longer a party to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.The US action sets the stage for a showdown that could lead to a crisis of credibility for the Security Council.In a letter presented to Indonesia’s ambassador to the UN, Dian Triansyah Djani, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the council, Pompeo said the US was notifying the body of “significant non-performance” by Iran related to the nuclear deal. As a result, Pompeo said the process leading to the re-imposition of UN sanctions had been initiated.The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has reported some Iranian violations of the agreement, but Tehran says those are the result of the US violating the accord by withdrawing from it and then re-imposing harsh unilateral sanctions.Pompeo noted that the European participants in the deal had attempted to bring Iran back into compliance. But he said “despite extensive efforts and exhaustive diplomacy on the part of those member states, Iran’s significant non-performance persists.”“As a result, the United States is left with no choice but to notify the council that Iran is in significant non-performance of its JCPOA commitments,” Pompeo wrote.Pompeo’s letter was accompanied by a six-page explanation of why the US believes it retains the right to invoke snapback.The US insistence that it can authorize snapback has already been rejected by virtually all other members of the 15-nation council. Germany, a participant in the Iran deal, is currently serving a two-year term on the council, and is also opposed.“France, Germany and the United Kingdom note that the US ceased to be a participant to the JCPOA following their withdrawal from the deal on May 8, 2018,” the group said in a statement released after Pompeo presented the letter. “We cannot therefore support this action which is incompatible with our current efforts to support the JCPOA.”Pompeo lashed out at the Europeans, accusing them of privately agreeing with the US concerns but lacking the courage to say so publicly. “Instead they chose to side with ayatollahs,” he said. “Their actions endanger the people of Iraq, of Yemen, of Lebanon, of Syria and indeed their own citizens as well.”Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, told UN chief António Guterres in a Thursday phone call that the Security Council must resist the US demand.“This would have dangerous consequences for international law, it will bring nothing but the destruction of international mechanisms and it will discredit the Security Council,” Zarif said.Under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined the nuclear deal, Thursday’s notification starts a 30-day clock after which pre-2015 UN sanctions on Iran that were eased will be re-imposed unless a resolution specifically extending their suspension is passed. The US, however, would use its veto power to block any resolution extending the sanctions relief.Pompeo said a Security Council resolution will be introduced as required under snapback, but he wouldn’t say which country would initiate it.Because of the legal debate over US standing, it is possible that the snapback demand will simply be ignored by the other members, which could call into question the Security Council’s relevance and ability to enforce its own legally binding decisions.Security Council president Djani is holding one-on-one consultations with members on the legality of the US action, council diplomats said, and the vast majority of members are virtually certain to agree that the US not legally entitled to invoke snapback — meaning snapback has not been triggered and the US action will have no effect.In these circumstances, the Security Council president would not be obliged to introduce a resolution to extend sanctions relief, which would face a US veto, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because consultations have been private.Russia asked for an open council meeting Friday to discuss implementation of the resolution endorsing the nuclear deal. But deputy ambassador Polyansky tweeted Thursday evening, “After groundlessly claiming that they triggered #snapback our US colleagues objected to holding a SC meeting to discuss what’s happening around implementation of Resolution 2231.”Trump and Pompeo had made no secret of their intention to pursue snapback, particularly after the administration’s embarrassing defeat last week at the Security Council on extending the arms embargo on Iran that expires in October. The US won just one other “yes” vote, with China and Russia opposed and the 11 other members abstaining.The Europeans are hoping to preserve the nuclear deal in the event Trump loses his bid for a second term in November’s presidential election. Democratic Joe Biden has said he would try to revive the agreement.The Europeans fear that the re-imposition of sanctions may lead Iran to quit the deal entirely and plow ahead with efforts to develop atomic weapons. The Trump administration says it withdrew precisely because the deal eased sanctions, opening major revenue streams for Iran while gradually easing restrictions on its nuclear activities that money could pay for.___Lee reported from Washington.

21-08-2020||World||JetBlue Airways deplanes woman, her 6 children as 2-year-old refuses to wear mask||Two recent incidents involving young children who refused to wear face masks show how airlines are struggling to balance safety with compassionate treatment of all their customers during a pandemic.JetBlue Airways forced a woman and her six children off a plane this week when her 2-year-old daughter wouldn’t keep her mask on.“It was horrible, the whole experience was traumatizing,” the mother, Chaya Bruck, told the New York Daily News from the airport in Orlando, Florida, where the Brooklyn family was stranded.Last week, a Texas woman said Southwest Airlines booted her family off a plane after one of the children, a 3-year-old with autism, refused to wear a mask. Alyssa Sadler said her son became upset because he does not like to have his face touched.All major U.S. airlines have mask rules and have banned at least a couple hundred passengers who have refused to comply. Typically, the violators are adults who argue that there is no government requirement to wear a mask — there isn’t; the Federal Aviation Administration has declined to impose one, leaving it up to the airlines.JetBlue and Southwest both require masks for all passengers except those under the age of 2.A JetBlue spokesman said the company’s policy mirrors guidelines on masks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“During these unprecedented times, our first priority is to keep crew members and customers safe, and we’ve quickly introduced new safety policies and procedures throughout the pandemic,” the airline spokesman, Derek Dombrowski, said in an email.Dombrowski said customers get an email before their flight that details safety rules including the one on face masks, and employees are ready to help customers who need assistance.Bruck and her family weren’t making a political stand against masks, “she and her other children were wearing them,” said Gary Leff, who writes about travel on his View from the Wing website. “She was doing her best, but some young children aren’t going to keep a mask on and fly much better with a pacifier.”Leff said “it seems reasonable” to exempt 2- and 3-year-olds from the mask rule.Sadler, the Houston-area woman kicked off a Southwest flight home from Midland, Texas, said she had a doctor’s note explaining her son’s autism condition, but it didn’t help.“I think there needs to be something in place for children or even adults with disabilities who can’t wear a mask. They should have some kind of exemption,” she told Houston TV station KPRC.Southwest is among several airlines that recently tightened the mask rules by ending an exemption for people who claim a medical reason for not covering their face. Southwest’s president said last month the change was made because passengers were uncomfortable seeing other people on board without masks.Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said Thursday that the airline regrets any inconvenience to the Sadler family. He said passengers 2 and up who can’t wear masks are given refunds and will be welcome on the airline “if public health guidance regarding face coverings changes.”Airlines have tweaked other pandemic-safety policies such as aircraft cleaning and leaving some seats empty to create more space between passengers.On Thursday, Delta Air Lines announced that it will continue blocking middle seats during the holidays and through at least Jan. 6. The Christmas season normally means packed planes, but it’s hard to know what flights will look like later this year. U.S. air travel during the peak summer season has been about 70% lower than a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jetblue-airways-deplanes-woman-her-6-children-as-2-year-old-refuses-to-wear-mask/story-Gyqzh2qlWshZrkJHkLIkXP.html
21-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un warns on economy, promotes sister, in sign of crisis||Kim Jong Un issued a dire warning for North Korea’s economy amid reports that he delegated some power to his sister, including responsibility for relations with the USKim told a gathering of ruling party leaders that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects” and that his development goals had been “seriously delayed,” state media said Thursday. The unusually candid assessment came as sanctions, flooding and the coronavirus pandemic pushed the North Korean economy toward what was expected to be its worst contraction in more than two decades.Hours later, South Korean lawmakers told reporters that the country’s spy agency determined that Kim had delegated responsibility for relations with Seoul and Washington to his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong. While she had taken an increasingly public role in diplomatic matters, such as responding to a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year, one lawmaker described a more formal power-sharing arrangement.Intelligence committee member Ha Tae-keung, who was among National Assembly lawmakers briefed by the spy agency Thursday, said the move didn’t indicate that Kim was adopting a “collective leadership” system similar to China’s Communist Party. “The absolute power of Kim Jong Un is being shared under the current leadership style of North Korea,” Ha said, adding that Kim still retained ultimate control.North Korea also announced plans for the first national congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea since 2016 next year. The key party meeting in January would provide another platform to promote prominent officials such as his sister, and purge others. Last week, Kim replaced the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, in another sign of political tension in Pyongyang.Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group, expressed skepticism that Kim would relinquish authority as supreme leader. “To say there is a partial transfer of power seems to be an exaggeration, given the system in North Korea,” she said.The statement on the economy was the latest in a series of complaints by Kim Jong Un about the pace of key policy goals. In recent months, he has lashed out at cadres over what he saw as lax virus management and blasted the people responsible constructing his showcase Pyongyang General Hospital, saying they were flouting party policies and being “careless” with spending.The North Korean leader also pledged to unveil a new five-year economic development plan at the upcoming party congress. The last meeting in 2016 of what is ostensibly North Korea’s highest-level decision-making assembly ended a 36-year lull when Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, ignored party rules requiring such a gathering every five years.“Planned attainment of the goals for improving the national economy have been seriously delayed and the people’s living standard has not been improved remarkably,” Kim told a gathering of the party’s Central Committee, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.While state media made no mention of the U.S.-led sanctions regime on the country, Pyongyang has repeatedly lashed out at the campaign. In December, Kim similarly told the Central Committee that “the conditions of the national economy have not turned better,” adding “the role of the state as the organizer of the economic work has not been enhanced.”Kim is facing difficulties on various fronts, and a reported health scare earlier this year raised questions about succession. His nuclear discussions with Trump have ground to a halt without him winning any sanctions relief, and the U.S. and South Korea this week kicked off joint military drills.At a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, Trump repeated his claim that the U.S. would have been at war with North Korea if not for him. Democrats have accused Trump of fueling tensions with Pyongyang to a point where conflict seemed possible.The economy was already under pressure from his decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on its minuscule legal trade. This year, the troubles could send the economy into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.Torrential rains that hit his state this summer have wiped out farmland, increasing food insecurity in the country where the United Nations World Food Program says about 40% of the population is undernourished. North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials.“Unless there is a major change -- such as pushing for economic reform or improving relations with South Korea, China and/or Russia -- it would be difficult for North Korea to deliver the economic prosperity it vowed,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-warns-on-economy-promotes-sister-in-sign-of-crisis/story-4dZ4ms783XPk7AbrsjbpZO.html
21-08-2020||World||TikTok pulls 380,000 videos in US for hate content||TikTok on Thursday said it has removed more than 380,000 videos in the US this year as part of a part of a mission to “eliminate hate” on the platform.TikTok also banned some 1,300 accounts for breaking rules against hateful content or behavior, and deleted 64,000 comments on similar grounds, according to the video-snippet sharing sensation.“These numbers don’t reflect a 100 percent success rate in catching every piece of hateful content or behavior, but they do indicate our commitment to action,” TikTok US head of safety Eric Han said in a blog post.“Our goal is to eliminate hate on TikTok.”Han’s overview of what TikTok is doing to combat hate comes as the app defends itself against what it calls “rumors and misinformation” about its links to the Chinese government.President Donald Trump has issued executive orders giving TikTok parent ByteDance, which is based in China, deadlines to stop running the app in the US and divest TikTok.“TikTok has never provided any US user data to the Chinese government, nor would it do so if asked,” the company said in a recent post.“Any insinuation to the contrary is unfounded and blatantly false.”US user data is stored in this country, with a backup in Singapore, according to TikTok.Han on Thursday outlined rules and actions being taken to make it more difficult to find threatening, violent, or dehumanizing content on TikTok.TikTok has a zero-tolerance stance against accounts linked to white nationalism, male supremacy, anti-Semitism and “other hate-based ideologies,” Han added.As tensions soar between the world’s two biggest economies, Trump has claimed TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on users for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.The US leader early this month also ordered a ban on the messaging app WeChat, which is used extensively in China.China meanwhile has slammed Washington for using “digital gunboat diplomacy” in the TikTok case.US technology firms Microsoft and Oracle are reported to be looking into the potential of buying TikTok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-pulls-380-000-videos-in-us-for-hate-content/story-AhP3YO9I2lRf0Wm9CuPhKO.html
21-08-2020||World||Republican who drew lines called gerrymanders faces charges||A Republican who played a prominent role in drawing North Carolina districts that were declared gerrymanders by courts resigned Thursday from the state House after being accused of federal fraud and tax violations.State Rep. David Lewis, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee since 2015, conducted a scheme to transfer money from his campaign committee to help his ailing farm, prosecutors said.Lewis, 49, entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Charlotte. According to the agreement, he will plead guilty to making false statements to a bank and failing to timely file a 2018 tax return. Government prosecutors won’t recommend active prison time.“The plea agreement signifies my commitment to put an unfortunate chapter behind me,” Lewis said in a news release. “These are my mistakes, and my mistakes alone. I am very sorry for these mistakes, and I apologize.”A formal plea hearing is scheduled for next week, a court record shows.The Harnett County Republican already had announced last month he wouldn’t be seeking a tenth term this November.As rules chairman, Lewis served as a top lieutenant to House Speaker Tim Moore, controlling the flow of legislation within the chamber.He was a chief legislative author of Republican redistricting plans in recent years and the resulting litigation that followed. One lawsuit involving congressional maps that went to the US Supreme Court pivoted on Lewis’ public comments about attempts to keep 10 of the US House seats in Republican hands.A document released by prosecutors and signed by Lewis’ attorney laying out the facts for the agreement said that Lewis made $300,000 in transfers from his campaign account to his bank account for Lewis Farms between January and May of 2018. While the campaign was later repaid in full, the expenditures were not reported to the State Board of Elections.In the summer of 2018, according to prosecutors, Lewis opened a bank account for an entity called “NC GOP, Inc.” and signed a document attesting it was a North Carolina corporation of which Lewis was president. But it wasn’t a legal entity, the document says.He subsequently deposited $65,000 from a Lewis campaign account, seemingly payable to the entity, into the “NC GOP, Inc.” bank account. Almost all of it ultimately went to Lewis Farms, the document says. Lewis later paid $65,000 from a personal bank account to the state Republican Party, in keeping with his campaign reports that described contributions to the state party, the court document said.The State Board of Elections had no information late Thursday about whether it was investigating Lewis’ campaign committee.Recent financial troubles had surfaced for Lewis, especially after Hurricane Florence in 2018, which he said last year had caused “catastrophic damage.”“Farming has been tough for me for the past six years in a row and the financial stress I’ve been under has been tremendous,” Lewis said in Thursday’s release. “However, that is the reality facing many family farms, and it does not excuse my mistakes.”By last fall, Lewis had taken out well over $1 million in loans to address his farm problems, including $500,000 from John Gray, a political consultant and fellow farmer, WRAL-TV reported last year. Gray was one of four people indicted during a federal investigation into attempts to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.A jury convicted Gray in March and he was sentenced on Wednesday to 2 1/2 years in prison. There is no mention of Gray in Thursday’s documents involving Lewis. Former state GOP Chairman Robin Hayes, who was among those indicted in the bribery case, accepted a plea agreement and received probation on Wednesday.Moore, who has known Lewis since college, wished “the Lewis family well moving forward from this.”“While people make mistakes they must be held accountable, particularly as public servants,” Moore said in a news release.Democrats hoping to retake control of the House for the first time since 2010 in November jumped on the news about Lewis.“North Carolinians cannot trust ... Moore and House Republicans to legislate in the people’s best interest when key members of his team put their own personal interests first and foremost,” Democratic state Rep. Graig Meyer said in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-who-drew-lines-called-gerrymanders-faces-charges/story-gTCkQfpEmUNWq1Rf6K5PxL.html
21-08-2020||World||Donald Trump reaffirms plan to withdraw all US troops from Iraq||President Donald Trump on Thursday reaffirmed his plan to withdraw all US troops from Iraq as quickly as possible as he met with the prime minister of Iraq to discuss ways to rein in pro-Iran militias in the country and counter residual threats from Islamic State sleeper cells.“We look forward to the day when we don’t have to be there,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.“We were there and now we’re getting out. We’ll be leaving shortly and the relationship is very good. We’re making very big oil deals. Our oil companies are making massive deals. ... We’re going to be leaving and hopefully we’re going to be leaving a country that can defend itself.”Asked about a timetable for a full withdrawal, the president turned to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who replied: “As soon as we can complete the mission. The president has made very clear he wants to get our forces down to the lowest level as quickly as we possibly can. That’s the mission he’s given us and we’re working with the Iraqis to achieve that.”There are more than 5,000 American troops in Iraq now. Last month, the top U.S. general for the Middle East said he believed the U.S. will keep a smaller but enduring presence in the country. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said he believes the Iraqis welcome the U.S. and coalition troops, especially in the ongoing fight to keep IS fighters from taking hold of the country again.McKenzie has not said how many U.S. troops might stay. But he said Iraqi conventional forces now operate on their own. U.S. and coalition forces continue to conduct training and counterterrorism operations, including with Iraqi commandos. Any final decisions, he said, would be coordinated with the Iraqi government.Al-Kadhimi, who is backed by the United States, assumed office in May when Baghdad’s relations with Washington were precarious following the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport. The prime minister “has my ear,” Trump said.Al-Kadhimi has often had to walk a tightrope due to the U.S.-Iran rivalry. Asked if he was bringing any messages from Tehran following a recent visit there, al-Kadhimi told The Associated Press before he left for Washington, “We do not play the role of postman in Iraq.”The U.S. recognizes the cultural and religious ties that exist between Iran and Iraq, but the administration wants to decrease Iran’s destabilizing influence in Iraq, often exercised by pro-Iranian militias.Al-Kadhimi’s administration inherited many crises. State coffers in the crude oil-dependent country were slashed following a severe drop in prices, adding to the woes of an economy already struggling with the aftershocks of the global coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. wants to make sure the Baghdad central government’s limited resources also find their way to the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.State violence used to quell the mass protests that erupted in October brought public trust in the government to a new low. Tens of thousands of Iraqis marched, decrying rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment, leading to the resignation of the previous premier, Adel Abdul-Mahdi.As al-Kadhimi held strategic talks with Trump, which were expected to shape the future of the U.S.-Iraq relationship, human rights monitors on Thursday sounded the alarm over a recent spike in killings targeting civil rights activists in the southern part of the county.In addition, rockets have continued to strike at the seat of al-Kadhimi’s government. Iran-backed Shiite militia groups are widely suspected of being behind both types of attacks.Pompeo, who met Wednesday with Iraq’s foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said the U.S. was committed to helping Iraq regain and maintain security, despite Trump’s desire to reduce and then eliminate American troops’ presence there. Armed groups are not under the full control of the Iraqi prime minister, Pompeo said. He said those groups should be replaced by local police as soon as possible and that the U.S. could and would help.The Iraqi prime minister told Pompeo that Iraq currently does not need direct military support on the ground, and that the levels of help will depend on the changing nature of the threat. Three years since Iraq declared victory over IS, sleeper cells continue to stage attacks across the country’s north.Pompeo and the Iraqi foreign minister expressed hope that as the security situation improves, there will be greater economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the energy sector.On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette announced energy agreements worth up to $8 billion between the Iraqi minsters of oil and electricity and five U.S. companies — Honeywell, Baker Hughes, GE, Stellar and Chevron. Brouillette said U.S. private investment will help Iraqi’s energy sector and stressed a need for Iraq to reduce its dependence on energy from Iran.___Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Lolita C.

21-08-2020||World||World Bank chief warns extreme poverty could surge by 100 million||The coronavirus pandemic may have driven as many as 100 million people back into extreme poverty, World Bank President David Malpass warned Thursday.The Washington-based development lender previously estimated that 60 million people would fall into extreme poverty due to Covid-19, but the new estimate puts the deterioration at 70 to 100 million, and he said “that number could go higher” if the pandemic worsens or drags on.The situation makes it “imperative” that creditors reduce the amount of debt held by poor countries at risk, going beyond the commitment to suspend debt payments, Malpass said in an interview with AFP.Even so, more countries will be obliged to restructure their debt.“The debt vulnerabilities are high, and the imperative of getting light at the end of the tunnel so that new investors can come in is substantial,” Malpass said.Advanced economies in the Group of 20 already have committed to suspending debt payments from the poorest nations through the end of the year, and there is growing support for extending that moratorium into next year amid a pandemic that’s killed nearly 800,000 people and sickened more than 25 million worldwide.But Malpass said that will not be enough, since the economic downturn means those countries, which already are struggling to provide a safety net for their citizens, will not be in a better position to deal with the payments.- Recession or depression? -The amount of debt reduction needed will depend on the situation in each country, he said, but the policy “makes a lot of sense.”“So I think the awareness of this will be gradually, more and more apparent” especially “for the countries with the highest vulnerability to the debt situation.”The World Bank has committed to deploying $160 billion in funding to 100 countries through June 2021 in an effort to addresses the immediate emergency, and about $21 billion had been released through the end of June.But even so, extreme poverty, defined as earning less than $1.90 a day, continues to rise.Malpass said the deterioration is due to a combination of the destruction of jobs during the pandemic as well as supply issues that make access to food more difficult.“All of this contributes to pushing people back into extreme poverty the longer the economic crisis persists.”Newly-installed World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart has called the economic crisis a “pandemic depression,” but Malpass was less concerned with terminology.“We can start calling it a depression. Our focus is on how do we help countries be resilient in working out on the other side.”- More debt transparency -Malpass said he has been “frustrated” by the slow progress among private creditors in providing comparable debt suspension terms for poor countries.While the Institute for International Finance has set up a framework to waive debt service payments, as of mid-July member banks had not received any applications.Having a clear view of the size of each country’s debt and the collateral involved also are key to being able to help the debtor nations, Malpass said.China is a major creditor in many of these countries, and the government has been “participating in the transparency process,” but he said more needs to be done to understand the terms of loans in nations like Angola, where there are liens on the country’s oil output.Governments in advanced economies so far have been “generous” in their support of developing nations, even while they take on heavy spending programs in their own countries, Malpass said.“But the bigger problem is that their economies are weak,” Malpass said of the wealthy nations.“The most important thing the advanced economies do for the developing countries is supply markets... start growing, and start reopening markets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-chief-warns-extreme-poverty-could-surge-by-100-million/story-Sm3GzNO9UkfxULjGd3pIiK.html
21-08-2020||World||Humans overshoot 2020 planetary ‘budget’ on August 22||Humanity will have burned through all the natural resources that the planet can replenish for 2020 by this Saturday, according to researchers who said the grim milestone is slightly later than last year after the pandemic slowed runaway overconsumption.So-called Earth Overshoot Day - the date when humanity has used all the biological resources that Earth can renew annually - has crept steadily earlier since the 1970s, according to the Global Footprint Network.The group calculates the point will be reached on August 22, compared to July 29 in 2019, marking a rare reversal after lockdowns to slow the coronavirus caused a temporary decline in emissions and wood harvesting. This reduced humanity’s footprint by 9.3% compared to last year, they said. But that is “not something to celebrate”, said Mathis Wackernagel, president of Global Footprint Network, in an online presentation on Thursday. “It’s not done by design, it’s done by disaster,” he added. Researchers calculate the date humanity overshoots its planetary budget by looking at “all the human demands” for food, energy, space for houses and roads and what would be needed to absorb global C02 emissions, Wackernagel said. “It’s like with money. We can spend more than what we earned, but not forever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/humans-overshoot-2020-planetary-budget-on-august-22/story-9imlytpzLfCbQMdHlfQYVO.html
21-08-2020||World||Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon arrested for fraud||Steve Bannon, a former senior advisor to President Donald Trump, and three others were arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors in connection with an online crowdfunding campaign for one of the president’s pet projects of building a wall along the border with Mexico.“As alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretence that all of that money would be spent on construction,” said acting US attorney for the South District of New York in a statement announcing the arrests and charges.The project was called “We Build the Wall”. “While repeatedly assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,” the US attorney added.Bannon was chief executive of the Trump campaign and after election joined the White House staff as chief strategist. He did not last long, and left the administration in August 2017.The other two arrested and charged are Andrew Badolato and Timothy Shea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-trump-advisor-steve-bannon-arrested-for-fraud/story-vpLMEIk8f8B9v5AjbSuXQO.html
21-08-2020||World||Libya’s government announces cease-fire, calls for elections||Libya’s UN supported government Friday announced a cease-fire across the oil-rich country and called for demilitarizing the strategic city of Sirte in an initiative supported by the rival parliament in the east.The development could mark a breakthrough following international pressure amid rising fear of a new escalation in the chaotic proxy war as rival sides mobilize for a battle over Sirte. The gateway to the country’s major oil export terminals has been under the control of forces loyal to military commander Khalifa Hifter since January.Libya was plunged into chaos when a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed. The country has since split between rival east- and west-based administrations, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.Hifter is supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Turkey, a bitter rival of Egypt and the UAE in a broader regional struggle over political Islam, is the main patron of the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord based in the capital Tripoli, which are also backed by the wealthy Gulf state of Qatar.Hifter’s forces launched an offensive in April 2019 to try and capture Tripoli. But his campaign collapsed in June when the Tripoli-allied militias, with heavy Turkish support, gained the upper hand, driving his forces from the outskirts of the city and other western towns.Emboldened by Turkey’s support, Tripoli-allied forces vowed to retake Sirte and the Jurfa area, which includes a vital inland military base, from Hifter’s forces, leading Egypt to threaten to send troops to Libya.The chaos in the oil-rich country has worsened in recent months as foreign backers increasingly intervene, despite pledges to the contrary at a high-profile peace summit in Berlin earlier this year. Thousands of mercenaries including Russian, Syrians and Sudanese are fighting on both sides of the conflict.“Achieving an effective cease-fire requires the demilitarization of Sirte and Jurfa areas, and that police forces from the two sides agree on security arrangements there,” said Fayez Sarraj, head of the Government of National Accord in Tripoli.In a separate statement, Aguila Saleh, speaker of the rival east-based House of Representatives, supported Sarraj’s proposal of demilitarization, an idea floated earlier this month by the United States as a compromise to prevent an escalation in the more than 9-year-old conflict.Sarraj also called for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held in March according to a “a constitutional base agreed on by the Libyans.”Saleh, the parliament speaker, called for Sirte to be a temporary seat of the new government.Both Saraj and Saleh said they want an end to an oil blockade imposed by the camp of military commander Khalifa Hifter since earlier this year. Hifter is an ally to the parliament speaker. They also called for oil revenues, the country’s main source of revenue, to flow into the bank account of the National Oil Corporation outside Libya.Powerful tribes in eastern Libya loyal to Hifter closed oil export terminals and choked off major pipelines at the start of the year in an effort to pressure the Tripoli-based government, which is accused of using oil revenues to fund militias and mercenaries.There was no immediate comment form Hifter’s army, but Hifter agreed on an Egyptian initiative in June that included a cease-fire.The U.N. support mission in Libya welcomed both statements and called for the expulsion of all foreign forces and mercenaries in Libya. Both sides of the conflict are supported by thousands of mercenaries.“The two initiatives have created hope for forging a peaceful political solution to the longstanding Libyan crisis, a solution that will affirm the desire of the Libyan people to live in peace and dignity,” said Stephanie Williams, acting head of the U.N. mission.Previous efforts to secure lasting cease-fires have stalled. But this time could prove different with heavy foreign interference in the conflict-stricken country, and the possibility of direct military confrontation between Egypt and Turkey, both allies to the U.S.“It sounds more like an announcement that tried to tick all the theoretical boxes, with a clear American influence,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at The Netherlands Institute of International Relations. “But is it fully implementable? That will be hard.”The chaos in the oil-rich country has worsened in recent months as foreign backers increasingly intervene, despite pledges to the contrary at a high-profile peace summit in Berlin earlier this year.Hifter’s offensive on Tripoli deeply polarized the already divided country and aborted U.N. efforts to hold a peace conference more than a year ago.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Twitter welcomed both statements as “an important step on the path of achieving the political settlement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-s-government-announces-cease-fire-calls-for-elections/story-q8YgVniSRVNyRI1mFkEFrJ.html
