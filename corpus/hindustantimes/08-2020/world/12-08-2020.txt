12-08-2020||World||‘We have arrived,’ say Indian American after Kamala Harris selection||“We have arrived,” said Ramesh Kapur, an Indian American Democratic operative, about Kamala Harris joining Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for vice-president.The Tuesday announcement sent a wave of excitement coursing through the small Indian American community of about 4 million people. There was a sense, cutting across party lines, that Harris’s name on the presidential ticket was a badge of recognition for the entire community.Kapur, a veteran Democratic fundraiser, insists that the Biden-Harris ticket, as the team will be called now and until the November 3 elections and beyond, should be called, instead, the “Biden-Kamala” ticket.“The ‘Biden-Kamala’ name,” said Kapur, who had hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his home in Boston in 2016 during her senate race, had a better Indian ring to it.No American of India descent has ever made it on to a presidential ticket. Bobby Jindal, a former governor of Louisiana, was the first of Indian-descent to run for president. But he lost in the Republican primaries to Donald Trump, who went on to win the White House in 2016.Harris became the second Indian American to try, in 2019. But her run for the Democratic ticket did not last long either, to the disappointment of the community, many of whom were girding up for a long run. including Kapur, who had held some fund-raisers.Her return to the fray Tuesday, rekindled that optimism and re-energized the community.“Moment of great pride for the Indian American community,” said Shekar Narasimhan, chairman of Victory Fund, a Democratic party-affiliate focussed on Asian Americans. “It’s a first in so many ways and will help Joe Biden win the presidency which is the first priority. A seismic shift occurred today and its ramifications will be felt for many decades.”Frank Islam, a major Indian American fundraiser for Democrats, said, “This is a historical day for America, especially for the African American and Indian American communities.”“Since Dalip Singh Saund entered the US Congress in 1957 against all odds, the community has made tremendous strides in politics,” he added, referring to the first Indian American elected to US congress. “This unquestionably trumps every milestone. Vice presidency is generally referred to as a position that is a heartbeat away from presidency.”Most vice-presidents go on to run for the top job, with the rare exception in recent years of Dick Cheney, vice-president to President George W Bush. And most of them win, against with the rare exception in recent years of Al Gore, vice-president to President Bill Clinton. And former Vice-President Biden is himself in the fray, continuing the tradition.The nomination sets up Harris for another presidential run, according to experts. It could be in 2024, if Biden, should he win this time in 2020, doesn’t want to continue, which is a widely considered possibility given his age (he is 77 now); or in 2028 at the end of the full two-term Biden presidency.“It’s the beginning of her becoming the first Indian American president,” Kapur said of the Tuesday announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-arrived-say-indian-american-after-kamala-harris-selection/story-Y5EgdHICsmLMwK7m0xBp9O.html
12-08-2020||World||China’s days as world’s factory are over, says iPhone maker||A key supplier to Apple Inc. and a dozen other tech giants plans to split its supply chain between the Chinese market and the U.S., declaring that China’s time as factory to the world is finished because of the trade war.Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Chairman Young Liu said it’s gradually adding more capacity outside of China, the main base of production for gadgets from iPhones to Dell desktops and Nintendo Switches. The proportion outside the country is now at 30%, up from 25% last June.That ratio will rise as the company -- known also as Foxconn -- moves more manufacturing to Southeast Asia and other regions to avoid escalating tariffs on Chinese-made goods headed to U.S. markets, Liu told reporters after his company reported financial results.Also read: Apple must pay $500 million over patent violations, US court rules“No matter if it’s India, Southeast Asia or the Americas, there will be a manufacturing ecosystem in each,” Liu said, adding that while China will still play a key role in Foxconn’s manufacturing empire, the country’s “days as the world’s factory are done.”Intensifying trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have pushed device manufacturers to diversify their production bases away from China, and Liu last year said that Apple’s most prized product, the iPhone, can be made outside China if needed. The two nations remain in trade talks, but Liu’s comments affirm a growing expectation that the China-centric electronics supply chain will fragment over the longer term.The Taiwanese company reported better-than-expected net income of NT$22.9 billion ($778 million) for the quarter ended in June, boosted by increased demand for iPads and MacBooks. Revenue was NT$1.13 trillion, but Hon Hai warned it expects its third-quarter sales will be down by double digits relative to 2019 as Apple delays its iPhone launch this year.Hon Hai is bouncing back from a record profit slump in the first quarter as production at its factories recovered and shelter-in-place orders spurred demand for home computing equipment. The pandemic likely boosted iPad and Mac sales, even as Apple store closures weighed on iPhone sales, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on July 31 after reporting quarterly revenue that crushed estimates. Apple accounts for half of Hon Hai’s sales.Even as Apple outperformed, Hon Hai’s other customers have fared less well. Hong Kong-listed subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd. said in its Aug. 7 earnings release that while Huawei Technologies Co.’s new phones have been popular in China, they missed expectations elsewhere following U.S. sanctions. Another key customer Xiaomi Corp. suffered a backlash in the Indian market amid growing tensions between China and the South Asian country. FIH lost $100 million in the first half.Foxconn has been shaking up its traditionally China-focused operations. Hon Hai is among Apple assembly partners that plan to expand operations in India, potentially helping the iPhone maker grow its presence in the country of 1.3 billion and shift some of the U.S. company’s supply chain outside of China as ties between Washington and Beijing fray.Chinese rivals are also posing a growing challenge. Local electronics titan Luxshare Precision Industry Co. is poised to become the first Chinese homegrown iPhone assembler after sealing a deal in July to buy an Apple handset production plant from Wistron Corp. While Hon Hai will keep assembly orders for premium iPhones, Luxshare will eat into the business for mid-to-entry-level Apple handsets, Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao wrote in a July 23 note.Foxconn will work on its component business to maintain tech leadership and it also benefits from its long-term relationship with Apple, Liu said in response to several analysts’ questions about Foxconn’s competitive strategy against the rising Chinese supplier.Orders could be further affected after President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring U.S. residents from doing business with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat. Annual iPhone shipments could plunge 25%-30% if Apple is forced to remove the app from its app stores worldwide, TF International Securities analyst Kuo Ming-chi warned in an August 9 note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-days-as-world-s-factory-are-over-says-iphone-maker/story-clPVEE4DKQX4Muwe4kNRJL.html
12-08-2020||World||‘Fight on’: Arrested Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai tells staff||Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai on Wednesday told his reporters to “fight on” after his dramatic arrest, as China widens its crackdown against critics in the semi-autonomous city.The clampdown has gathered pace since Beijing imposed a sweeping security law on the international business hub in June, with opposition politicians disqualified and activists arrested for social media posts.Lai was among 10 people detained under the new law on Monday as around 200 police officers searched the newsroom of his Apple Daily tabloid, which is unapologetically critical of Beijing.The 71-year-old was cheered by staff and handed a bouquet on Wednesday as he returned to the newsroom following a late-night release on bail after 40 hours in custody.“Fight on! Let’s fight on,” Lai said. “We have the support of the Hong Kong people. We can’t let them down.”In images broadcast live on Facebook by his own reporters, he told staff to continue filing the kind of unvarnished dispatches that have infuriated China and pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong.But Lai told staff it was becoming “increasingly difficult” to run a media business in the city.“Luckily, I was not sent back to the mainland,” he quipped in a characteristic display of dark humour.The crackdown has provoked outrage in the West and deepened fears for millions who last year took to the streets to protest China’s tightening grip on the city.China has declared it will have jurisdiction over especially serious national security crimes, toppling the legal firewall between the mainland’s Communist Party-controlled courts and Hong Kong’s independent judiciary.Sweeping new law Beijing imposed the new national security law in response to huge and often violent pro-democracy protests last year.It has described the law -- its contents kept secret until it was enacted on 30 June -- as a “sword” hanging over the heads of opponents in Hong Kong.It officially criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.Also read: Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai arrested under national security law: ReportBut the broadly worded provisions outlawed certain political speech overnight, such as advocating sanctions, and greater autonomy or independence for Hong Kong.Similar laws are used on the authoritarian mainland to snuff out opposition.The most serious crimes under the Hong Kong law -- which is not supposed to be retroactive -- carry up to life in jail.Police have given limited details of their alleged case against Lai and those arrested on Monday.They say the group were involved in lobbying for foreign sanctions before the security law was passed and that they continued to operate in some form once the legislation came in.Among those arrested were two of Lai’s sons, senior Apple Daily executives and three members of now-disbanded pro-democracy party Demosisto -- including prominent activist Agnes Chow.Regional media hub Critics believe the security law has ended the key liberties and autonomy that Beijing promised Hong Kong could keep after its 1997 handover by Britain.The US has declared Hong Kong no longer autonomous from the mainland and has deployed sanctions in response.A growing roster of western powers has suspended extradition agreements with Hong Kong in protest at the crackdown including Britain, Canada, Australia, France and Germany.China has responded in kind. On Wednesday, Hong Kong’s government announced it was suspending its extradition agreements with France and Germany.Hong Kong is a major media hub with a vibrant local press and multiple international news outlets operating regional headquarters in the city. Both China and Hong Kong’s government vowed the security law would keep press freedoms intact. But the police operation against Lai sparked denunciations of plunging press freedoms.Several foreign media groups have reported sudden delays in getting visas renewed for staff or outright rejections.Local media reported that a new unit has been set up in Hong Kong’s immigration department to vet visa applications for foreign journalists.The Immigration Department has declined to comment on the reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fight-on-arrested-hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-tells-staff/story-wzvwSeBPMoFSyMKiPlyxWI.html
12-08-2020||World||Iran’s president, FM lash out at new US push on arms embargo||Iran’s president and foreign minister lashed out on Wednesday at a revised proposal by the US that would extend a UN arms embargo on Iran indefinitely, the latest in the Trump administration’s maximum pressure policy against Iran.The US on Tuesday circulated the revised draft at the UN, seeking to gain more support in the 15-member Security Council where veto-wielding Russia and China have voiced strong opposition. The revised draft, which eliminated some provisions from the earlier version that diplomats said went beyond the extension of the arms embargo, may be put to a vote as early as Friday.Still, with Russia and China sharply critical of the US effort to indefinitely extend the arms embargo, the two will likely use their veto powers even if the draft got the minimum nine “yes” votes in the council, which appears unlikely.The US push to make the arms embargo permanent follows President Donald Trump’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal between major world powers and Tehran, aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran has repeatedly insisted it does not seek to produce a nuclear bomb.The nuclear deal, endorsed by the Security Council, includes a provision lifting the arms embargo on Iran on October 18.Rouhani lambasted the revised draft, saying its “initiators will be responsible for the consequences” if the Security Council adopts the new resolution. He did not elaborate on what steps Iran could take.Zarif said the US draft was a “very illegal resolution, and in fact it uses the Security Council mechanisms to destroy the Security Council. “ “I’m confident that this resolution will be rejected too,” Zarif said.The United Nations banned Iran from buying major foreign weapon systems in 2010 amid tensions over its nuclear program. That blocked Iran from replacing its aging military equipment, much of which had been purchased by the shah before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. An earlier embargo targeted Iranian arms exports.In a separate development Wednesday, Iranian hard-liners in parliament voted against Rouhani’s nominee for trade minister in the first showdown between the rival camps since the house resumed work in May despite the struggles to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Lawmakers rejected Hossein Modares Khiabani’s nomination for minister of trade and industries.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said the vote was 140-104 against the nominee. There were 254 lawmakers at the session and 10 abstained. The parliament has 290 seats.The vote marked the first serious confrontation between the newly elected house, dominated by conservatives and the bloc of supporters of the relatively moderate Rouhani. Under the law, Rouhani must introduce new nominees to his Cabinet in the next three months.Rouhani in May dismissed the trade and industry minister at the time, Reza Rahmani, as Iran faced an unprecedented economic downturn amid intense pressure from the United States after Trump pulled America out of the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country. Khiabani, 52, had since been the acting trade minister.Iran is also grappling with the largest and deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus in the Middle East, with more than 333,000 confirmed cases and at least 18,988 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-president-fm-lash-out-at-new-us-push-on-arms-embargo/story-NiB0VUBU13bI3y9Yoj5QaI.html

Best Wishes from Changsha! True unity inspires people to work as one to overcome adversity,” The Capital Gazette reported.Another note from Yani Xia, a representative in the Chinese city’s Foreign Affairs Office, accompanied the shipments. “We sincerely wish you and everyone in Annapolis continued good health, and the fortitude to persevere during this challenging period,” Xia’s note read.Annapolis’ relationship with Changsha began under a former city administrator, according to the release. The two municipalities are now sister cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-city-donates-40-000-masks-to-annapolis/story-TFLNlRwBbHONrhQwL8eZyJ.html
12-08-2020||World||Chinese woman, 68, tests Covid-19 positive after recovering in February||A 68-year-old Chinese woman has tested positive for Covid-19 six months after she recovered from the disease, health authorities said here Wednesday. The second – and rare late -- resurgence of the virulent virus in a cured and discharged patient in China raises questions about the time it could take to eliminate the pathogen from the body.The woman’s case was reported from the Jingzhou area of central China’s Hubei province.The virus first emerged late last year in the provincial capital, Wuhan, before spreading across China and then globally.The patient, who was not identified, had been infected early during the outbreak in China but recovered and was discharged from the hospital in February.But she tested positive again on August 9 following tests after she showed symptoms.The elderly patient was quarantined, and her close contacts have tested negative for the virus, the health authorities said.A virologist told Chinese state media that the rare case shows it probably takes a long time to eliminate the coronavirus from the human body, but asserted that people who tested positive again after recovering from Covid-19 are not infectious.The virologist cited scientific studies to say that “re-positive” Covid-19 patients are not infectious.The density of the virus inside this specific patient’s body was low, which may explain why she had tested negative in the first place, Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the state-controlled tabloid Global Times. A survey conducted by Wuhan’s Zhongnan hospital last week said 90 percent of a sample group of recovered patients reported lung damage and five percent of them had to be again quarantined after testing positive for the virus.A team at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University led by Peng Zhiyong, director of the hospital’s ICU has been conducting follow-up visits with ‘100 recovered patients’ ..The results also showed that antibodies against the novel coronavirus in 10 per cent of the 100 patients have disappeared.Five per cent of them received negative results in Covid-19 nucleic acid tests but positive results in Immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests, and thus have to be quarantined again, the report said.The patients also suffered depression and a sense of stigma. Most of the recovered patients told the team that their families were not willing to have dinner with them at the same table, the report said.China has brought the spread of the pandemic under control but is still tackling new smaller cluster infections in different cities and imported cases of Covid-19.The coronavirus was found on the outer packaging of frozen shrimps bought by a restaurant in Wuhu city in Anhui province during a routine inspection by local authorities, CCTV, China’s state television, reported.The news broke a day after a port city in eastern China’s Shandong province said it found the virus on the packaging of imported frozen seafood although it did not say where the seafood consignment originated.The Hubei province has reported a total of 68138 Covid-19 cases, the most in China and the disease has claimed 4512 lives in the province.China’s national health commission (NHC) on Wednesday said that it received reports of 25 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Tuesday, including 16 imported cases and nine domestically transmitted ones.China has so far reported 84737 cases and 4634 deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-woman-68-tests-covid-19-positive-after-recovering-in-february/story-vlkL6YBtLFK3BBAmVDrYDK.html
12-08-2020||World||Covid-19 plunges UK into recession, Sunak warns of ‘hard times’||Chancellor Rishi Sunak declared on Wednesday that ‘hard times are here’ after new official figures showed that the United Kingdom had fallen into deep recession – the GDP is down by 20.4% – as the coronavirus pandemic takes a heavy toll of lives, lifestyles and jobs.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the GDP fell in the second quarter of 2020 by 20.4% compared with the previous three months – the biggest quarterly decline since comparable records began in 1955. It is the worst figure for any G7 nation in the three months to June.Sunak, who has been borrowing heavily to pay most of the wage bill of the private sector and the self-employed since March, said: ““I’ve said before that hard times were ahead and today’s figures confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs and, sadly, in the coming months many more will. But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”The government-backed furlough scheme is to end in October, with more warnings that it would further plunge employment figures as companies either shut shop or cut staff drastically to remain in business.The ONS said the economy bounced back in June as government restrictions on movement started to ease: it grew by 8.7% in June, after growth of 1.8% in May, but Jonathan Athow of ONS said: “Despite this, gross domestic product in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.”The opposition Labour criticised the Boris Johnson government’s handling of the economy during the pandemic. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: “We’ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we’re on course for the worst recession too”.“That’s a tragedy for the British people and it’s happened on Boris Johnson’s watch,” she added.Alpesh Paleja of the Confederation of British Industry said many companies were struggling to pay their bills on time: “A sustained recovery is by no means assured. The dual threats of a second wave and slow progress over Brexit negotiations are also particularly concerning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-plunges-uk-into-recession-sunak-warns-of-hard-times/story-FYkpGymyVbLJiUeS9ZPy1H.html
12-08-2020||World||China to bring up WeChat, TikTok in next US trade talks||US and Chinese negotiators plan to discuss progress of their trade deal in the coming days, with Beijing pushing to widen the agenda to include Washington’s recent crackdown on businesses including TikTok and WeChat.A virtual meeting will likely take place as soon as this week though a date hasn’t been finalized, according to people familiar with preparations for the talks who asked not to be named. President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser on Tuesday downplayed concerns the phase-one agreement will fall apart.Also read | Twitter, TikTok have had preliminary talks about merger: ReportAlong with agricultural purchases and the dollar-yuan exchange rate, Chinese officials intend to bring up Trump’s prospective bans on transactions with the two apps on national security grounds, the people said without elaborating about what China hopes to achieve by doing so.Almost seven months after a White House signing ceremony paused a tariff war that had roiled the global economy, Beijing’s pledged purchases of US goods are far behind schedule. The coronavirus crisis and the deterioration in US-China relations on everything from tech security to Hong Kong has left trade a rare area of cooperation.The “one area we are engaging is trade,” Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said at a White House press conference Tuesday. “It’s fine right now.”At a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China’s position on phase one remains consistent. TikTok, he said, “is just a platform for providing entertainment, leisure, the show of talents and sharing for American people and people around the world. It has nothing to do with national security.”In the US, Trump’s treatment of China is emerging as a political weapon for Democrats trying to unseat him in November. It was three years ago this month that the Trump administration initiated an investigation into China’s treatment of US intellectual property that would help form the foundation of a trade war that would lead to tariffs on some $500 billion in products shipped between the world’s largest economies.Now, less than three months before Trump’s re-election bid, the pandemic that originated in China has his administration struggling to find the balance between showing toughness and clinging to an agreement that isn’t delivering on Beijing’s promises.‘It’s About Farmers’Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Bloomberg Television this week that “it’s amazing that despite the storm that is now the US-China relationship, neither Trump or Xi Jinping really want to junk the phase-one deal.”“For Trump, in a word, it’s about farmers -- the sales that they can make for red states in this election,” Kennedy said, referring to rural strongholds for Republicans. For Chinese President Xi, “it’s about stability and keeping the relationship from entirely collapsing,” he said.China is seeking to defuse an unpredictable confrontation with the US that’s seen several of its tech champions targeted, with the latest actions spurring a potential sale of the US operations of ByteDance Ltd’s wildly popular short video app to Microsoft Corp. Trump is also banning US transactions with Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat app, which has more than 1 billion users.Trump’s executive orders, set to take effect in September, have potentially an even wider impact than the multi-pronged assault on telecommunications hardware provider Huawei Technologies Co., as they threaten to sever communication links among the people of the world’s biggest economies. The US argues that Chinese apps which collect information on US citizens pose a grave national security risk as the data is prone to being acquired by the Chinese government.Given the collapse in the global economy this year tied to the pandemic, which Trump has repeatedly blamed on China, Beijing was only a quarter of the way through its effort to buy more than $170 billion in US goods this year by the end of June.On Tuesday Kudlow downplayed the shortfall, saying China had “substantially” increased purchases of US goods.China would need to buy about $130 billion in the second half of this year to comply with the original terms of the agreement signed in January, which laid out purchasing an additional $200 billion of US goods and services over the 2017 level by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-bring-up-wechat-tiktok-in-next-us-trade-talks/story-8hZRpWmt8JrMExFyGyERWJ.html

As Islamabad returns loan, questions riseThis development came after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had given a blunt warning to Saudi Arabia-led Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for not taking a stance against India over the Kashmir issue.Qureshi was quoted as saying by the ARY channel, “If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris.”“I am once again respectfully telling OIC that a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers is our expectation,” he further stated.As Pakistan pulled out of the Kuala Lumpur summit after Saudi Arabia’s “request”, it now expects Riyadh to “show leadership on this issue,” he added.Islamabad has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) since India abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.After Pakistan failed to gather support from the OIC members on Kashmir on May 22, Prime Minister Imran Khan said, “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We cannot even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”Though Pakistan reportedly made attempts to push its narrative of raising the issue of rising Islamophobia in India in its agenda, Maldives, an ally of India, thwarted the move and said, “Isolated statements by motivated people and disinformation campaigns on social media should not be construed as representative of the feelings of 1.3 billion.”Maldives Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Thilmeeza Hussain, said that alleging Islamophobia in the context of India would be factually incorrect.“It would be detrimental to the religious harmony in the South Asian region. Islam has existed in India for centuries and it is the second-largest religion in India, with 14.2 per cent of the country’s population,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-loan-oil-supply-for-pakistan-says-saudi-arabia/story-834l4VX4OLmNZOlyQ8doAL.html
12-08-2020||World||Biden has surrendered to radical mob by naming Kamala Harris as running mate: Trump Campaign||By naming Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris as his Vice President running mate, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has surrendered to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding and appease socialist dictators, President Donald Trump campaign has alleged. Launching a scathing attack on Harris, the Trump campaign said the Americans will resoundingly reject the absymal failures of Biden and Harris.“Joe Biden is no moderate, and with Harris as his ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators,” Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 campaign’s senior advisor, said in a statement.“At the ballot box, Americans will resoundingly reject the abysmal failures of Biden-Harris in favor of the America First strength of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence,” Pierson said. The comments came as Biden on Tuesday named Harris as his Vice-Presidential running mate, making history by selecting the first black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.Harris, has been one of those Democratic Senators who has been leading the party’s charge against President Donald Trump, who is seeking his re-election from the Republican party.“Not long ago, Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received. Clearly, Phony Kamala will abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat Party,” Pierson said.“In her failed attempt at running for president, Harris gleefully embraced the left’s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders’ government takeover of healthcare. She is proof that Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left,” Pierson said.Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel alleged that Harris’ extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials, show that the left-wing mob is controlling Biden’s candidacy, just like they would control him as president. “These radical policies might be popular among liberals, but they are well outside the mainstream for most Americans,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/biden-has-surrendered-to-radical-mob-by-naming-kamala-harris-as-running-mate-trump-campaign/story-G0hkDu7VNCuxRoYuH5mg5K.html

One of the biggest concerns is that the approval comes before the completion of human trials. Russia was yet to start a larger trial involving thousands of participants, commonly known as a Phase III trial, which is normally considered an essential precursor to a regulatory approval.Russian President Vladimir Putin claims the vaccine offers “sustainable immunity” against Covid-19. He said one of his daughters had received the inoculation and felt better.Also read: ‘Need to assess if Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective’ - AIIMS DirectorExperts say the lack of published data on Russia’s vaccine have left scientists, health authorities and the public in the dark. There exists little clarity about how the vaccine is made and details on safety, immune response and whether it can prevent Covid-19 infection, news agency Reuters reported. Top US infectious disease official Dr Anthony Fauci said he had not heard of any evidence that the vaccine was ready for widespread use.Also read: Has 3rd Covid-19 curve flattening begun?Russian business conglomerate Sistema has said it expects to put the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, into mass production by the end of the year. According to Russian government officials, the vaccine will be first administered to medical personnel, and then to teachers, on a voluntary basis at the end of this month or in early September. Mass roll-out in Russia is expected to start in October.The vaccine is administered in two doses and consists of two serotypes of a human adenovirus, each carrying an S-antigen of the new coronavirus, which enter human cells and produce an immune response. The platform used for the vaccine was developed by Russian scientists over two decades and had formed the basis for several vaccines in the past, including those against Ebola.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-all-about-russia-s-sputnik-v-and-its-availability/story-A9JJBgIIqlxL04tlcDvmVN.html

According to Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tally, over 7.3 lakh people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 globally, whereas more than 13 million people have beaten the deadly virus across the globe. With this, the active number of Covid-19 patients, those suffering from the disease at present, stands at nearly 6 million people across the globe. The United States leads the Covid-19 tally with the highest total, as well as, active Covid-19 cases in the world. Brazil and India follow as countries with the second and third highest cumulative Covid-19 cases globally.Here’s taking a look at countries with highest Covid-19 caseload and fatalities in the world:United StatesLeading the global Covid-19 tally is the United States with over 5 million total and 2 million active cases of coronavirus. The Covid-19 death toll in the US has jumped over 1.6 lakh which is the highest in the world. As many as 2.7 million people have recovered from Covid-19 in the US.Also read: ‘Need to assess if Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective’ - AIIMS DirectorBrazilBrazil stands second in the world with respect to total coronavirus cases. The country’s total Covid-19 caseload stands at over 3 million while active cases are at around 7.6 lakh. Over 1.03 lakh people have lost their lives to Covid-19 in Brazil. IndiaIndia is the third country with most Covid-19 cases - 2 million. However, India’s active cases stand at over 6 lakh. More than 16 lakh people have recovered from the disease while more than 46,000 people have beaten the virus. The government claims that the country’s recovery rate is among the highest in the world with over 70 percent of patients defeating the contagion. The death rate, at 1.98 percent, is said to be among the lowest globally. RussiaNext in the list is Russia which has nearly 9 lakh total Covid-19 cases and 1.7 lakh active cases. Russia’s Covid-19 death toll stands at around 15,000. South AfricaWith over 5.6 lakh total Covid-19 cases, South Africa is the fifth most affected country in the globally. The active cases here stand at 1.2 lakh while the death toll is around 10,000.Active casesAlthough these are the top five countries with respect to total Covid-19 cases, some countries with fewer Covid-19 total counts have more number of active cases. For example, Peru and Columbia stand further down the Covid-19 global tally at the seventh and eighth spot respectively but their active cases - 1.3 lakh and 1.6 lakh - are more than South Africa’s. Similarly, Bangladesh has around 2.6 lakh total Covid-19 cases of which active patients are around 1.08 lakh. Covid-19 fatalitiesThe number of deaths also signify and affects the Covid-19 caseload in a country. More number of deaths and fewer recoveries signal at the severity of the virus in a particular nation. While the US and Brazil have the most number of Covid-19 deaths in the world, it is Mexico which stands third in the world with over 53,000 patients killed by the virus followed by the UK and India (both have reported over 46,000 deaths).Once Covid-19 hotspots, European countries like France and Italy have dropped down on the global tally but their number of fatalities are still high - over 30,000 and 35,000 respectively. Spain has witnessed nearly 29,000 coronavirus deaths till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tackling-covid-19-crisis-countries-with-highest-number-of-cases-and-deaths/story-WGk1MMGDsokZ3n2RQNrrLI.html
12-08-2020||World||Who is Kamala Harris? A few facts about Joe Biden’s running mate||Kamala Harris made history when she was picked by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as his running mate on Tuesday. She is the first Asian-American on a major presidential ticket.She is the daughter of Indian mother from Chennai, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher who passed away in 2009, and Jamaican father, Donald Harris, who teaches at Stanford University. The parents separated when Harris and her younger sister Maya Harris were still very young.From Kamala’s name (Shyamala gave her and her sisters Sanskrit names to connect their heritage with their identities) to her focus on immigration and equal rights, Shyamala has had a profound influence and lasting legacy on her high-flying daughter. Her selection came as little surprise. With the United States in the midst of a reckoning over its history of racial injustice, Biden had increasingly been pressed to select a woman of colour. Harris, who became the Senate’s second Black woman in its history, was always at the top of the list. .@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he's spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he'll build an America that lives up to our ideals.I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.But Harris did anything but keep a low profile while Biden was making up his mind. Instead, she emerged as a fierce advocate for police reform and social justice - in the Senate, in the streets, and on the airwaves, sparring with Republicans on the Senate floor and offering fiery critiques of Republican President Donald Trump.Harris is now the first American of Indian and Asian descent to run for vice-president. She is also the first African American of a major party and only the third woman yet to run for that office, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and Republican Sarah Palin.Harris became the first Indian American woman to run for US president ever - from either party - in 2019. She is also the first Indian-American Democrat to try for the job.Harris has also served as district attorney in San Francisco.Harris was sworn in as a United States Senator from California in 2017, only the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history. She served on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee on the Budget.She grew up in Oakland. And after earning an undergraduate degree from Howard University and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings, she a career in law in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. She became the district attorney of San Francisco in 2003.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-kamala-harris-a-few-facts-about-joe-biden-s-running-mate/story-uQoxCnERjPya5nZg4nbxFK.html

Argentina has been under quarantine since March 20, although officials previously relaxed restrictions in many parts of the nation, a move blamed for the recent spike in cases. The country recorded 7,043 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, pushing the total confirmed infections to 260,911, surpassing the total caseload in Italy. The latest government data shows 5,004 people have died from the disease.The capital Buenos Aires and the surrounding province have been bound by the strictest quarantine measures but have nonetheless emerged as the focal point of the country´s outbreak.The World Health Organization earlier on Tuesday expressed special concern for the spike in cases in Argentina after months in which the country appeared to have the outbreak under control. More than 100,000 cases of Covid-19 are being reported daily in the Americas, the global health organization said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentina-death-toll-from-coronavirus-tops-5-000-as-new-cases-spike/story-wdxpyr3RHGtiwwb8DpGGHK.html
12-08-2020||World||Ecuador says China restoring shrimp exports following Covid-19 dispute||Ecuador expects a quick resolution to a trade dispute with China over traces of coronavirus in a container of exported shrimp that led Beijing to suspend imports from three companies, Ecuador’s production and trade minister said on Tuesday.Chinese officials last month said they found six positive results in tests for coronavirus in the walls of a container carrying frozen Ecuadorean shrimp, even through the shrimp and inner packaging tested negative.China has given the green light for one of the three companies to resume exports after Ecuador agreed to improve shipping protocols, Ivan Ontaneda said in an interview, adding that the other two should be approved soon.“We are in the final stretch for the other two establishments to also overcome the impasse,” said Ontaneda, who oversees the country’s fishing industry.“The virtual inspections were completed to (their) satisfaction, with positive feedback on quality standards.”One of the three companies, Industrial Pesquera Santa Priscila SA, sent Reuters a June 10 letter to clients in which it said it had received authorization from China to resume exports.The other two companies, Empacreci SA and Empacadora Del Pacifico SA, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.An oil-producing nation, Ecuador exported nearly $4 billion of shrimp in 2019, 55% of which went to China, according to official data.But shrimp sales have dropped in the last two months due to the economic effects of the coronavirus, as have remittances from emigrees, which are historically an important source of foreign exchange for Ecuador.“Today we’re relying on income from non-oil exports, this income must be increased,” said Ontaneda.Social distancing measures meant to control the pandemic cost the economy some $7 billion between mid-March and August due to declines in industrial and commercial activity.The government needs about $4 billion to reactivate idled businesses, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ecuador-says-china-restoring-shrimp-exports-following-covid-19-dispute/story-WkDZqm53eeXr5aMOlaCBeL.html
12-08-2020||World||Indian-American groups laud historic selection of Kamala Harris as Biden’s vice presidential candidate||Leading Indian-American groups and individuals, including former Pepsico chief Indra Nooyi, have hailed the nomination of Indian-origin Senator Kamala Harris as Democratic vice presidential candidate, saying it was a “great choice” and a “moment of pride” for the entire community in the US.However, there were also some community members who questioned Harris’ contribution towards the Indo-US ties and said they would not be swayed by identity politics. Presumptive Democratic party presidential nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday named 55-year-old Harris as his vice presidential running mate, making history by selecting the first black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.Harris, whose father is an African from Jamaica and mother an Indian, is currently the US Senator from California.“This is a great choice for our country,” tweeted Nooyi, who is seen as a role model by millions of women across the world.Harris herself was a presidential aspirant until last year before she dropped out of the race because of lack of popular support.“What an electric moment for the Indian-American community! Indian-Americans are now truly a mainstream community in the national fabric,” M R Rangaswami, an eminent Indian-American and the founder of Indiaspora, told PTI.Welcoming the decision, IMPACT, a leading Indian-American advocacy group and a Political Action Committee, said it will raise USD 10 million for the campaign.“Kamala Harris’ story is the story of a changing, inclusive America...Her candidacy is historic and inspiring, not only for Black Americans, but for millions of Asian American voters, the fastest growing voting bloc in the country,” IMPACT’s executive director Neil Makhija said.Harris’ supporters on Tuesday announced to launch a nationwide campaign ‘America mein Khila Kamal (Lotus blooms in the US). California-based Indian-American entrepreneur Ajay Bhutoria told PTI that he is planning to release graphic and social media posts around this slogan in the run up to the November 3 presidential elections.Bhutoria is also the creator of a multi-language campaign, including in Hindi, which says, “America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho, Jo Biden Jaisa Ho!! (How America’s leader should be, like Biden)”, as part of the efforts to reach to the Indian-American community.According to Neha Dewan, National Director of South Asians for Biden, Harris has fought for justice throughout her time in public service, which makes her an “uniquely inspired choice” to take on Trump and the Republicans. Harris’ selection to serve in the second-highest office in the US is a signal that the community is an important part of the American fabric, said Deepa Sharma, national communications co-chair for South Asians for Biden.The Indo-American Democratic Organisation, one of the oldest South Asian American political advocacy bodies in the US, noted that a “Biden-Harris administration will prioritise the needs and challenges faced by immigrants”. Harris will build stronger US-India relations, said Rajendra Dichpally from US India Security Council. However, not all Indian-Americans were happy with Harris’ nomination.“Yes, there will be initial excitement and confusion for a few weeks amongst the Indian Americans -- debating whether to vote for Biden due to Kamala Harris being of Indian Heritage or voting for Trump, who has been great for India-US relations. There is and there will be a lot of hustling by the Biden-Harris combo for the Indian-American votes in the battleground states,” Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, told PTI.However, after initial few weeks of excitement, Indian-Americans would continue to support Trump because of his “impeccable track record” when it comes to Indo-US ties and promises fulfilled to the community, he asserted. Mason questioned what Biden and Harris have done for India? And went on to add, “Zero. Future promises by them -- after being elected -- mean nothing.” According to a recent survey conducted by Mason 50 per cent of the Indian-Americans in key battleground states like Texas, Michigan, Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania who traditionally vote for Democrats, are now switching over to the Trump camp. Prominent physician Dr Deepak Nandi said Harris’ selection as vice presidential candidate will have minimal effects on the Indian-American electoral votes as Trump has done so much for the community by supporting their entrepreneurial efforts and ease of doing business in the US. According to Sridhar Chillara, founder and chairman of the Asian American Republican Alliance, Indian-Americans will vote “with eyes wide open” in the presidential election and “reject the game of hypocrisy and identity politics played by the Democrats”. Acknowledging that Harris’ nomination will excite many community members, as this is the closest the community has come to the Oval Office, Indian-Americans for Trump in a statement said, however, there is a lot of opposition to her. “Until she was contesting for the President, during the Democratic primary season, she had not associated herself with the Indian-American population. That is why, at a debate podium, questions were raised to her about her being of Indian heritage and hiding it. That opened this issue for her,” it said in a statement.Indian-American physician Dr Raj Bhayani said historically, selection of vice president candidates has had no effect on the outcome of the presidential race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-groups-laud-historic-selection-of-kamala-harris-as-biden-s-vice-presidential-candidate/story-IZLUV0zRFGw3gv6X9zxMGP.html

Known as an aggressive campaigner, she has won statewide elections three times in California. She built her early career as district attorney of San Francisco and was elected as the state’s attorney general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-kamala-harris-meanest-and-most-horrible-us-senator/story-s5zyJp9ql0RpXgSKcbcY6L.html

12-08-2020||World||Hong Kongers rush to buy Lai’s paper, stocks in his company||Hong Kong’s markets watchdog had to urge investors to “exercise extreme caution” after shares of Next Digital Ltd rose more than 2,000% to a 12-year high, spurred by an online campaign for its detained owner media tycoon Jimmy Lai.Lai was released on bail in the early hours of Wednesday morning, flanked by his lawyers, and greeted by a throng of supporters who chanted “fight till the end” and “support apple, have an apple a day”, referring to the pro-democracy tabloid.Readers had queued from the early hours of Tuesday to get copies of the newspaper, a day after police raided its offices and took Lai into detention, the highest-profile arrest under the national law. “Apple Daily must fight on,” the front-page headline read, amid fears the new law is eroding media freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.“The prayers and encouragement of many readers and writers make us believe that as long as there are readers, there will be writers, and that Apple Daily shall certainly fight on.” More than 500,000 copies were printed, compared with the usual 100,000, the paper said on its website.Mainland-born Lai, who was smuggled into Hong Kong on a fishing boat when he was a penniless 12-year-old, is one of the most prominent democracy activists in the city and an ardent critic of Communist Party rule in Beijing.The sweeping security law imposed on June 30 punishes anything China considers secession, subversion or terrorism. The city’s Beijing-backed government and Chinese authorities say the law is necessary to restore order after months of at times violent anti-government protests last year, sparked by fears China was slowly eroding those freedoms. Police detained Lai for suspected collusion with foreign forces after about 200 officers searched the newspaper’s offices, collecting 25 boxes of evidence.Handcuffed and apparently wearing the same clothes after spending the night in jail, he was driven by police on Tuesday to his yacht which police searched, according to media footage.On his release, Lai left in a black car without speaking.Beijing has labelled Lai a “traitor” in the past and issued a statement supporting his arrest.The Beijing-backed China Daily newspaper said in an editorial Lai’s arrest showed “the cost of dancing with the enemy”. Shares in Next Digital, which publishes Apple Daily, surged for a second day, gaining more than 2,078% from Friday’s close, after online pro-democracy forums called on investors to show support. Its market value rose as high as HK$5.17 billion ($666.7 million) from some HK$200 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kongers-rush-to-buy-lai-s-paper-stocks-in-his-company/story-O0WfoNUWjTPQpfCxGvoLdJ.html

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa continued with the same panel appointed by Sirisena after assuming office. The police unit of the panel appointed by then president Sirisena has asked Wickremesinghe to appear before them on August 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-easter-attack-probe-panel-summons-ex-pm-ranil-wickremesinghe/story-Yds3HtmjtyfVr6HIiOgYwK.html

The state security report, which confirmed the correspondence to the president and the prime minister, has not previously been reported. “There was a danger that this material, if stolen, could be used in a terrorist attack,” the official told Reuters.“I warned them that this could destroy Beirut if it exploded,” said the official, who was involved in writing the letter and declined to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/govt-was-warned-on-explosives-at-port/story-CmG3bL0iu7dTaJarDMJ7QM.html
12-08-2020||World||Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has named Kamala Harris, who is of mixed Black and Indian heritage, as his pick for vice-president in a much anticipated announcement Tuesday that was described as “historic” and “seismic” by Democrats, including many ecstatic Indian Americas, and non-partisan observers.Biden announced his pick in a tweet late afternoon as speculation reached a feverish pitch on all leading TV channels and social media. “I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate,” the former vice-president wrote on twitter.His campaign followed up with a more expansive explanation of the pick. “Joe knows more about the importance of the Vice Presidency than just about anyone, and he is confident that Kamala Harris will be the best partner for him to finally get the country back on track,” it said in a statement, and added, “Kamala will be ready to tackle the work that is needed to heal our country on Day One of the Biden-Harris Administration.”In her first public response to the announcement, Harris wrote on twitter:, shortly: “@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he’s spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he’ll build an America that lives up to our ideals. I’m honored to join him as our party’s nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.”A win in November will make Harris the first female vice-president of the United States and set her up the presidency in 2024, at the end of Biden’s first term, or 2028. Most vice-presidents have gone on to run for the top job themselves and win, with some exceptions such as Al Gore.President Donald Trump, who had earlier called Harris a “fine choice” if picked by Biden, felt differently and accorded the announcement the full Trump treatment. He slammed her as “nasty” and “the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful” for her grilling of Brett Kavanaugh at his senate confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. His campaign called her “phony”.Harris was not a surprise pick as she had been on everyone’s shortlist of Biden’s choices, which at some stage had 11 names. In recent days the former vice-president had been focussed on three — Harris, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Congresswoman Karen Baas. Some days ago, Biden may have tipped his hand inadvertently when notes he held during a press interaction showed several check-marks against her name.The 55-year-old first time senator from California is now the first American of Indian and Asian descent to run for vice-president. She is also the first African American of a major party and only the third woman yet to run for that office, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and Republican Sarah Palin. The US hasn’t had a female vice-president, or president, yet.Harris’s mother Shyamala Gopalan (Harris by marriage) came from Chennai. She was a cancer researcher, who raised Harris and the younger daughter Maya Harris, as a single-mother mostly after early separation from Donald Harris, who had come to the US from Jamaica. Gopalan passed away in 2009.Indian Americans were ecstatic. Ramesh Kapur, a veteran Democrat who hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his home in Boston in 2016 during her senate run, said he believed the Tuesday announcement was the start of a journey. “It’s the beginning of her becoming the first Indian American president — this is a journey.”“Moment of great pride for the Indian American community,” said Shekar Narasimhan, a top Democratic strategist and fundraiser. “It’s a first in so many ways and will help Joe Biden win the presidency which is the first priority. A seismic shift occurred today and its ramifications will be felt for many decades”.Harris was friends with Biden’s elder son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer. But her links to the family were said to have suffered a major blow after she attacked the former vice-president’s record on racism at one of the Democratic primaries. Biden is reported to have been hurt by Harris’s attacks. But Biden made clear in recent days that he does not hold grudges as he considered Harris along with a long list of 10 other women for his vice-president pick.The Trump re-election campaign picked on that debate exchange to attack Harris. “Not long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received,” Katrina Pierson, a Trump 2020 senior advisor, said in a statement, adding, “Clearly, Phony Kamala will abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat Party.”Harris became the first Indian American woman to run for US president ever — from either party in 2019. The first from the tiny minority community of 4 million was Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, who didn’t last the primaries that were eventually won by President Trump in 2016. Harris is also the first Indian American Democrat — ale or female — to try for the job; she failed also..Harris was only the second African American woman of a major political party to run for the presidency. Shirley Chisholm, also a Democrat, was the first, making an unsuccessful bid in 1972. The list thus far, however, has been dominated by men, which includes, most famously, Barack Obama who went on to win two terms. Also, Jesse Jackson, who ran twice, unsuccessfully.Harris addressed her mixed heritage in her autobiography released 2010, “The Truth We hold: An American journey”. Growing up, her mother and her relatives “instilled pride in our South Asian roots. Our classical Indian names harked back to our Indian heritage and we were raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for India culture. All my mother’s words of affection or frustration came out in her mother tongue — which seems fitting to me, since the purity of those emotions is what I associated with my mother most of all.”She also wrote, “My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls. and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”Harris was sworn in as a United States Senator from California in 2017, only the second African-American woman and first South Asian-American senator in history. She served on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the Committee on the Budget. And quickly earned a reputation for her hard-nosed prosecutorial manner of questioning of witnesses at hearings.Her website says she has spent her entire life fighting for justice, as a “passion that was first inspired by her mother, Shyamala, an Indian-American immigrant, activist, and breast cancer researcher”. Harris grew up in Oakland. And after earning an undergraduate degree from Howard University in Washington DC, and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings, she began a career in law in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. She became the district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. And after two terms as district attorney, she was elected California’s attorney general. (that’s how she met Beau Biden, who was attorney general of Delaware). Harris is married to Doug Emhoff and is stepmother to Ella and Cole Emhoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-picks-kamala-harris-as-his-running-mate/story-eQ8HvusuyfqQFMhXFuqqUP.html

Harris, a senator from California, has remained on the list as some others dropped out. So have Congresswoman Karen Baas and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Senator Tammy Duckworth and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms are also there.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced Tuesday a list of speakers for the four nights of the convention starting August 17, during which Biden will be officially crowned as the party’s nominee to take on President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbentSpeakers include former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and former first ladies Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. Also on the list were Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most senior woman politician in the US, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two leaders of the progressive wing of the party, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the rock-star progressive congresswoman from New York.Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican, is also on the list of speakers in recognition perhaps of — and in a tactical move to tap into — Republicans opposed to President Trump. The Lincoln Project — a group of former Republican strategists and operatives that include John McCain campaign head Steve Schmidt, Mitt Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens and several leading NeverTrumpers — has run some of the most hard-hitting campaign ads against Trump.The Republican convention starts on August 24 and will also be all done virtually, though some ground-activity in Charlottesville, North Carolina are still being considered.President Trump on Monday confirmed reports that he is looking at Gettysburg, the site of the iconic 1863 address by President Abraham Lincoln, as one of the venues for his convention speech accepting the party’s nomination to seek a second term. The other venue up for consideration is White House. The Republican National Committee has yet to announce other details about the convention, including speakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-remains-in-race-for-biden-s-vice-president-pick-clintons-obamas-to-address-convention/story-JQJ8lauYai0qZROhQe9K5M.html

The postponement suggests Pakistan would have to do more to rectify the situation.One observer has said his job is now on the line.Last week, Qureshi asked OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” on convening a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers on Kashmir. “I am once again respectfully telling OIC that a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers is our expectation. If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” he had told a TV channel.He said if OIC fails to summon the council of foreign ministers meeting, Pakistan would be ready to go for a session outside OIC. Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the 57-member bloc of Muslim countries, the second largest intergovernmental body after the United Nations.Pakistan’s Foreign Office, asked about Qureshi’s remarks, had later insisted that it was not against diplomatic norms.Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the 57-member bloc of Muslim countries, the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, since India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status last August.Qureshi said Pakistan skipped the Kuala Lumpur Summit last December on a Saudi request and now Pakistani Muslims are demanding Riyadh “show leadership on the issue”.“We have our own sensitivities. You have to realise this. Gulf countries should understand this,” the foreign minister said, adding that he could no more indulge in diplomatic niceties.Qureshi made it clear that he was not being emotional and fully understood the implications of his statement. “It’s right, I’m taking a position despite our good ties with Saudi Arabia,” he said.Opposition PML-N had attacked the government for the minister’s remarks, describing it as an irresponsible statement about a friendly country and the worst kind of diplomacy. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had historic and strategic relations and Saudi Arabia had always stood by Pakistan in testing times, the party’s secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said, accusing the government of “playing with” vital interests of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-minister-s-cancelled-briefing-on-saudi-ties-hints-the-tiff-just-got-wider/story-n7LS1F23YavfV0CN7j4ejM.html

However, the PMO statement said, “The Prime Minister knows that Minister Morneau and the entire team of Cabinet ministers will keep doing the work that Canadians rely on to get them through this pandemic.”Like Trudeau, Morneau has also been embroiled in the scandal over a nearly billion dollar contract given to a charity with close links to them. Both are also facing investigations by Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner in this context, while also being probed by Parliamentary panels.Rumours of Morneau’s ouster gained ground after the return to the country of former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney as an informal advisor to the Prime Minister on the economic aspect of the coronavirus crisis and recovery from the adversity caused by precautionary restrictions. Carney, who was till recently Governor of the Bank of England, was cited as a potential replacement for Morneau.However, the statement from the PMO was lavish in its praise for Morneau as it said the Finance Minister had “worked relentlessly” and “closely with the Prime Minister” to build a “strong and resilient” Canadian economy. “That work has continued throughout the global pandemic,” the statement said, listing out measures including wage subsidies and doles announced during the crisis. It went on to say that Morneau “is continuing this important work.” The Finance Minister has also denied that he is planning to resign. Morneau has been in that post since Trudeau first came to power in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-canadian-pm-trudeau-backs-up-finance-minister-morneau-despite-controversy/story-wX2hO62M7oOybbC4guxNPL.html
