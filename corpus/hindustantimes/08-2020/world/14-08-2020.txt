The increase in Sino-India diplomatic activity in Beijing could also be seen in the backdrop of reports from India, which say that the disengagement process between the troops of the two countries is not progressing as expected with People’s Liberation of Army (PLA) troops not pulling back at certain friction points in the region.Chinese troops are said to have pulled back from the Galwan Valley, the site of the June 15 clash, and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of its troops has not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso, Gogra and Depsang as demanded by India, reports from New Delhi say.A Chinese foreign ministry to the Hindustan Times this week said the “At present, the two sides have disengaged in most of the border areas and will continue to coordinate and consult through military and diplomatic channels to further ease the tension and maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.” the statement in Mandarin said.It has been more than a month since the formal process of disengagement began between the two neighbours, scarred by the deaths of soldiers after decades of no casualties along the disputed boundary.The graded disengagement began on July 6, a day following a conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councilor Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tensions in the area. Until now, diplomatic talks have been held under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs while military talks have been headed by major general-level officers from both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flurry-of-india-china-diplomatic-activity-in-beijing-amid-talks-of-dialogue-deadlock/story-LR2gZI3MKcISYQ8eILUBQL.html

ISKP leader Aslam Farooqi, a Pakistani national with links to LeT and Pakistan’s Tehrik-e-Taliban was arrested by Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security along with 19 other terrorist cadres on April 5.Af-Pak watchers say that ISKP units in Kabul and the border province of Nangarhar are already under the firm control of former HQN commanders and Sirajuddin Haqqani, Deputy leader of Taliban, who are launching attacks on Afghan capital. Besides being part of the intelligence and reconnaissance gathering network, ISKP cadres are also attacking Kabul in tandem with the HQN group.Also read: Pakistan proxies in fight to the finish in Afghanistan, but India too needs to prep | AnalysisThe HQN’s influence in ISKP is not only restricted to the cadres joining the outfit but also transcends into various other levels such as leadership control, military and intelligence commissions and district levels Emirs of the global terrorist group. The ISKP is currently divided into three factions - Aslam Farooqi, Mauvviya and Imam Bukhari.However, the attempt to take over ISKP by the Haqqani Network with the help of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is not without its own set of challenges. The three factions are apprehensive of the Rawalpindi-backed group and are vehemently resisting the Haqqani Network’s effort to join the ISKP in Afghanistan.The ISI, however, is helping the HQN try to open channels with the ISKP’s Imam Bukhari faction to bring it within the fold of “Khilafat-e-Islami Khorasan” and maintain strong operational cooperation.“The HQN take over of ISKP could be a game-changing development as it will create a mega terror group of the Al Qaida variety with its handlers based in Rawalpindi getting Pakistan deniability of any attack in Indian sub-continent or in the west,” said a senior counter-terror official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/backed-by-isi-haqqani-network-is-making-a-game-changing-move-in-afghanistan/story-LZG67eCHjGiDazcFEXwVpO.html

His location, according to his mobile phone, showed the same, after which the phone was switched off.His family had filed a missing report with the police, following which a manhunt was launched to trace him, Kathmandu Post reported.“As per the application received for his search, which also contained his photo, it has been verified that the body that was found was that of journalist Baniya,” according to the DPO.According to Kathmandu Post, Baniya was associated with Kantipur Daily, a Nepali newspaper, since the paper’s initial days. He used to cover politics and parliament and later did extensive reporting on governance and bureaucracy. He reportedly wrote an article highlighting the Chinese encroachment in Rui village located in Gorkha district.The journalist’s death comes amid the strained bilateral relations between India and Nepal after the Himalayan nation included the Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in its controversial new political map.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepalese-journalist-who-reported-on-chinese-encroachment-in-nepal-village-found-dead/story-uQE9CyMV4ca2zY8JoWSoHO.html
14-08-2020||World||Launching frugality drive, Chinese President Xi calls for ‘sense of crisis’ on food security||China is mulling mechanisms to prevent wastage of food days after President Xi Jinping called the amount of food wasted in the country “shocking and distressing”.Xi’s renewed call for the “clean plate campaign” comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has battered the Chinese economy into contraction this year, and the worst floods in years impacting rice production areas in China.Chinese official media, Xinhua, quoted Xi calling the issue of food waste “shocking and distressing” and said it was important to “…maintain a sense of crisis regarding food security”.The phrase “sense of crisis” about food also recalls the time of Chinese leader Mao Zedong in the early 1960s when the country was ravaged by famines.Beijing, however, has said that despite the twin problems of epidemic and floods, the agriculture sector has yielded “bumper harvests” this year.Catering groups, reports said, responded to Xi’s call by embracing a so-called “N-1 policy” -- urging customers to order one dish fewer than the number of diners at a table. No new national statistics is available about food wastage in China but a 2018 report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said consumers wasted 17 million to 18 million tons of food served in big cities in 2015.The amount wasted could have fed 30 million to 50 million individuals or the total number of people living in South Korea, officials had then pointed out.Following the publicity given to Xi’s call, short-video platforms have begun to crack down on “competitive eaters”, many of whom waste or spit out the food they ordered.“Such shows have been condemned by many netizens and generated heated discussions on Sina Weibo. The related hashtag had been viewed more than 830 million times as of Thursday afternoon,” a state media report said.Xi had first launched a similarly titled campaign against food waste in 2013 but rather than the general public it focused on feasts and banquets hosted by Communist Party of China officials on government funds.Xi’s call on food waste, an editorial in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post pointed out also recalled Mao’s time during the Great Leap Forward between 1959-62“China’s leader has urged the country to maintain a sense of crisis about food security…It is a reminder of the Mao Zedong era when Chinese leaders, prompted by natural and man-made disasters, encouraged people to store food. It was a time of widespread hunger and starvation,” the editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/launching-frugality-drive-chinese-president-xi-calls-for-sense-of-crisis-on-food-security/story-TJ004dwkrNczTiV0anaT3L.html
14-08-2020||World||Kamala Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Joe Biden’s campaign||In her first two days as Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris has fired off the campaign’s sharpest criticism of President Donald Trump’s shortcomings. She has vouched for Biden’s character on race and more. And the enthusiasm surrounding her historic candidacy has brought in a record $36 million, including contributions from 150,000 new donors.The campaign hopes it is just the beginning.With less than three months before the election, Harris is rapidly embracing her new role. Democratic operatives and Harris allies believe she’ll energize what has been a relatively quiet campaign that has often preferred to keep the attention on the turbulence of Trump’s White House. She’s already making a vigorous case for Trump’s defeat, allowing Biden to focus more on his own policy prescriptions and less on direct attacks.“We always look for surrogates and validators that help close the deal and can speak to voters who needed another reason to say, ‘Yes, I’m gonna support Joe Biden,’” said Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chair who also ran Al Gore’s 2000 campaign. “She fills in the gap.”Harris was known during the Democratic presidential primary for wearing Converse sneakers and dancing with staff and supporters in unscripted moments. Biden allies expect her to deliver enthusiasm among some Democrats who oppose Trump but aren’t yet energized to vote for a candidate they feel may be out of touch with their concerns.Harris’ “ability to connect” is part of what California Rep. Barbara Lee, who served as one of her campaign chairs, believes will help her deliver the campaign message to voters who may be otherwise tuned out.“She loves to dance. She loves to cook. She’s a person who does normal things that everybody does. They can relate to her,” Lee said.Still, Harris, the first Black woman selected for a national ticket, has faced her own criticism from young voters and progressives in the past, namely over her record on police misconduct as a district attorney and later California’s attorney general. Critics say she opposed key criminal justice reform measures, including police body cameras statewide, and didn’t address a number of wrongful convictions on her watch.But during her time in Congress she’s embraced greater reforms to law enforcement, particularly in recent months in the nationwide reckoning over racism sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. She has been a leading Democratic voice on the issue.Some progressives still point to Biden’s past support for the 1994 crime bill as reason to doubt his commitment to criminal justice reform. And Harris herself was a critic of Biden’s record on race, notably assailing him during a primary debate for previously opposing federally mandated busing. But Harris signaled Wednesday that she’ll offer a strong defense of Biden’s record on race.During her first appearance with the former vice president, she said Biden “takes his place in the ongoing story of America’s march towards equality and justice” as the only person “who’s served alongside the first Black president and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate.”Biden campaign officials see her as a strong messenger against Trump, pointing to both her vigorous criticism of the Republican president during her primary campaign, when her pledge to “prosecute the case” against Trump won her support, as well as her sharp comments Wednesday. She said Trump “cares more about himself than the people who elected him” and accused him of “making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve.”Brian Brokaw, who ran Harris’ campaign for attorney general in 2010, said her questioning of Trump officials during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings hints at the case she’ll make against him on the campaign trail and during the vice presidential debate with Mike Pence.“No one should forget that she had cut her teeth in the courtroom,” he said. “Anybody who has been on the receiving end of the Kamala Harris cross-examination, whether it’s a witness on the stand or Jeff Sessions or Bill Barr knows that if you’re in her crosshairs, it’s an uncomfortable place to be.”Biden’s allies believe a main Harris advantage is demonstrated by the Republicans’ struggle to settle on a line of attack against her. In the short time since she was announced, Trump has called her everything from “extraordinarily nasty” to “a madwoman,” from “phony” to “radical left.” On Thursday he said he had “heard” rumors that she is ineligible to run for national office because her parents are immigrants. She was born in Oakland, California, and there is no doubt she is eligible.Harris is already delivering for the campaign in a tangible way: with a record-breaking fundraising haul.While fundraising is traditionally one of the running mate’s top priorities, a number of donors said her presence would be particularly helpful for Democrats because of her connections in California and beyond. Through her nearly two decades in California politics, Harris built a network of deep-pocketed donors in Hollywood and the state’s legal circles.Andrew Byrnes, a California donor who supported Harris, then moved to Biden in the presidential primary, said he got about 50 messages from donors wanting to get involved after Biden selected her.Michel Kraut, a Los Angeles lawyer and major Harris contributor, said he’s already had donors asking him about putting together events in the area.“It allows Kamala’s nationwide fundraising machine to get reinvigorated,” said Kraut, who has already been raising money for Biden.“There’s this new energy that the person we wanted to be president and now is on the presidential ticket has created. It’s not just, “I’ll raise money,’ but, ‘I’ll be dedicated to do this.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-bringing-energy-dollars-and-more-to-joe-biden-s-campaign/story-zbvJqsUU5A5RlUdljBkxXL.html
14-08-2020||World||Heatwaves, fires, storms: Blame climate change for summer misery||It’s hot out. Cue the headlines showing yet another temperature record above the Arctic circle, fires deep in the Amazon, and more intense floods and droughts anywhere in between.Also look for the self-described rational skeptics, the eco-pragmatists, and other hyphenated attention-seekers pointing out how, yes, it’s summer in the northern hemisphere, how it’s been hot in the past, and how we need to look at hardnosed statistics rather than headlines and emotions.Let’s.Yes, there have been Biblical floods and droughts long before humanity began burning fossil fuels. It’s also true, of course, that modern societies are better prepared to weather these extreme events, and that some observed impacts are due to more people and their wealth having moved in harm’s way (sadly often supported by misguided government policies).But it’s precisely a closer look at statistics that tells us why even relatively small changes in global average temperatures are such a big deal.Climate is weather. Not literally, of course. Climate is the long-term batting average, while weather is what happens in any one baseball game. Climate is your personality, weather is your mood today. Climate, in short, is weather averaged.This chart from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows how the two are intimately linked.We see so many record hot temperatures precisely because global average temperatures have increased by over 1°C by now. Those relatively small increases in mean temperatures don’t just make hot weather a bit more likely. They increase the chance of hot weather extremes by a lot. Add more temperature variability to the mix, and the chance of extremes goes higher still.Heat kills. Whether the temperature outside is 21°C or 22°C (around 70°F or 72°F) makes little difference. The latter might even register as a bit more pleasant. Increase it to 32°C (around 90°F), however, and all sorts of bad things begin to happen. If you’re a New York City high school student taking the Regents exam, you’re suddenly over 10% more likely to fail.Hotter temperatures make workers and, with it, entire economies less productive. They kill crops. They kill animals. They kill people, especially the poor. One additional day above 32°C increases the chance of dying that year by 0.11%. And that’s in the United States.Indians are 5 to 10 times more likely to die because of extreme heat, driven by rural India. Relatively richer urban Indians have the same mortality rate from extreme heat as the average American, pointing to the impact of extreme poverty. The rich adapt. The poor suffer.If climate change is your personality and weather your mood, climate change is making all of us moodier. That goes for increased road rage and car crashes on hot days as much as for increased police aggression, robberies, domestic violence, assaults, and murders. And heat on the baseball field leads to more pitchers hitting batters with errant balls as retaliation.These individual effects extend to increased peasant rebellions in Qing China, political instability in Medieval Egypt, ethnic riots in India, communal conflict in sub-Saharan Africa, and civil conflicts and political coups globally. The link between climate and conflict is strong, and unmitigated climate change all but ensures that it’s getting stronger.A few more sultry nights may well sound pleasant after hiding in (Covid-19-transmission-proof) air-conditioning all day. But those small increases in global averages go hand in hand with large increases in extremes. These extremes are not just unpleasant. They are all too often deadly.(Gernot Wagner writes the Risky Climate column for Bloomberg Green. He teaches at New York University and is a co-author of Climate Shock.

14-08-2020||World||UK’s Princess Anne to mark 70th birthday in low-key fashion||Queen Elizabeth II’s only daughter, Princess Anne, will be celebrating her 70th birthday on Saturday in a no-nonsense manner befitting her reputation in Britain.Whatever is planned for the princess, it will have to be a scaled-back affair because of the coronavirus pandemic. Not that the pandemic has stopped Anne.She’s been as busy as ever helping out the many charities with which she is associated, such as Save the Children. She also has been seen remotely assisting her mother get to grips with online video calls while the queen and Prince Philip are locked down at Windsor Castle.Mike Tindall, the former England rugby player who is married to Anne’s daughter, Zara, said the family had planned to mark his mother-in-law’s milestone in Scotland but that alternative arrangements had to be made.“I’m sure we’ll do something as a family to celebrate her 70 amazing years. She’s just an incredible woman in terms of how much work she can get through in the year,” Tindall told the BBC. “We will be doing something. As yet, I don’t know whether she knows, so my lips are sealed.”As part of the birthday celebration, Anne has been the subject of an ITV television documentary, more than a year in the making. It features unseen family footage and conversations with her daughter, her son, Peter Phillips, and with her husband, Vice Admiral Tim Laurence.Anne, whose formal title is Princess Royal, is widely admired for her work ethic, sporting pedigree - she competed as an equestrian in the 1976 Olympic Games - and for a particularly dry British sense of humor that she donned with such effect during a kidnapping attempt in 1974.Born on Aug. 15, 1950 at Clarence House, one of the royal family’s London residences, she is the younger sister of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and elder sibling to princes Andrew and Edward. She is currently 14th in the line of succession.Anne has plowed her own path since she was a young girl. She certainly hasn’t been the traditional sort of princess seen in fairy tales.“As a young princess, I was a huge disappointment to everyone concerned,” she once remarked. “It’s impractical to go around in life dressed in a long white dress and a crown.”While Anne is connected with more than 300 charities, organizations and military regiments, and regularly tops the list of royals carrying out the most public engagements, she is probably best known in Britain for her prowess in the saddle.She — and her horse Doublet — won the European Championship eventing individual gold medal in 1971, an achievement that earned her the admiration of the nation and the coveted BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.Sport has featured in her life ever since. As well as winning a place in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Anne has been a long-standing member of the International Olympic Committee. She also played a central role in London’s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, and was a member of the organizing committee.Zara Tindall inherited her mother’s horse-riding skills and won a silver medal in London as part of the British eventing team. Anne, of course, was the appropriate person to present Tindall with her medal..Before having children, Anne and her first husband, army Capt. Mark Phillips, survived an attempted kidnapping in 1974 while she was being driven to Buckingham Palace. When the armed would-be abductor, Ian Ball, told her to “Come with me for a day or two” because he wanted 2 million pounds, the princess replied it was not “bloody likely, and I haven’t got 2 million pounds.”Anne said she was “furious at this man who was having a tug of war” with her and for ripping her favorite blue velvet dress.That dry sense of humor will no doubt be on display Saturday, whatever goes on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-princess-anne-to-mark-70th-birthday-in-low-key-fashion/story-vxX3CqJRVDdlf1I23UGweP.html
14-08-2020||World||Tropical storm Josephine weakens slightly in Atlantic Ocean||Josephine just barely held on to its tropical storm status early Friday as it moved over the Atlantic Ocean as the earliest “J-named” storm in a record-setting hurricane season.The storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) and was located about 680 miles (1,090 kilometers) east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the US National Hurricane Center stated in its 5 a.m. advisory.Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds between 39 and 73 mph (63 and 117 kph). Josephine was expected to strengthen over the next day or so, forecasters said.No coastal watches or warnings were in effect.Josephine was the earliest tenth Atlantic named storm on record, breaking the previous record of Jose, which formed Aug. 22, 2005, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard, Fay, Gonzalo, Hanna and Isaias have also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storms of their respective place in the alphabet. Only Hanna and Isaias this year have developed into hurricanes.Isaias killed two people in the Caribbean earlier this month. Several others across multiple US states were then killed when the storm made landfall in North Carolina and moved through the East Coast, leading to floods, tornadoes, fires, and widespread power outages.Last month, Hurricane Hanna slammed the Texas Gulf Coast with high winds and rains that flooded streets and knocked out power across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-josephine-weakens-slightly-in-atlantic-ocean/story-qqCxOJwUmN7CJrC2KEKPeI.html
14-08-2020||World||Covid-19: France, Netherlands added to UK’s 14-day quarantine list||Hundreds of thousands of British holidaymakers on Friday faced the prospect of having to go into self-isolation for 14 days when they return home after the British government reimposed quarantine restrictions on France following a recent pick-up in coronavirus infections.In an announcement late Thursday, the government said France is being removed from the list of nations exempted from quarantine requirements because of rising coronavirus infections, which have surged by 66% in the past week. The Netherlands, Malta, Monaco and the Caribbean islands of Aruba and Turks & Caicos are also being added to the quarantine list.The requirement to spend 14 days in self-isolation will apply to anyone returning to the UK after 4 a.m. local time on Saturday, a timeframe that may prompt many — particularly those who cannot work from home — to try to return before then.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision shouldn’t have come as a big surprise given that the government has consistently said it will continue to monitor infection rates when assessing its list of safe countries.“Unfortunately, this virus doesn’t play ball,” he told Sky News. “So people will look at their own situations. I think a lot of people would have been aware that this was a possibility in France and in some of these other countries.”Any rush back is likely to be most prominent in France, the second-most popular holiday destination for British tourists after Spain, which was put on the quarantine list last month. Travel companies are urging anyone considering a swift return home to check whether they will be able to do so.Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel rail service linking Britain and France, warned travelers that they may not be able to get back in time as services are heavily booked.John Keefe, Getlink’s director of public affairs, told the BBC that trains were “already pretty much fully booked” on Friday.He said there was “some possibility of adding additional trains in the off-peak periods” but insisted that would-be travelers have to check online before heading to the terminal.While the number of new infections in Britain is also rising, they are not thought to be increasing at the same pace as in the countries added to the quarantine list. The latest 14-day cumulative figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show 32.1 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in France, compared with 18.5 in the UK.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday that everyone “understands that in a pandemic you don’t allow our population to be re-infected or the disease to come back in.”The decision is a big blow to France’s tourism industry, which is heavily reliant on tourists from Britain.France’s junior minister for European affairs, Clement Beaune, indicated that that France would respond in kind.He said in a tweet that this is “a British decision that we regret and which will prompt a reciprocity measure, in the hope to get back to normal as soon as possible.”The UK’s quarantine approach has been criticized by many travel companies, some of whom are urging a change of tack, such as a ramp-up in testing of all arrivals in the country.Shapps said that proposal “isn’t quite as straightforward as it sounds” because many people may not test positive for the virus at the point of arrival but may end up doing so a few days later.“You need to have a system which is more accurate than that before you can say to people you’ve now been tested and you don’t need to quarantine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-france-netherlands-added-to-uk-s-14-day-quarantine-list/story-c5HUdxQlEaNJ8qv0YhJlKO.html
14-08-2020||World||UK relaxes more Covid-19 curbs, mask violators face £3,200 fine||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday announced more easing of restrictions from Saturday, allowing marriage receptions for up to 30 people and reopening casinos, skating rinks and beauty salons, but raised fines for those not wearing masks up to £3,200.The enforcement measures include doubling the fine to a maximum of £3,200 for those who repeatedly flout face covering rules, and new fines introduced for people hosting raves or other unlawful gatherings of more than 30 people.The relaxations are the same that were to come into effect two weeks ago, but were paused due to a rise in infections. Officials said: “The situation now appears to have levelled off”. As of Thursday evening, the UK had recorded 41,347 deaths and 313,798 cases.The piloting of a small number of sporting events to test the safe return of spectators will resume from August 15 with a view to reopening competition venues for sports fans, with social distancing measures in place from October 1.Johnson said: “Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus, but we must remain focused and we cannot be complacent. That is why we are strengthening the enforcement powers available to use against those who repeatedly flout the rules”.“At every stage I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional and that it relies on continued progress against the virus. Today, we are able to announce some further changes which will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed”.“However, as I have always said, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus”.Business secretary Alok Sharma announced that new in-principle agreements had been reached to secure 60 million doses of the Novavax vaccine and 30 million doses of the Janssen vaccine, adding to the portfolio of promising vaccine candidates currently under trial.With Friday’s announcement, the UK has now secured access to six different vaccine candidates, across four different vaccine types, including the University of Oxford’s vaccine being developed with AstraZeneca, as well as agreements with the BioNTech/Pfizer alliance, Valneva and GSK/Sanofi Pasteur.Sharma said: “Today’s agreements will not only benefit people in the UK but will ensure fair and equitable access of a vaccine around the world, potentially protecting hundreds of millions of lives”.“While we are doing everything we can to ensure the British people get access to a successful vaccine as soon as possible, nobody is safe until we are all safe so global cooperation is absolutely critical if we are to defeat this virus once and for all”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-relaxes-more-covid-19-curbs-mask-violators-face-3-200-fine/story-FcRgOt0oxLC4DcDUrdLUHI.html
14-08-2020||World||Forced isolation may be the only way to stop resurgence of coronavirus||Flare-ups from Australia to Japan show the world hasn’t learned an early lesson from the coronavirus crisis: to stop the spread, those with mild or symptom-free coronavirus infections must be forced to isolate, both from their communities and family.In Australia, where Victoria state has been reporting record deaths, some 3,000 checks last month on people who should have been isolating at home found 800 were out and about. In Japan, where the virus has roared back, people are staying home but aren’t in isolation: 40% of elderly patients are getting sick from family members in the same apartments.The failure to effectively manage contagious people with mild or no symptoms is a driving factor behind some of the world’s worst resurgences. But lessons from Italy, South Korea and others that have successfully contained large-scale outbreaks show that there’s a tried-and-tested approach to cutting off transmission: move them out of their homes into centralized facilities while they get over their infections, which usually doesn’t require longer than a few weeks.“A laissez-faire approach naively trusting everyone to be responsible has been shown to be ineffective, as there will always be a proportion who will breach the terms of the isolation,” said Jeremy Lim, adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.Faced with a new cluster this week after 102 days without a locally transmitted case, New Zealand has quickly enacted this strategy, placing around 30 people -- including at least two children below the age of 10 -- into centralized quarantine.But other countries facing sustained spread like Australia and the U.S. are not broadly enacting the policy despite its proven track record. Their unwillingness -- or inability -- to do so underscores the challenges faced by liberal democracies whose populations are less likely to tolerate measures that require individual sacrifice for the greater good.Not at HomeThe existence of a large group of carriers who hardly feel sick is a unique feature of the coronavirus crisis, and a major factor that has driven its rapid spread across the globe. Unlike in previous outbreaks like the 2003 SARS epidemic, many infected people don’t feel ill enough to stay home, and so spread the pathogen widely as they go about their daily lives.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 40% of Covid-19 infections are asymptomatic.In Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged last year, mildly sick patients were originally turned away from hospitals and told to rest at home, given that the overwhelmed health-care system needed to tend to the most severe cases. But health experts soon found that these people would infect their family members and others as they moved around in the community, precipitating a deluge of cases.Bringing mild or asymptomatic patients to designated facilities -- re-purposed convention centers, hotels and stadiums -- for basic medical care marked a turning point in the city’s fight against the coronavirus. Simply separating them from healthy people halted the pathogen’s silent spread through the community.The strategy has since been used in Italy, Singapore and South Korea at the height of their own coronavirus outbreaks earlier this year. Faced with a resurgence last month, Hong Kong converted an exhibition center to accommodate mild Covid-19 patients and is building more such facilities.In New Zealand, the government put “a lot of thought” into enacting the policy, and is asking family members of confirmed cases to go into centralized quarantine with them if they require care, said director general of health Ashley Bloomfield.The approach is effective firstly because it prevents people from infecting family members in the same household -- over 80% of cluster infections in China cities were in households after mild patients were allowed to stay home, said a Lancet study. In Europe, the surge of household infections drove Italy’s Milan to start putting such cases in hotels, enabling the country to gain control over its outbreak in early May.Beyond household spread, the strategy is necessitated by a facet of human nature that’s been seen time and again across countries and cultures: left to their own devices, some people just won’t follow the rules.In Australia and Japan, infected people who’ve been told to stay home have gone out for a variety of reasons -- some can’t work from home and need the income, while others want to pick up groceries and supplies. One woman in Tokyo traveled cross country by bus after having her infection confirmed.“It is far better to be more aggressive in the short term with even mild cases than it is to allow such cases to slip under the radar,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong.Locked UpBut forcibly moving mild or asymptomatic patients into centralized facilities has been met with backlash in some countries where citizens are not as accepting of government directives. Some people might lose their jobs if they disappear for two weeks, or have caretaking responsibilities for young children or older parents where it’s unfeasible to be separated.“People would be wondering what on earth they’re doing locked up in a hospital,” said Stephen Leeder, emeritus professor of public health and community medicine at the University of Sydney. “From what I know about the Australian psyche, I don’t think it would go down all that well.”In places like Venezuela and India where conditions in quarantine facilities are poor, the prospect of being taken away has caused some to avoid being tested or to lie to contact-tracers for fear of being found positive, making the work of health officials more challenging.In an emailed response to Bloomberg News queries, the Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria said the government provides alternative accommodation for quarantine, but that these are for health workers “who may not be able to safely live at their normal address” and other vulnerable groups.Rather than forcing isolation on mild cases, authorities have locked down 5 million residents in Melbourne and are tightening restrictions until new cases come under control.Officials are using a combination of stepped-up checks and fines of A$4,957 ($3,550) to convince infected people to stay home, while repeat offenders risk a A$20,000 penalty in court. More than 500 military personnel are helping the police conduct checks on 4,000 households every day to ensure those who are supposed to be staying home are there.To be sure, aggressive and thorough contact-tracing and case follow-up have successfully contained outbreaks in countries like Germany without a centralized quarantine strategy. But these places relied on an army of efficient workers hunting down every chain of transmission, a resource not many governments have had time to build up.“The classic practice in public health is to identify, trace and quarantine,” said Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “But how that is carried out depends on popular sentiment and the country’s resources.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forced-isolation-may-be-the-only-way-to-stop-resurgence-of-coronavirus/story-tUjebmXyng5GKA58D0I9OP.html
14-08-2020||World||Assange will never have chance of fair trial in UK, US: Ex-Ecuadorian Consul||Former Ecuadorian Sonsul in London Fidel Narvaez told Sputnik ahead of Friday’s administrative hearing in Wikileaks founder Julian Assange’s extradition case that the whistleblower will never get a fair trial either in the UK or in the United States.“There is plenty of evidence showing that Assange is a victim of a judicial persecution and that he is not getting a fair extradition trial here in the UK, and certainly will not have a fair trial in the US,” the former diplomat told Sputnik in a phone interview.According to Narvaez, the judicial persecution against the Australian journalist began even before he was arrested on April 11, 2019, at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he enjoyed political asylum for seven years to avoid being sent to Sweden until Ecuador’s current government handed him into the UK police last year.After being sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for jumping bail in a hearing that lasted less than 15 minutes, Assange was sent to maximum-security prison of Belmarsh in east London, where visits by relatives and lawyers are normally restricted.Narvaez said that after the coronavirus pandemic struck, the Wikileaks founder has seen his solitary confinement conditions worsened. The whistleblower has not been allowed to see his partner and sons, nor meet his lawyers in person, due to social distance restrictions.It even took months for the prison authorities to give him a pair of reading glasses and a radio receiver he had requested, Narvaez commented.He also recalled that when the extradition trial began in February in a London court, Assange was not allowed to sit with his lawyers, and was instead forced to watch the process from behind high walls made of glass panel.“The British judicial system has been particularly hard on Assange, and not just me, but many international lawyers think that he is not being granted the right to a fair trial,” Narvaez stressed.Asked about the new “superseding indictment” against the Wikileaks founder that the US prosecution made public even before formally presenting it to British court dealing with the extradition request, Narvaez called it a “publicity stunt”.“They [the US prosecutors] know they have nothing new. They just want to attract public attention,” he claimed.The US federal government charged Assange with 18 criminal charges related to endangering US national security by conspiring to obtain and disclose classified information.If the UK court consents to his extradition in the trial that is due to resume on September 7, Assange could be sentenced to 175 years behind bars.At the last administrative hearing held on July 27, Assange appeared by video link from prison for the first time in months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assange-will-never-have-chance-of-fair-trial-in-uk-us-ex-ecuadorian-consul/story-Se6ZGQDcac53EpexV0g5RL.html

But documents have emerged in the wake of the explosion that show the country’s top leadership and security officials were aware of the chemicals being stored in the city port.The blast has changed the face of the capital and forced the government to resign. Lebanon’s Parliament on Thursday approved a state of emergency in Beirut in its first session since the tragic explosion last week, granting the military sweeping powers amid rising popular anger and political uncertainty.Some 120 schools, used by 50,000 students, have been damaged. More than 1,000 of nearly 50,000 residential units were severely damaged, the UN report said.At east 13 refugees, including at least two Palestinians, were among those killed and more than 170,000 residents’ apartments were damaged, according to the UN report.Despite damage to the silos in the Beirut port, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said food shortages are not expected.The blast struck Beirut in the midst of a crippling financial and economic crisis, and the UN predicted people may have difficulties restoring or fixing their homes. But at least 55% of buildings assessed were rented, which may allow people to move elsewhere, the UN said.According to the world body the Beirut port is operating at 30% capacity and the Tripoli port in the country’s north, at 70%. That is allowing for food and goods to continue to flow. The World Food Program is bringing in a three-month supply of wheat flour and grains.The agency said however it is concerned about a surge in coronavirus cases, particularly as social distancing is relaxed during the widespread volunteering to help those affected by the blast and protests against the government and political elite.The government resigned on August 10 and the Cabinet remains in caretaker capacity. Protesters are demanding officials be held accountable for the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-explosion-178-killed-30-still-missing-says-united-nations/story-OUcI23qZWNV0ioPgAuNIyL.html
14-08-2020||World||New Zealand PM extends Covid-19 lockdown in Auckland by 12 days||Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern extended the lockdown of New Zealand’s largest city Auckland for 12 days as authorities try to stamp out the nation’s first outbreak in more than three months.Under the level 3 restrictions, people will be urged to stay home and consumer-facing businesses will be shuttered until August 26. Across the country, level 2 restrictions that include social distancing and gathering limits, will also be extended until the same day.The move is in line with New Zealand’s philosophy of “going hard and going early,” Ardern told reporters. To help people cope with the economic shock of the lockdown, a wage subsidy program and mortgage payment deferral scheme will be extended.After eradicating community transmission, New Zealand’s 102-day Covid-free run ended this week when an initial four new cases were detected in an Auckland household. Ardern responded to the fresh outbreak by putting Auckland, a city of 1.6 million people and a hub of commerce, into an initial three day lockdown and reimposed social distancing rules across the rest of the country.The prime minister said she will make a decision on whether to delay the Sept. 19 election within 48 hours.New Zealand recorded 12 new confirmed local cases of the coronavirus on Friday including 2 in the North Island town of Tokoroa. That takes the cluster, all linked to the Auckland outbreak, to 30, including one probable case. The nation now has 48 active cases, which includes 18 people who tested positive during the 14-day quarantine that’s mandatory for anyone returning to the country from overseas.While the origin of the outbreak is yet to be determined, the earliest case dates to July 31 with the infection of a worker at the Americold cold storage plant in the Auckland suburb of Mt Wellington, Ardern said.“We have found this outbreak relatively early in its life,” she said. Some 30,000 tests have been carried out this week, and the country has stockpiles sufficient for another 303,000 tests, she said.Businesses and investors are wary that an extension of the restrictions would stall the economic recovery that has been underway since a seven-week nationwide lockdown that ended in mid-May. The first lockdown -- a so-called alert level 4 -- saw manufacturing and construction closed, tipping New Zealand into recession for the first time in 10 years.“If this is just a scare and the alert levels are raised only briefly, then the economic implications are small,” said Dominick Stephens, chief New Zealand economist at Westpac in Auckland. “If New Zealand goes into another strict level 4 lockdown, the economic implications would be more severe.”Still, international experience shows that losing control of the virus would be much more damaging to the economy, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-extends-covid-19-lockdown-in-auckland-by-12-days/story-YNiw9gIXhmD7yTby0LvvJJ.html
14-08-2020||World||Michael Cohen book “Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump” to be published on Sept 8||NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Cohen’s memoir about President Donald Trump will be released Sept. 8 by Skyhorse Publishing, which confirmed the news Thursday to The Associated Press. The book is called “Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”“‘Disloyal’ is the most devastating business and political horror story of the century,” according to a Skyhorse statement shared with the AP. “It is a story that you haven’t read in newspapers, or on social media, or watched on television. These are accounts that only someone who worked for Trump around the clock for a decade — not a few months or even a couple of years — could know.”Earlier in the day, Cohen had released the book’s foreword, writing of his estranged former boss, “He wouldn’t mind if I was dead.” He did not list a publisher for the book and, as of midday Thursday, it was not listed on Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble.com.Cohen is completing the last two years of a three-year prison sentence at home after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress. He was released from prison in May amid coronavirus fears, only to be returned in July after making it known that he planned to publish “Disloyal.” The US government dropped its effort to silence Cohen late last month after an agreement was reached between government lawyers and Cohen attorney Danya Perry that lifted a ban on Cohen speaking publicly.Cohen’s charges stemmed from his efforts to arrange payouts during the 2016 presidential race to keep the porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from speaking out about their alleged extramarital affairs with Trump, who has denied the affairs. He has said that Trump directed him to make the payments.Skyhorse has a history of taking on books by controversial public figures, including a memoir this spring by Woody Allen that had been dropped by Hachette Book Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michael-cohen-book-disloyal-the-true-story-of-the-former-personal-attorney-to-president-donald-j-trump-to-be-published-on-sept-8/story-hW7WuSijAQD9IP5h5LCSlI.html

The premier is seen as a steward of economic management and naming Kim Tok Hun to the post to replace Kim Jae Ryong could deflect blame off the North Korean leader for any hardships coming from a poor harvest.The official Korean Central News Agency report said “Kim Jae Ryong was relieved from the premiership.” Kim Tok Hun is a senior cadre who serves as the head of the parliamentary budget committee.“The North Korean economy is facing a serious challenge now and someone had to take political responsibility,” said Choi Kang, vice-president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “This looks like a precautionary measure to offset complaints from North Korean people.”Kim Jong Un said at a Workers’ Party politburo meeting that flooding has taken a toll but North Korea shouldn’t accept foreign aid because of the coronavirus risk, KCNA said. North Korea has said it doesn’t have any coronavirus cases -- a claim doubted by US and Japanese officials -- and placed Kaesong on lockdown last month after the former defector crossed into the country.The leader “decided to lift the lockdown of Kaesong city based on scientific evidence,” KCNA added, noting he also ordered measures to further support flood victims.North Korea has been hit by flooding since earlier this month, as torrential rains threaten to wipe out farmland and the virus-damaged economy heads for what might be its biggest contraction in more than two decades. The flooding has also impacted its Yongbyon nuclear facility, with waters reaching pump houses for mothballed reactors, the 38 North website said based on an analysis of satellite imagery.Agricultural production is a key element of North Korea’s economy and flooding in its summer months has led to diminished harvest, putting strain on Kim as he battles global sanctions put in place to punish the state for its nuclear and ballistic missile testing. The United Nations World Food Program, which has operations in North Korea, has said about 40% of the population is undernourished, adding “food insecurity and malnutrition are widespread.”In addition to damage to farmland, Kim’s decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus slammed the brakes on the little legal trade the state has, and could send the economy this year into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-replaces-minister-kim-jae-ryong-as-economy-hit-by-floods/story-HB5lJWe2WpZlCz84svNQrL.html
14-08-2020||World||TikTok and its employees prepare to fight Trump over app ban||TikTok and its US employees are planning to take President Donald Trump’s administration to court over his sweeping order to ban the popular video app, according to a lawyer preparing one of the lawsuits.The employees’ legal challenge to Trump’s executive order will be separate from a pending lawsuit from the company that owns the app, though both will argue that the order is unconstitutional, said Mike Godwin, an internet policy lawyer representing the employees.Also read: TikTok and WeChat expose big tech’s lack of innovation | OpinionTrump last week ordered sweeping but vague bans on dealings with the Chinese owners of TikTok and messaging app WeChat, saying they are a threat to US national security, foreign policy and the economy. The TikTok order would take effect in September, but it remains unclear what it will mean for the apps’ 100 million US users, many of them teenagers or young adults who use it to post and watch short-form videos.It’s also unclear if it will make it illegal for TikTok to pay its roughly 1,500 workers in the US, which is why some of them came to Godwin for help, he said. The order would prohibit “any transaction by any person” with TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance.“Employees correctly recognize that their jobs are in danger and their payment is in danger right now,” Godwin said.TikTok said in a statement last week that it was “shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process.” It declined to comment on Thursday on whether it is pursuing its own lawsuit.“We have no involvement with and are not coordinating on” the employee-led initiative, said TikTok spokeswoman Hilary McQuaide said via email. “We respect the rights of employees to engage in concerted activity to seek due process of law.” The Fifth and 14th Amendments to the US Constitution safeguard life, liberty and property from arbitrary government action lacking “due process of law.” Microsoft is in talks to buy parts of TikTok, in a potential sale that’s being forced under Trump’s threat of a ban.Also read: French privacy watchdog opens preliminary investigation into TikTokWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump’s TikTok and WeChat orders on Thursday, telling reporters he was exercising his emergency authority under a 1977 law enabling the president to regulate international commerce to address unusual threats.“The administration is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber threats and these apps collect significant amounts of private data on users,” said McEnany, adding that the Chinese government can access and use such data.TikTok said it spent nearly a year trying to engage in “good faith” with the US government to address these concerns.“What we encountered instead was that the Administration paid no attention to facts, dictated terms of an agreement without going through standard legal processes, and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,” the company’s statement said.Godwin said he was retained by Patrick Ryan, who joined TikTok from Google earlier this year as a technical program manager. Ryan posted a public fundraising pitch on GoFundMe this week to raise money for attorneys who can “fight this unconstitutional taking.” “This is unprecedented,” Ryan wrote. “And it’s frankly really uncool.” Unlike other Chinese tech companies targeted by Trump, such as telecom giant Huawei, TikTok’s widespread popularity among Americans adds a layer of complexity to its legal and political challenges. The looming ban has annoyed TikTok users, some of them Trump supporters like Pam Graef of Metairie, Louisiana.The 53-year-old fitness instructor found nearly instant TikTok fame after downloading the app this summer and posting a video of herself dancing frenetically in a kitchen as someone pretending to be her embarrassed daughter shouts that she’s doing it wrong. The video has nearly 3.5 million views.“I don’t want it to be banned. It’s just a blast,” Graef said. “It’s a way for me to promote my virtual training and virtual classes.” She said Trump won’t lose her vote over this, but she doesn’t understand all the fuss about the app’s Chinese ownership. “What are they gaining by spying on us?” Graef said. “We’re just doing stupid videos and having fun.” The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that, until late last year, the TikTok app was able to track users of Android phones without their consent by collecting unique phone identifiers in a way that skirted privacy safeguards set by Google. TikTok responded that the technique it used is a common way to prevent fraud and said it no longer collects the unique identifier.The company has repeatedly said that the way it collects data is typical for thousands of mobile apps. “We have made clear that TikTok has never shared user data with the Chinese government, nor censored content at its request,” said its statement last week.Trump’s actions follow the lead of India, which has expressed similar security concerns and earlier this summer banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps amid a military standoff between the two countries.Godwin said the employees’ legal challenge will be focused on worker rights, not on the national security claims underlying Trump’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-and-its-employees-prepare-to-fight-trump-over-app-ban/story-gNOeRkjgPgtrb4rtlrhpcL.html

This gave the South Asian community in the United States a reason to cheer.Harris came to the US as an immigrant from Tamil Nadu in India.Since her nomination, a lot is being said about Harris and her Indian roots. Now, an old video has resurfaced in which the senator is seen making dosa with actor Mindy Kaling, who also has Indian roots.The dosa-making was done at Kaling’s home in Los Angeles where the two women also bonded over their shared South Indian roots. It was posted on social media channels of Harris.As the video begins, Kaling starts off by talking about Indian spices kept in small jars which she said has been done by her father. Harris says she is reminded of her own home by seeing this and the dishes her mother used to make.Kaling talks about the long process to make dosa batter and introduces a readymade stuff available in the US market. Harris then makes a confession.“I have never made a dosa,” she says in the video.They also talk about the immigration stories of their respective parents. Harris made history on Tuesday as the first Indian-American and Black woman to run for vice-president. She has credited her Indian-born mother for inspiring her into a life in public service that led her to this historic moment.She appeared for the first time with Biden after he named her his running mate. “Don’t just sit around and complain about things,” Harris, 55, said her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would tell her and younger sister Maya Harris when they were growing up. “Do something.”Gopalan, who came to the United States from Chennai and was a breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009. But she has remained the most enduring influence in Harris’s life, the US senator wrote ahead of her failed White House bid in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-ve-never-made-a-dosa-after-her-nomination-kamala-harris-old-video-resurfaces/story-KYL1WvWXloMbMMozrwhl8K.html

The decision made amid this context by the Israeli authorities on suspending the annexation of the Palestinian territories is a positive step, which must become a final measure,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on late Thursday.The minister expressed hope that the Israeli-UAE agreement would also boost the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a two-state solution, which is “the only way to reach fair and stable peace in the region.”On Thursday, Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalise their relations, and an agreement on the mutual establishment of embassies is expected to follow in the coming three weeks. In exchange, Israel said it would halt its plans to formally annex parts of the West Bank.Both ruling Palestinian movements, Fatah and Hamas, have already denounced the agreement.

14-08-2020||World||Covid-19 shaping up to be battle for years even with vaccine||The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be a challenge for years to come even with a vaccine, according to pharmaceutical and public-health experts.While a vaccine will provide some measure of protection to societies around the globe, the virus is likely to flare up from time to time and be constantly battled, much like the flu and other pathogens.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We know this virus is not going away any time soon. It’s established itself and is going to keep on transmitting wherever it’s able to do so,” Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist for the World Health Organization, at the “How Covid-19 Is Reshaping the Global Healthcare Ecosystem” event hosted by Bloomberg Prognosis. “We know we have to live this this.”Humanity’s record against viruses is poor. Only one virus has been fully driven out of existence in humans – smallpox. The rest are managed, with brushfires stomped out when they flare up.“I think what’s realistic to expect is that with a combination of drugs and vaccines we can get to a stable place where the pandemic is manageable,” said Novartis Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan. He called the actual elimination of the virus “unlikely.”There are 29 different vaccines in human trials around the world, according to a World Health Organization report released Thursday. More than 20 million people have been confirmed infected around the globe, with at least 751,000 killed by the virus.While the rush to rapidly test vaccines has potentially cut years off of the time before one will be ready, a first round of inoculations will likely go only to health workers and high-risk populations, with the general public having to wait until sometime next year to get a shot.“The longer you wait, the more knowledge you’re going to have on the vaccine,” Narasimhan said. ”With reasonable confidence, we could have a safe and effective vaccine before the end of next year that could be used broadly.”Also read: Govt panel on Covid-19 vaccine protocol discusses delivery mechanismTwo of the furthest along vaccines are being developed by Pfizer Inc. and by the University of Oxford, which is working with drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc. But scientists working on the trials said it was important to collect a robust set of data rather than rush to look at early results.The Oxford vaccine is being tested in the United Kingdom in a 10,000-person trial that has signed up most of its participants. It’s set to run for as long as a year gathering results, potentially with an earlier look.“We don’t yet have clarity on the timelines for those trials,” said Sarah Gilbert, the Oxford professor who has led development of the vaccine. She warned against early looks into the trial -- a process called unblinding -- that can taint the results. “We can’t have multiple looks at the data,” she said.Pfizer said it, too, would not rush into an early look.“We won’t unblind the study too early,” said Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development. “If we are successful, yeah, we can declare success early.”With vaccines, which are given to healthy people, longer sets of data are crucial to find out how safe they are in the long term and how long protection lasts.“We won’t know until we follow patients in clinical trials, in particular the vaccine trials, for six months to a year,” said Novartis’s Narasimhan.Ongoing riskPandemics like Covid-19 are rare, occurring perhaps as infrequently as once in 200 years, said Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College London who advised the U.K. government on its early-stage response. Yet more new viruses and outbreaks are likely to appear as urbanization and deforestation bring humans and animals into closer contact.Over the past decade there have been an “increasing number of viruses and bacterial infections spilling over into humans,” said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. “As long as we have close contact between animals and humans we will continue to have spillover events. And we’re seeing that through urbanization, deforestation, having wet markets.”There are steps that can be taken to reduce the risks of future pandemics, mainly involving the reduction of human interaction with wildlife, Ferguson said. One of the big risks is killing game for food, along with sales in markets in Asia and Africa.“Frankly, stopping those we could reduce the risk, but not completely,” he said.While hundreds of vaccines are in development that could slow or even halt the coronavirus, that’s just one step along the way to protection. Covid has wreaked havoc in rich and poor countries alike, suggesting that public health systems have been found lacking even in countries with strong systems of care, according to Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization.The WHO has been heavily criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said the group failed the prevent the outbreak and is too politically close to China. The U.S. currently has one of the world’s worst ongoing outbreaks.“We haven’t invested in public health responses,” said Swaminathan. “The countries that have really responded well have done so because the political leadership took it seriously, took early note of what was happening, and relied on scientific expertise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-shaping-up-to-be-battle-for-years-even-with-vaccine/story-iOA3bVsavU4Qo1m26pbreK.html
14-08-2020||World||Jimmy Lai says he was arrested on ‘trumped up’ charges||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai said he was arrested on “trumped up” charges, pushing back against landmark national security legislation that has raised questions about press freedoms and the future of the democracy movement.“They’re trumped up. I can’t go further on the details,” Lai said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday morning. “Before any evidence, they just claimed and presumed that I’m guilty. This isn’t the way the law is. I should be presumed innocent. We have never supported the independence of Hong Kong.”He said Hong Kong’s future as Asia’s main financial hub was uncertain if there was no respect for the rule of law under the new security measures.“The future of Hong Kong is the future of any other Chinese city,” he added. “Without the rule of law, the international financial center will be finished.” He added that the law sent a “very negative” message to the business community in Hong Kong and overseas.Lai has the highest profile of more than 20 democracy activists so far arrested under the national security law, which bars subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers. Hong Kong police on Monday arrested Lai along with his sons and senior executives of his media company, Next Digital Ltd., on suspicion of collusion under the security law imposed by China on June 30.Next Digital reversed an earlier decline to rise 32% as of 9:58 a.m. It declined Wednesday and Thursday after a 1,100% gain in the first two days of this week triggered a warning from Hong Kong’s securities regulator.The case has put new strain on already-fraught ties between the US and China, with President Donald Trump calling the arrest “a terrible thing” at a Thursday briefing. The Trump administration has slapped sanctions on senior Hong Kong officials including Chief Executive Carrie Lam and has led international condemnation of the law, calling it an attempt to crush Hong Kong’s political opposition.Reporters on Monday live-streamed a handcuffed Lai being led through the headquarters of his flagship Apple Daily newspaper. Its vocal criticism of the pro-Beijing establishment and support for last year’s historic protests helped make it a symbol of the press freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony.“We will persist,” Lai said of the newspaper. “There’s no doubt.”His arrest was part of an investigation into an online activist group that received more than HK$1 million ($129,000) in funding from overseas bank accounts, the South China Morning Post reported this week, citing unidentified people. Lai told Bloomberg Television that he had never given “one cent” to the protest movement and had no ties to prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong’s political party, which was disbanded as the national security law came into effect.More UncertaintyThe arrest drew calls among opposition supporters to buy Lai’s newspapers and stock in his company, fueling a 1,100% surge in its share price and prompting the market regulator to urge investors to “exercise extreme caution.” The Securities and Futures Commission has requested brokerages’ transaction records and client information related to Next Digital’s shares, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported Monday, citing unidentified brokers.The law has injected an additional measure of instability to Hong Kong as a fresh challenge to businesses in Asia’s main financial hub, which was once known for predictability more than protests. The city’s economy had faltered even before the law was enacted in June, following months of often-violent rallies and turmoil fomented by Covid-19.A survey released Thursday by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong showed almost half of businesses reported feeling pessimistic about the city’s business prospects, while others were almost equally worried about surprise retaliatory moves from the US.One member company described being “caught between a rock and a hard place,” with mainland Chinese clients unwilling to work with American firms and American firms unwilling to work with companies located in Hong Kong. “Frankly impossible to do anything right now, until there is clarity,” the respondent said.Protest EvolutionLai said Hong Kong’s protests have been curtailed by the new security law, but that pro-democracy supporters would find new ways to continue supporting the cause.“The protest movement has been reduced quite a lot,” he said. “A lot of young people have left or are about to leave. And some of the pro-democracy movement people have stepped aside.”“Those that remain are still very strong. And more people are reacting to the national security law in a different way,” he said. “I think the movement will go on. I don’t know how they’re going to go on. We can no long have 2 million people walk on the street. Are people going to scatter into small groups? I think in the future there will be innovation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jimmy-lai-says-he-was-arrested-on-trumped-up-charges/story-Z8eXDUlmv65ysdaNgPbcFM.html
14-08-2020||World||US, China to discuss trade deal amid Covid-19 disruption||Negotiators from the United States and China will on Saturday discuss the “phase one” trade deal signed earlier this year -- before the coronavirus slammed the world economy and relations between the two economic powers took a turn for the worse.Washington and Beijing’s January deal represented a partial truce in their months-long trade war, and obligated Beijing to import an additional $200 billion in American products over two years, ranging from cars to machinery to oil to farm products.But purchases of those goods have been lagging, while US President Donald Trump has stepped up rhetoric against China ahead of what’s expected to be a tough fight for a second term in the November elections, raising questions about the deal’s fate as well as the possibility of a second phase of the truce.“The outcome of the trade talk will signal if both sides are willing to continue to keep the deal, which will signal whether the relationship will deteriorate further,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at financial services giant ING. Neither the US nor the Chinese government confirmed the talks to AFP but the deal mandates meetings every six months after it takes effect, which would be Saturday.Even with tensions high and both countries reeling from the shock of Covid-19 -- which has caused a historic contraction in global growth and trade -- analysts don’t expect the talks to produce major changes in the agreement. And if anything does happen, Washington would be the catalyst.“Until now, China has been relatively passive and the United States has been relatively proactive,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for greater China at ANZ bank. “In my opinion, there shouldn’t be much change coming from China in terms of trade, cooperation or opening up the market, the key still lies in the US side.”Tensions worseningThe comity of the deal’s signing in Washington has been overshadowed in recent months as Washington and Beijing have traded barbs over who is to blame for the coronavirus, which first surfaced in China.Also worsening tensions are China’s crackdown on Hong Kong, which Washington has responded to with sanctions, and the Trump administration’s order to bar Chinese internet giants TikTok and WeChat from operating in the US.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in June said China would follow through on its commitments while Washington eyes a second deal, but that same month a Chinese State Council counsellor said the Covid-19 pandemic has had an “impact” on the deal and that relations between the countries are “very unsatisfactory.”The US-based Peterson Institute for International Economics said Chinese agricultural purchases at the end of June were far from where they should be at that point in the year.They had reached only 39 percent of their semi-annual target, according to US figures, or 48 percent, based on Chinese figures.Beijing “is lagging but it looks like China still wants to commit, despite the escalation of the US-China tensions,” said Tommy Xie, head of research on China at OCBC Bank.Bert Hofman, director of the East Asian Institute in Singapore, said Chinese agricultural purchases may improve later in the year but it will struggle to hit targets for energy products, given low global prices.However he said language in the agreement would allow both sides to modify the targets in response to a disaster like the coronavirus pandemic, which would be “a good outcome” but could be passed over for political considerations.“It will be politically hard to change the agreement in the run-up to an election in which President Trump has made containing China a key plank in his re-election campaign,” Hofman said. “Rather than amending the agreement, he may prefer to cancel it shortly before the US elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-to-discuss-trade-deal-amid-covid-19-disruption/story-XZvKO3ZDomLxAv0agGOjYO.html

These flights have connected several cities in India with the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. They have so far ferried nearly 9,000 persons back to India, and with 20 more such flights scheduled for this month, that number is expected to cross 10,000.Meanwhile, the Canadian Government, through its High Commission in Delhi and its Consulates in India, has also operated 41 repatriation flights, but those were chartered. Air Canada will return to India after nearly five months. Though the current arrangement of three-flights-a-week between Delhi and Toronto is only listed till the end of August, it is expected to be extended.The two countries were prompt in establishing the air bubble, with the Canadian Government seeking permission to this effect last week. “It adds to the convenience of Indian and Canadian citizens,” India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria said.The Indian Government is also working at synchronizing sharing of data with Air Canada for smooth implementation of restrictions and precautions related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Canadians of Indian origin holding Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards will be able to travel on these flights to India. This underscores the importance of these cards, since those who do not have it will have to apply for an emergency visa to travel, Bisaria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flights-under-air-bubble-agreement-between-india-and-canada-start-aug-15/story-KgfBghTsiMGRFbkeFuhR9L.html

Later test results on the man were “inconclusive”, according to the World Health Organisation.Coronavirus prevention measures had stabilised the risk in the area, Kim said in a statement carried by KCNA.While easing the lockdown within the country, Kim said that border controls should remain tight and ordered communities not to accept any external assistance related to the floods caused by weeks of heavy rain.“The situation, in which the spread of the worldwide malignant virus has become worse, requires us not to allow any outside aid for the flood damage but shut the border tighter and carry out strict anti-epidemic work,” Kim said in a statement carried out by the KCNA.The monsoon season caused extensive damage in several provinces, with farmlands inundated with floodwaters, around 16,680 houses and 630 public buildings destroyed or flooded, and many roads, bridges and railroads damaged, KCNA reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-lifts-lockdown-in-border-town-after-suspected-covid-19-case-inconclusive/story-bhysx83JWK0VHVEenxXaGN.html

He also kept older cars in the company’s rental fleet longer to lower depreciation costs without disclosing the change to investors, the SEC said.Hertz reaffirmed earnings guidance in November 2013 despite internal projections that showed lower earnings per share figures, according to the SEC. The company then revised the results in 2014 and restated them in 2015, cutting previously reported pretax income by $235 million, the SEC said. Hertz agreed to pay $16 million to resolve SEC claims over the misstatements.Frissora, who agreed to settle without admitting or denying the SEC’s claims, will pay a $200,000 fine in addition to returning nearly $2 million in incentive-based pay. He left Hertz in September 2014 after investors pushed for his removal and went on to serve as president of Caesars Entertainment Corp. for four years through April 2019.Hertz, which filed for bankruptcy in May, said earlier this week that it is seeking debtor-in-possession financing. That came after the SEC raised questions about a plan to issue as much as $500 million of equity, forcing Hertz to terminate the offering after raising just $29 million from investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-ceo-of-hertz-to-repay-2-million-over-misstatements-in-2013/story-lQHYRXJvJF2bYMhYEecl6I.html

This was their first meeting after a week.The details of the meeting have not been disclosed. The sources close to the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) said the talk ended on a positive note. Sources said as Prime Minister Oli agreed to hand over the total command of the party to Prachanda during the meeting, an agreement could be closer.The leaders are expected to meet on Friday too.Oli during a television interview on Wednesday said that the ongoing intra-party tussle will be settled down within five days. Oli and Prachanda have held at least ten meetings in recent weeks to sort out the differences between them. But, as the Prime Minister did not accept the condition of a one-man-one-post, the talks failed. Oli has refused to give up his post as prime minister as well as a co-chairman of the NCP.A bitter internal feud has been brewing in the ruling NCP since the last few weeks after top party leaders, including Prachanda, demanded Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” They are also against Oli’s autocratic style of functioning.The differences grew further after Oli said that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.The two leaders are also engaged in tightening their grip within the party with the escalation of the intra-party feud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oli-prachanda-meet-to-resolve-their-differences/story-rtwu3UyVRun6TuMKdFjEnM.html
14-08-2020||World||Palestinians recall ambassador from UAE over Israel deal||The official Palestinian news agency says the Palestinian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates is being recalled.The move comes after the UAE and Israel announced a deal on Thursday to establish full diplomatic ties that would see Israel suspend its plans to annex parts of the West Bank.The Palestinians have slammed the deal, calling it a “betrayal” of the Palestinian cause and have demanded its retraction.Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced Thursday they are establishing full diplomatic relations in a US-brokered deal that required Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians.The historic deal delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the deal amounts to “treason,” and should be reversed.The agreement makes the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full diplomatic ties with Israel. They announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between Israel and the UAE were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Trump called the deal “a truly historic moment.” “Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.In a nationally televised news conference, Netanyahu echoed Trump’s remarks.“Today we usher in a new era of peace between Israel and the Arab world,” he said. “There is a good chance we will soon see more Arab countries joining this expanding circle of peace.” But Netanyahu said the annexation plan was on “temporary hold,” appearing to contradict statements from Emirati officials who said it was off the table. Emirati officials described the deal in pragmatic terms, saying they had dealt a “death blow” to an aggressive Israeli move and hoped to help reshape the region.“Is it perfect? Nothing is perfect in a very difficult region,” said Anwar Gargash, a top Emirati official. “But I think we used our political chips right.” He said the deal dealt a “death blow” Israel and the UAE do not share a border and have never fought a war. But the UAE, like most of the Arab world, long rejected diplomatic ties with Israel in the absence of a peace deal establishing a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in 1967.That steadfast support for the Palestinians, however, has begun to weaken in recent years, in large part because of the shared enmity toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the day-to-day ruler of the UAE, also shares Israel’s distrust of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gaza Strip’s ruling Hamas militant group.Netanyahu has long boasted about fostering closer behind-the-scenes ties with Arab countries than publicly acknowledged. The UAE has made little secret of those budding ties, allowing Israeli businessmen to enter the country on foreign passports and welcoming Israeli officials and sporting figures. Next year, Israel will take part in the UAE’s delayed Expo 2020, the world’s fair being hosted by Dubai. A secret synagogue also draws practicing Jews in Dubai.Still, the timing of the deal was unexpected, and perhaps tied to the upcoming US election.For Trump, it gave an important boost to a president trailing in opinion polls and facing heavy criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. It was also a rare achievement for his Mideast team, led by adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose Mideast plan has made little headway since it was unveiled early this year.Israel and the UAE are among Trump’s few close international allies, and Thursday’s deal may have been seen as an election gift.U.S.-Israeli author Joel Rosenberg, who met with the crown prince in 2018 alongside fellow evangelical Christians, said the announcement could influence religious voters who may “struggle to decide” between Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.Thursday’s agreement offers “a feel that this is historic” and a change for Trump to “have a series of big moments in the months ahead.” In a statement, Biden praised Israel for freezing the annexation plan.“The United Arab Emirates and Israel have pointed a path toward a more peaceful, stable Middle East,” he said, adding that a Biden presidency “will seek to build on this progress.” Netanyahu also chalked up a diplomatic victory at a time when his shaky coalition government has been plagued by infighting and facing the possibility of early elections. But even his rivals praised the deal.Netanyahu has seen his popularity plummet as the country grapples with a renewed coronavirus outbreak, mass street protests and skyrocketing unemployment as the result of earlier lockdown measures.For the UAE, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and the rolling, oil-rich sand dunes of Abu Dhabi, it further burnishes its international campaign to be seen as a beacon of tolerance in the Middle East despite being governed by autocratic rulers. It also removes the stigma of recognizing Israel and could open the door for neighboring countries to follow suit.The Gulf state of Bahrain welcomed the deal.All in all, Netanyahu paid a relatively minor price. Although the hoped-for annexation plan is on hold, a half-century status quo remains in place in which Israel maintains its occupation of the West Bank and continues to expand its scores of settlements while Palestinians live in small autonomous enclaves. Those settlements are now home to some 500,000 Israelis.The Palestinians claim all of the West Bank, captured in the 1967 Mideast war, as the heartland of a future state. The Trump Mideast plan envisions granting Israel permanent control over 30% of that territory, while offering the Palestinians limited autonomy in the remainder. After embracing the plan, Netanyahu backed away from moving forward with annexation last month in the face of fierce international opposition and misgivings by White House officials.The Palestinians have rejected Trump’s Mideast plan out of hand.Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, convened a meeting of his top leadership Thursday night, and afterward his spokesman Nabil Abu Rdeneh, said the agreement amounted to “treason.” He added that the UAE must reverse the decision and urged other Arab countries not to follow suit “at the expense of Palestinian rights.” In Gaza, Hamas called the deal a “stabbing in the back of our people.” Moving to head off the Palestinian criticism, UAE officials said the deal had prevented the annexation and kept hopes alive for Palestinian statehood.“The UAE is using its gravitas and promise of a relationship to unscrew a time bomb that is threatening a two-state solution,” Gargash said.Netanyahu also came under criticism from Israeli hardliners who accused him of missing an opportunity to annex parts of the biblical land of Israel. Naftali Bennett, a pro-settler lawmaker, welcomed the agreement but said it was “tragic that Netanyahu did not seize the moment.” Netanyahu insisted there was “no change” to his annexation plans. He said Israel would “wait temporarily” at the request of Trump.Still, by dropping the annexation plan Netanyahu may be hedging his bets ahead of a possible change in the White House. Biden has made clear that he would oppose any annexation.Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, said the deal would solidify Netanyahu’s legacy among Israel’s greatest leaders.“There’s Rabin with Jordan, Begin with Egypt,” he said, referring to the prime ministers who reached Israel’s other peace deals. “Now there’s Benjamin Netanyahu. He’s going to be in the history books.” (AP) ANB ANB||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-recall-ambassador-from-uae-over-israel-deal/story-xEGaScjbVPqYUPq9TaYYHN.html

14-08-2020||World||Indian mother taught me to fight for change: Kamala Harris||Appearing with Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, for the fist time after he named her his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday credited her Indian-born mother for inspiring her into a life in public service that led her to this historic moment.“Don’t just sit around and complain about things,” Harris, 55, said her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would tell her and younger sister Maya Harris when they were growing up. “Do something.” Gopalan, who came to the United States from Chennai and was a breast cancer researcher, passed away in 2009. But she has remained the most enduring influence in Harris’s life, the US senator wrote ahead of her failed White House bid in 2019. Harris made history on Tuesday as the first Indian-American and Black woman to run for vice-president.“Kamala is smart. She’s tough. She’s experienced. She’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class,” Biden said in his first public explanation of why he picked Harris, from the 11 other women candidates he considered for the job.And, after listing out her accomplishments, the former vice-president said, “As the child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country, as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up Black and Indian-American in the United States.” He added: “Her story is an American story – different from mine in many particulars, but also, not so different in essentials.” The former vice-president then went on to frame his pick in a larger context of a changing America: “And this morning, all across this nation little girls woke up – especially little Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — but today, maybe they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way. As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.”Biden and Harris used their first public appearance together after the announcement to launch a blistering attack on President Donald Trump. “As someone who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and {vice president} Mike Pence is open and shut,” said Harris.After the historic announcement on Tuesday, Wednesday was a quiet affair, held at a school gymnasium in Wilmington, Delaware, which is Biden’s home-state. There were no on-stage handshakes or hugs, and the candidates stayed socially distanced for the photo-op, joined by their spouses. And they put on their masks as they left. “Just look where they’ve gotten us,” Harris said, taking aim at the Trump administration for its handling of the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic. “When other countries were following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News.” Polls show a large chunk of Americans do not approve the Trump administration’s response to the biggest public health crisis faced by the US since the 1918 flu epidemic that killed 675,000 people in the country.The president’s changing position on social distancing and use of masks and his “delusional belief that he knows better than the experts”, Harris said, are the reasons why “an American dies of Covid-19 every 80 seconds, why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good.”Continuing to hold Trump personally responsible for the crisis and the resulting unemployment, among other consequences, the Senator said, “He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden — and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.”Harris also spoke of her commitment to “root out systemic racism from our justice system”, pass a Voting Rights Act, support for dreamers and immigrants, LGBTQs (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queers) and identified herself with the anti-racism protests, saying, “All across this country, a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice, and chants of hope, on which I was raised” during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. On November 3, voting day, she said: “We need more than a victory … We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are, or who we aspire to be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-mother-taught-me-to-fight-for-change-kamal-harris/story-5MGPvzG7GsDRfXO7ItEXUJ.html
14-08-2020||World||In US-brokered deal, UAE and Israel to normalise ties||Israel and the United Arab Emirates will open diplomatic relations, US President Donald Trump said on Thursday in a surprise announcement of a deal that would halt Israel’s planned annexation of Palestinian land.“This historic diplomatic breakthrough will advance peace in the Middle East region and is a testament to bold diplomacy and vision of the three leaders and the courage of the United Arab Emirates and Israel to chart a new path that will unlock the great potential of the region,” said a joint statement by the US, the UAE and Israel released by the White House.The UAE and Israel will sign an agreement at the White House some time in the future, President Trump told reporters. The two nations will open embassies. Delegations from the two sides will meet in the coming weeks to sign bilateral agreements on areas including energy, tourism, direct flights, investment, security, communication and technology, the UAE foreign ministry said in a statement . The White House statement said Israel will “suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined” in the President’s Vision for Peace unveiled earlier and focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world. It said the three countries are “confident that additional diplomatic breakthroughs with other nations are possible, and will work together to achieve this goal.”The UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said the agreement to normalise relations with Israel was done to deal with the threat that further annexation of Palestinian territories posed to the two-state solution. He urged the Palestinians and Israelis to return to the negotiating table.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal represented a “historic day” for Israel, and ushered in a “new era” in its relations with the Arab world.The agreement broke new ground in Israel’s outreach to Gulf Arab countries with a common fear of Iran’s regional influence. But the Hamas militant group accused the UAE of stabbing the Palestinians in the back. “This announcement is a reward for the Israeli occupation’s crimes,” said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. “The normalisation is a stabbing in the back of our people.” The Islamic militant movement seeks Israel’s destruction and has fought three wars against Israel since seizing control of the Gaza Strip in 2007.A top official in the West Bank settler movement said freezing the annexation plan was a “fair price” for establishing relations with the UAE. Oded Revivi, a top leader in the Yesha settler council, a strong advocate of annexation, tweeted: “The Israeli agreement to postpone the application of Israeli law in the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria is a fair price. The reaction could be a sign that even Israeli hard-liners who pushed for annexation will not criticize Netanyahu for abandoning their dream.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-brokered-deal-uae-and-israel-to-normalise-ties/story-BabtcYzxGZikbUGHNw0O5L.html
14-08-2020||World||‘Harris may help Biden with women, youth, GOP voters’||Nearly nine out of 10 Democrats approve of US Senator Kamala Harris as their party’s vice presidential nominee, and she is more popular than presidential candidate Joe Biden among women, young voters and some Republicans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.The August 11-12 public opinion survey also found that 60% of Americans, including 87% of Democrats and 37% of Republicans, considered the selection of Harris - the first Black woman and Asian American nominated for vice presidency - to be a “major milestone” for the US.The California senator is viewed about as favourably or better than Biden in most major demographic groups, the poll showed, highlighting her potential to help the former vice president expand his support in November’s election.The poll showed Biden’s lead over Republican President Donald Trump was effectively unchanged after he announced his running mate choice, increasing by 1 percentage point among all Americans to an 8-point advantage - well within the poll’s credibility interval - when compared with a similar poll that ran on Monday and Tuesday.Forty-six percent of U.S. adults said they would vote for a Biden/Harris ticket, while 38% would vote for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. A similar poll that ran on Monday and Tuesday showed that 44% would vote for Biden while 37% would back Trump.The latest poll also found that 56% of Americans have a favourable impression of Harris, which is about the same as the number who favour Biden. Forty-two percent of US adults say they have a favourable view of Trump and 47% said the same of Pence.Among women, 60% said they have a favourable view of Harris, compared with 53% who felt the same way about Biden. In addition, about 25% of Republicans said they had a favourable view of Harris and approve of her choice as Biden’s running mate. Only about 20% of Republicans said they have a similarly favourable view of Biden. Harris also is a little more popular among American adults who are younger than 35 years old: 62% said they view Harris favourably, while 60% said the same of Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-may-help-biden-with-women-youth-gop-voters/story-jHpfd2RH7cVPnVVIDSLXHM.html
14-08-2020||World||Global Covid death toll passes 750,000||he global death toll from Covid-19 passed 750,000 on Thursday, with some countries toughening controls as caseloads once again creep up.The Latin America and the Caribbean region remained the global epicentre, accounting for almost one-third of all deaths and housing two of the worst-affected countries - Mexico and Brazil. Fear is growing in other regions, with countries including New Zealand and Italy tightening measures in a bid to secure hard-won gains in fighting the virus, which has now infected more than 20 million worldwide.New Zealand, which earlier this week broke a streak of more than 100 days without a new infection, is scrambling to find the source of 17 new cases in its biggest city Auckland - which faces the prospect of a three-day lockdown being extended.People living in London and those of Indian and Asian background are most likely to have been infected by the coronavirus, a key study by Imperial College London published on Thursday said, adding that 6% of England’s population has been infected so far. The 6% reflects about 3.4 million people. Over 100,000 volunteers took part in the study. Billed as the “world’s largest home antibody testing programme for coronavirus”, it tracked infections across England after the first peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-death-toll-passes-750-000/story-ffW9STcJC3YJJcw3UnqwVI.html
14-08-2020||World||Donald Trump rant prompts easing of shower standards||The US government proposed rule changes on Wednesday that would allow shower heads to boost water pressure, after President Donald Trump repeatedly complained that bathroom fixtures do not work to his liking. The Department of Energy plan followed comments from Trump last month a White House event on rolling back regulations. He said he believed water does not come out fast enough from fixtures.“So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect.”Last December, Trump said environmental regulators were looking at sinks, faucets and toilets to revise rules meant to conserve water and fuel that heats it. “People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once,” Trump told a meeting of small business leaders at the White House.Consumer groups decried the plan, saying current rules saved consumers money by conserving water and fuel.The proposal would effectively allow shower fixtures to include multiple shower heads that would get around the 2.5 gallon (9.4 litre) per minute standard Congress set in 1992, when Trump’s fellow Republican George H.W. Bush was president. The Energy Department also proposed easier standards on clothes washers. The Trump administration says its regulatory rollbacks save average American households $3,100 a year. But conservationists say easing bathroom fixture standards could boost energy and water costs. It was uncertain whether the plan would be finalised. Trump is campaigning for reelection in November and trails in opinion polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-rant-prompts-easing-of-shower-standards/story-zBUk9FWMwZVbtOxVERstcK.html
14-08-2020||World||Confucius Institute a foreign mission: US||The US on Thursday designated the Confucius Institute US Center (CIUS) as a foreign mission, calling it an “entity advancing Beijing’s global propaganda and malign influence campaign” on American campuses and schools.“The goal of these actions is simple: to ensure that American educators and school administrators can make informed choices about whether these CCP-backed programmes should be allowed to continue, and if so, in what fashion,” secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in a statement.As a “foreign mission,” CIUS will be subject to same administrative rules and restrictions that apply to the Chinese diplomatic missions on a reciprocal basis. CIUSs, many of them based on college campuses, are a long-established Chinese-government funded programme dedicated to teaching Chinese language and culture in the US and other nations.The Trump administration shut down the Chinese mission in Houston recently alleging it had become a den of spies.The US had also designated several Chinese media outlets operating in the country as “foreign missions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/confucius-institute-a-foreign-mission-us/story-DXjwF3JgLq8xSKd3B3O2bN.html
14-08-2020||World||Indian tricolour to be hoisted at Niagara falls on August 15||The Indian tricolour will be hoisted for the first time ever at the iconic Canadian landmark of Niagara Falls to mark Independence Day this year.The ceremony at the globally-famous scenic spot will be part of celebrations that will take place across the country. Given the current restrictions in place due to the pandemic, many of the regular events will now migrate online, including the traditional hoisting of the flag at the Indian High Commission in Ottawa and the Consulates in Toronto and Vancouver.The flag will also be featured at other significant Canadian locations, including over the 553 metre high CN Tower, the most striking building in the skyline of Canada’s largest city, Toronto. Another quintessential landmark in the city, the three-dimensional Toronto sign near City Hall in Toronto will be illuminated in the colours of the Indian flag.These displays will continue through the weekend, as the flag raising at Niagara will take place on the evening of August 15, while the flag will flutter over CN Tower on Sunday, while the Toronto sign will stay illuminated over both evenings.India’s Consul General to Toronto Apoorva Srivastava said, “It is a matter of great pride that this Independence Day, iconic locations like Niagara Falls, CN Tower and the Toronto sign will be illuminated in Indian tricolour.”Each year, Toronto witnesses the signature event for the community in the country, the India Day Parade. Last year, it attracted a crowd of a record 85,000 at its downtown venue. However, given measures prohibiting the gathering of large numbers of people due to the coronavirus crisis, this event will occur virtually this year, which will be streamed live. While the event featured floats from various states and community groups in the past, this year, it will showcase 10-minute videos comprising the culture and cuisine of the various parts of India, as part of a virtual Parade.Another virtual event to mark the occasion of Independence Day, Taste of India, also took place in the digital sphere this year, and featured cuisine from different parts of India as well a recipes from celebrity chefs.Srivastava said these events have been planned ‘keeping in mind the safety regulations and social distancing.” She also said there will be a symbolic planting of 74 saplings in Brampton, a city in the Greater Toronto Area, followed by a rally which will feature cars displaying the India flag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-tricolour-to-be-hoisted-in-niagara-falls-on-august-15/story-8lNDJcMtivX4mWUs2lRnUO.html
14-08-2020||World||Trump fans ‘birther’ slur against Harris||President Donald Trump on Thursday resurrected the racially charged “birther” controversy he had fanned for years to question President Barack Obama’s eligibility for the presidency. His target this time is Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and Indian American to run for vice-president.Since the announcement of her pick as the running mate of Joe Biden, some fringe conservatives have sought to question Harris’s eligibility arguing that while she was born in the United States, her parents — mother from India and father from Jamaica — were not naturalized citizens of the US at the time.Therefore, they have argued, while Harris may not be a “natural born citizen” as required by the constitution to become president and, by extension, vice-president.“I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements, and by the way the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented,” Trump told reporters at a briefing when asked about questions being raised about Harris’s eligibility as an “anchor baby”, a term used for children born to non-citizens during visits to the US aimed to help the rest of the family immigrate to the United States. Trump had referred to a column in the Newsweek that first made this argument.“I have no idea if that’s right,” he added. “I would have assumed the Democrats would’ve checked that out before she gets chosen for vice president.”Instead of dismissing the clearly absurd theory, the president lingered. “Thats a very serious... they’re saying she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country?” he asked.When told Harris was indeed born in the United States and that her parents may not have been legal resident or naturalized citizens at the time, he said. “I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I will take a look.”Harris, 55, was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, which makes her a natural born citizen, eligible to run for the White House or any other officer in the US. Her parents had met as graduate students at University of California, Berkeley.The Biden-Harris campaign had not responded to the president’s tacit support of the unfounded theory, to fan it, till hours after, but Maya Harris, the younger sister of Kamala Harris, did: “There are no gradations of birtherism. You’re either in or you’re out,” she wrote on twitter, joining a growing call for ignoring the attempt to resurrect the “birther” controversy.Trump started the “birther” movement in 2011 when he first seriously considered a run for the White House. He began by questioning then President Barack Obama’s eligibility for the White House, alleging wrongly he was not born in the US. Obama was born in Hawaii but he felt compelled to release a long-form record of his birth.Trump acknowledged he was wrong years later. But in intervening years, he used the same strategy to diminish Ted Cruz, the last of his primaries challengers. Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada to father who was from Cuba and mother, who was a natural-born American citizen. Cruz lost the primaries and soon resurfaced as a strong support of President Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-fans-birther-slur-against-harris/story-DpwYiayWykBdgNir5RoFAP.html
