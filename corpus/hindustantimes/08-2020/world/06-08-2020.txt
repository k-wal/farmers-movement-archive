06-08-2020||World||It’s not for me: Speed of Covid-19 vaccine race raises safety concerns||The frenetic race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine has intensified safety concerns about an inoculation, prompting governments and drugmakers to raise awareness to ensure their efforts to beat the coronavirus aren’t derailed by public distrust.There are more than 200 Covid-19 vaccine candidates in development globally, including more than 20 in human clinical trials. US President Donald Trump has vowed to have a shot ready before year’s end, although they typically take 10 years or longer to develop and test for safety and effectiveness.In the drive to find a potential Covid-19 vaccine “fast is good for politicians,” said Heidi Larson, who leads the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), a global surveillance programme on vaccine trust. “But from the public perspective, the general sentiment is: ‘too fast can’t be safe’“, she told Reuters. Regulators around the world have repeatedly said speed will not compromise safety, as quicker results would stem from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence.However, these reassurances have failed to convince many, including in Western countries where scepticism about vaccinations was already growing before the pandemic.Preliminary results of a survey conducted over the last three months in 19 countries showed that only about 70% of British and U.S. respondents would take a Covid-19 vaccine if available, Scott Ratzan, co-leader of ‘Business Partners to CONVINCE’, told Reuters.Business Partners to CONVINCE, a U.S./UK initiative that is partly government funded, conducted the survey jointly with VCP and the results were broadly in line with a Reuters/Ipsos poll of the U.S. public in May. “We just see this distrust growing against science and government,” said Ratzan.“We need to address legitimate concerns about the rapid pace of development, political over-promises and the risks of vaccination.” The VCP/Business Partners’ survey, expected to be published in a few weeks, will also show that Chinese participants were the most trusting of vaccines, while Russians were the least so, Ratzan said. Drugmakers and governments had hoped the scale of the Covid-19 crisis would allay concerns about vaccines, which they see as crucial to defeating the pandemic and enabling economies to fully recover from its impact.Vaccine hesitancy - or the reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated - is also known as “anti-vax”, a term that is sometimes associated with conspiracy theories when often it simply reflects many people’s concerns about side-effects or industry ethics. In January 2019 the World Health Organisation named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats for that year.In Europe, scepticism among the public was high before the pandemic due to a range of factors including negative coverage of pharmaceutical companies as well as false theories including suggested links between childhood immunisations and autism.Only 70% of French people considered vaccines safe in a 2018 survey commissioned by the European Union executive. The EU average was 82%, but trust fell to 68% for the shot against seasonal flu. The VCP project on vaccine trust, funded by the European Commission and pharmaceutical companies among others, aims to identify early signs and causes of public mistrust and tackle them with information campaigns before it is too late.Larson said headlines referring to Warp Speed - the name of the U.S. operation aimed at delivering a COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. population by next year - could increase vaccine hesitancy even more than perceptions that the disease could become less lethal.“One of the most frequent things that comes up in people’s conversations is concerns about how quick it is. If I have to pick one theme that is more recurrent than others it is this one,” Larson said.Data collected by VCP from social media show that by the end of June about 40% of Britons’ posts concerning a Covid-19 vaccine, for example, were negative, with many distrusting any coronavirus vaccine and the medical establishment.Announcements about fast progress in Covid vaccines in Russia and China in particular could also contribute to rising scepticism. “We don’t have transparency and don’t know how accurate or valid their data are,” Ratzan said, adding that errors there could boost scepticism elsewhere.Key for any information campaign to be successful is to tailor it to different audiences as there is no uniform profile of anti-vaxxers, said Kate Elder of Doctors Without Borders, a non-governmental organisation.“They go from the highly educated to those who don’t believe in science,” she said, urging politicians to be more careful in their messages on vaccines and to better explain the reasons behind potentially fast results against Covid-19.“We are exploring the idea of a chatbot that will speak in different languages,” said Ratzan, adding it could be something similar to Smokey Bear, the U.S. Forest Service’s campaign to educate about preventing wildfires. “Different parts of the world will require different strategies. We know we need to tailor it and to be specific,” he said.Risks are high if hesitancy is not addressed quickly. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, growing scepticism about the vaccine led to a failure of the vaccination campaign in France, where only 8% of the population got a shot against the virus which is estimated to have killed around 280,000 people across the world.A study published in May in the Lancet by a group of French scientists warned of similar risks now in the country where vaccine hesitancy went up from 18% in mid-March when a lockdown was imposed on the French to 26% by the end of that month.“Distrust is likely to become an issue when the vaccine will be made available,” the scientists concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-not-for-me-speed-of-covid-19-vaccine-race-raises-safety-concerns/story-sWmfz99xcdcznNjhg6LopM.html
06-08-2020||World||French President Macron announces fundraising conference for Lebanon||French President Emmanuel Macron says an international fundraising conference for Lebanon will be held in the next few days after the deadly explosion that devastated Beirut.On a visit to the gutted city, Macron said Thursday that France will organize a conference with European, American and Middle Eastern and other donors to raise money for food, medicine, housing and other urgent aid.He promised a “clear and transparent governance” so that the aid goes directly to the populations and aid groups.Beirut residents blame years of corruption and mismanagement by Lebanon’s leaders for Tuesday’s explosion, which killed more than 130 people, wounded thousands and left tens of thousands homeless.France once governed Lebanon as a protectorate and maintains close ties.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.BEIRUT (AP) — Residents of Beirut vented their fury at Lebanon’s leaders Thursday during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, blaming them for the deadly explosion that ravaged the capital. Shouting, “Revolution!” they crowded around the visiting leader who promised to press the politicians for reform.For many Lebanese, Tuesday’s giant blast was the last straw after years of corruption and mismanagement by a political elite that has ruled for decades.The blast, which killed more than 130 people, wounded thousands and left tens of thousands homeless, is believed to have been caused when a fire touched off a stockpile of 2,750 tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate that authorities left sitting in a warehouse for years — despite a customs official’s repeated warnings.Macron visited the devastated port and toured a hard-hit neighborhood lined with heavily damaged buildings. A crowd gathered around him and shouted their anger, chanting, “Revolution!” and “The people want to bring down the regime!” — slogans used at mass protests last year.Macron told them he would speak to Lebanon’s political leaders.“I will propose to them a new political pact this afternoon,” he said. “I will be back on the first of September and if they can’t do it, I will keep my responsibility toward you.”He also promised that French aid would be given out with transparency and “will not go into the hands of corruption.” France once governed Lebanon as a protectorate and maintains close ties.Elsewhere, he said his visit was “an opportunity to have a frank and challenging dialogue with the Lebanese political powers and institutions.” France will work to coordinate aid, he said, but warned that “if reforms are not made, Lebanon will continue to sink.”There have been widespread pledges of international aid to Lebanon, but the country has been mired in a severe economic crisis and faces a daunting challenge in rebuilding. It’s unclear how much support the international community will offer the notoriously corrupt and dysfunctional government.Losses from the blast were estimated by Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud to be between $10 billion to $15 billion, who said nearly 300,000 people are homeless.The disaster may also have accelerated the country’s coronavirus outbreak, as thousands flooded into hospitals. Tens of thousands have had to move in with relatives and friends after their homes were damaged, further raising the risks of exposure.The head of Lebanon’s customs department, meanwhile, confirmed in an interview with LBC TV on Wednesday that officials had sent five or six letters over the years to the judiciary, asking that the ammonium nitrate be removed because of its dangers.Badri Daher said all he could do was alert authorities to its presence, saying even that was “extra work” for him and his predecessor. He said the port authority was responsible for the material, while his job was to prevent smuggling and collect duties.The judiciary and the port authority could not immediately be reached for comment. The government said Wednesday an investigation was underway and that port officials have been placed under house arrest.The ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilizers, had been stored at the port since it was confiscated from a ship years earlier. Based on the timeline and the size of the cargo, that ship could be the MV Rhosus. The ship was initially seized in Beirut in 2013 when it entered the port due to technical problems, according to lawyers involved in the case. It came from the nation of Georgia, and had been bound for Mozambique.The stockpile is believed to have detonated after a fire broke out nearby in what appeared to be a warehouse holding fireworks. Daher, the customs official, said he did not know if there were fireworks near the site.Another theory is that the fire began when welders were trying to repair a broken gate and a hole in the wall of Warehouse 12, where the explosive material was stored. Local news reports say the repairs were ordered by security forces who were concerned about theft.Security officials have declined to comment during the investigation. Port officials have rejected the welding theory in interviews with local media, saying the work had been completed long before the fire broke out.Lebanon’s various political factions, including the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group, have ruled the country since the 1975-1990 civil war. Almost all the country’s public institutions are divided up among the factions, which use them as patronage generators for themselves and their supporters. Little actual development is put into the institutions and anything that requires joint action often becomes mired in bickering. As a result, even basic services like electricity and trash collection are in a shambles.The tiny Mediterranean country is beset by soaring unemployment and a financial crisis that has wiped out people’s life savings. Hospitals were already strained by the coronavirus, and one was so badly damaged by the blast it had to treat patients in a nearby field.Dr. Firas Abiad, director general of Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the public hospital leading the coronavirus fight, said he expects an increase in cases in the next 10 to 15 days linked to crowding at hospitals and blood donation centers after the blast.Authorities had largely contained the outbreak by imposing a sweeping lockdown in March and April, but case numbers have risen recently. A renewed lockdown was to take effect this week but was canceled after the explosion. The country has reported more than 5,400 coronavirus cases and 68 deaths since February.“There is no doubt that our immunity in the country is less than before the explosion and this will affect us medium- to long-term,” Abiad said. “We desperately need aid, not only us but all hospitals in Lebanon.”The explosion was the most powerful blast ever seen in the city, which has survived decades of war and conflict. Several city blocks were left littered with rubble, broken glass and damaged vehicles.Authorities have cordoned off the port itself, where the blast left a crater 200 meters (yards) across and shredded a large grain silo, emptying its contents into the rubble. Estimates suggested about 85% of the import-reliant country’s grain was stored there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-announces-fundraising-conference-for-lebanon/story-bJVBmdyWjP8wUFpK0y9y1H.html
06-08-2020||World||UK says 50 million face masks it bought might not be safe||The British government says it won’t be using 50 million face masks it bought during a scramble to secure protective equipment for medics during the coronavirus outbreak because of concerns they might not be safe.The admission sparked calls from the political opposition for an urgent inquiry into the way contracts for essential supplies were handed out.The masks were part of a 252-million-pound ($332 million) contract the government signed with investment firm Ayanda Capital in April. Papers filed in a court case reveal that the masks won’t be distributed because they have ear loops rather than head loops and may not fit tightly enough.The papers, published Thursday, are part of a lawsuit against the Conservative government by campaigning groups the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor. They want the courts to review contracts signed by the government for personal protective equipment, which they say were not properly scrutinized.As the coronavirus outbreak accelerated across the U.K. in March, it became clear that the country lacked enough masks, gloves, gowns and other protective gear for health care workers and nursing home staff. That sparked a race to buy billions of pieces of equipment from suppliers around the world.Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, said the government had signed three contracts worth more than 100 million pounds each “with respectively a pest control company, a confectioner and a family hedge fund.”“Each of those contracts has revealed real cause for alarm,” he said.The government said in its response to the lawsuit that the offer to supply the 50 million masks came from Andrew Mills, a businessman who is both an adviser to the government’s Board of Trade and to Ayanda Capital. Mills has denied there was any conflict of interest.The government says another 150 million masks of a different type supplied by Ayanda are still being tested.It said in a statement that “there is a robust process in place to ensure orders are of high quality and meet strict safety standards, with the necessary due diligence undertaken on all government contracts.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “very disappointed” that the shipment was unusable. But he said Britain had “achieved a colossal race against time” to obtain supplies of equipment and stockpile it in case of a second wave of coronavirus in the fall and winter.Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called for an urgent investigation into the way personal protective equipment was acquired.“It’s just not good enough to people who need that protective equipment that we find ourselves in this position,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-50-million-face-masks-it-bought-might-not-be-safe/story-tsUoNt5nG4DnGvTOOhz6WM.html
06-08-2020||World||US launches 5-pronged ‘Clean Network’ to curb Chinese tech access||The United States on Wednesday announced an expanded five-pronged “Clean Network” initiative to further reduce Chinese access to data on Americans. It would include removing “untrusted” Chinese apps such as TikTok and WeChat from American apps stores.“With parent companies based in China, apps like TikTok, WeChat, and others are significant threats to the personal data of American citizens, not to mention tools for CCP content censorship,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a news briefing.TikTok is in talks with Microsoft to sell its US operations at a reported price of $30 billion. As President Donald Trump announced earlier in the week, TikTok faces a ban in the US if the deal is not clinched by September 15.The top US diplomat went on to unveil an expanded version of the “Clean Path” initiative he had launched in April. It”s called the “Clean Network” and 30 countries have already signed on.Here are the five “lines” of the network: Clean Carrier, to keep out “untrusted” Chinese telecommunications companies connecting the US and foreign destinations; Clean Store, to remove “untrusted” Chinese apps from US apps stores; Clean Apps, to prevent Chinese companies such as Huawei from pre-installing or making available for download on their devices US apps; Clean Cloud, to keep Chinese cloud service providers from accessing data on Americans; and Clean Cable, to to ensure Chinese government cannot “compromise” information carried through undersea cables.On undersea cables, Secretary Pompeo cited Huawei, which, he said, “significantly underbids” rival companies on multiple procurements to connect Asia, the Pacific, Africa, and Europe “using Chinese state-backed underseas technology”.The secretary said the state department will be working closely with the department of commerce and other agencies to “limit the ability of Chinese cloud service providers to collect, to store, and to process vast amounts of data and sensitive information here in the United States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-launches-5-pronged-clean-network-to-curb-chinese-tech-access/story-RYjphziXoM8AgqvV8nnwtJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Donald Trump says coronavirus vaccine possible before November 3||US President Donald Trump said on Thursday it was possible the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine before the November 3 election, a more optimistic forecast than timing put forth by his own White House health experts.Asked on the Geraldo Rivera radio program when a vaccine might be ready, Trump said, “Sooner than the end of the year, could be much sooner.” “Sooner than November 3?” he was asked. “I think in some cases, yes possible before, but right around that time,” Trump said.Trump, who is seeking re-election to a second term amid a U.S. economy crippled by coronavirus shutdowns, has pushed for schools to reopen and things to get “back to normal” as coronavirus deaths in the country average more than 1,000 per day.Top government health officials have said corners would not be cut in the race to secure a vaccine against the virus.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. government infectious diseases official, offered a more conservative view in a Reuters interview on Wednesday, saying there might be an indication that at least one vaccine works and is safe by year end.Trump was upbeat on the U.S. economic recovery once a vaccine is available. “We’re going to have vaccines very soon, we’re gonna have therapeutics very soon,” he told the radio program.Asked if he believed China may have stolen a vaccine from the United States, Trump said, “I can’t say that with certainty, but it’s possible.”Chinese government-linked hackers targeted biotech company Moderna Inc, a U.S.-based coronavirus vaccine developer, this year in a bid to steal data, according to a U.S. security official tracking Chinese hacking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-coronavirus-vaccine-possible-before-november-3/story-O76IXKh8fBwaGjLx7K5aIO.html
06-08-2020||World||US congressional body expresses bipartisan ‘concern’ over Kashmir||The US House of Representatives committee that oversees foreign relations on Wednesday expressed bipartisan “concern” over the situation in Kashmir in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar by its top Democratic and Republican leaders, worded carefully so as to not sound a discordant note.“We note with concern that conditions in Jammu and Kashmir have not normalised one year after India’s repeal of Article 370 and the establishment of Jammu and Kashmir as a Union Territory,” Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Michael T McCaul, the top Republican called the ranking member, wrote in the letter.It was a rare instance of bipartisan criticism of the Kashmir changes. Democrats have condemned it before, and in many public forums such as congressional and semi-congressional hearings and on social media, headlined most prominently by Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, an Indian American. Republicans had been mostly supportive thus far through their silence, taking the lead from the Trump administration’s carefully calibrated response that it was an “internal matter” for India but it wanted the restrictions in place in the immediate aftermath be removed at the earliest.Cognizant perhaps of the significance of the bipartisan nature of their criticism, the two lawmakers sought to soft-land it by averring themselves as “champions” of the relationship, which they have been indeed over the years, and added they were “delighted” at the two countries’ “close cooperation on issues from defense to climate change”.They also offered full-throated support for India in its ongoing border tensions with China. “This closer relationship is all the more important as India faces aggression from China along your shared border, which is part of the Chinese government’s consistent pattern of unlawful and belligerent territorial aggression across the Indo-Pacific. The United States will remain steadfast in support of India’s efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”They also acknowledged “the ongoing serious security and counterterrorism concerns in the region”, in a barely veiled reference to threat emanating from across border in Pakistan.The House Foreign Relations Committee controls the state department’s budget, and uses that power to influence the country’s foreign relations. Its Senate counterpart — the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — wields similar influence through its power to confirm or reject the appointment of ambassadors and senior officials.Engel had joined the top Democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, Senator Bob Menendez, to call on India to protect the constitutional rights of “all it citizens” in reference to the Kashmir restrictions. “As the world’s largest democracy, India has an opportunity to demonstrate for all its citizens the importance of protecting and promoting equal rights, including freedom of assembly, access to information, and equal protections under the law,” they had said then in a joint statement. But it was not a bipartisan action like Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressional-body-expresses-bipartisan-concern-over-kashmir/story-H3h960tPLMThwDVC0tqgiL.html
06-08-2020||World||In big shift, Pope names 6 women to Vatican financial oversight body||Pope Francis has appointed six women, including the former treasurer for Britain’s Prince Charles, to the council that oversees Vatican finances, naming them in one fell swoop to some of the most senior roles.The appointments to one of the Holy See’s most important offices marked the latest attempt by the pope to keep promises to improve gender balance made years ago but which women’s groups have said were too slow in being realised.Francis has already appointed women as deputy foreign minister, director of the Vatican Museums, and deputy head of the Vatican Press Office, as well as four women as councillors to the Synod of Bishops, which prepares major meetings.Still, Thursday’s new appointments marked the largest number of women named at one time to Vatican posts.The previously all-male Council for the Economy consists of 15 posts. One cardinal is the coordinator and the 14 other posts are divided evenly among members of the clergy and lay people.The seven-member lay portion now consists of six women and one man. Of the six women, two each are from Britain, Spain and Germany. The sole male lay member is Italian.One of the Britons, Leslie Jane Ferrar, was treasurer to Prince Charles from 2015 to 2017 and now holds a number of non-executive and trustee roles, the Vatican said.The other, Ruth May Kelly, served as secretary of state for education and for transport, and as minister for women and equality, in Britain’s former Labour government from 2004-2008.The other four women have backgrounds in business, banking and academia.Francis established the Council for the Economy, which oversees budgets and sets policy, in 2014 as an international body to oversee often-troubled Vatican finances.The new council is starting its work as the coronavirus pandemic has hit the Vatican’s finances hard, forcing it to dip into reserve funds and implement some of the toughest cost control measures ever in the tiny city state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-big-shift-pope-names-6-women-to-vatican-financial-oversight-body/story-Xrrv87bs12tLD3o0aDdYHK.html

The bombing destroyed the city and killed 140,000 people, mostly civilians and including many children. The US dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on August 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression in Asia. Survivors, their relatives and other participants marked the 8:15 a.m. blast anniversary with the sound of a bell followed by a minute of silence.

For instance, it has long singled out telecom equipment provider Huawei, encouraging allies not to use its equipment in their high-speed 5G wireless networks and banning U.S. telecom companies from using government funds for equipment and services from Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecom equipment provider.Citing national security concerns, it has also barred Google from providing its Android apps such as Google Maps for Huawei phones. The Federal Communications Commission is considering barring operations of Chinese telecom companies China Telecom and China Unicom, which provide services in the U.S., due to national-security concerns.President Donald Trump has also threatened to ban TikTok, although the legal basis for such a move remains uncertain.“It’s a PR stunt. No specifics. It’s an objective,” George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson said by email.Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo said the U.S. government is trying to push its allies and companies to stop using Chinese gear and software “at all levels of their communications networks, from the internet backbone to app stores.” That includes calling for companies to yank their apps from Huawei’s app store, which advertises that it contains apps from European and U.S. companies like travel service Booking and Amazon.The legal authority for the administration to take action against apps and app stores is unclear, Triolo write in a research note. The State Department did not immediately a question seeking information about the legal authority the administration could use to justify such measures.The initiative is meant to force countries and companies to choose sides between the U.S. and China, Triolo said. He expects many companies and governments to resist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-talks-tougher-on-chinese-tech-but-offers-few-specifics/story-dAaekuR3bBv5WwxhqtnSFJ.html
06-08-2020||World||China firm to make 100 million doses of potential UK Covid-19 vaccine by 2020 end||Shenzhen Kangtai one of China’s top vaccine makers will produce 100 million doses of British pharma company AstraZeneca’s potential Covid-19 vaccine by the end of 2020, the two companies separately announced in China on Thursday.The vaccine deal is the first to cater to China, the most populous country in the world, the statements said.The potential coronavirus vaccine developed by the company with Oxford University has produced a promising immune response in a large, early-stage human trial, medical journal The Lancet said in a report in July.AstraZeneca’s China arm on Thursday announced the deal on the social media app WeChat, saying it has signed an “…exclusive authorisation cooperation framework agreement with Kangtai Biology in the Chinese mainland market to actively promote the development, production, supply and commercialisation of the adenovirus vector vaccine AZDI222 through technology transfer”.The Chinese company posted a statement on the deal on the website of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.As part of the technology transfer deal, the Chinese company will ensure the annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses of the new coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020.The deal adds that the “…vaccine design capacity will be expanded to at least 200 million doses by the end of 2021 to meet the needs of the Chinese market”.The two companies will also explore the possibility of cooperation on the vaccine candidate in other markets, AstraZeneca said.In May, the British company and the University of Oxford partnered to develop and produce the potential new vaccine for Covid-19, which has triggered the worst pandemic in decades.The experimental Covid-19 vaccine is probably the world’s leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development, the World Health Organisation’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan had said in late June.“Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate,” Swaminathan had said, adding:“So it’s possible they will have results quite early.”The company has signed manufacturing deals globally to meet its target of making 2 billion doses of the vaccine, the Reuters said in a report Thursday.The British company, according to Bloomberg, has struck deals to supply hundreds of millions of doses of the experimental vaccine for the UK, US and Europe.Shenzhen Kangtai is one of China’s biggest vaccine makers, with shots against diseases such as pneumonia and measles. Many of its products employ more sophisticated techniques, including genetic engineering. It’s also a major supplier of hepatitis B vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-firm-to-make-100-million-doses-of-potential-uk-covid-19-vaccine-by-2020-end/story-KF2XVs1QpZX7oewCQGveeI.html

North Darfur, White Nile, Sennar and Kassala states are the latest to report storms and flooding, the report said.In North Darfur, at least 600 internally displaced people are “in dire need” of shelter and food after a flash flood hit the camp where they lived in the Al Lait area.“The Sudan Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rains are expected during August and September in most of the country, which can lead to further flooding and displacement,” said UNOCHA.Last week, heavy rains caused the collapse of the Bout Dam in Blue Nile province, destroyed 1,200 houses and left at least five people dead across the country.The Sudanese government and humanitarian agencies are monitoring the situation and providing assistance to those affected, said UNOCHA.Last year, flooding killed a total of 78 people in 16 Sudanese provinces, between July and August, according to the U.N.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-tens-of-thousands-affected-by-floods-in-sudan/story-vDvUdWVTvPqvuyimawPw1M.html
06-08-2020||World||Seeking refuge in US, children fleeing danger are expelled||When officers led them out of a detention facility near the US-Mexico border and onto a bus last month, the 12-year-old from Honduras and his 9-year-old sister believed they were going to a shelter so they could be reunited with their mother in the Midwest.They had been told to sign a paper they thought would tell the shelter they didn’t have the coronavirus, the boy said. The form was in English, a language he and his sister don’t speak. The only thing he recognized was the letters “Covid.”Instead, the bus drove five hours to an airport where the children were told to board a plane.“They lied to us,” he said. “They didn’t tell us we were going back to Honduras.”More than 2,000 unaccompanied children have been expelled since March under an emergency declaration enacted by the Trump administration, which has cited the coronavirus in refusing to provide them protections under federal anti-trafficking and asylum laws. Lawyers and advocates have sharply criticized the administration for using the global pandemic as a pretext to deport children to places of danger.No U.S. agents looked at the video the boy had saved on his cellphone showing a hooded man holding a rifle, saying his name, and threatening to kill him and his sister, weeks after the uncle caring for them was shot dead in June. And even though they were expelled under an emergency declaration citing the virus, they were never tested for COVID-19, the boy said.Three weeks after their uncle was killed, the children fled Honduras, crossing the U.S.-Mexico border alone. Under the normal process set out by U.S. law, they would have been referred to a government facility for youth and eventually placed with their mother. Instead, they were expelled on July 24 after three days in U.S. detention and now live in Honduras with another uncle who is looking to leave the country himself.U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined multiple requests for comment on the boy’s story, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also declined, saying the children had been in Border Patrol custody until they boarded a deportation flight operated by ICE.Spokesmen for both agencies have refused to answer most questions about how they treat roughly 70,000 adults and children expelled under the emergency declaration issued in March. They have refused to say how they decide whether to expel children or where to detain them before expulsion, including in hotels where at least 150 unaccompanied children as young as 1 year old have been held.Much of what’s known about expulsions has come from the accounts of children like the 12-year-old boy, who recounted his experience to The Associated Press last week with a recall of details that makes him seem older.The AP is not identifying the boy, his sister, their mother or where their mother lives in the U.S. because of fears the children are still targeted by the people who killed their uncle.Dr. Amy Cohen, executive director of the advocacy group Every Last One, interviewed the boy several times and said she found him credible based on her conversations with hundreds of other immigrant children.“When he has an opportunity to exaggerate or embroider his story, he absolutely does not,” Cohen said. “And he is consistent with everyone he has talked to. There’s no sense that the story is rehearsed.”Six children have died since 2018 after being detained by the Border Patrol, several in conditions that raised questions about how the agency treats children. The agency says it has instituted new medical checks and takes anyone determined to need additional care to a hospital.In court, meanwhile, the Trump administration has argued children it is seeking to expel are not entitled to protections under the Flores settlement, a 2-decade-old court agreement that sets standards for the detention of immigrant children.The children’s uncle took them in three years ago after their mother fled with their older sister due to gang threats, according to the family.It’s not clear who killed the uncle. But the boy said he remembers family members deciding not to have his uncle taken to the hospital because they feared they wouldn’t be able to afford to get his body out of the morgue.The killing frightened the family. According to the boy, he was left alone in his uncle’s home with his sister to fend for themselves. The boy said he cooked meals for them with the beans and eggs left in the house.Then, one day, he said, a man approached him outside the house, asked to see his phone and gave it back with a video saved on it. In the video, a masked man said the siblings’ names and warned: “You either join us and start working with us,” or end up like your uncle. The same day, someone left a note outside their home threatening them, he said.“It reminded me of my uncle’s death,” he said. “I felt a lot of fear.”They joined a large group of migrants leaving Honduras in hopes of reaching the U.S, he said. After the group split up in Guatemala, a man took him and his sister through Mexico and to the border.Parts of the story are impossible to verify. Experts say MS-13 and other gangs often deliver death threats verbally, and migrant groups and routes through Mexico and Central America are known to be controlled by human smugglers who charge thousands of dollars per person. The boy’s mother says she doesn’t believe her son or any other relative paid a smuggler.The siblings crossed the border around July 21 and were apprehended by Border Patrol agents, the boy said. Based on his description, it appears he and his sister were detained at the Border Patrol’s central processing center in McAllen, Texas, where children and adults are separated into large cages of chain-link fencing. Opened during the administration of former President Barack Obama, the same processing center was used two years ago to detain hundreds of parents and children separated by the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy.The boy said he was held in a cage with about 20 other boys his age and older. He was separated from his sister but could see her from a distance in another enclosure.Once a day, someone took their temperatures, but the boy says he was never given a medical exam or a test to see if he had the virus. He said he wore a mask he brought with him from Honduras.He was able to call his mother from custody once before he and his sister were expelled. The phone call she received was from a number in McAllen, Texas.The next call the mother received was from an official in Honduras, a few days later, asking her to send a relative to pick her kids up from a shelter for deported children. That was how she learned they had been expelled, she said.She sat recently in the trailer where she lives with family, including her elder daughter, now 16.“I wanted something to be done and to be able to be calm, to know that my children are safe with me,” she said, crying. “No part of Honduras is safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seeking-refuge-in-us-children-fleeing-danger-are-expelled/story-vPRand38RzpyNqlaA2S7sJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Two kids caught in Indian, British citizenship legal row||Two children of Indian parents --- aged 9 and 11 --- are the focus of legal action in the high court of England and Wales, with the local authority in Birmingham keen to apply for British citizenship on their behalf, and the parents opposed to the change of citizenship.The high court on Thursday ruled that the local authority did not have the power to apply for British citizenship on the children’s behalf in the face of parental opposition and where that may lead to a loss of their existing citizenship, without first obtaining the court’s approval.The parents and children have not been named in court documents, which state that the children are Indian citizens, born in the UK after their parents arrived here in 2004. They failed to get permanent residency. The mother moved to Singapore in 2015, while the father remains in England.Prominent lawyer Harish Salve represented the father of the children, while a legally qualified Delhi-based individual named as ‘Rao’ in the judgement represented their Singapore-based mother. Both parents opposed the idea of British citizenship for the children.The judgement said: “In August 2015, for reasons which it is not now necessary to describe, the children were removed from their parents and placed in a foster home where they have lived ever since. Contact with the parents has not taken place since that time”.“The mother left the UK in November 2015 while pregnant and now lives in Singapore. The father has remained in England, but his antagonism towards the local authority has made contact unachievable. In the course of a complex set of proceedings, the children became the subject of placement orders”, it added.Birmingham local authorities, who have been caring for the children since 2015, were keen to apply for British citizenship to regularise their immigration status. The Indian high commission was involved in the proceedings through a solicitor and an official attending some of the hearings. The mother emphasised nationality as being fundamental to a person’s life, and of an importance that is on a par with serious medical treatment. Deprivation of Indian citizenship has consequences for succession and for the children’s ability to own land, she contended.The local authority’s lawyer contended that a decision about a change of citizenship was not one of such magnitude that it had to be put before the court, comparing the decision “to routine vaccination and not to serious medical treatment”.But Justice Peter Jackson ruled: “The characterisation of a change of citizenship as akin to routine vaccination is misplaced. Changing a child’s citizenship is a momentous step with profound and enduring consequences that requires the most careful consideration”.The court asked the local authority to indicate whether it wished to progress the matter, in which case the judgement said the court will give appropriate directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-kids-caught-in-indian-british-citizenship-legal-row/story-DboNTxs88wDJoPfQYrvzxM.html
06-08-2020||World||In Beirut, Macron says Lebanese leaders need to hear ‘home truths’||President Emmanuel Macron offered France’s support for the Lebanese people on Thursday on a visit to Beirut following a huge warehouse blast, but said crisis-hit Lebanon would “continue to sink” unless its leaders carry out reforms.Macron was the first foreign leader to visit the Lebanese capital since the explosion on Tuesday that killed at least 145 people.France has long sought to support its former colony and has sent emergency aid since the blast, but is worried about endemic corruption and has pressed for reforms as a financial crisis deepened in the Middle East country.After landing in Beirut, Macron said France’s solidarity with the Lebanese people was unconditional, but said he wanted to tell some “home truths” to political figures. “Beyond the blast, we know the crisis here is serious, it involves the historic responsibility of leaders in place,” Macron told reporters.“We can’t do without telling each other some home truths,” he added. “If reforms are not carried out, Lebanon will continue to sink.” He mentioned reforms of the energy sector, public tenders and the fight against corruption. Lebanese officials have blamed the disaster on a huge stockpile of a highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at Beirut port.But many Lebanese people who have lost jobs and watched savings evaporate in a financial meltdown have blamed it on politicians who have benefited from decades of state corruption and bad governance. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for “concrete action” during a visit to Beirut last month and said protesters’ calls for change and transparency had “unfortunately not been heard so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-beirut-macron-says-lebanese-leaders-need-to-hear-home-truths/story-9UA6rvjySjvaDVtieqm7dK.html
06-08-2020||World||Chinese court sentences Canadian to death for making drugs||A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced a Canadian citizen to death for producing drugs, the third Canadian to be given the capital punishment since Ottawa detained a top executive of the Chinese company, Huawei, in 2018. The Canadian identified as Xu Weihong was sentenced to death for manufacturing ketamine, a tranquilising drug for humans and animals, on Thursday at a first trial in the southern city of Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Intermediate Court said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday that drug crimes were very serious and everyone was equal before the law.“China’s relevant authorities handled the case independently according to law. I don’t think it should have any effect on China-Canada relations,” Wang said when asked to share details about the case.A Chinese national, Wen Guanxiong, was also charged with making drugs in the same case; he was jailed for life.The latest conviction of a Canadian comes at a time when ties between China and Canada are strained over the case of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in the Canadian city of Vancouver in late 2018, on a warrant from the US.Beijing has said that the US and Canada have abused their bilateral extradition treaty to arbitrarily take compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without cause.“This is a serious political incident that grossly violates the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese citizen,” the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier.In January 2019, a Canadian citizen Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was given the death sentence in the north-eastern city of Dalian after the judge had changed his original 15-year jail sentence.Schellenberg, then 36, was detained in 2014 on suspicion of smuggling crystal meth from China to Australia.Three months later, in April 2019, Fan Wei, another Canadian was sentenced to death in the southern city of Jiangmen.Beijing has also formally charged two Canadians, ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, with spying since the diplomatic hostilities began.China has denied that their arrest is linked to Meng’s case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-sentences-canadian-to-death-for-making-drugs/story-V4WR8fyUfBDNxFJfanP2FJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Iraq to list hazardous materials after Beirut explosion||Iraq announced Thursday it will create an inventory of all hazardous materials at ports and airports after the ignition of ammonium nitrate fertiliser at a portside warehouse levelled swathes of Beirut.An emergency committee chaired by the head of Iraq’s border agency said it had been tasked with carrying out the work and had given itself 72 hours to complete it. The goal was to “avoid any repetition of what happened in Lebanon” in Iraq, the panel said.The huge blast that caused widespread destruction across the Lebanese capital on Tuesday was triggered by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser that had been stored in the city’s port for years.A security official said on condition of anonymity the ammonium nitrate had arrived in Lebanon in 2013 on board a Moldovan-flagged ship sailing from Georgia and bound for Mozambique.Port authorities unloaded the ammonium nitrate and stored it in a rundown warehouse with cracks in its walls, several security officials said.Security forces launched an investigation in 2019 after the warehouse reportedly started to exude a strange odour, and concluded that the “dangerous” chemicals should be removed, but no action was taken.The revelations have sparked fury in Lebanon that so much ammonium nitrate could be stored for so long in the heart of the capital.The standing of Lebanon’s political class was already close to rock bottom after months of mass protests against mismanagement of the deeply indebted economy, before social distancing related to the coronavirus pandemic brought some breathing space for the establishment.Iraq too has seen mass protests over the past year against a political system based on confessional quotas that is seen as corrupt and incompetent.The searing summer heat in Iraq makes it even more vulnerable to the danger of accidental explosions of poorly stored hazardous materials.The accidental ignition of munitions stocked in residential areas has caused deadly explosions in Iraq in the past, although such incidents have largely been put down to the costs of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-to-list-hazardous-materials-after-beirut-explosion/story-XztyO3NmDiuN0OLAG2tqdO.html
06-08-2020||World||Beijing warns of ‘measures’ If US denies Chinese media visas||China repeated that it would take measures if Washington didn’t renew visas for Chinese journalists working in the U.S., amid questions over whether it will make a tit-for-tat move against American reporters in Hong Kong.“We learned that relevant Chinese journalists applied for visa extensions but none of them have received a clear reply from the U.S. side,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday, echoing comments he made earlier this week. “If the U.S. is bent on going down the wrong path, China will take necessary and legitimate measures to defend its interests.”Speculation over the future visa status of U.S. journalists working in Hong Kong mounted this week following online posts by Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin that a number of Chinese journalists would see their visas expire on Aug. 6, and “none of them” had yet been renewed.“From what I know, given that the US side hasn’t renewed visa of Chinese journalists, Chinese side has prepared for the worst scenario that all Chinese journalists have to leave the US,” Hu wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “If that’s the case, Chinese side will retaliate, including targeting US journalists based in HK.”The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong said Thursday that it “opposes using journalists’ visas as a weapon in international disputes.”The club “is aware of recent examples of delays involving the issuing of visas to foreign journalists in Hong Kong, as well as suggestions by the Chinese government that more foreign journalists could face repercussions in response to U.S. actions,” it said in a statement.“The FCC calls on the Trump administration to lift its restrictions on Chinese media working in the U.S., and on Hong Kong and China’s governments to refrain from retribution in targeting U.S. media and journalists working in Hong Kong,” it said.Hong Kong’s ability to determine its own immigration policy has been undermined in recent years, and any squeezing of journalists in the financial hub could fuel a broader escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China.“We said many times that the U.S. caused the current situation and is responsible for it,” said Wang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. “The U.S. should immediately correct its mistakes and stop its political oppression against Chinese journalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-warns-of-measures-if-us-denies-chinese-media-visas/story-xMLeaD3PxmUQILaqzqwEQO.html
06-08-2020||World||Germany mandates tests for some arrivals as Covid-19 cases increase||Germany will require people arriving from countries considered high-risk to take coronavirus tests starting this weekend, the health minister said Thursday, as the country recorded its highest daily tally of new infections in three months.German officials have voiced alarm over a steady upward creep in the number of new infections over recent weeks. The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said 1,045 cases were recorded on Wednesday — the first time since May 7 that it has counted more than 1,000 cases in a day.Daily figures can be volatile or distorted by delays in reporting, and the number is still far short of the peak of more than 6,000 reached in early April.“What we are seeing is a lot of small outbreaks,” Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters. “People are getting infected at family parties, at their place of work or at community facilities.”On top of that, school holidays — the dates of which are staggered across Germany’s 16 states — are ending in some regions, increasing concerns that vacationers could bring home the virus.Last Saturday, the government started offering free tests for people returning to the country.People entering from countries deemed high-risk — currently most of the world outside Europe, as well as Luxembourg and parts of northern Spain — are required to quarantine for 14 days unless they can present a negative test result no more than two days old.Spahn said that, starting Saturday, people arriving from those countries will be required to take a test unless they bring a new test result with them.“I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,” Spahn said.The minister dismissed arguments by some politicians that people who can afford a vacation should also have to pay for their tests.He said many returnees from high-risk and other countries “have saved hard for this vacation, put a lot of money aside, don’t have a lot in reserve — and nevertheless, I want to make it possible for them to get tested.”Germany’s Covid-19 response has been widely regarded as relatively successful. The Robert Koch Institute has recorded 9,175 deaths from over 213,000 confirmed cases -- a lower death rate than in many comparable countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-mandates-tests-for-some-arrivals-as-covid-19-cases-increase/story-JATOpLz6WMYSOwPOjaXjzH.html
06-08-2020||World||China threatens countermeasures as Taiwan prepares for US visit||China on Thursday threatened to take countermeasures over a trip to Taiwan by US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, as the Chinese-claimed island geared up for its highest-level U.S. official visit in four decades.The visit, which begins on Sunday, adds to tensions between Beijing and Washington over everything from trade and human rights to the novel coronavirus pandemic. China calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its bilateral ties with the United States.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing that any attempt to deny or challenge the “one China” principle, which states that Taiwan is part of China, would end in failure.“China will take strong countermeasures in response to the U.S. behaviour,” Wang said, referring to Azar’s visit.While he gave no details, China last month said it would impose sanctions on Lockheed Martin for involvement in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.Taiwan has batted away China’s criticism, saying Beijing has no right to comment.Washington broke off official ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing. The Trump administration has made strengthening its support for the democratic island a priority, and boosted arms sales.Azar, who is scheduled to meet President Tsai Ing-wen, is coming to strengthen economic and public health cooperation with Taiwan, and support Taiwan’s international role in fighting the pandemic.Taiwan is locked out of most global agencies, such as the World Health Organization, due to the objections of China, which views the island as a Chinese province that is not entitled to any of the rights that statehood confers.Taiwan Centres for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said Azar and members of the U.S. delegation would be tested for coronavirus before leaving for Taiwan, and again upon entry at the airport.Only if they are negative will they be allowed in.“They must wear masks at all times,” Chuang said.“There are rules on where they can go,” he added, saying that Taiwan’s often-crowded night markets would not be on the list for private visits.The members of the U.S. delegation will also have to maintain social distancing when meeting government officials, Chuang said, adding they would use dedicated elevators “to avoid any risks”.Taiwan has won praise for its steps to control the coronavirus, including strict border quarantine controls and the widespread wearing of masks, which have won broad public support.It has reported 477 cases of the coronavirus and seven deaths. Most cases have been imported, and only a small number of people remain in hospital or isolation.The United States has had more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country, and the wearing of masks has become a heated political issue, with some people objecting to what they see as an infringement of personal freedom.

TikTok’s “Trust and Safety Hub”, set up in Dublin in January, deals with regulators and governments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.It also moved its privacy oversight of European users to Ireland in June and TikTok said its Irish and UK entities will take over from its U.S. business in managing and safeguarding the personal data of its European users.“TikTok’s decision to establish its first European data centre in Ireland is very welcome and positions Ireland as an important location in the company’s global operations,” Martin Shanahan, head of the Irish state agency charged with attracting foreign investment, said in a statement.($1 = 0.8420 euros)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-to-open-first-european-data-centre-in-ireland/story-JY15rYB05gG6wJpsE0dA5L.html
06-08-2020||World||French President Macron arrives in Beirut to show support after blast||French President Emmanuel Macron has arrived in Beirut to express support for Lebanon in the wake of a massive explosion that tore through the capital earlier this week. France and other countries have send emergency aid and search-and-rescue teams. But Lebanon, which was already reeling from a severe economic crisis, will need substantial international support to rebuild. The blast killed at least 135 people, wounded thousands, and obliterated Beirut’s port.Lebanese army bulldozers plowed through wreckage to reopen roads around Beirut’s demolished port Thursday, a day after the government pledged to investigate this week’s devastating explosion and placed port officials under house arrest.The blast Tuesday, which appeared to have been caused by an accidental fire that ignited a stockpile of ammonium nitrate at the port, rippled across the Lebanese capital, killing at least 135 people, injuring more than 5,000 and causing widespread destruction.It also may have accelerated the country’s coronavirus outbreak, as thousands flooded into hospitals in the wake of the blast. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to move in with relatives and friends after their homes were damaged, further raising the risks of exposure.French President Emmanuel Macron was expected to visit later Thursday amid pledges of international aid. But Lebanon, which was already mired in a severe economic crisis, faces a daunting challenge in rebuilding. It’s unclear how much support the international community will offer the notoriously corrupt and dysfunctional government.Losses from the blast are estimated to be between $10 billion to $15 billion, Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud told the Saudi-owned TV station Al-Hadath on Wednesday, adding that nearly 300,000 people are homeless.The tiny Mediterranean country was already on the brink of collapse, with soaring unemployment and a financial crisis that has wiped out people’s life savings. Hospitals were already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, and one was so badly damaged by the blast it had to treat patients in a nearby field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-arrives-in-lebanon-s-beirut-to-show-support-after-blast/story-1Y8A2atFI1sAnvqOv2uOpJ.html

The findings by scientists, including those from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US, show that the vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, induced neutralising antibodies in mice when given as two intramuscular injections of a 1-microgramme (mcg) dose three weeks apart.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  Additional experiments found that mice given two injections of the 1-mcg dose and later challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus either five or 13 weeks after the second injection were protected from viral replication in the lungs and nose, the researchers said. Mice challenged seven weeks after only a single dose of 1 mcg or 10 mcg of mRNA-1273 were also protected against viral replication in the lung, they said. NIAID Vaccine Research Center (VRC) scientists worked with investigators from the University of Texas at Austin to identify the atomic structure of the spike protein on the surface of the novel coronavirus. This structure was used by Moderna in the development of the vaccine candidate, according to the researchers. The latest study found that the investigational vaccine also induced robust CD8 T-cell responses in mice. It did not induce the type of cellular immune response that has been linked to vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), according to the researchers.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  This rare, allergic-type inflammation was seen in individuals vaccinated with a whole-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in the 1960s, they said. The researchers explained that VAERD can occur when a vaccine induces an immune response that is not strong enough to protect against infection. They vaccinated mice with sub-protective doses of mRNA-1273 and then challenged the mice with SARS-CoV-2. The mice showed no evidence of enhanced lung pathology or excessive mucus production, indicating the vaccine did not cause enhanced disease, the researchers found. The team noted that the data from these studies, combined with data from studies in nonhuman primates and Phase-1 clinical testing, support the evaluation of mRNA-1273 in clinical efficacy trials. The researchers also explained how their prior research on a candidate MERS-CoV vaccine paved the way for a rapid response to the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-candidate-protects-mice-from-covid-19-finds-study/story-iPyd0Ke9vAAQFgAkdFsxtO.html

He said Macron will host a summit of the EU’s seven Mediterranean nations on Sept. 10 to discuss developments in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyprus-france-to-boost-defense-ties-under-cooperation-deal/story-rJXWZQLJ1PmfEfLHffMApL.html
06-08-2020||World||France’s Macron heads to Lebanon after deadly mega-blast||French President Emmanuel Macron was expected in Lebanon Thursday, two days after a monster blast sowed unfathomable destruction in Beirut and brought Paris’s Middle East protege to its knees.The highest-ranking foreign official to visit the country since Tuesday’s tragedy, Macron will visit the site of the blast that obliterated part of Beirut port and ripped through entire neighbourhoods of the city.Two days on, Lebanon was still reeling from a blast so huge it was felt in neighbouring countries, its mushroom-shaped cloud drawing comparisons with Hiroshima and the devastation caused by its shockwave with the scene of an earthquake.The provisional death toll stood at 137 but with dozens missing and 5,000 wounded, the number of victims was expected to rise as rescue workers continued to comb through the rubble.According to several officials, the explosion was caused by a fire igniting 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser stored in a portside warehouse.“Apocalypse”, “Armageddon” -- Lebanese were lost for words to describe the impact of the blast, which dwarfed anything the country had ever experienced despite its violence-plagued history.The Beirut governor estimated up to 300,000 people may have been made temporarily homeless by the destruction, which he said would cost the debt-ridden country in excess of three billion dollars.International probeEven as they counted their dead and cleaned up the streets, many Lebanese were boiling with anger over a blast they see as the most shocking expression yet of their leadership’s incompetence and corruption.“We can’t bear more than this. This is it. The whole system has got to go,” said 30-year-old Mohammad Suyur as he picked up broken glass in Mar Mikhail, one of the most affected districts in Beirut.Many questions were being asked as to how such a huge cargo of highly explosive material could have been left unsecured in Beirut for years.Prime Minister Hassan Diab and President Michel Aoun promised to put the culprits behind bars but trust in institutions is low and few on the streets of the Lebanese capital held out any hope of an impartial inquiry.Human Rights Watch on Thursday supported mounting calls for an international probe as the only credible option.“An independent investigation with international experts is the best guarantee that victims of the explosion will get the justice they deserve,” the watchdog said.In France, prosecutors on Wednesday opened a probe into the blast over injuries inflicted to 21 French citizens.Paris spearheaded international mobilisation in support of Lebanon, which will mark its centenary next month but has looked like a country on its last legs since defaulting on its debt earlier this year.Flights carrying medical aid, field hospitals, rescue experts and tracking dogs have been flying in since Wednesday to Beirut airport, which sustained no serious damage from the explosion.Political backlashBesides the international emergency effort, the aftermath of the terrible explosion yielded countless uplifting examples of spontaneous solidarity.Much of the cleanup was being handled by volunteers who improvised working groups, bringing their own equipment and making appeals for help on social media.“We’re sending people into the damaged homes of the elderly and handicapped to help them find a home for tonight,” said Husam Abu Nasr, a 30-year-old volunteer.“We don’t have a state to take these steps, so we took matters into our own hands,” he said.Business owners swiftly took to social media, posting offers to repair doors, paint damaged walls or replace shattered windows for free.An unprecedented nationwide and cross-sectarian protest movement that erupted on October 17 last year had looked for a moment like it could topple what it considers a hereditary kleptocracy.The euphoria faded as change failed to materialise and the combination of economic hardship and the coronavirus pandemic left the revolution in tatters.The revulsion at Tuesday’s tragedy and its implications could rekindle the flame however and activists’ social media accounts were rife with calls for a new push to remove Lebanon’s widely reviled political leaders.“Lebanon’s political class should be on guard in the weeks ahead,” Faysal Itani, a deputy director at the Center for Global Policy, wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times.“Shock will inevitably turn to anger.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-s-macron-heads-to-lebanon-after-deadly-mega-blast/story-kK2J142TkGJHvVGoFXMbVO.html

06-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un directs aid to North Korean town under virus lockdown||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un directed his government agencies to act immediately to stabilise the livelihoods of residents in a city locked down over coronavirus concerns, state media reported Thursday.North Korea declared an emergency and locked down Kaesong near the inter-Korean border in late July after finding a suspected virus case there. It hasn’t confirmed yet if the person tested positive and still says the country hasn’t had a single case of Covid-19, a claim questioned by outside experts.Kim presided over a meeting Wednesday of the ruling Workers’ Party’s executive policy council where they discussed a special supply of food and funds to Kaesong, the Korean Central News Agency said. The report didn’t specify the measures that were to be taken. North Korea has said the suspected virus patient is a runaway who had fled to South Korea three years ago before slipping back to Kaesong last month. Some experts speculate North Korea is aiming to hold South Korea responsible for a potential virus spread in the North or try to save its face before winning aid items from the South.Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with symptoms. But the Kaesong lockdown is the first such known measure taken in a North Korean city to stem the pandemic.Foreign experts say a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea could cause dire consequences because of its fragile public health care infrastructure and chronic lack of medical supplies. They are also skeptical about North Korea’s claim of having had no infections because the country shares a long, porous border with China, its biggest trading partner, where the pandemic emerged last year.Kaesong, a city with an estimated population of 200,000, is just north of the heavily fortified land border with South Korea. It once hosted the Koreas’ jointly run industrial complex, which has been shut since 2016 amid nuclear tensions, and an inter-Korean liaison office North Korea demolished earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-directs-aid-to-north-korean-town-under-virus-lockdown/story-OnM2rW4LABMObTAwxJ73VJ.html

If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris.”This is being described as an unusual move by observers as the OIC is led by Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Pakistan.Also read: Turkey’s tentacles in India go deeper than thought, says new intel warningIn the TV programme, Qureshi said that if the OIC fails to summon the CFM meeting, Pakistan would be ready to go for a session outside the OIC. In response to another question, he said Pakistan could not wait any further.Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the 57-member bloc of Muslim countries, which is the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN.Qureshi said Pakistan skipped the Kuala Lumpur Summit last December on a Saudi Arabia’s request and now Pakistani Muslims are demanding Riyadh to “show leadership on the issue”.Also read: India pans China after UNSC rebuffs bid to raise Kashmir“We have our own sensitivities.

Later, 23 people were found to have been infected in East China’s Anhui province, state-run Global Times quoted media reports.A woman from Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu, who suffered from the virus showed onset of symptoms such as fever, coughing. Doctors found a decline of leukocyte, blood platelet inside of her body.After a month of treatment, she was discharged from the hospital.At least seven people have died in Anhui and East China’s Zhejiang province due to the virus, the report said.SFTS Virus is not a new virus. China has isolated pathogen of the virus in 2011, and it belongs to the Bunyavirus category.Virologists believe that the infection may have been passed on to humans by ticks and that the virus can be transmitted between humans, it said.Sheng Jifang, a doctor from the first affiliated hospital under Zhejiang University, said that the possibility of human-to-human transmission could not be excluded; patients can pass the virus to others via blood or mucous.Doctors warned that tick bite is the major transmission route, as long as people remain cautious, there’s no need to over panic over such virus contagion, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-dead-60-infected-by-new-infectious-disease-in-china-report/story-ufWdNIYT6FGMDKf1TQMEoM.html
06-08-2020||World||N. Korea’s escalating virus response raises fear of outbreak||North Korea is quarantining thousands of people and shipping food and other aid to a southern city locked down over coronavirus worries, officials said, as the country’s response to a suspected case reinforces doubt about its longstanding claim to be virus-free.But amid the outside skepticism and a stream of North Korean propaganda glorifying its virus efforts, an exchange between Pyongyang and the United Nations is providing new clarity — and actual numbers — about what might be happening in the North, which has closed its borders and cut travel — never a free-flowing stream — by outsider monitors and journalists.In late July, North Korea said it had imposed its “maximum emergency system” to guard against the virus spreading after finding a person with Covid-19 symptoms in Kaesong city, near the border with rival South Korea.State media reported that leader Kim Jong Un then ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong, and said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to South Korea before slipping back into Kaesong last month.North Korea’s public admission of its first potential case and the emergency steps it took prompted immediate outside speculation that Pyongyang may be worried about a big outbreak after months of steadfastly claiming it had no cases. Foreign experts are highly skeptical over the North’s assertion of no cases, in large part because of its long, porous border with China, where the virus emerged, and its history of hiding past disease outbreaks.In a report to the World Health Organization obtained by The Associated Press, North Korea said it has quarantined 64 first contacts of the suspected Keasong case and 3,571 secondary contacts in state-run facilities for 40 days, according to Dr. Edwin Salvador, WHO representative to North Korea.Salvador said in an email to AP that North Korea also informed WHO of the suspected first case, saying that person was tested for Covid-19 but the test results were inconclusive. Salvador said the WHO has requested that North Korea share more information about the person.Salvador said all North Korea’s international borders remain closed, group gatherings are banned, masks are required in public, and all educational institutions, including preschools, are on an extended summer break. Since the end of December, Salvador said North Korea has quarantined and released 25,905 people, 382 of them foreigners.Many outside observers are all but certain the virus already entered North Korea because it closed the border with China, its biggest trading partner, cme weeks after the world’s first known virus cases were recorded in China in December. Monitoring groups in Seoul have steadfastly reported about North Korean virus cases and deaths.A major coronavirus outbreak may cause a humanitarian disaster because of North Korea’s broken public health care system and lack of medical supplies.But it’s unclear how serious the North’s current situation is.“Though a really extensive local outbreak might not have occurred yet, it’s likely that a considerable number of people has been infected,” said analyst Hong Min at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. “Even though North Korea locks itself down, there should be suspected cases there and authorities must aggressively diagnose them. But North Korea has never been transparent about whether it has such a capacity and the will to do so.”The North’s state media have recently churned out articles thick with rallying propaganda that describe the latest anti-virus work as “an all-people’s campaign” that demonstrates the Kim government’s resolve to protect public safety “at any cost.” The articles also say that any individual carelessness or breach of anti-virus guidelines may lead to “critical consequences.”State media said North Korea has deployed more health workers, sanitized personnel and goods, and used loudspeakers to raise public awareness of the virus. The Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that 550,000 aid items have been sent to Kaesong.North Korea’s claimed emergency steps suggest that an outbreak there may have worsened, Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul, said. The North may also aim to win aid from South Korea or others, but wants to save face by saying its suspected Kaesong case is someone who had been in South Korea, he said.Before returning to North Korea, the suspected first case, identified in South Korea as a 24-year-old surnamed Kim, hadn’t tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any patient, South Korean health official Yoon Taeho said.The motive for his return to North Korea isn’t known. More than 33,000 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea over the past 22 years for political and economic reasons, but only a handful of them have returned to North Korea.Police said the man was questioned in June on an allegation that he had sexually assaulted a fellow female North Korean refugee. The man denied the accusation. Last month, the national forensic service told police it found DNA evidence of the assault, and police were continuing to investigate, according to the Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-s-escalating-virus-response-raises-fear-of-outbreak/story-2Xy0go0PtFowALwRgnSotL.html
06-08-2020||World||Human trials of coronavirus vaccine set to begin in Indonesia||Human trials on a potential coronavirus vaccine are due to start in Indonesia next week as part of a collaboration between state-owned pharmaceutical company Bio Farma and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd, a senior researcher said.The launch of the vaccine trial comes as Indonesia has struggled to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, with a consistently escalating number of cases. The phase 3 clinical trial is set to begin on Aug. 11 and will involve 1,620 volunteers aged between 18 and 59, Professor Kusnandi Rusmil, head researcher at Bandung’s Padjadjaran University, told reporters. Half of the participants will receive the vaccine over a six-month period, while the rest will receive a placebo, he said, noting 800 volunteers had been signed up so far. “We want to have our vaccines so we can use it for our people,” Rusmil told reporters. As of Wednesday, Indonesia had recorded 116,871 coronavirus infections and 5,432 deaths - the highest in East Asia. The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a global race for a vaccine, with more than 100 in development and about a dozen already being tested on humans. As Indonesia seeks to stem an ongoing wave of infections, the government has been vocal about the need to secure sufficient supplies of a vaccine amid concerns some nations may miss out.Erick Thohir, Indonesia’s minister for state-owned enterprises, sought to reassure the public this week, saying that Bio Farma would be ready by year-end to produce 250 million doses a year should the Sinovac vaccine prove successful. [L4N2F635B] The Sinovac trial is one of several collaborations to produce a vaccine underway in the world’s fourth-most populous nation.

06-08-2020||World||US sends first shipment of crude to Saudi Arabia in over a decade||The United States sent a shipment of crude to Saudi Arabia in June, data from the US Census Bureau showed on Wednesday, in what appears to be the first such delivery since the US ban on crude exports ended in 2015.The United States shipped about 550,000 barrels, or 18,300 barrels per day (bpd), of crude to Saudi Arabia in June, US Census data shows. The US Energy Information Administration has no recorded instances of a US crude shipment to Saudi Arabia. US Census data shows a miniscule 1,000-barrel shipment to Saudi Arabia in 2002. That was during the four-decade ban on exports. The size of June’s cargo is less than what would be shipped even in the smallest class of crude tankers known as Aframax vessels. Traders said it is possible the cargo was part of another shipment headed to a different country. There are no records of a crude shipment to Saudi Arabia from the United States in Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data.Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest suppliers of crude to the United States. It sent about 1.2 million barrels per day of crude in May, the most in three years, the result of a short-lived oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that erupted just as the coronavirus pandemic was worsening worldwide.That created a major supply glut, which the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and allies agreed to deal with by cutting output by 9.7 million bpd. OPEC oil output rose by more than 1 million bpd in July as Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members ended voluntary additional supply curbs on top of that deal.US crude exports have surged since Washington lifted a ban in 2015, averaging 2.75 million bpd in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sends-first-shipment-of-crude-to-saudi-arabia-in-over-a-decade/story-aVWzaHdlGxsHHp1D4KU6HK.html
06-08-2020||World||US coronavirus fraud losses near $100 million as Covid-19 scams double||US losses from coronavirus-related fraud and identity theft have reached nearly $100 million since the pandemic emerged in March, while complaints of Covid-19 scams have at least doubled in most states, a consumer protection group said on Tuesday.A report from the group, based on government data, highlighted the vast scope of a fast-growing criminal cottage industry - from phony stimulus-check offers to shopping scams and fake cures - preying on Americans already distressed by the pandemic and its economic fallout.Perhaps not surprisingly, the study found California, Florida, New York, Texas and Pennsylvania - the most populous of the 50 US states - to be the five most targeted by coronavirus scams in the country.Together they accounted for about a third of more than 150,000 instances of Covid-related fraud reported nationally by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from mid-March, when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, through July, the report showed.Those cases have cost victims a total of $97.5 million to date, according to the FTC.Even relatively small states saw huge spikes in Covid-related fraud in recent months, led by Maine, whose monthly complaints of coronavirus scams and identity theft quadrupled between March and July, the study said.The report was published by the internet-based group SocialCatfish.com, which helps consumers avoid being defrauded online by determining the true identity of individuals or organizations hiding behind a phony persona.Scams taking advantage of Americans’ desperation in the midst of a deadly pandemic and accompanying economic upheaval “are running rampant,” said Richard Neil, a spokesman for the report’s authors.Several newly flourishing forms of fraud involve fake promises of government stimulus checks, often perpetuated through “robocalls,” texts, or emails seeking personal and financial information the caller supposedly needs to deposit benefits into the victim’s account, according to the report.Price-gouging and other consumer product scams have also become widespread, the study warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-fraud-losses-near-100-million-as-covid-19-scams-double/story-cGEorX7zRxEh3hInoUHKTO.html
06-08-2020||World||Lanka general election: Counting begins, Rajapaksa clan eyes landslide win||The counting of votes in Sri Lanka’s twice-postponed parliamentary election began on Thursday with the powerful Rajapaksa family-run Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) saying it is confident of recording a “historic victory” by securing a two-thirds majority. The election, conducted amidst Covid-19 pandemic fears, concluded in a peaceful manner on Wednesday, with a voter turnout of over 70 per cent, according to Chairman of the National Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya. As the counting of votes began, SLPP founder and its National Organiser Basil Rajapaksa -- who is the younger brother of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa with the eldest being Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa -- said that the party is all set to form a new government, News 1st Channel reported. He said that his party would make history as the only party to come into power within a short span of time since its formation, defeating other old political parties. “We are confident of the SLPP recording a historic victory. We hope for a two-thirds majority at the election but it is up to the people to decide,” he said. He said he is confident that the economy can be revived under the leadership of President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda. The results would be announced by Thursday evening, Deshapriya said. President Gotabaya voted in his Colombo suburb polling station while his elder brother and the prime ministerial aspirant Mahinda voted in his home constituency in the southern district of Hambantota. “We are hopeful of winning two-thirds support,” Mahinda, 74, told reporters after voting. He said his younger brother Gotabaya’s election as president was endorsed by 6.9 million voters last December and that he was hopeful of securing the same support. Former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that only his party, the United National Party, was capable of turning around the economy which is currently in poor state due to Covid-19 and mishandling by the current government. Mahinda’s SLPP is expected to win control of the 225-member assembly by a comfortable margin, according to analysts. President Gotabaya hopes for a two-thirds majority for the SLPP so that he can amend the Constitution to restore presidential powers curbed by a 2015 constitutional change. The president is not a candidate while Mahinda is running from the north western capital district of Kurunegala. Poll stations were manned by over 8,000 health officials who supervised the maintenance of health guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The election, which was postponed twice due to the coronavirus, is to elect a 225-member Parliament for a 5-year term. Over 16 million people were eligible to vote to elect 196 out of a total of 225 lawmakers for the next five years. Twenty-nine others will be named from a national list according to the number of votes received by each party. The election, originally scheduled for April 25, was put off until June 20 as the Covid-19 outbreak hampered the preparations. The August 5 date was later fixed as the health authorities issued guidelines for holding the poll. Some 20 political parties and 34 independent groups are in the fray with over 7,200 candidates from 22 electoral districts. Former president Maithripala Sirisena is running from the north central region of Polonnaruwa under the SLPP banner while former prime minister Wickremesinghe and former leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa are running from the Colombo district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lanka-general-election-counting-begins-rajapaksa-clan-eyes-landslide-win/story-S1F59FLrL9xV3rNYFWwCAK.html
06-08-2020||World||A shattered Beirut leaves Lebanese asking if they have a future||Even before the explosion ripped through his butcher’s shop on one of Beirut’s most fashionable streets, Tony Iyami was just about staying afloat.A lockdown to control the coronavirus pandemic had hit business, compounding a banking crisis that’s left most Lebanese unable to access their savings or borrow. The government is bankrupt, in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout and barely functioning. Then came Tuesday’s cataclysmic blast that erupted out of the capital’s port area shattering all before it, killing at least 100 people and wounding thousands.“We were already hobbling along, surviving step by step, but now we’ve been struck down,” Iyami said in between securing his property and sweeping up debris. “If our officials don’t wake up, we’re already being destroyed, but if they don’t wake up to what’s happening now, this nation is finished.”The explosion, fueled by a vast consignment of ammonium nitrate stored at the port despite repeated safety warnings, couldn’t have come at a worse time for Lebanon, which is enduring its deepest political and financial crisis since the 15-year civil war ended in 1990. As fighting ebbed, former warlords became the nation’s rulers, borrowed up to the hilt and then pillaged state coffers for three decades until there was virtually nothing left. The result is often a state in name only.Daily blackouts last hours, while garbage is left uncollected on the streets. A collapse in the currency has pushed inflation above 50%, erasing life savings. The blast has put the country’s leading port out of action and destroyed the main grain silos, ensuring prices will soar higher as supply chains are disrupted. Weeks of protest that began in October against cronyism and corruption, have fizzled into hopelessness as more Lebanese look to follow previous generations and emigrate.Lebanon has appealed for international help as concerns mount over shortages in a nation that depends heavily on imports. France, Germany and others have offered medical aid and assistance with rescue operations. But decades of corruption and failure to prove that Lebanon’s political class is serious about reform means donors remain reluctant to provide the government with budget support. Any aid is likely to be humanitarian or targeted at specific sectors like health.Unable to generate foreign significant support, oversee an economic recovery or guarantee public safety, Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s administration, cobbled together in January after mass protests brought down the previous government, may not last. Though Lebanon’s problems are an accumulation of nepotistic policies and public mismanagement over the decades, he’s facing criticism for doing too little to manage the country’s multiple crises.“Large elements of the public no longer believes the government is able to manage,” Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at Eurasia Group, said in a note. “The economic crisis will also deepen as the port is the main trade valve and base for many stored goods awaiting clearance.”Talks with the IMF had stalled as it became clear that politicians and bankers could not agree even on the magnitude of financial losses let alone who should pay for them. The government has lost key advisers and officials and the foreign minister resigned this week, frustrated that political elites were too busy protecting their own interests to take the steps demanded by potential lenders to save the economy from ruin.The areas behind the Port of Beirut were some of the trendiest in a politically turbulent city infamous for its nightlife. Packed with bars, restaurants and boutiques as well as residential apartment buildings, Gemmayze, Mar Mikhail and Saifi once throbbed with a mix of fashionable revelers and longtime residents. Beyond the port itself, where the 2,750 tons of hazardous ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse exploded on Tuesday, these old quarters were among the worst hit.Dazed employees picked up broken sheets of metal and glass on Wednesday as volunteers armed with brooms descended on the neighborhood to help with the cleanup. Lebanese Food Bank volunteers handed out water and sandwiches while ambulances sped along streets to pick up wounded people still trapped.“We’ve already been closed for four months by the government because of coronavirus. All they do is fine us. The state doesn’t care. I don’t think they can help us. I don’t think anyone will help,” said Saeed, who owns a bar in Gemmayze that had its windows and doors blown in and kitchen and bar equipment damaged.The blame game has begun. Diab, whose government was appointed in the aftermath of protests demanding the removal of a political elite that had taken Lebanon to the brink, has promised to investigate who was responsible for leaving the deadly chemical pile in storage for six years despite the danger. Critics have demanded an international inquiry into a tragedy they say will otherwise be hushed up.Some port officials have been placed under house arrest pending investigations but the government has yet to say what, if anything, it will do to compensate home and businessowners. That’s left some some facing ruin.Abbas Mattar works in a luxury kitchen showroom near the port that once kitted out high-end homes across Lebanon. Already laid low by the financial crisis, it faces a repair bill running into millions of dollars that may not be fully covered by insurance.“You despair in the end,” he said. “From 1990 to today, all the ministers and MPs need to be killed because you can’t get any dirtier than this. There are people who steal and leave but not to this extent. People are dead and you’re continuing? Still clinging to your chair, to power?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-shattered-beirut-leaves-lebanese-asking-if-they-have-a-future/story-a1mVlAxWlvll80Eg4zk8gO.html

It’s a really big moment for me and for all the Indians across the world,” said a resident. More than a 1,000 people of Indian heritage gathered near the world’s biggest digital billboard displaying images of Lord Ram at New York’s Broadway. Broadway clearly looked like a carnival of sorts.“I am from New Jersey and I am here to be a part of the Ram Janmabhoomi celebration today. It feels great to be a part of it. Our previous generations struggled for over 500 years,” said Manju Nath. Dressed in traditional attire, many Indians travelled from places near and far to celebrate and be a part of the Ram temple celebrations. Many lit candles and earthen lamps, exchanged sweets and savouries. Many among them said they would return to celebrate Diwali each year at Times Square.On Wednesday, New York City witnessed the largest high-definition digital display of Lord Ram and the proposed temple at Ayodhya on Broadway.The digital display of Lord Ram is said to be one of the most expensive digital billboards of the Hindu deity at Times Square. It lit up at 10 am to celebrate the laying of the temple’s foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ayodhya.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, took part in the ‘bhoomi poojan’ at Ram Janambhoomi site.Besides, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Governor Anandiben Patel and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat among several others were present at the ceremony in Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhajans-jai-shri-ram-chants-at-times-square-to-celebrate-bhoomi-poojan-at-ayodhya/story-4m58y9SU3S5uYSpWqlWlhP.html
06-08-2020||World||Fauci expects tens of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses at start of 2021||Drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year, Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases official, said in a Reuters interview on Wednesday, offering a more conservative view of the ramp up than some Trump administration officials.Fauci said there could be a billion vaccine doses available by the end of 2021, and that he is hopeful the world could get past the pandemic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives worldwide by then, with the help of a vaccine.US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said last month the US would have hundreds of millions of vaccine doses by early in 2021. Those goals are only possible because drugmakers have agreed to manufacture large supplies of their vaccines even before they know whether they work in order to save time.“The federal government has put more than one egg in the basket,” Fauci said. “We have a pretty comprehensive portfolio that’s going to subsequently be going into clinical trials.”He said there might be an indication that at least one vaccine works and is safe by year end.“I’m cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine that’s effective enough to get approved,” he said.That will not happen because of any pressure to have a vaccine available in time for the Nov. 3 presidential election, he said. Health regulators have promised “they are not going to let political considerations interfere” with the need to deliver a safe COVID-19 vaccine, Fauci said. [nL1N2F72GO]Fauci’s interview with Reuters came on the same day Trump said in an interview with Fox News that the virus is “going away. It will go away like things go away.”Fauci offered a more mixed assessment, saying some parts of the country had done well in containing the spread of the virus, while others were “on fire.”“I hope, and feel it’s possible, that by the time we get through 2021 and go around for another cycle that we’ll have this under control,” he said.The United States is committed to spending billions of dollars on vaccines being produced by companies including Johnson & Johnson

Tokyo has not signed the nuclear weapons ban treaty adopted in 2017, despite its non-nuclear pledge, a failure to act that atomic bombing survivors and pacifist groups call insincere.The US dropped its first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people. The US dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered Aug. 15, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression in Asia.Survivors, their relatives and other participants marked the 8:15 a.m. blast anniversary with a minute of silence.Thursday’s peace ceremony at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was scaled down because of the coronavirus pandemic. The fewer than 1,000 attendees was one-tenth of those attending in past years.Some survivors and their relatives prayed at the park’s cenotaph before the ceremony. The registry of the atomic bombing victims is stored at the cenotaph, whose inscription reads “Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the mistake.”Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in his speech at the ceremony, said Japan is committed to nuclear weapons ban but a nuclear free world cannot be achieved overnight and that it has to start from dialogue between opposite sides.“Japan’s position is to serve as a bridge between different sides and patiently promote their dialogue and actions to achieve a world without nuclear weapons,” Abe said. Nuclear policies are divided amid a harsh security environment, so it is necessary to create common ground first, he said.An aging group of survivors, known as hibakusha, feel a growing urgency to tell their stories, in hopes of reaching a younger generation.On the 75th anniversary, elderly survivors, whose average age now exceeds 83, lamented the slow progress of nuclear disarmament.They expressed anger over what they said was the Japanese government’s reluctance to help and listen to those who suffered from the atomic bombing.“Abe’s words and actions don’t seem to match,” said Manabu Iwasa, 47, who came to the park to pray for his father, a survivor who died at age 87 in March. “Japan apparently sides with the US and make more effort toward nuclear weapons ban,” he said. “It’s frustrating, but there is not much we individuals can do.”Keiko Ogura, 84, who survived the atomic bombing at age 8, wants non-nuclear states to pressure Japan into signing the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty. “Many survivors are offended by the prime minister of this country who does not sign the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty,” she said.Matsui urged world leaders, especially those from nuclear weapons states, to visit Hiroshima and see the reality of the atomic bombing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survivors-mark-75th-anniversary-of-world-s-1st-atomic-attack/story-qFsEw2rvZv2BRKdsYB9bSJ.html
06-08-2020||World||New drug RLF-100 shows dramatic results for critical Covid-19 patients||Doctors at a hospital in Houston have used a new drug called RLF-100, also known as aviptadil, that has led to rapid recovery from respiratory failure in critically ill Covid-19 patients. The drug has been approved by the FDA for emergency use at multiple clinical sites in patients who are too ill to enter the FDA’s Phase 2/3 trials. Houston Methodist Hospital was the first to report the rapid recovery of patients on ventilators and those with severe medical conditions after three days of treatment.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  Aviptadil is a formulation of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), which is present in high concentrations in the lungs and known to block various inflammatory cytokines. NeuroRx and Relief Therapeutics have partnered to develop the drug. According to a statement from the drug maker NeuroRX, independent researchers have reported that aviptadil blocked replication of the SARS coronavirus in human lung cells and monocytes.Also read: Zydus to start second phase of Covid-19 vaccine candidate trials today According to the report, a 54-year-old man who contracted Covid-19 while being treated for rejection of a double lung transplant came off a ventilator within four days. And, similar results were seen in more than 15 patients. The drug appeared to have rapidly cleared pneumonitis findings on an X-ray, improved blood oxygen and a 50 per cent or greater average decrease in laboratory markers associated with Covid-19 inflammation, the statement said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “No other antiviral agent has demonstrated rapid recovery from viral infection and demonstrated laboratory inhibition of viral replication,” said Prof. Jonathan Javitt, CEO and chairman of NeuroRx. “We are conducting placebo-controlled trials to see whether the observations made in the case-control and open-label studies will be confirmed for less ill patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. Our independent Data Monitoring Committee will be conducting an interim analysis of these data later this month,” Javitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-drug-rlf-100-shows-dramatic-results-for-critical-covid-19-patients/story-wcWIo9Kcez00yTCppoe0lJ.html
06-08-2020||World||Twitter, Facebook block Trump video, citing coronavirus misinformation||Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. blocked a video shared by accounts linked to U.S. President Donald Trump for violating their policies on coronavirus misinformation.The Trump re-election campaign’s Twitter account, @TeamTrump, was briefly banned from sending new tweets after it posted a clip of an interview Trump did Wednesday with Fox News in which he said children were “virtually immune” from the Covid-19 coronavirus. “[Children] don’t have a problem, they just don’t have a problem,” Trump said in the video as part of an argument for why schools should reopen. “It doesn’t have an impact on them. I’ve watched some doctors say they’re totally immune.”Trump posted the same video to his account on Facebook, which removed the clip shortly before Twitter froze the campaign’s account. Both social-media companies have policies that forbid sharing misleading information about the coronavirus that could cause people harm.The @TeamTrump account resumed posting Wednesday evening after the video appeared to have been taken down. “The original Tweet from @TeamTrump is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation, and we’ve required removal,” according to a post from Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio. Though the president also shared the video on his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, that account wasn’t punished because the clip was re-shared from the campaign’s feed instead of uploaded directly, Twitter said.“Silicon Valley is hopelessly biased against the President and only enforces the rules in one direction,” Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a tweet in response to the company’s actions.The Washington Post initially reported that Twitter had barred Trump from posting to his personal account, but later corrected its story to say that the temporary ban had only impacted the @TeamTrump campaign account.Twitter, which had for years been criticized for its lack of action against the U.S. president’s controversial tweets, has taken a more aggressive stand against the U.S. President in recent months. In late May, the company flagged two Trump posts about mail-in ballots, part of a new policy preventing false or confusing information related to voting. Shortly after that, Twitter highlighted another tweet for violating its rules against glorifying violence when Trump tweeted that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a reference to protests against police brutality and racism in Minneapolis.Facebook has also been under fire for what critics say is a failure to enforce its rules against Trump. In early July, an outside auditor found Facebook didn’t enforce its own voter suppression policies against the president when he posted misleading information about mail-in ballots. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has said that fighting misinformation on Covid-19 is easier than on other topics because the company has reliable sources to help determine what is true, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Trump’s comments on children and Covid contradicted what officials at those organizations say about the virus.“Children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease,” according to the WHO website. The CDC says that while children don’t appear to be at higher risk for Covid-19 than adults, there are some children who have contracted the virus, and recommends they follow the same social distancing guidelines as adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-facebook-block-trump-video-citing-coronavirus-misinformation/story-IuvlBZHaSvoDsdvajrtJDJ.html

It said the attackers managed to escape.East senior superintendent of police Sajid Sadozai said two unidentified persons riding a motorcycle threw an RGD-1 grenade at the rally and fled, another report on the Dawn website claimed.One person was stated to be critical while no deaths were reported yet, the Dawn quoted Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator for the Sindh health minister, as saying. He had earlier ruled out that the blast was caused by a planted bomb, the report said.The incident happened near a mosque and shattered windows of cars nearby. A heavy contingent of security forces reached the site after the incident.Eyewitnesses said the blast caused a stampede and severely injured five people on the site, according to the Geo News report. “The banned Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) claimed responsibility for the attack through social media,” the Dawn said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-40-people-injured-in-blast-at-karachi-rally/story-ClUn4vJnfArXHVEBHgySvI.html
06-08-2020||World||Canada signs up with Pfizer, Moderna for 2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine||After having been criticised for reacting slowly to the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in a shortage of personal protective equipment like masks at the outset of the crisis, the Canadian Government is taking steps to ensure an early supply of a vaccine, when available. The Government announced that it has entered into agreements with two companies “to secure millions of doses” of the vaccine.Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand said that after review by the Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force the government had signed agreements with the companies Pfizer and Moderna for the vaccine candidates. Anand said that “if all goes well” Canada could get deliveries in 2021 while adding that the government are in talks with other vaccine candidates. “The Government is negotiating and signing agreements with a number of leading pharmaceutical companies to establish a guaranteed supply base of potential vaccine candidates,” a statement said. Anand, an Indo-Canadian Minister, pointed out that vaccination may not be made mandatory for Canadians, echoing the stand of the country’s public health authorities.“We are now squarely focused on preparing Canada for an eventual vaccine. Given intense global competition, we are taking an aggressive approach to secure access to the most promising candidates so that we will be ready to vaccinate all Canadians as quickly as possible,” Anand said. She highlighted that the initial efforts earlier had been directed at procuring PPE and suppliesThe formation of a Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force was announced at the same time, by Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains.At a media interaction, Anand said, “Canadians are at the front of the line when a vaccine becomes available. Whenever the vaccine does become available, Health Canada will review its safety, efficacy and manufacturing quality before it is approved for use in the country.”Bains noted in a statement that the government was “working hard on all possible fronts to deliver safe and effective treatments and vaccines against Covid-19 for Canadians as fast as possible.”Anand did not disclose the exact number of doses that have been ordered in advanced other than to put that figure in millions. She also would not divulge the names of other pharmaceutical or biotech companies with which the Government is also negotiating for potential vaccine procurement.Canada has so far logged 118,140 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections, and recorded 8962 deaths. The number of fatalities has declined significantly from the peak in April, with only four being reported on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-signs-up-with-pfizer-moderna-for-2-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-mLmbmCFPfachrHa5AmAuhN.html
06-08-2020||World||Common cold infection may help body in recognising Covid-19: Study||The immune system’s memory helper T cells which recognise the common cold virus and help the body fight it off, also identifies some parts of the novel coronavirus, according to a study whose findings may explain why some people have milder Covid-19 cases than others. The research, published in the journal Science, noted that the immune system’s memory T cells keep track of the viruses they have seen before, giving the cells a headstart in recognising and fighting off repeat invaders. However, the scientists, including those from La Jolla Institute (LJI) in the US, cautioned that it is too soon to say whether such pre-existing immune cell memory affects Covid-19 clinical outcomes.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “We have now proven that, in some people, pre-existing T cell memory against common cold coronaviruses can cross-recognise SARS-CoV-2, down to the exact molecular structures,” said Daniela Weiskopf, a co-author of the study from LJI. “This could help explain why some people show milder symptoms of disease while others get severely sick,” Weiskopf said. Alessandro Sette, another co-author of the study from LJI, noted that the reactivity of the immune system may translate to different degrees of protection. “Having a strong T cell response, or a better T cell response may give you the opportunity to mount a much quicker and stronger response,” Sette said. An earlier study by Sette and his team had shown that 40 to 60 per cent of people who were never exposed to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had T cells that reacted to the virus. According to the study, the immune systems in these individuals recognised fragments of the virus it had never seen before -- a finding which was also reported among people in the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, and the UK. In the current research, the scientists assessed samples collected from study participants who had never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. They defined the exact parts of the virus that are responsible for the cross-reactive T cell response. Their analysis showed that unexposed individuals can produce a range of memory T cells that are equally reactive against SARS-CoV-2, and four types of common cold coronaviruses. Based on the finding, the scientists said fighting off a common cold coronavirus could teach the T cell compartment to recognise some parts of SARS-CoV-2 as well. They believe this process provides evidence for the hypothesis that common cold viruses can, in fact, induce cross-reactive T cell memory against SARS-CoV-2. “We knew there was pre-existing reactivity, and this study provides very strong direct molecular evidence that memory T cells can ‘see’ sequences that are very similar between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2,” Sette said. The scientists found that while some cross-reactive T cells targeted the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein -- the region of the virus that recognises and binds to human cells -- pre-existing immune memory was also directed to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Sette noted that the finding is relevant since most vaccine candidates target the spike protein. The findings, according to the researchers, suggest the hypothesis that inclusion of additional SARS-CoV-2 targets might enhance the potential to take advantage of this cross reactivity, and could further enhance vaccine potency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/common-cold-infection-may-help-body-in-recognising-covid-19-study/story-CPg8Uj0Bn61JEFVMurJmtL.html
06-08-2020||World||8 Western nations urge Russian forces to leave Georgia||The United States and seven European countries marked Friday’s 12th anniversary of the conflict between Russia and Georgia with a call to Moscow to withdraw forces from Abkhazia and South Ossetia and allow medical evacuations and aid deliveries especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.The western nations said after a closed briefing to the UN Security Council on Wednesday by Assistant Secretary-General Miroslav Jenca that Russia’s continuing military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and its recognition of “the so-called independence of the regions” violates Georgia’s territorial integrity and undermines its sovereignty.Georgia made a botched attempt to regain control of its breakaway province of South Ossetia during the presidency of Mikhail Saakashvili, sparking the war with Russia that began on Aug. 7, 2008. Russia recognized the independence of South Ossetia as well as the breakaway province of Abkhazia and set up military bases there.The US and European nations said in a joint statement that they are “extremely concerned” about Russia’s “intensification of the so-called `borderization process’ over the past year, including during the global COVID-19 pandemic.”They said Russia’s actions further divide communities and put at risk “the health and lives of the conflict-affected population.”“Throughout this already challenging time, the de-facto authorities exercising effective control over the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have continued the practice of arbitrary detentions along the administrative boundary lines,” the statement said. “De facto South Ossetian authorities have repeatedly denied emergency medical evacuations and incoming humanitarian aid.”The US, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Norway and Ireland also expressed concern about “the ongoing disinformation campaign by Russia about the pandemic and related health issues.”“These acts prolong the conflict, threaten peace and stability, interfere with the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and negatively impact the health and safety of people across Georgia, destabilizing the region as a whole,” the eight nations said.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky responded, tweeting that the joint statement is “A beautiful fiction. But only a fiction.”He made no mention of the pandemic but said Georgia’s “aggression which triggered all the problems for this country & the region was officially confirmed in 2009 by the report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the conflict.”“As a result of former Georgian leadership’s reckless policy unscrupulously encouraged by the US and some of its satellites 2 new independent states have emerged on the global map and this is the reality that cannot be ignored,” Polyansky tweeted.“Politicians promoting selfish geopolitical interests managed so far to drive a wedge between our countries but they failed to do so between our 2 peoples,” he added. “Discussions like today attempt to undermine the ongoing process of reconciliation of Russia and Georgia.”The US and Europeans called again on Russia to fully implement agreements in August 2008 to withdraw its armed forces to positions before hostilities began, and to establish an international security mechanism.Representatives of Georgia, Russia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the United States have held talks in Geneva since October 2008 to address the consequences of the Georgia conflict under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the United Nations.The US and Europeans expressed regret at Russia’s “lack of commitment” in the Geneva talks on the topic of refugees and Georgians internally displaced, and reiterated support for human rights, including for those forcibly displaced during the conflict to return safely to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-western-nations-urge-russian-forces-to-leave-georgia/story-c8PGAqOjyyQcZGs72IxdiO.html
06-08-2020||World||Beirut reels from huge blast as death toll climbs to at least 135||Lebanese rescue teams pulled out bodies and hunted for missing people on Wednesday from the wreckage caused by a massive warehouse explosion that sent a devastating blast wave across Beirut, killing at least 135.Prime Minister Hassan Diab declared three days of mourning from Thursday as early investigations blamed negligence for the explosion at Beirut port, which has left tens of people missing and injured more than 5,000 others.Up to a quarter of a million people were left without homes fit to live in, officials said, after shockwaves smashed building facades, sucked furniture out into streets and shattered windows miles inland.The death toll was expected to rise from the blast, which officials blamed on a huge stockpile of highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at the port.The explosion was the most powerful ever in Beirut, a city still scarred by civil war that ended three decades ago and reeling from an economic meltdown and a surge in coronavirus infections. The blast rattled buildings on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, about 100 miles (160 km) away.“No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city,” President Michel Aoun said in an address to the nation during an emergency cabinet session.Aoun said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, was stored for six years at the port after it was seized.The government was “determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable,” he said.An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on “inaction and negligence”, saying “nothing was done” by committees and judges involved in the matter to order the removal of hazardous material.The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material to be put under house arrest, ministerial sources told Reuters.Officials have not confirmed the origin of an initial blaze that sparked the explosion, although a security source and local media said it was started by welding work.‘COLLAPSE OF LEBANON’For many, the blast was a dreadful reminder of the 1975-1990 civil war that tore the nation apart and destroyed swathes of Beirut, much of which had since been rebuilt.Ordinary Lebanese, who have lost jobs and watched savings evaporate in the country’s financial crisis, blamed politicians who have overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance.“This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon. I really blame the ruling class,” said Hassan Zaiter, 32, a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut.Relatives gathered at a cordon to Beirut port seeking information on those still missing as the search continued. Many of those killed were port and custom employees, people working in the area or those driving nearby during the Tuesday evening rush hour. Some victims were hurled out to sea by the powerful blast.The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed. Health officials reported that hospitals were running out of beds and equipment to attend to the injured.Beirut’s Clemenceau Medical Center was “like a slaughterhouse, blood covering the corridors and the lifts,” said Sara, one of its nurses.Beirut Governor Marwan Abboud told Al Hadath TV that collective losses from the blast might reach as high as $15 billion, including indirect losses related to business.“This is the killer blow for Beirut, we are a disaster zone,” said Bilal, a man in his 60s, in the downtown area.The World Bank Group said on Wednesday it would work with Lebanon’s partners to mobilize public and private financing for reconstruction and recovery. It was unclear what effect the disaster would have on the country’s difficult negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, however.Offers of international support poured in.Gulf Arab states, who in the past were major financial supporters of Lebanon but recently stepped back because of what they say is Iranian meddling, sent planes with medical equipment and other supplies.Turkey said it would send 20 doctors to help treat the injured, as well as medical and relief assistance. Iraq pledged fuel aid, while Iran offered food and a field hospital.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted: “We sympathize with the dear Lebanese citizens and stand by them in the painful tragedy of the Beirut port explosion ... Patience in the face of this incident will be a golden leaf of honour for Lebanon.”The United States, Britain and other Western nations, which have been demanding political and economic change in Lebanon, also offered aid. Germany, the Netherlands and Cyprus offered specialised search and rescue teams.Two French planes were expected to arrive on Thursday with specialist rescue personnel and equipment, and President Emmanuel Macron was due to visit on Thursday.FOOD SECURITY“This is a catastrophe for Beirut and Lebanon,” Mayor Jamal Itani told Reuters while inspecting damage.The port district was left a tangled wreck, disabling the nation’s main route for imports needed to feed a nation of more than 6 million people.The country’s main grain silo at the port was destroyed in the blast and Beirut Governor Abboud said a crisis might develop without international intervention.Lebanon was already struggling to house and feed refugees fleeing conflict in neighbouring Syria and has no trade or other ties with its only other neighbour Israel.“On a scale, this explosion is scaled down from a nuclear bomb rather than up from a conventional bomb,” said Roland Alford, managing director of British explosive ordnance disposal firm Alford Technologies. “This is huge.”The blast also prompted the Special Tribunal for Lebanon on Wednesday to postpone its verdict in the trial over the 2005 bombing that killed ex-Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri to Aug. 18. The tribunal’s decision had been expected this Friday.The U.N.-backed court put on trial four suspects from the Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah. Hariri and 21 others were killed by a big truck bomb in another area of the Beirut waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the U.S. government had not totally ruled out the possibility that Tuesday’s explosion was an attack, and said it is still gathering intelligence on the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-reels-from-huge-blast-as-death-toll-climbs-to-at-least-135/story-4MaHIbo4ZXnLXk6BCHWm8N.html

The person discussed details on condition of anonymity because the fundraiser was closed to news media coverage.President Trump briefly addressed the contributors after he telephoned his daughter during the event and she put the call on speakerphone.Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said proceeds will be used to pay for field work and to highlight Trump’s pro-worker agenda for voters.Ivanka Trump gets the most requests, after the president, to appear at fundraisers and other events, officials said. She plans to appear at another fundraiser next week in Wyoming.“Ivanka is a tremendous voice for the re-election effort,” McDaniel said in a statement. “Supporters across the country are eager to hear from her on issues ranging from the economy to workforce development and paid family leave.” Ivanka Trump campaigned for her father’s 2016 campaign, including before and after the birth of her third child. She works in the White House as an unpaid adviser to the president.The USD 4 million raised Wednesday topped a recent online fundraiser for Joe Biden, Trump’s likely Democratic opponent.Massachusetts Sen.

06-08-2020||World||Drug regulators assured scientists that political pressure wont’ affect approval of a vaccine: Fauci||US regulators have assured scientists that political pressure will not determine when a coronavirus vaccine is approved even as the White House hopes to have one ready ahead of the November presidential election, the country’s leading infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday.“We have assurances, and I’ve discussed this with the regulatory authorities, that they promise that they are not going to let political considerations interfere with a regulatory decision,” Dr. Fauci told Reuters in an interview.“We’ve spoken explicitly about that, because the subject obviously comes up, and the people in charge of the regulatory process assure us that safety and efficacy is going to be the prime consideration,” he said.President Donald Trump, a Republican, is behind Democrat Joe Biden in public opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election. Trump has lost ground in part due to voter concerns over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.A vaccine announcement in October could help Trump’s chances in the nationwide vote.“I’m certain of what the White House would like to see, but I haven’t seen any indication of pressure at this point to do anything different than what we’re doing,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“I mean obviously they’ve expressed: ‘Gee, it would be nice, the sooner the better.’“Trump has suggested publicly that a vaccine could be ready long before the end of the year. In the interview Fauci offered a more conservative view, suggesting drugmakers will likely have tens of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines in the early part of next year.Fauci and other doctors on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, including its coordinator Deborah Birx, have come under criticism from the president for portraying the pandemic in less rosy terms than he has sought to emphasize.Trump said in a recent interview with Axios that the virus was “under control.”Asked if he shared that assessment, Fauci said some parts of the country were more under control than others.“We’re a big country. You can pick out some parts of the country that are looking good and you could say is under control; you could pick some parts of the country that are on fire, in the sense, I mean you’re having outbreaks that you know you don’t get 70,000 cases a day when nothing’s going on.”More than 157,000 people have died in the United States from COVID-19 and more than 4.7 million cases have been reported in the country and its territories, according to Reuters tallies.Earlier this week the president criticized Dr. Birx for giving a sobering description of the state of the pandemic.Fauci said the doctors try to focus on the science rather than political distractions.“What we try to do, you know maybe some could do it better than others, is to focus like a laser on what we’re supposed to be doing: getting this epidemic under control,” he said.Fauci said differences in the seriousness with which people had taken the virus in the United States had hampered the response to the pandemic in comparison to other countries.“We have somewhat of a disjointed approach to things,” he said. “If we had a uniformity of it, and everybody rode together in the same boat, we probably would do much better.”Fauci and other medical professionals have urged Americans to wear masks and maintain a social distance to prevent the spread of the virus. He lamented the fact that mask-wearing had become political earlier in the pandemic.Trump declined to wear a mask in public for months and Vice President Mike Pence faced criticism for not wearing one when he visited the Mayo Clinic in April.“Thank goodness that’s changed,” Fauci said. “I’m very pleased now that we’re seeing the vice president consistently wearing a mask, the president tweeting that you should be wearing masks. That’s a good thing.

06-08-2020||World||Coronavirus testing in United States is dropping, even as deaths mount||US testing for the coronavirus is dropping even as infections remain high and the death toll rises by more than 1,000 a day, a worrisome trend that officials attribute largely to Americans getting discouraged over having to wait hours to get a test and days or weeks to find out the results.An Associated Press analysis found that the number of tests per day slid 3.6 per cent over the past two weeks to 750,000, with the count falling in 22 states. That includes places like Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri and Iowa where the percentage of positive tests is high and continuing to climb, an indicator that the virus is still spreading uncontrolled.Amid the crisis, some health officials are calling for the introduction of a different type of test that would yield results in a matter of minutes and would be cheap and simple enough for millions of Americans to test themselves — but would also be less accurate.“There’s a sense of desperation that we need to do something else,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute.Widespread testing is considered essential to containing the outbreak as the US approaches a mammoth 5 million confirmed infections and more than 157,000 deaths out of over 700,000 worldwide.Testing demand is expected to surge again this fall, when schools reopen and flu season hits, most likely outstripping supplies and leading to new delays and bottlenecks.Some of the decline in testing over the past few weeks was expected after backlogged commercial labs urged doctors to concentrate on their highest-risk patients. But some health and government officials are seeing growing public frustration and waning demand.In Iowa, state officials are reporting less interest in testing, despite ample supplies. The state’s daily testing rate peaked in mid-July but has declined 40 per cent in the last two weeks.“We have the capacity. Iowans just need to test,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said last week.Jessica Moore of rural Newberry, South Carolina, said that after a private lab lost her Covid-19 test results in mid-July, she had to get re-tested at a pop-up site organised by the state.Moore and her husband arrived early on a Saturday morning at the site, a community center, where they waited for two hours for her test. Moore watched in the rear-view mirror as people drove up, saw the long line of cars, and then turned around and left.“If people have something to do on a Saturday and they want to get tested, they’re not going to wait for two hours in the South Carolina heat for a test, especially if they’re not symptomatic,” Moore said.Before travelling from Florida to Delaware last month, Laura DuBose Schumacher signed up to go to a drive-up testing site in Orlando with her husband. They were given a one-hour window in which to arrive.They got there at the start of the window, but after 50 minutes it looked as if the wait would be another hour. Others who had gone through the line told them that they wouldn’t get their results until five days later, a Monday, at the earliest. They were planning to travel the next day, so they gave up.“Monday would have been pointless, so we left the line,” Schumacher said.The number of confirmed infections in the US has topped 4.7 million, with new cases running at nearly 60,000 a day on average, down from more than 70,000 in the second half of July.US testing is built primarily on highly sensitive molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the coronavirus. Although the test is considered the gold standard for accuracy, experts increasingly say the country’s overburdened lab system is incapable of keeping pace with the outbreak and producing results within two or three days, the time frame crucial to isolating patients and containing the virus.“They’re doing as good a job as they possibly can do, but the current system will not allow them to keep up with the demand,” said Mara Aspinall of Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions.Testing delays have led researchers at Harvard and elsewhere to propose a new approach using so-called antigen tests — rapid technology already used to screen for flu, strep throat and other common infections. Instead of detecting the virus itself, such tests look for viral proteins, or antigens, which are generally considered a less accurate measure of infection.A number of companies are studying Covid-19 antigen tests in which you spit on a specially coated strip of paper, and if you are infected, it changes color. Experts say the speed and widespread availability of such tests would more than make up for their lower precision.While no such tests for the coronavirus are on the US market, experts say the technology is simple and the hurdles are more regulatory than technical. The Harvard researchers say production could quickly be scaled into the millions.A proposal from the Harvard researchers calls for the federal government to distribute USD 1 saliva-based antigen tests to all Americans so that they can test themselves regularly, perhaps even daily.Even with accuracy as low as 50 per cent, researchers estimate the paper strip tests would uncover five times more Covid-19 cases than the current laboratory-based approach, which federal officials estimate catches just 1 in 10 infections.But the approach faces resistance in Washington, where federal regulators have required at least 80 per cent accuracy for new Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-in-united-states-is-dropping-even-as-deaths-mount/story-aZ8NBsxDgxNeKuc8fUDhHL.html

They said a Jamaat-i-Islami rally was attacked with a grenade in Karachi on Wednesday evening.The blast took place near the main truck that was part of the rally in the Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, when two persons on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade, according to a Jamaat-i-Islami spokesperson. This was also confirmed by a senior police official Sajid Sadozai, who claimed that it was an RGD-1 grade grenade.Jamaat-i-Islami had taken out the rally to mark the first anniversary of India’s decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019.Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA), a banned outfit in Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack through social media.Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator to the Sindh health minister said one person was in a critical condition and no deaths had been reported so far.She earlier said five of the injured were taken to Al Mustafa Hospital, seven to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), 11 to Aga Khan University Hospital and 10 to Liaquat National Hospital, according to Dawn News website.It quoted Yousuf as saying that a majority of the injured received “very minor injuries”, while some were discharged after preliminary medical treatment.Dawn reported that the explosion, which took place near Bait-ul-Mukarram Masjid, also shattered the windows of nearby cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/39-injured-in-a-grenade-attack-on-a-rally-in-pakistan-s-karachi/story-cAZCJIkkvfHBfsXBOoMOuN.html

In the centre is a huge industrial plant which produces chemicals. One night there is an explosion in the plant. A deadly gas settles over much of the city and the sleeping people. By morning thousands are dead”.“The agony doesn’t stop there: in the decades that follow, many thousands more die from the effects of the gas, or from birth deformities; hundreds of thousands more have their lives ruined; and the land and water around the plant are poisoned. This is not fiction”.“This happened, in 1984 in a place called Bhopal in India. I’ve been to Bhopal and visited the site. The chemical plant is still there, derelict and rusting away. People still live all around it, many of them the victims of the explosion or their children. The land is still poisoned and the water is still undrinkable. Nearly forty years on, no one has been held accountable. The sense of loss and injustice is visceral”.“Bhopal is a textbook example of failed regulation. A hazardous industrial plant was allowed to operate in the middle of one of the most densely populated cities in the world without proper checks and precautions until one day disaster struck”, he said.The Bhopal disaster, Bevan added, is the reason why he believes in regulation of the right kind that has teeth, because not everyone plays by the rules. He cited examples of how regulation has made a major difference in England’s environment.The disaster was caused by chemical methyl isocyanate leaking from the Union Carbide’s plant on the night of December 2 and 3, 1984, killing at least 3,700 people, hundreds of thousands injured and many more adversely affected for life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/case-of-failed-regulation-uk-environment-agency-chief-on-bhopal-gas-horror/story-80faPOYzPjBzl8d9ATKPeJ.html
06-08-2020||World||China, US to review trade deal, air other grievances on August 15: Report||Senior US and Chinese officials will review the implementation of their Phase 1 trade deal and likely air mutual grievances in an increasingly tense relationship during an August 15 videoconference, two people familiar with the plans said.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the principal negotiators for the two countries, will participate in the meeting, an initial six-month review of the pact activated on February 15.The meeting plans were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The US Trade Representative’s office and the US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.Under the Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, China had pledged to boost purchases of US goods by some $200 billion over 2017 levels, including agricultural and manufactured products, energy and services.But China, battered by the global coronavirus recession, is far behind the pace needed to meet its first-year goal of a $77 billion increase. Imports of farm goods have been lower than the 2017 level, far behind the 50% increase needed to meet the 2020 target of $36.5 billion.Beijing has bought only 5% of the energy products needed to meet the Phase 1 first year goal of $25.3 billionOne of the people familiar with the plans said Chinese officials hoped to discuss other issues beyond the Phase 1 trade deal implementation.“It’s both the normal semi-annual review and also comes at a time when the relationship continues to deteriorate. Naturally there is much to discuss,” the person said.China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said on Tuesday that there was always a plan for high-level consultations six months into the pact, but the two sides have remained in regular contact over the trade deal.“If they do have such a meeting I guess it will be very positive,” Cui told a virtual event sponsored by the Aspen Security Forum.Trump has threatened to end the trade pact over China’s handling of the coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, and tensions have risen over US sanctions related to China’s security crackdown on Hong Kong.The latest irritant between the world’s two largest economies is Trump’s threat to ban US use of the Chinese-owned video app TikTok unless it is sold to a non-Chinese buyer.White House officials on Tuesday could not say how Trump’s suggestion that the US Treasury get a significant portion of the proceeds of the sale - potentially to US software giant Microsoft - could be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-to-review-trade-deal-air-other-grievances-on-august-15-report/story-YsK7wN7mWXMIjlZrLEb3BM.html
06-08-2020||World||Trump says US generals feel Beirut blast that killed over 70 was likely an ‘attack’||President Donald Trump said US military generals have told him that they “seem to feel” the massive explosion that rocked Beirut on Tuesday, killing at least 70 people, was a “terrible attack” likely caused by a bomb.Trump was asked why he called it an attack and not an accident, especially since Lebanese officials say they have not determined the cause of the explosion. He told reporters at the White House: “It would seem like it based on the explosion. I met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a — some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of a event. ... They seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.”Trump offered condolences to the victims and said the United States stood ready to assist Lebanon. “It looks like a terrible attack,” he said.The explosion flattened much of a port and damaged buildings across the capital, sending a giant mushroom cloud into the sky. In addition to those who died, more than 3,000 other people were injured, with bodies buried in the rubble, officials said.The cause of the blast was not immediately known, but initial reports suggested a fire had detonated a warehouse at the port. Abbas Ibrahim, chief of Lebanese General Security, said it might have been caused by highly explosive material that was confiscateWasd from a ship some time ago and stored at the port. Local television channel LBC said the material was ammonium nitrate.Witnesses reported seeing a strange, orange cloud like that which appears when toxic nitrogen dioxide gas is released after an explosion involving nitrates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-generals-feel-beirut-blast-that-killed-70-was-likely-an-attack/story-ydqGeFpouwsAwlB5imNfEN.html
06-08-2020||World||China sentences 3rd Canadian to death on drug charges||China has sentenced a third Canadian citizen to death on drug charges amid a steep decline in relations between the two countries.The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court announced Xu Weihong’s penalty on Thursday and said an alleged accomplice, Wen Guanxiong, had been given a life sentence.Death sentences are automatically referred to China’s highest court for review.The brief court statement gave no details but local media in the southern Chinese city at the heart of the country’s manufacturing industry said Xu and Wen had gathered ingredients and tools and began making the drug ketamine in October 2016, then stored the final product in Xu’s home in Guangzhou’s Haizhu district.Police later confiscated more than 120 kilograms (266 pounds) of the drug from Xu’s home and another address, the reports said. Ketamine is a powerful pain killer that has become popular among club goers in China and elsewhere.Relations between China and Canada soured over the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive and the daughter of the founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei, at Vancouver’s airport in late 2018. The U.S. wants her extradited to face fraud charges over the company’s dealings with Iran. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China’s rise as a global technology power.In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor, accusing them of vague national security crimes.Soon after, China handed a death sentence to convicted Canadian drug smuggler Robert Schellenberg in a sudden retrial, and in April 2019, gave the death penalty to a Canadian citizen identified as Fan Wei in a multinational drug smuggling case.China has also placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola seed oil, in an apparent attempt to pressure Ottawa into releasing Meng.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said there was no connection between Xu’s sentencing and current China-Canada relations.“I would like to stress that China’s judicial authorities handle the relevant case independently in strict accordance with Chinese law and legal procedures,” Wang said at a daily briefing Thursday. “This case should not inflict any impact on China-Canada relations.”Like many Asian nations, China deals out stiff penalties for manufacturing and selling illegal drugs, including the death penalty. In December 2009, Pakistani-British businessman Akmal Shaikh was executed after being convicted of smuggling heroin, despite allegations he was mentally disturbed.“Death sentences for drug-related crimes that are extremely dangerous will help deter and prevent such crimes,” Wang said. “China’s judicial authorities handle cases involving criminals of different nationalities in accordance with law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-3rd-canadian-to-death-on-drug-charges/story-h6YLkFAodAJUIMExuZvxMO.html
06-08-2020||World||In a rebuff to Pakistan, UNSC again says Kashmir should be resolved bilaterally||The UN Security Council on Wednesday rebuffed another attempt by Pakistan to raise Kashmir at the body, and made it abundantly clear this is an issue for India and Pakistan to resolve bilaterally, as has been India’s position . Four of the five permanent members — the US, UK, France and Russia — sided firmly with India, as has become a practice.“In today’s meeting of UN Security Council which was closed, informal, not recorded and without any outcome, almost all countries underlined that J&K was bilateral issue & did not deserve time and attention of Council,” said TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, in a tweet. Also read: Imran Khan’s Pakistan might end up regretting its new ‘political map’. Here is whyPakistan had sought a discussion on Kashmir — for the third time since last August — in a letter to the council which, as some diplomats said, “was match-fixed” to coincide with the anniversary of the revocation of the Article 370. And China, batting for its “all-weather friend”, made it happen as it had before, calling for a discussion under Ayn Other Business practice, which allows any member to raise an issue for discussion.But they couldn’t fix the outcome. “They chose the date carefully but it proved to be a short-sighted move as everyone else came to India’s support,” said a UN diplomat ho had monitored the meeting closely. “Most members felt this needs to be resolved bilaterally and it does not deserve to come to be security council, and there was a sense that this was a waste of the body’s time.”This time Pakistan and China had the support also of Indonesia, which holds UNSC’s rotational chair for August. Though Indonesia is among the few countries to side with Pakistan on Kashmir publicly, including Turkey, it may not have had a choice this time though, said another UN diplomat cautioning against smothering it with all the blame.“Once a P-5 member (China) called for discussing Kashmir under AOB, Indonesia was really in no position to prevent it.” Even China, a as a permanent member couldn’t prevent an AOB discussion on Hong Kong in May.Also read: Indian envoy to UN outlines Pakistan’s direct involvement in manufacturing terrorIn the end, however, Indonesia came through for India, according to one of the diplomats cited above, as it agreed with others that the dispute needed to be resolved bilaterally.This was an informal consultation that was held behind closed doors and no records were kept of who said what, which would have happened in a formal and open meeting. Pakistan has sought open and formal meetings of the council to grandstand its Kashmir case, but has had to settle for these closed-door version; now for the third time starting August 2019, shortly after the change in status of Kashmir.The United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia — four of the permanent five countries called for bilateral resolution of the issues, as it Germany. Russia, in fact sought a resolution of the dispute in keeping with the Simla agreement and the Lahore declaration, said the above cited diplomat.The rebuff of Pakistan was born of “less appetite” in the council for what is now widely recognized as a bilateral issue and “systematic” briefing preemptively of the members particularly on the “developmental front” over the last one year and also the “wrong narrative” put out by Pakistan on the domicile issue, in a an April letter to the UNSC.Pakistan had tried to create an impression that under the new domicile rules released in march, people from all over the country will not descent upon Kashmir and change the demographics of the region. Indians briefed members on the rules, the different categories of who can and not settle there.India was elected to the Security Council in June as a non-permanent member. And as is the practice it began receiving documents circulated to member countries from August and it will sit in on meetings from October purely in observer capacity in preparation for the start of its two-year term in January 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-rebuff-to-pakistan-unsc-says-again-kashmir-should-be-resolved-bilaterally/story-QKb9cmcoMarnYU4zJKeAvO.html
