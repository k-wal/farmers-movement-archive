It appears to be fast losing momentum and support, even within their own respective communities”.Officials said the high commission has been sensitising British authorities and communities in the UK about India’s perspectives and facts, particularly over the last year. Violence during last year’s celebrations led to a diplomatic row and souring of relations with the Labour party, then led by Jeremy Corbyn.The spokesperson added: “We are also highly appreciative of the cooperation received from the UK Government in ensuring the safety and security of the High Commission and its personnel”.Low participation in recent such protests may have been due to coronavirus- related travel restrictions and local lockdowns in UK areas with large population of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir origin. Unlike last year, there was also no prominent figure from Pakistan joining the protest on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/limited-participation-says-mission-on-anti-india-demo-in-london/story-J6zkxwSmnIhN9rbZIJpOaN.html
15-08-2020||World||Donald Trump orders TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell its US assets||President Donald Trump on Friday ordered the Chinese owner of the popular music video app TikTok to sell its U.S. assets, citing national security grounds and delivering the latest salvo in his standoff with Beijing.Trump’s decision came after an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, which reviews proposed acquisitions of American businesses by overseas investors for national security concerns.ByteDance Ltd. bought the app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with TikTok to create a single, integrated social-media application. Trump’s order, in effect, called for a reversal of that transaction.Through its ownership of Musical.ly, Beijing-based ByteDance “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” Trump said in the order.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that “CFIUS conducted an exhaustive review of the case and unanimously recommended this action to the president in order to protect U.S. users from exploitation of their personal data.”CFIUS, which is led by the treasury secretary, includes officials from across 16 government departments and agencies, including State, Defense and Commerce. The White House referred questions on Friday’s decision to the Treasury Department.“As we’ve said previously, TikTok is loved by 100 million Americans because it is their home for entertainment, self-expression, and connection,” TikTok said in a statement. “We’re committed to continuing to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform for many years to come.”The order signed by Trump on Friday sets a 90-day deadline for a possible sale of TikTok to a U.S. buyer, which could be extended for as much as 30 days at the discretion of CFIUS. ByteDance was also ordered to divest and destroy any data obtained or derived from TikTok or Musical.ly app users in the U.S.Yet other recent actions by administration suggest the app’s Chinese owners may have to act more quickly. An executive order issued by the president last week would prohibit U.S. persons and companies from doing business with TikTok effective 45 days from Aug. 6. Trump told reporters on Thursday at the White House that “we have a deadline of Sept. 15” for a deal to be reached.It was unclear how the different deadlines from the administration might work together.The orders, and another one on Aug. 6 that singled out WeChat, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., are consistent with the administration’s increasingly aggressive posture toward Chinese technology giants as relations with the Beijing government deteriorate and Trump faces a tough re-election campaign.In July, the State Department imposed visa restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. over the Chinese Communist Party’s human rights abuses, including against Muslims and other minorities.The U.S. has said that Huawei’s technology could be used by China’s government to spy on Americans. The company has repeatedly said that it is independent of the government.Microsoft Corp. is exploring an acquisition of TikTok’s U.S. operations and it’s possible that other potential buyers could come forward, sparking a potential bidding war for the assets.Microsoft said Friday it did not have an immediate comment.Microsoft’s industry peers -- Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. -- fit the profile of potential suitors, though all are under antitrust scrutiny from U.S. regulators, which would be likely to complicate a deal.A divestiture also could prove technically challenging since it would require rewriting the codes and algorithms that underlie the platform.TikTok has hired almost 1,000 people in the U.S. this year and had planned to employ thousands more but the hiring spree is now on hold, a spokesperson said Friday.In June, the company figured in an embarrassing episode for the president when some users tried to disrupt his campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by registering for thousands of seats at the event. Only a few thousand people showed up, leaving Trump speaking to a largely empty arena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-orders-tiktok-s-chinese-parent-to-sell-its-us-assets/story-KUtVZTXkvzCVDMuhe7W9sL.html
15-08-2020||World||Postal service warns states of delays to mail-in ballots for US election 2020||The US Postal Service has sent warnings to 46 states that it may not be able to deliver their ballots on time for the November election, as Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, blasted the Trump-appointed postmaster general.Former president Barack Obama escalated the Democratic response to the mail slow-down on Friday, accusing President Donald Trump of trying to “actively kneecap the Postal Service” to suppress the vote. The nations mayors said Saturday that safe voting, including vote-by-mail “must be a national priority.”The Postal Service’s inspector general said Friday she’s opened an investigation into complaints by Democrats about cuts to mail services that have slowed delivery of mail and may imperil vote-by-mail operations.The vast majority of states are set to allow mail-in voting in response to the coronavirus pandemic, even as Trump condemns the practice almost daily, saying it’s rife with fraud, though there’s no evidence that is the case. Trump and his wife have requested mail-in ballots for Florida’s primary election, which is Tuesday, CNN reported.Obama, who’s rarely spoken out against his successor since leaving office, pointed to Trump’s recent remarks linking his opposition to $25 billion in emergency postal funding to his fears about mail-in ballots. Trump has also said he won’t approve a request for $3.5 billion for election resources.“That’s sort of unheard of, right?” Obama said in an interview with his former adviser, David Plouffe, on his “Campaign HQ” podcast. On Twitter, Obama urged people to vote early in states where that’s an option. Voting in some states opens in mid-September.On Thursday, Trump said that not approving a financial lifeline for the postal service sought by Democrats would mean that “you can’t have universal mail-in voting, because they’re not equipped to have it.”Congressional Democrats on Friday asked Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a large donor to Trump and other Republicans, to provide more information on cutbacks he ordered at the Postal Service last month. In a letter, they said the service seemed to be reversing a longstanding policy of prioritizing election-related mail.“The Postal Service should not make changes that slow down the mail or in any way compromise service for veterans, small businesses, rural communities, seniors, and millions of Americans who rely on the mail -- including significant numbers of people who will be relying on the Postal Service to exercise their right to vote,” wrote Pelosi and five other top Democrats.Representative Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey, went further. He asked that his state’s attorney general launch a grand jury investigation to consider criminal indictments against Trump and DeJoy for “the subversion of New Jersey state elections.”On Friday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said he would order the November general election to be conducted mostly through the mail in a state that was one of the early US coronavirus hot spots.The escalation in the dispute came after the Postal Service warned election officials in 46 states and the District of Columbia that state deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots were “incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.”“This mismatch creates a risk that ballots requested near the deadline under state law will not be returned by mail in time to be counted under your laws as we understand them,” USPS lawyer Thomas Marshall said in letters released Friday under the Freedom of Information Act.The Postal Service says voters and election officials should allow at least seven days for a ballot to go through the mail.By that standard, more than 20 states would not leave enough time for even a one-way mailing, according to state laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Because many states require a voter to first request an absentee ballot by mail, the back-and-forth mailings could take 15 days or more, depending on the class of mail.The Postal Service changes and the Trump administration’s decision to withhold funding “is alarming and should be of grave concern to us all, particularly with the general election only months away,” Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer said in a statement on Saturday. Fischer, a Democrat, is president of the nonpartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors.On Friday, Pennsylvania officials cited the USPS letter in a request for a judge to extend the deadline for the state to accept mail-in ballots, which is currently Election Day.“The Postal Service’s announcement represents a significant change to the outlook for voting by mail in the general election,” the state said in a legal filing. But prior to the letter, “the Postal Service had not indicated the likelihood of widespread, continuing, multiple-day mail-delivery delays presenting an overwhelming, statewide risk of disenfranchisement for significant numbers of voters utilizing mail-in ballots.”Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said her state was prepared to handle the election. She said ballots were sent out three weeks in advance, and voters could either put them in drop boxes or leave them at voting centers.“Colorado’s election model is well situated to handle both the delivery and return of mail ballots,” Griswold said in a statement. “Starting eight days before an election we encourage voters to use one of these two options rather than the mail to ensure their ballot is received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/postal-service-warns-states-of-delays-to-mail-in-ballots-for-us-election-2020/story-iqiul79gypuYTnKrIa6JeP.html

The United States and the Dominican Republic were the only votes in favour.“I don’t remember the United States preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote!,” Rouhani said in a televised speech.“But the great success was that the United States was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.”The UN arms embargo on Iran is due to expire under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which provided for many international sanctions against Iran being lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Washington withdrew from the deal in 2018.The United States could now follow through on a threat to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Iran using a provision in the nuclear deal, known as snapback. Diplomats have said the United States could do this as early as next week, but that it would face a tough, messy battle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-us-humiliated-by-rejection-of-bid-to-extend-arms-embargo-on-tehran/story-aINlal26JvgB0M2D4R5o4N.html
15-08-2020||World||Iran’s president says UAE made ‘huge mistake’ with Israel deal||The United Arab Emirates has made a “huge mistake” in reaching a deal toward normalising ties with Israel, Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday in a speech furiously condemning what he called a betrayal by the Gulf state.The Iranian hardline daily Kayhan, whose editor-in-chief is appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said “the UAE has turned itself into a legitimate target for the resistance”, according to its website.The UAE-Israel agreement announced on Thursday, which US president Donald Trump helped to broker, is seen as aimed at bolstering opposition to regional power Iran.In his televised speech, Rouhani warned the UAE against allowing Israel a “foothold in the region”.“They (the UAE) better be mindful. They have committed a huge mistake, a treacherous act. We hope they will realise this and abandon this wrong path,” Rouhani said without elaborating.In a front-page comment, the newspaper Kayhan said: “The UAE’s great betrayal of the Palestinian people ..., will turn this small, rich country which is heavily dependent on security into a ‘legitimate and easy target’ for the resistance.”Iran often refers to militant forces and regional countries opposed to Israel and the United States as a “resistance” front.Rouhani said the deal seemed aimed at ensuring that Trump wins another term in the US presidential election in November and referred to the fact that it was announced in Washington.“Why then did it happen now? If it weren’t a wrong deal, why was it then announced in a third country, in America? So a gentleman in Washington wins votes, you betray your country, your people, Muslims and the Arab world?”Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps said in a statement the UAE-Israel deal would “accelerate the process of the destruction of the child-killing Zionist regime (Israel)”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-president-says-uae-made-huge-mistake-with-israel-deal/story-SuAeBGyrL3AEQ4UroeN4LL.html
15-08-2020||World||US calls for credible probe into ‘overwhelming’ Beirut blast||The United States called on Saturday for a transparent and credible investigation into the massive port blast in Beirut that killed 172 people and said Lebanon could never go back to the days “in which anything goes” at its ports and borders.The August 4 blast, which the authorities say was caused by more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored at the port for years, injured 6,000 people, damaged swathes of the city and left 300,000 homeless.Some 30 people remain missing.“Seeing it on television is one thing, seeing it up close is another. It’s really overwhelming,” David Hale, US Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs, said after visiting the port.“We can never go back to an era in which anything goes at the port or the borders of Lebanon that had to contribute to this situation,” Hale said. “Every sovereign state controls its ports and its borders thoroughly and I imagine all Lebanese would like to return to that era.”He added that FBI agents would be arriving this weekend, at the invitation of Lebanon, to help find out what exactly happened and what led to the explosion.The blast has fuelled anger at ruling politicians who were already facing heavy criticism over a financial meltdown that has sunk the currency, left savers unable to withdraw their money, and fuelled poverty and unemployment since October.President Michel Aoun has said a probe will look into whether the cause of the blast was negligence, an accident or “external interference”.The heavily armed Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by the United States, said on Friday it would wait for results of the official Lebanese investigation into the blast.But if it turns out to be an act of sabotage by Israel then it would “pay an equal price”, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address. Israel has denied any role in the explosion.Nasrallah also said his group was against an international investigation because its first purpose would be to “distance Israel from any responsibility for this explosion, if it had responsibility”. He said the participation of the FBI in an investigation would serve the same purpose.Political vacuum The explosion has pitched Lebanon into a new political vacuum since the resignation of the government, which formed in January with backing of Hezbollah and its allies including Aoun.Lebanon’s most senior Christian cleric said the Lebanese people and the international community had run out of patience with ruling politicians.In his strongest intervention yet since the blast, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai also said the church reserved the right to veto any proposals that further jeopardise Lebanon.His comments in a sermon were reported by Lebanese broadcaster LBC.The Maronite church exercises political sway in a country where the head of state must be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the parliament speaker a Shi’ite Muslim.Iran backs Hezbollah and in a visit to Beirut on Friday, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said international efforts should help Lebanon rather than “impose anything on it”.Western visitors including French president Emmanuel Macron and the US State Department’s Hale have called for Lebanon to implement reforms including anti-corruption measures that the country’s leaders have avoided for years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-for-credible-probe-into-overwhelming-beirut-blast/story-wrr7ddjvckS8XHCUayVSrN.html

Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Russia has said the vaccine, the first for the coronavirus to go into production, will be rolled out by the end of this month. Its approval comes before trials that would normally involve thousands of participants, commonly known as Phase III. Such trials are usually considered essential precursors for a vaccine to secure regulatory approval.The vaccine has been named “Sputnik V” in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union. President Vladimir Putin has assured the public that it is safe, adding that one of his daughters had taken it as a volunteer and felt good afterwards.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed the vaccine, said previously that Russia would be producing about 5 million doses a month by December-January, Interfax said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-produces-first-batch-of-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-report/story-4Xj57TsCDanapDJ1vhbacI.html

Also joining the virtual celebration were Harrow mayor Nitin Parekh (Labour) and London deputy mayor Rajesh Agarwal (Labour).Some anti-India elements organised a protest demonstration outside India House, which last year witnessed violence on August 15, when people who gathered to celebrate the day were attacked. The police said an appropriate policing plan is in place to prevent a recurrence.India, Kumar said, is looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Boris Johnson “soon”, as she dwelt in her address on several people-to-people linkages between India and the UK, including the Indian doctors and nurses dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in the NHS.Noting the help extended by the community to the thousands of Indians stranded earlier this year, Kumar said: “High Commission of India complemented the selfless efforts of our diaspora and worked day and night to help more than 28000 stranded Indians reach their homes in India”.“This is the spirit of our diaspora, not only a living bridge, but also a loving one”, she added.Individuals who contributed to the virtual celebration live or in recorded messages included Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, Usha Parashar of Ficci UK, Northern Ireland deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill, industrialist Nat Puri, and Andy Street, mayor of the West Midlands, and Rupanjana Dutta of the Indian Journalists Association..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/74th-independence-day-british-mp-sings-yeh-jo-des-hai-mera-swades-hai-mera/story-OUMoEgigDoYOxJopu9Gj5O.html

A $62 billion figure announced by the Pentagon on Friday is the upper limit of numerous contracts if all potential foreign customers placed their maximum desired number over the decade.The move is likely to be denounced by Beijing, even though the US first signaled its plans to approve the sale a year ago in an informal notification to Congress and it could still be years before the jets are delivered.The announcement said that work on the 90 jets potentially to be sold under Friday’s announcement would be complete by late 2026.Company officials have previously said they project a market for as many as 400 of the new F-16s.When the planned sale was announced in August last year, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry told reporters that “U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely violate the one-China principle.”The spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at the time that her government was urging the U.S. to “refrain” from selling the “fighter jets to Taiwan and stop arms sales to, and military contact with, Taiwan. Otherwise, the Chinese side will surely make strong reactions, and the U.S. will have to bear all the consequences.”Since then, ties with the U.S. have only frayed further, with the two nations in a series of disputes ranging from the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic to 5G technology and Beijing’s tightening grip over Hong Kong. The Trump administration last month rejected China’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, reversing a previous policy of not taking sides in such disputes. The U.S. Navy sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the South China Sea on Friday to conduct maritime air defense operations.In addition to Taiwan, Morocco is buying 24 F-16s jets in the first tranche of 90 aircraft that the Pentagon said was valued at $4.9 billion. The Pentagon announcement didn’t name Taiwan or Morocco, but they have been identified in a previous statement and were confirmed Friday by a person familiar with the contract.The new F-16s are being assembled at Lockheed’s new facility in Greenville, South Carolina, which opened in April 2019. The contracting mechanism used by the Pentagon “will facilitate faster contract awards and greater pricing clarity for our foreign military partners,” Brian Brackens, an Air Force spokesman, said in a statement to Bloomberg News before the contract announcement.“Taiwan and Morocco are expected to be the first two partner nations that will utilize this contract,” Brackens said.The Taiwan F-16s will be equipped with a top-line fire control radar made by Northrop Grumman Corp. Called the APG-83, it would allow precision-guided munitions to be fired at greater distances, said an official familiar with the details.Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Possenriede told analysts on a July 21 earnings call that the company was anticipating a “quite large” F-16 order “that should get announced sometime this quarter” in which “the marquee customer is Taiwan.”The additional 90 F-16s would add to Lockheed’s current 38-aircraft backlog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formalises-f-16-jet-sale-to-taiwan-with-china-tensions-high/story-G2pRWO3GekspbyQpZ7imBM.html
15-08-2020||World||Mike Pompeo signs defense agreement to add 1,000 troops to Poland||Poland and the US signed an expanded defense cooperation agreement that will result in 1,000 additional U.S. personnel being sent to the Eastern European country on a rotational basis.The deal, agreed earlier this month, and signed Saturday in Warsaw by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak, follows the U.S.’s decision to withdraw about 12,000 troops from Germany and plans to redeploy almost half of that number to other nations in Europe.It envisages that Poland will host forward elements of the U.S. Army’s V Corps headquarters and intelligence, and surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities as well as the infrastructure to support an armored brigade combat team and a combat aviation brigade on top of the 4,500 personnel already on rotation in the eastern European nation. Poland will cover the costs of the presence, which its defense ministry estimated at 500 million zloty ($135 million) a year.“I believe the agreement will help boost cooperation in other areas; more security means more investment by American companies, including more cooperation in the energy industry,” President Andrzej Duda said at the signing ceremony.The nations have also been negotiating a bilateral civil nuclear power agreement to help Poland to “decisively move ahead” in building nuclear plants with American technology, the White House said in June.Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller confirmed nuclear power was among the topics raised by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki at his meeting with Pompeo earlier on Saturday.“Excited that the US and PL took another important step towards enhancing Poland’s energy security through the Intergovernmental Agreement on nuclear power,” Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher tweeted on Saturday.Pompeo and Morawiecki also discussed the situation in Belarus, as well as co-operation in 5G network construction, and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would link Russia and Germany. Poland welcomed U.S. sanctions aimed at halting the pipeline’s construction, Muller said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-signs-defense-agreement-to-add-1-000-troops-to-poland/story-glS9g5vlzu9nbKwMYD19xN.html
15-08-2020||World||Mike Pompeo inks deal for United States troops move from Germany to Poland||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday sealed a defense cooperation deal with Polish officials that will pave the way for the redeployment of American troops from Germany to Poland.In Warsaw at the end of a four-nation tour of central and eastern Europe, Pompeo and Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement that sets out the legal framework for the additional troop presence.“This is going to be an extended guarantee: a guarantee that in case of a threat our soldiers are going to stand arm-in-arm,” Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said during the signing ceremony. “It will also serve to increase the security of other countries in our part of Europe,” Duda said.The deal would also further other aspects of US-Polish cooperation, he added, citing primarily investment and trade ties.The pact supplements an existing NATO Status of Forces Agreement and allows for the enhancement and modernization of existing capabilities and facilities by allowing US forces to access additional Polish military installations. It also sets out a formula for sharing the logistical and infrastructure costs of an expanded US presence in the country.Some 4,500 US troops are currently based in Poland, but about 1,000 more are to be added, under a bilateral decision announced last year. Last month, in line with President Donald Trump’s demand to reduce troop numbers in Germany, the Pentagon announced that some 12,000 troops would be withdrawn from Germany with about 5,600 moving to other countries in Europe, including Poland.In addition, several US military commands will be moved out of Germany, including the US Army V Corps overseas headquarters that will relocate to Poland next year.Trump has long and loudly complained that Germany does not spend enough on defense and has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to pay NATO bills, which is a misstatement of the issue. NATO nations have pledged to dedicate 2% of their gross domestic product.Saturday’s signing came just a day after the Trump administration suffered an embarrassing diplomatic loss at the United Nations when its proposal to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran was soundly defeated in a UN Security Council vote that saw only one country side with the US. Pompeo will visit that country, the Dominican Republic, on Sunday for the inauguration of its new president.Pompeo has used his Europe trip to warn the region’s young democracies about threats posed by Russia and China and has received a warm welcome. In Poland, the reception was particularly kind given the friendship between Trump and conservative Polish President Duda, who was sworn in for a second five-year term earlier this month after a hotly contested election.Many of Duda’s Law and Justice party’s policies have put Poland at odds with the European Union, which is concerned that government efforts to reshape the judiciary and other actions have eroded the rule of law and democracy in the EU member country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-inks-deal-for-united-states-troops-move-from-germany-to-poland/story-g5u4dDh262sg4vOD5niq6K.html

15-08-2020||World||From Oxford clinical trial to Russian candidate, latest on Covid-19 vaccine||On the occasion on Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that India is ready to mass-produce Covid-19 vaccine as and when the scientists give it a nod. “Not one, not two, as many as three coronavirus vaccines are being tested in India,” he said from the ramparts of the Red Fort in the national capital. “The country is also ready for mass production of those vaccines,” PM Modi added. The race to developing a vaccine for Covid-19 is intensifying by the day with new contenders joining in and the front runners making great strides.According to the World Health Organisation, over 160 vaccine candidates are in pre-clinical or clinical trials at present, 29 of them are in the clinical trials phase. Six contenders are in final stages, phase-III of human trials. At least eight candidate vaccines are being developed in India of which two are in phase -II trial phase.The latest to create ripples is Russia which recently announced giving a regulatory approval for the “Sputnik V” vaccine for Covid-19. On Saturday, Moscow said it has started manufacturing the new vaccine, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the health ministry. The vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and the first for the coronavirus to go into production, is expected to be rolled out by the end of this month.Also read: ‘Made in India Covid-19 vaccine soon’ - PM Modi in Independence Day speechOxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine trial, which is in phase-III, is expected to get completed by the end of this year. The University of Oxford joined hands with British Swedish firm Astrazeneca to make a vaccine against coronavirus. The vaccine had shown promising results in the first phase of clinical human trial. Pune-based vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) has already received a nod from for India’s top drug regulatory body for conducting phase-II and III clinical trials on the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, Argentine biotech firm working on the production of 400 million doses of an AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine for Latin America said it could begin shipping the active substance of the product to Mexico for completion. Esteban Corley, director of mAbxience, the biotech firm, said he foresaw the finished product could be distributed in Latin America between April and May, news agency Reuters reported. The US government has entered into a $1.5 billion deal with biotechnology company Moderna for the manufacturing and delivery of 100 million doses of its potential Covid-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.

The deals cover a wide range of vaccine types currently in development for Covid-19, as Britain seeks to hedge its bets should one or more of the technologies prove ineffective.“For now that is probably the bedrock of the portfolio. We basically need to see now, what we want to add, if anything, immediately that could diversify the sorts of vaccine that we’ve got in the hopper now,” Kate Bingham, chair of UK Vaccine Taskforce, told Reuters.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “I think we’re well placed... but I think we need to see the data of some of these early vaccines first before we know what is likely to be protective and what is not.”Johnson & Johnson said its Janssen Pharmaceutica unit will supply Britain with its candidate, known as Ad26.COV2.S, with an initial sale of 30 million doses on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use. The advance purchase agreement will also provide an option for an additional purchase of up to a 22 million doses, it said.Separately, Novavax said Britain would buy 60 million doses of its vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373. Novavax will manufacture some of the vaccine using Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies facilities in Stockton-on-Tees, northern England. Alex Harris, head of global policy at the Wellcome Trust health charity, said the deals put the Britain in a strong position, and urged the government to explain how it will now ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for poorer countries too.“Without this...the risk increases that other rich countries will seek to strike similar bilateral deals, potentially ... leaving insufficient volumes of vaccine for the rest of the world,” Harris said in a statement.The Janssen vaccine uses an adenovirus technique to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, while the Novavax shot uses a technology known as recombinant nanoparticle to produce antigens - molecules that are designed to spur the immune system into action.Recent studies show the odds of an experimental vaccine making it from early testing in people to regulatory approval are roughly one in three. J&J said it has also agreed to collaborate with the British government on a global Phase III trial to explore the two-dose regimen of its Covid-19 vaccine, which will run parallel to a Phase III single-dose trials. Britain will also work with Novavax on a late stage British-based trial.No COVID-19 vaccine candidate has yet been proven effective against the disease, but around 20 are in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-lines-up-more-potential-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-with-j-j-novavax-deals/story-ioVDFqzec4xqAueIV5aptI.html

We here, and people in India, of course, have had to face up to the twin challenges of Covid-19 as well as aggression on our borders.”Referring to the twin challenges, Misri said facing up to them would require both effort and sacrifices.Happy Independence Day! 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳74th #IndependenceDay Celebrations held at India House today. #IndiaAt74 #AtmaNirbharBharat pic.twitter.com/cYiU1TT6gAAs India’s ambassador to China, Misri has been at the centre of India’s efforts to keep channels of communication open on the boundary question in the opaque corridors of power in the Chinese capital.Besides reaching out to other embassies and diplomats stationed in Beijing on New Delhi’s position on the border, Misri held two meetings this week with a senior functionary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and senior officer of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which administers the Chinese armed forces.Misri’s meeting with Maj Gen Ci Guowei, director of CMC’s office of international military cooperation on Friday, came two days after the envoy met Liu Jianchao, deputy director of the CPC central committee’s foreign affairs commission.The meetings are part of India’s outreach to the Chinese leadership to resolve the standoff.In context of the Covid-19 outbreak in China, the Indian embassy, and Misri, have also coordinated evacuation flights in February, which flew back hundreds of Indians working and studying in China from Wuhan, the first epicentre of the pandemic from where the infection emerged late last year.“You are in China, things have changed, also, in imperceptible ways, and I am sure in certain cases, this change is impacting upon many of you in daily life,” Misri told the Indian diaspora in context of the Covid-19 outbreak.Assuring the Indian diaspora of help, Misri said even the government of China itself is deploying different policies in order to respond to the evolving pandemic situation and that “We have to adjust ourselves to those policies and do the best for our citizens”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-in-china-facing-twin-challenges-of-covid-19-border-aggression-indian-envoy/story-imEuIra67rJIa4SZfoakIO.html

This is about the UAE, Israel and the United States,” Anwar Gargash, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, said in a phone interview. “This is in no way meant to create some sort of grouping against Iran.”While the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have sought to frame the agreement as part of their attempt to confront and further isolate Iran, Gargash signaled that the UAE isn’t looking to provoke its near neighbor.“We have a very complicated relationship with Iran,” he said. “While we have our concerns, we feel also that resolving these issues should be through diplomacy and de-escalation.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said Turkey could withdraw its ambassador to the UAE over the country’s agreement with Israel, saying it dealt a blow to Palestinian rights. Gargash dismissed the statement as a “double standard” which glossed over Turkey’s own significant trade links with Israel.“They receive over half a million Israeli tourists, have $2 billion worth of bilateral trade and an existing embassy there. And I ask myself whether this is a principled position or not,” Gargash said.Under the deal, Israel agreed to put aside for now its pledge to annex West Bank land the Palestinians want for a state. “We have been very concerned with the issue of annexation,” Gargash said. “Through this imaginative proclamation, we have at least been able to give negotiations space.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-says-pact-not-about-confronting-iran-rejects-erdogan-threat/story-daUf9igc4AaJQse804iK3L.html

15-08-2020||World||Japan marks 75th anniversary of war end with no Abe apology||Japan on Saturday marked the 75th anniversary of its surrender in World War II, with Emperor Naruhito expressing “deep remorse” over his country’s wartime actions at a somber annual ceremony curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic.Naruhito pledged to reflect on the war’s events and expressed hope that the tragedy would never be repeated. There was no word of apology from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Japanese war dead but had nothing to say about the suffering of Japan’s neighbours.“Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated,” Naruhito said in a short speech at the event in Tokyo marking the 75th anniversary of Japan’s surrender on August 15, 1945.Amid virus fears and worries about the fading memories of the fast-aging war generation, about 500 participants, reduced from 6,200 last year, mourned the dead with a minute of silence. Masks were required, and there was no singing of the “Kimigayo” national anthem.Naruhito has promised to follow in the footsteps of his father, who devoted his 30-year career to making amends for a war fought in the name of Hirohito, the current emperor’s grandfather.Abe has increasingly sought to whitewash Japan’s brutal past since taking office in December 2012. He hasn’t acknowledged Japan’s wartime hostilities during August 15 speeches, which had previously been a nearly 20-year tradition that began with the 1995 apology of Socialist leader Tomiichi Murayama.Abe, in a largely domestic-focused speech, said the peace that Japan enjoys today is built on the sacrifices of those who died in the war. He pledged that Japan will reflect on lessons from history and will not repeat the war devastation. He listed damage inflicted on Japan and its people, including the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, massive firebombings of Tokyo and the fierce battle of Okinawa.Abe pledged to play a greater role in tackling global problems. Under his goal of turning Japan into a “beautiful” and “normal” nation, Abe has steadily pushed to cleanse Japan of its embarrassing wartime history and build up its military by stretching the interpretation of Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. It includes acquiring greater missile defense capability in the face of a growing military threat from North Korea and China.“Remembering those days, I strongly feel we should never wage war,” said Shoji Nagaya, 93, who traveled from Hokkaido in northern Japan to commemorate his brother who died of illness while serving in China. “But politicians today seem to have different views than ours, and I really hope that they will not head to a wrong direction.” Abe stayed away from the shrine that honours convicted war criminals among the war dead. He sent a religious offering through a lawmaker, a gesture meant to avoid angering China and South Korea, which consider the Yasukuni shrine a symbol of Japan’s militarism. Abe last visited Yasukuni in December 2013.Four members of his Cabinet did visit the shrine, the first ministerial visit in four years. Among them was Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi who repeatedly visited the shrine on different occasions, including his last visit as serving prime minister on August 15, 2006, that sparked criticism from China and South Korea.“We decide how we want to pay respects to the war dead. This should not be a diplomatic problem,” Internal Affairs Minister Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative who shares Abe’s historical views, told reporters after praying at the shrine.Repeated Yasukuni visits by Japanese government officials “indicates that on the issue of history, Japan has not completely abandoned militarism,” said Wang Shaopu, a Japanese studies professor at Jiao Tong University and honorary president of the Japan Society of Shanghai.“Japan’s invasion of China has brought huge disaster to the Chinese people. Under these circumstances, if Japan doesn’t face up to historical issues, how could we be sure that japan will follow the path of peace in the future?” Kosaburo Tanaka, a martial arts association manager, travelled from Osaka to give thanks for Japan’s postwar peace. “Japan hasn’t been in any war over the last 75 years and we were able to live peacefully. I think that’s all because of the spirits that rest here in Yasukuni. They protect the peace.” Nobuko Bamba a retiree whose grandmother, uncle and aunt died in the March 10, 1945, US firebombing of Tokyo, thinks both sides of history should be remembered.“There are many people who don’t know anything about the war, not only the suffering of the Japanese people, but there are also things that Japanese people did, bad things,” Bamba said. “Unless we teach these things to future generations, I don’t think war would end.” She prayed for her uncle, whose remains have never been found.

15-08-2020||World||United Nations rejects Iran arms embargo extension, crisis looms||The United Nations Security Council overwhelmingly rejected a US resolution to extend an Iranian arms embargo on Friday, in a move with huge repercussions for the Iran nuclear deal.Only two of the Council’s 15 members voted in favour, highlighting the division between Washington and its European allies since President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord in May 2018.Tehran mocked the Trump administration for its failure to win more than just a single vote of support, from the Dominican Republic.Washington’s European allies all abstained.“In the 75 years of United Nations history, America has never been so isolated,” foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi tweeted.“Despite all the trips, pressure and the hawking, the United States could only mobilize a small country (to vote) with them.”The result increases the likelihood that the US will try to unilaterally force a return of UN sanctions, which experts say threatens to plunge the Council into one of its worst-ever diplomatic crises. ‘Inexcusable’“The Security Council’s failure to act decisively in defense of international peace and security is inexcusable,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.The embargo on conventional arms is due to expire on October 18 under the terms of a resolution that blessed the Iran nuclear deal, signed in July 2015 and officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).Under the deal, negotiated by then US president Barack Obama, Iran committed to curtailing its nuclear activities for sanctions relief and other benefits.Since Trump pulled out and slapped unilateral sanctions on Iran under a campaign of “maximum pressure,” Tehran has since taken small but escalating steps away from compliance with the nuclear accord as it presses for sanctions relief.European allies of the United States -- who, along with Russia and China, signed the deal with Iran -- have voiced support for extending the 13-year-long conventional arms embargo, saying an expiry threatens stability in the Middle East.However, their priority is to preserve the JCPOA.The US text, seen by AFP, effectively called for an indefinite extension of the embargo on Iran, which diplomats said would threaten the nuclear agreement.Iran says it has the right to self-defense and that a continuation of the ban would mean an end to the nuclear deal.Pompeo announced that members had failed to back the proposal around 30 minutes before Indonesia, the current president of the Security Council, announced that the official results included two votes against and 11 abstentions.Russia and China opposed the resolution.“The result shows again that unilateralism enjoys no support, and bullying will fail,” China’s UN mission tweeted.‘Snapback’Ambassador Gunter Sautter of Germany, which abstained, said “more consultations are needed” to find a solution that is acceptable to all council members.During a call between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron, the leaders “discussed the urgent need for UN action to extend the arms embargo on Iran”.Earlier Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on China, France, Russia, Britain, the United States, Germany and Iran to convene an emergency video summit to avoid an escalation of tensions in the Gulf.The United States has threatened to try to force a return of UN sanctions if it is not extended by using a controversial technique called “snapback.”Pompeo has offered the contested argument that the United States remains a “participant” in the nuclear accord as it was listed in the 2015 resolution -- and therefore can force a return to sanctions if it sees Iran as being in violation of its terms.European allies have been skeptical on whether Washington can force sanctions and warn that the attempt may delegitimize the Security Council.Nevertheless, the US is expected to deliver the snapback letter next week, AFP understands.Analysts suspect that Washington purposefully put forward a hardline draft that it knew Council members would not be able to accept. “The fact is that everybody at the UN believes this (resolution) is just a prelude to a US effort to trigger snapback and sink the Iranian nuclear deal,” Richard Gowan, a UN expert at the International Crisis Group, told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-rejects-iran-arms-embargo-extension-crisis-looms/story-qS8Mqrl2JfQPZYIh2IcHtI.html
15-08-2020||World||New Zealand PM Ardern seen resisting call to delay September vote as Covid-19 flares up||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is set to decide by Monday whether a general election will go ahead on Sept. 19, with most analysts expecting her to resist opposition calls for a delay due to a flare up in coronavirus infections.A country of five million people, a long way from anywhere, New Zealand has fared far better than most countries during the pandemic, but a spate of new infections forced Ardern earlier this week to lockdown Auckland, the largest city.Seven new cases were reported on Saturday.Having kept New Zealand clear of infections for 102 days straight before the flare-up, Ardern has won praise for her decisive response to the pandemic, and opinion polls have shown her Labour Party in a winning position.Pollsters have been unable to survey voters since the latest outbreak, but analysts expected Ardern to decide to go ahead with the election next month.The opposition National Party would like it delayed, they said, in the hope that Ardern loses some of her lustre once hardships caused by the lockdown begin to bite.“She is a savvy politician,” said Grant Duncan, professor of politics at Massey University. “It pays for the government to have an election sooner rather than later, while the opposition wants it delayed.”Forced to cancel campaign events due to restrictions on movement and crowds due to the health scare, the opposition has accused Ardern of using the pandemic to shore up support as she appears on television nearly everyday to reassure New Zealanders, while their own leaders struggle to draw audiences.Parliament is due to be dissolved on Monday, and Ardern told reporters on Friday that she would have decided by then, while giving assurances that the election commission had already planned for the vote - which must be held by Nov. 21 - to be conducted safely.Pollster and blogger David Farrar said in a post on Kiwiblog that with Auckland still in lockdown for another 12 days, an election in September would be “madness”, predicting a near record low turnout if it went ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-ardern-seen-resisting-call-to-delay-september-vote-as-covid-19-flares-up/story-VC4MSnmfVSq5kfXd4IJZoI.html
15-08-2020||World||Moon says South Korea ready to discuss tensions with Japan||South Korean President Moon Jae-In said his administration remains ready to mend ties with Japan after more than a year of tensions, and as both sides hold ceremonies to remember Japan’s World War II surrender in 1945 that ended its brutal colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula.Moon reiterated a call for Japan to respect its Supreme Court’s decision in 2018 for two Japanese firms to compensate Koreans conscripted to work during the colonial occupation. While Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a speech in Tokyo, didn’t offer any direct apologies for the damage caused in the region from the country’s past militarism, Emperor Naruhito said at the same ceremony that bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse, he hopes “the ravages of war will never be repeated.”Abe on Saturday also spoke of Japan’s new military doctrine of “proactive pacifism.” He has long pressed a revision of Japan’s pacifist constitution and has been accused by critics of trying to whitewash the country’s militarist past.Abe usually marks the anniversary by sending a ceremonial gift via an aide to Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors 14 wartime leaders convicted as Class A war criminals alongside other war dead. He did the same this year, Kyodo News reported. A personal visit to a shrine viewed by some as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism would be seen by Seoul as crossing a diplomatic red line. Abe hasn’t made a pilgrimage since 2013.Still, four members of his Cabinet were at the shrine on Saturday. Japanese Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi -- the 38-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and a rising political star -- paid his respects, becoming the first sitting cabinet minister to do so on the anniversary in four years. Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda and Seiichi Eto, minister in charge of Okinawa and Northern territories affairs, and Internal Affairs Minister Sanae Takaichi also visited.It isn’t immediately clear how the shrine visits will impact relations. Any renewed acrimony between America’s two most powerful allies in Asia could prove troublesome for President Donald Trump, as his administration tries to curtail the nuclear threat from North Korea and seeks support as it steps up its pressure campaign against China, trying to contain Beijing’s push into the South China Sea.Tokyo has said that all claims were settled completely and finally under a 1965 treaty that set up basic relations between the two. Seoul has seen its Supreme Court decision as a victory for human rights, arguing that victims’ individual rights to file a claim have not expired due to the 1965 agreement.“The Supreme Court’s decision has the highest legal authority and enforcement power within the territories of the Republic of Korea,” Moon said in his speech on Saturday to mark Korea’s National Liberation Day. “We are always ready to discuss this matter with Japan.”Moon and Abe have found support at home for taking a hard line against each other. But they both have taken cautious moves in recent years on the anniversary, in a sign that they are aware of the dangers of using the day to overtly antagonize the other.“We will work together with Japan to protect democracy, universal values and principles of international law,” Moon said. “I believe the bilateral cooperation to respect human rights would work as a ‘bridge of friendship’ between the two nations.”Tensions between the two recently intensified after a district court in the eastern South Korean city of Pohang initiated a process which enabled the seizing of shares that Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. has in a joint venture with South Korean steelmaker Posco. Nippon Steel immediately appealed the notice.Apart from the disputes surrounding colonial-era labor, the two U.S. allies are also squaring off at the World Trade Organization over Tokyo’s decision to restrict exports of electronics components vital for South Korea’s tech sector.Moon on Saturday also proposed that North Korea work together in environmental management issues to accelerate inter-Korean reconciliation.The two Koreas are “in the same boat when it comes to protecting the safety of its citizens,” Moon said. “We must co-manage the rivers and streams.”North Korea released water from a border dam water without notifying South Korea last week, a violation of an inter-Korean agreement. It opened the floodgates of Hwanggang Dam on the western inter-Korean border and discharged water into the Imjin River, putting officials in Seoul on alert against the potential rise in water levels.(Updates with Moon’s speech and shrine visits by Japan ministers)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moon-says-south-korea-ready-to-discuss-tensions-with-japan/story-hqnhToNCg0N3gquPSGmxDM.html

Her companion then punched the estimated 3-meter (10-foot) shark until it let her go.“We’ve had some really serious and tragic shark encounters over the past couple of months along the coastline, so to paddle out of your own safety zone, into an area where you know there is a large shark, I think is amazing ... a tremendous act of bravery,” state Surf Life Saving chief executive Steven Pearce said.Beaches in Port Macquarie have been closed for 24 hours as authorities attempt to track the shark.There have been five fatal shark attacks in Australian waters in 2020, higher than the country’s average of three deadly attacks a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surfer-saved-after-friend-punches-shark-in-australian-attack/story-LzbOTwRBe824PrYktw1gcO.html

Best wishes for more progress and prosperity of the people of India.”The PM’s message holds significance as it will be the first since the ties strained between the two nations following the issuance of a new map by the Nepal government incorporating parts of Indian territory.New Delhi has been assisting Kathmandu in various development projects under India-Nepal bilateral initiation to support and strengthen grassroots infrastructure development projects across the Himalayan nation.Projects under this initiative benefit the communities in the project area, particularly in the areas of education, health, connectivity, drinking water and sanitation, vocational training and medical campus. Since 2003, India has completed 422 High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs), covering 77 districts of Nepal with a financial grant of over NRs 798.7 crores, according to the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu.Nepal government had issued the new map of the country in May incorporating Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.India had said that the updated map is “not based on historical facts and evidence” and termed the claims by Nepal as artificial enlargement.External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also said that the move is violative of the current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues.

Another aspect under the scanner is “any efforts or strategies by Amazon that may influence consumers to purchase products it offers for sale over those offered by competing sellers.”The Bureau pointed out that online shopping had increased over threefold in Canada between 2012 and 2018, from CA$ 18.9 billion to CA$ 57.4 billion. Amazon, obviously, has been among the prime destination for digital purchases during the boom, which has persisted through the period of restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The Bureau is a Federal institution that serves “as an independent law enforcement agency” and “ensures that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-federal-agency-launches-probe-into-practices-adopted-by-amazon/story-u8qtmOmDqHsWJ23HxuXcjI.html
15-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Canadian healthcare authorities plan for a resurgence of cases this fall||Canadian healthcare authorities are planning for a resurgence of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases this fall, even as some parts of the country witness a spike related to “fatigue” related to precautionary restrictions among the youth.New modelling released by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) underscores that point, as it noted, “We are planning for a reasonable worst case scenario comprised of a large ‘Fall Peak’ followed by ongoing ‘Peak & Valleys’ in which resource demands intermittently exceed the health and/or public health system’s capacity to manage.” Those peaks and valleys are expected to continue into January 2022. However, the PHAC also stated that there may be the scenario of a “slow burn” where cases are kept controllable and do not stress the healthcare system. Canada has so far recorded 121,523 confirmed cases related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including 9020 fatalities.Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam told reporters that “continuing to build up capacity” while “urging all Canadians to continue with public health practices will give us the best chance of keeping the epidemic on a slow burn, while preparing us in the event of a need to rapidly ramp up response measures for possible larger resurgence.”Worryingly, it stated, “Since early July, the highest incidence of Covid-19 has been reported among individuals aged 20 to 39 years.” This has been attributed to “fatigue” within younger demographics and a spike in cases in provinces like British Columbia has been connected to house parties and increased socialising among the young.This trend has led to authorities trying to get influencers to send out the message to young Canadians. In an audio posted in Twitter, Vancouver-born Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds said, “Young people are partying. Which is of course dangerous. What they probably don’t know is that thousands of people are not just getting sick from coronavirus, they are dying from it too.”Another factor that could contribute to the rise in Covid-19 cases is opening up of various sectors of the economy, as the PHAC stated, “Increases in infection rates are expected as we continue to support economic and social activities, even with appropriate controls in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canadian-healthcare-authorities-plan-for-a-resurgence-of-cases-this-fall/story-0ZXxaJU4xKtjuMyIxvSHCN.html
15-08-2020||World||Donald Trump stokes theory that questions Kamala Harris’ eligibility||US President Donald Trump on Thursday fanned the “birther” debate to target Kamala Harris, the same controversy he had used for years to question former president Barack Obama’s eligibility for the American presidency. Harris is the first Black woman and Indian-American to run for vice-president.Since the announcement of her pick as Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s running mate for the November 3 election, some fringe conservatives have questioned Harris’s eligibility, arguing that while she was born in the US, her parents - mother from India and father from Jamaica - were not naturalised citizens of America at the time.Therefore, they argued, Harris may not be a “natural born citizen” as required by the US constitution to become president or vice-president.“I heard it today that she (Harris) doesn’t meet the requirements, and by the way, the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented,” Trump told reporters on Thursday when asked about questions being raised about Harris being an “anchor baby”, a term often used for children born to non-citizens during visits to the US with the aim of helping the rest of the family immigrate to America. Trump was referring to a column in the Newsweek that first floated this argument.“I have no idea if that’s right,” Trump added. “I would have assumed the Democrats would’ve checked that out before she gets chosen for vice-president.”“That’s very serious... they’re saying she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country?” the US president questioned.When told that Harris was indeed born in the US and that her parents may not have been legal residents or naturalised citizens at the time, he said. “I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I will take a look.”Harris, 55, was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, which makes her a natural born citizen, eligible to run for the White House or any other officer in the US. Her parents had met as graduate students at University of California, Berkeley.The Biden-Harris campaign hadn’t immediately responded to Trump’s tacit support for the unproven theory. Maya Harris, the younger sister of Kamala Harris, later tweeted, “There are no gradations of birtherism. You’re either in or you’re out.”Trump started the “birther” debate in 2011 when he first seriously considered a run for the White House. He questioned Obama’s eligibility for the presidency, wrongly alleging that he was not born in the US. Obama was born in Hawaii, but he felt compelled to release his birth records.Years later, Trump acknowledged that he was wrong. But in the intervening years, he used the same strategy to attack Ted Cruz, the last of his challengers in the Republican primaries. Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada, to a father who was from Cuba and a mother who was a natural born American citizen. Cruz lost the primaries and later went on to support Trump for the White House run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-stokes-theory-that-questions-kamala-harris-eligibility/story-p6Zfz04qzBkmst5ZwO6TYN.html
15-08-2020||World||In bid for peace, Afghan govt starts releasing 400 Taliban prisoners||Afghan authorities said on Friday they have started to release 400 Taliban prisoners, the final hurdle in long-delayed peace talks between the two warring sides, even as President Ashraf Ghani warned they were a “danger to the world”.The Afghan government and the Taliban are set to meet within days of the prisoner release being completed, in a move that has drawn widespread condemnation after it emerged many of the inmates were involved in attacks that killed scores of Afghans and foreigners.A group of 80 prisoners had been released on Thursday, National Security Council spokesman Javid Faisal said, tweeting that it would “speed up efforts for direct talks and a lasting, nationwide ceasefire”.The release of 400 militants was approved at the weekend by a gathering of thousands of prominent Afghans who said they wanted to pave the way for talks to begin in Doha, Qatar, and a possible ceasefire.But the decision has caused heartache for the families of those killed by the insurgents. “If (the Taliban) can’t bring peace and they attack again, thousands of people will be killed and their families will be tormented,” said Bashir Naween, whose brother was killed in a 2017 truck bombing near the Germany embassy in Kabul, an attack involving one of the militants due to be released.The prisoners include at least 44 insurgents of particular concern to the United States and other countries for their role in high-profile attacks, according to an official list seen by AFP.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier this week he had lobbied for a former Afghan army soldier, who went rogue and killed three Australian colleagues, to stay in jail.Ghani warned on Thursday that the hardened criminals were “likely to pose a danger both to us and to (America) and to the world”.“Until this issue, there was a consensus on the desirability of peace but not on the cost of it,” Ghani said in a video conference organised by a US think tank. “We have now paid the major instalment on cost and that means peace will have consequences.”A prisoner swap formed part of a deal signed by the Taliban and the US in February, which saw Washington agree to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan in return for various commitments from the insurgents including a pledge to hold peace talks with the Afghan government.The government was excluded from that deal, which stipulated Kabul release 5,000 militants in return for 1,000 Afghan government prisoners held by the insurgents.The Taliban have warned of possible attacks against the freed prisoners by Islamic State jihadists in coordination with Afghanistan’s spy agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-bid-for-peace-afghan-govt-starts-releasing-400-taliban-prisoners/story-liUsgKnN16FZ7nG5oRf5UM.html
15-08-2020||World||Belarus frees protesters; EU weighs action||Belarusian authorities have released about 1,000 people detained amid demonstrations contesting the results of the presidential election, in an attempt to assuage public anger against a brutal crackdown on peaceful protests and avoid Western sanctions.At least nine European Union countries and the bloc’s executive arm have called for new sanctions on Belarus ahead of emergency talks among member states on Friday. Any EU decision on sanctions would require unanimity. A final decision is expected later this month.Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Denmark called in a joint letter for “restrictive measures against officials” responsible for the election result, which gave President Alexander Lukashenko 80%, and for crackdown on protesters.Germany, Austria and Sweden have already called for sanctions straight away.Diplomatic sources said the main sceptic was Hungary, which has previously called for all EU sanctions on Minsk to be lifted. The head of the EU’s executive arm, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: “We need additional sanctions against those who violated democratic values or abused human rights in Belarus. I am confident today’s ... discussion will demonstrate our strong support for the rights of the people in Belarus to fundamental freedoms and democracy.”The bloc first imposed sanctions on Belarus in 2004. It stepped them up in 2011 over abuses of human rights and democratic standards, including vote rigging. Any new EU sanctions would most likely take the form of travel bans and asset freezes on individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-frees-protesters-eu-weighs-action/story-1iC79zRw35QrJSgR6rRuSJ.html

15-08-2020||World||Iran, Turkey slam UAE over peace deal with Israel||Iran and Turkey lashed out at their regional rival UAE on Friday over its decision to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel, accusing it of betraying the Palestinian cause, even as much of the international community welcomed the move.The US envoy to Israel, meanwhile, said Israel’s plans to annex West Bank was not “off the table”.Iran’s foreign ministry called the US-brokered deal a “dagger that was unjustly struck by the UAE in the backs of the Palestinian people and all Muslims”. Turkey said the peoples of the region “will never forget and will never forgive this hypocritical behaviour” by the UAE.The UAE, which has never fought Israel and has quietly been improving ties for years, said the agreement put a hold on Israel’s plans to unilaterally annex parts of the occupied West Bank, which the Palestinians view as the heartland of their future state.But the Turkish foreign ministry said the UAE had no authority to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the Palestinians or “to make concessions on matters vital to Palestine”.The agreement would make the UAE the first Gulf Arab state - and the third Arab country after Egypt and Jordan - to have full diplomatic ties with Israel. The Palestinians said the deal amounts to “treason” and have called on Arab and Muslim countries to oppose it. The official Palestinian news agency says the Palestinian ambassador to the UAE is being recalled.Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas welcomed both the agreement and the decision to suspend annexation and called to congratulate his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi on “this historic step”. China also said it welcomes “any measure that helps in easing tensions between Middle Eastern countries and promotes regional peace and stability”.The US ambassador to Israel said Israel has not abandoned its plan to annex the West Bank despite Thursday’s agreement.“It’s not off the table, it’s just something that will be deferred until we give peace every single chance,” David Friedman said at a news conference alongside President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-turkey-slam-uae-over-peace-deal-with-israel/story-poaioPovevpvPQwGHBKODP.html
15-08-2020||World||China’s vaccine shows positive signs in trials: Researchers||A coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by a unit of the China National Pharmaceutical Group, called Sinopharm, appeared to be safe and triggered antibody-based immune responses in early and mid-stage trials, researchers said.The candidate has already moved into a late-stage trial, one of a handful of candidates being tested on several thousand people to see if they are effective enough to win regulatory approval.Sinopharm is testing the vaccine in the UAE in a Phase 3 trial expected to recruit 15,000 people, as China has too few new cases to be a useful trial site.The company will also supply the candidate to Pakistan as part of a trial agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported. The shot did not cause any serious side effects, according to a paper published on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association by scientists who are part of Sinopharm and other China-based disease control authorities and research institutes. The results were based on data from 320 healthy adults in Phase 1 and 2 trials. In the US, officials said the government will ensure that a successful Covid-19 vaccine, once it comes up, will be distributed for free to all Americans. “(But) we are not reducing the regulatory rigour with which we will evaluate and approve vaccines,” Paul Mango, a senior health department official, told reporters. Washington has invested more than $10 billion in six vaccine projects and signed contracts guaranteeing the delivery of hundreds of millions of doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-vaccine-shows-positive-signs-in-trials-researchers/story-vfa1YB2ECZTDtZ6I0A2N5K.html

Fines for those not wearing masks have bee doubled to £3,200. New fines were introduced for people hosting rave parties or other unlawful gatherings of more than 30 people.The piloting of a small number of sporting events to test the safe return of spectators will resume from Saturday with a view to reopening competition venues for sports fans, with social distancing measures in place from October 1.British holidaymakers faced a scramble to get home on Friday after the government said it will reimpose a 14-day quarantine for travellers from France and the Netherlands, prompting Paris to quickly announce a “reciprocal measure”.The UK government said the change will kick in on Saturday, likely sparking a mass exodus among the estimated 160,000 British holidaymakers currently in France.The head of France’s national health service said Paris and Marseille have been declared at-risk zones for the coronavirus as authorities observed a sharp increase in Covid-19 infections. Jerome Salomon warned “the situation is deteriorating from week to week” in the country. He said virus clusters are emerging every day following family reunions, big parties and other gatherings amid summer holidays.New Zealand’s government on Friday extended a lockdown of its largest city Auckland for another 12 days as it tries to stamp out its first domestic outbreak in more than three months, which has grown to 30 people and extended beyond Auckland for the first time. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has lifted a three-week lockdown in the city of Kaesong after a suspected case of the coronavirus there. Authorities locked down the city bordering South Korea, and declared an emergency in the area last month after a North Korean who had defected to the South slipped back into the town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ire-chaos-as-uk-adds-france-to-quarantine-list/story-bjhrzjpXnEW6Sd5kcb0jOI.html
15-08-2020||World||Google to stop responding directly to data requests from HK govt||Alphabet’s Google said on Friday it would no longer provide data in response to requests from Hong Kong authorities following the enactment of a new national security law imposed by China.The US tech giant had not produced any data since the sweeping new law took force in June and would not directly respond to such requests henceforth, it added.“As always, authorities outside the US may seek data needed for criminal investigations through diplomatic procedures,” Google said in an emailed statement. Google reviewed all requests for user data and pushed back on “overly broad ones” to protect the privacy of users, the statement added. The Washington Post newspaper reported earlier on Friday that Google would stop responding directly to data requests from Hong Kong authorities, implying the company would now treat Hong Kong effectively the same as mainland China in such dealings.The national security law has drawn criticism from the administration of US President Donald Trump and further raised US-China tensions after Washington’s decision to end the former British colony’s special status under US law.Google notified Hong Kong police on Thursday that it would direct officials to pursue any requests for data through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States, which involves routing through the US justice department, The Washington Post reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-stop-responding-directly-to-data-requests-from-hk-govt/story-Pzchw0SLQjmKiNlJzwOhzL.html

The death toll from the deadly explosion has risen to nearly 178, with an estimated 6,000 people injured and at least 30 missing, the United Nations said on Friday.The blast, the most destructive in Lebanon’s troubled history caused damage of up to $15 billion. Among the damaged structures were museums, historic buildings, art galleries and religious sites in Beirut.The most affected areas in the capital were the historic quarters of Gemayzeh and Mar Mikhael that face the port and that were known for their active night life, with many old buildings turned to pubs or restaurant.“The international community has sent a strong signal of support to Lebanon following this tragedy,” said Ernesto Ottone, assistant Unesco director-general for culture.“Unesco is committed to leading the response in the field of culture, which must form a key part of wider reconstruction and recovery efforts.” Unesco’s statement quoted Sarkis Khoury, director-general of antiquities at the ministry of culture in Lebanon, as saying that at least 8,000 buildings, many concentrated in Gemayzeh and Mar Mikhael, were affected. Among them are some 640 historic buildings, approximately 60 of which are at risk of collapse, he said.Also affected was Beirut’s eastern neighbourhood of Achrafieh where the landmark Sursock Museum is located as well as other neighbourhoods that are home to the National Museum and the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut, Unesco said.Unesco said that it will lead the international mobilisation “for the recovery and reconstruction of Beirut’s culture and heritage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-puts-death-toll-at-178-several-historic-buildings-facing-collapse/story-XXC2jhzLHAF4Qv6cZbR78N.html

The findings are the result of a two-year investigation in response to a complaint by Asian-American groups concerning Yale’s conduct, the department said in a statement on Thursday.The department said it was prepared to file a lawsuit against Yale if the school, in New Haven, Connecticut, did not take “remedial measures”.A Yale spokeswoman said the university “categorically denies” the allegations but has cooperated fully with the investigation.The justice department made its findings before allowing Yale to provide requested documents, Yale said. “Had the department fully received and fairly weighed this information, it would have concluded that Yale’s practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent,” the spokeswoman said.The justice department said that although race can lawfully be considered in college admissions in limited circumstances, “Yale’s use of race is anything but limited”.The elite school “uses race at multiple steps of its admissions process resulting in a multiplied effect of race on an applicant’s likelihood of admission”, the justice department said.The justice department has previously filed legal briefs in support of a lawsuit, brought by affirmative action opponents, accusing Harvard University of discriminating against Asian Americans.A federal judge in Boston ruled in favour of Harvard last year, saying the school’s affirmative action programme advanced a legitimate interest in having a diverse student body.An appeal of that ruling is pending. The case could eventually reach the Supreme Court.Affirmative action programmes in higher education were meant to address racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled universities may use affirmative action with the aim of helping minority applicants get into college.US conservatives have said that in helping Black and Latino applicants, affirmative action can hurt white people and Asian Americans||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-yale-discriminated-against-asians-whites/story-9OgO4pPB7fiP9qo3cGQVuJ.html

The development comes even as Pakistan has failed to get traction over the Kashmir issue on international forums.On August 5 last year, India revoked the special status of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and bifurcated it into two Union Territories (UTs). A majority of the Muslim countries recognise India’s decision.Recently, Pakistan had to pay back Saudi Arabia USD 1 billion out of a USD 3 billion loan that it secured one and a half year ago to avoid default on international debt obligations after the kingdom decided to reduce its financial support.This came after Pakistan was pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) since India abrogated Article 370.In a report published by Dawn, a Pakistani daily, a Pakistan diplomatic source confirmed that Saudi Arabia had shown reluctance to accept Islamabad’s request for an immediate meeting of OIC foreign ministers’ on Kashmir.India has urged Pakistan to not interfere in its internal affairs repeatedly, saying it will not make its “untenable” claims acceptable.Pakistan has also observed a “Kashmir Solidarity Day”, but failed to get much traction for the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-again-rakes-up-kashmir-issue-on-pak-s-independence-day/story-B4kABtJ5msN5skk0a9Ud3O.html
