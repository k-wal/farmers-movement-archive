26-08-2020||World||Court: School transgender bathroom policy unconstitutional||A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that a Virginia school board’s transgender bathroom ban is unconstitutional and discriminated against a transgender male student who was barred from using the boys bathrooms in his high school.The ruling is a victory for transgender rights advocates and Gavin Grimm, a former student at Gloucester High School who was required to use restrooms that corresponded with his biological sex — female — or private bathrooms.A three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Gloucester County School Board violated Grimm’s constitutional rights when it banned him from using the boys bathrooms.The panel upheld a decision from a federal judge in Norfolk who ruled last year that Grimm’s rights were violated under the US Constitution’s equal protection clause as well as under Title IX, a federal civil rights law that protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance.Grimm’s lawsuit became a federal test case when it was supported by the administration of then-President Barack Obama. It was scheduled to go before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017, but the high court hearing was canceled after President Donald Trump rescinded an Obama-era directive that students can choose bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.During arguments before the 4th Circuit in May, Grimm’s lawyer said the board treated Grimm differently than other students when it required him to use separate but unequal facilities — either bathrooms that corresponded with his biological sex — female — or private bathrooms.“They were stigmatizing and humiliating,” said Joshua Block, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.Grimm began transitioning from female to male while he was a student at Gloucester High School, located in a mostly rural area about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east of Richmond. He had chest reconstruction surgery and hormone therapy. In 2016, when he was in 12th grade, he obtained a Virginia court order and Virginia birth certificate declaring his sex as male.David Corrigan, a lawyer for the school board, argued that the law protects against discrimination based on sex, not gender identity.Grimm, now 21, graduated in 2017. He now lives in California and is an activist for transgender rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-school-transgender-bathroom-policy-unconstitutional/story-dY1pfFimL9gcNKVT6X0uKM.html
26-08-2020||World||Mike Pence speech to involve veterans in rebuttal to athlete protests||Vice President Mike Pence’s speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday will involve combat veterans in a display of patriotism -- imagery intended at least in part as criticism of professional athletes who kneel during the national anthem.The scene, to be staged at historic Fort McHenry outside Baltimore, according to people familiar with the matter, promises to unfold as another example of President Donald Trump’s efforts to use the country’s cultural and racial divisions for political gain.The people asked not to be identified because the involvement of the veterans is intended as a surprise for viewers.Pence will deliver the keynote address on the convention’s third night, a spotlight moment before a national television audience for a vice president believed to have White House ambitions of his own.Trump and Pence have each denounced professional athletes -- mainly Black football players -- who kneel during the National Anthem to protest police brutality. Pence said he left an Indianapolis Colts game early in 2017 because some players kneeled during the anthem, and Trump has urged NFL owners to bench or fire players who protest, at one point referring to them as “son of a bitch.”The NFL initially discouraged the protests, adopting a policy in 2018 that players who didn’t want to stand during the anthem should stay in the locker room. But like many corporations, the league has moved rapidly to embrace the Black Lives Matter movement since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued an apology in June “for not listening to NFL players earlier” and encouraged future peaceful protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-speech-to-involve-veterans-in-rebuttal-to-athlete-protests/story-XdHaApomCxhHHkn86He4jK.html
26-08-2020||World||2 people shot to death during protest over Kenosha shooting||Two people were shot to death and another was wounded during a third night of protests in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, and authorities Wednesday hunted for a possible vigilante seen on cellphone video opening fire in the middle of the street with a rifle.The gunfire was reported just before midnight, and Sheriff David Beth said one victim was shot in the head and another in the chest, the Milwaukee Journal Sentine l reported. The third victim’s wounds were not believed to life-threatening.He said that investigators had reviewed footage of what happened and that he was confident a man would be arrested soon.Beth told the Journal Sentinel that armed people had been patrolling the city’s streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them.Also read: Cops, protesters clash for 3rd night over black man’s shooting in Wisconsin’s Kenosha“They’re a militia,” Beth said. “They’re like a vigilante group.” Cellphone video of at least two of the shootings that was posted online shows what appears to be a white man with a semi-automatic rifle jogging down the middle of a street as a crowd and some police officers follow him. Someone in the crowd can be heard asking, “What did he do?” and another person responds that the man had shot someone.The man with the gun stumbles and falls, and as he is approached by people in the crowd, he fires three or four shots from a seated position, hitting at least two people, including one who falls over and another who stumbles away to cries of “Medic! Medic!” A witness, Julio Rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled and fell, “two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. At that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds and that dispersed people near him.” “The rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,” Rosas said.In the cellphone footage, as the crowd scatters, the gunman stands up and continues walking down the street as police cars arrive. The man puts up his hands and walks toward the squad cars, with someone in the crowd yelling at police that the man had just shot someone, but several of the cars drive past him toward the people who had been shot.Protester Devin Scott told the Chicago Tribune that he witnessed one of the shootings.“We were all chanting ‘Black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and I told my friend, `’That’s not fireworks,’” said Scott, 19. “And then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘He shot someone! He shot someone!’ And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him and then he started shooting again.” Scott said he cradled one of the lifeless victims in his arms, and a woman started performing CPR, but “I don’t think he made it.” At a news conference earlier Tuesday, Ben Crump, the lawyer for Blake’s family, said that Blake was shot multiple times by police on Sunday and that it would “take a miracle” for him to walk again. He called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs.The shooting of Blake — apparently while three of his children looked on — was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests over racial injustice in the US just three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police touched off a wider reckoning on race.Kenosha police have said little about what happened, other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. They have not said why the officers opened fire or whether Blake was armed, and they have not disclosed the race of three officers who were on the scene.The 29-year-old Blake underwent surgery Tuesday, according to Crump, who added that the bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered his vertebrae. Another attorney said there was also severe damage to organs.Blake’s father, also named Jacob Blake, told the Chicago Sun-Times that his son had eight holes in his body. At a news conference, he said police shot his son “seven times, seven times, like he didn’t matter.” “But my son matters. He’s a human being and he matters,” he said.Blake’s mother, Julia Jackson, told CBS “This Morning” in an interview that aired Wednesday that she feels as if she is in a “bad dream” and that it felt “unreal” that her son’s name has been added to the list of Black people who were shot by police.“Never in a million years did I think we would be here in this place. Him being alive is just a miracle in itself,” she said.During the latest round of unrest Tuesday, police fired tear gas for the third straight night to disperse protesters who had gathered outside Kenosha’s courthouse, where some shook a protective fence and threw water bottles and fireworks at officers lined up behind it.On Tuesday, before the two deadly shootings, Kenosha County Board sent a letter to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers requesting that at least 2,000 more National Guard troops be sent. Evers initially dispatched 150 troops on Monday and increased that to 250 on Tuesday.Evers did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.On Monday night, crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires downtown.“Our county is under attack. Our businesses are under attack. Our homes are under attack. Our local law enforcement agencies need additional support to help bring civility back to our community,” the county board leaders wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-people-shot-to-death-during-protest-over-kenosha-shooting/story-Zkg1Alxu0AW5TgXQjNRvgJ.html

Kim addressed “some shortcomings” in the preventive efforts and called for stronger measures to eliminate “defects”, KCNA said.Last month Pyongyang imposed a lockdown on the city of Kaesong, close to the border with the South, claiming a defector who had returned was suspected of carrying the virus. The restrictions were lifted earlier this month and the infection was never confirmed.The meeting also discussed emergency measures to prevent crop damage or casualties from Typhoon Bavi, which is forecast to hit the country this week.There have been days of heavy rain across parts of North Korea, which is vulnerable to flooding as many mountains and hills have long been stripped of vegetation, allowing water to flow downhill unchecked.Kim laid out tasks for various departments, saying thoroughly preventing casualties and crop damage was “crucial”, KCNA reported.Several analysts have played down suggestions that Kim’s health is deteriorating and Seoul’s intelligence agency has a mixed record with its past pronouncements on developments in the North.Earlier this year Kim was absent from public view for nearly three weeks, missing a key celebration in April for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder -- the most important day in the country’s political calendar -- prompting widespread questions over his condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-issues-warning-on-covid-19-as-health-speculation-swirls/story-BkGVo1zxkL5FY5NPnWTehN.html
26-08-2020||World||‘Polishing the gun’: China, US tensions raise Taiwan conflict fears||Numerous Chinese and US military exercises, Taiwan missiles tracking Chinese fighters and plummeting China-US ties make for a heady cocktail of tension that is raising fears of conflict touched off by a crisis over Taiwan.In the last three weeks, China has announced four separate exercises along its coast, from the Bohai Gulf in the north to the East and Yellow Seas and South China Sea, along with other exercises it said were aimed at “the current security situation across the Taiwan Strait”.Meanwhile Taiwan, claimed by China as its “sacred” territory, said its surface-to-air missiles had tracked approaching Chinese fighters - details Taiwan does not normally give - as US Health Secretary Alex Azar was visiting the island this month.Addressing the Chinese exercises, Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Tuesday the closer Chinese jets get to the island the “more actively” Taipei would respond, though it would “not escalate conflict” nor “trigger an incident”.The United States sent another warship through the Taiwan Strait this month, a few days after a US carrier group conducted an exercise in the disputed South China Sea, and this week China complained a US spy plane had observed Chinese live-fire exercises.Chinese military expert Ni Lexiong, a retired professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said it was very rare and possibly the first time multiple Chinese exercises were taking place at the same time.“By simultaneously conducting drills in the three seas, it means China is testing its ability to fight enemies coming from three directions at the same time - for example from Taiwan, from Japan and from the US from the south,” he said.“Historically, frequent drills are a clear predictor of war.”‘Dismay and concern’ Taiwan-based security and diplomatic sources say the chances of “firing off a shot while polishing the gun” - a Chinese saying for an accidental encounter setting off a broader conflict - are rising mainly because of increased US and Chinese military activity in the region.“Neither side wants to start a conflict. The fundamentals have not changed much,” said a Western diplomat looking into military activities across the Taiwan Strait. “But the frequent activities do increase the chances of an accidental conflict,” the diplomat said.China’s defence ministry and its Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to requests for comment, and neither did the Pentagon nor US State Department.China’s foreign ministry said in statement sent to Reuters: “We have the determination and capability to stop any activities aimed at separating Taiwan from China”. A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that China was becoming more assertive and more aggressive in the region and there was concern its military could miscalculate, leading to unexpected consequences.     “This is an issue that is broader than Taiwan and broader than just the United States,” the official said.“I would argue that there are many like-minded countries in the region that are viewing with dismay and increasing concern the trend lines coming out of Beijing.”To the last soldier The Trump administration has been taking an escalating array of measures against China in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, adding to the uncertainty.A hypothetical scenario spelled out in a recent essay by James Winnefeld, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Michael Morrell, former acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has made the rounds in Taiwan security circles. In their suggested sequence of events, set out in the Proceedings of the US Naval Institute, a disputed US election gives China the opportunity to move on Taiwan while Washington and the world are distracted. In Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen has responded to the tension with pledges to defend the island.She and her government have denounced as scaremongering and kowtowing to Beijing a campaign this month by former president Ma Ying-jeou, who held a landmark meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, to warn that Taiwan is courting disaster by needling China and would not last long in a war.Still, Taiwan has been keen to show its teeth. Its defence ministry this month issued two slickly produced videos showing missiles being fired and F-16s in the air to demonstrate their resolve to defend the island.“Dare to fight, and fight to the last soldier,” the ministry said in a caption for the latest video, released on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polishing-the-gun-china-us-tensions-raise-taiwan-conflict-fears/story-VbsGRGh6qt7B0ZyrF9gJON.html

According to the yet-to-be published findings, the vaccine combined with the Seqirus MF59 adjuvant, provided protection against virus reproduction in hamster models, and reduced lung inflammation, following exposure to the virus.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Associate Professor Keith Chappell, who is the project co-leader, has reported to the International Society for Vaccines on the data from animal trials conducted by Viroclinics-DDL in the Netherlands, according to a statement. “The neutralising immune response created by our molecular clamp vaccine in animal models was better than the average level of antibodies found in patients who have recovered from COVID-19,” Chappell said. “It also induces a strong T-cell response and showed strong results when it came to data relating to manufacturability,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  The researchers noted that one of the big challenges in the development of vaccines is the ability to produce them at sufficient scale for widespread use. They said the phase 1 study being conducted in Queensland is progressing well and assuming the study demonstrates adequate safety and immune responses, data should be available in time to commence the required large-scale efficacy study before the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promising-results-in-animal-trials-report/story-xlSaxMg7MeTLk4bvy4uV7N.html

The protests have drawn support from the German far right.Officials said that those protesting would likely have breached rules on social distancing designed to stop the spread of the virus. Germany has seen an upswing in infections in recent weeks and the government is considering whether to impose fresh restrictions again.Authorities in the capital cited a rally against Covid-19 restrictions on August 1 during which participants ignored mask-wearing and distancing rules and other conditions imposed on the protest.Berlin’s top security official, Andreas Geisel, welcomed the decision.“We need to weigh the basic right of freedom of assembly against the sanctity of life,” he said in a statement. “We chose life.” Geisel said police would act to stop any large gathering of people and indicated that authorities wouldn’t tolerate a tent camp that protesters have erected near the German parliament.“I’m not prepared to accept that Berlin is abused a second time as a stage for corona deniers ... and right-wing extremists,” he said.Numerous leading figures in the country’s far-right scene, including members of the Alternative for Germany party, had announced they would participate in rallies in Berlin on Saturday.The party’s leader in the Berlin state assembly, Georg Pazderski, criticized the decision to ban the protests, calling it disproportionate and unjustified.The protest ban can be appealed in court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berlin-bans-weekend-protests-against-anti-coronavirus-measures/story-xW5AuMmSKpmaSlrVXzf83N.html

That speech cast aside his own advice to American diplomats to be apolitical and bulldozed a long tradition of non-partisanship by previous secretaries of state.In Manama, Pompeo is expected to meet with King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and his son, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The State Department has not offered any word on what Pompeo will bring up during the meeting, though it comes after a U.S.-brokered deal announced Aug. 13 saw the United Arab Emirates and Israel open diplomatic relations.Bahrain, a small island nation just off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf, has a historic Jewish community. The kingdom has slowly encouraged ties to Israel, with two U.S.-based rabbis in 2017 saying King Hamad himself promoted the idea of ending the boycott of Israel by Arab nations. That boycott had been in place to offer Palestinians support in their efforts to form an independent state.Bahrain is also home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet and remains a close security partner of the U.S. Pompeo arrived there Tuesday night and met Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani, wearing an American-flag-colored face mask amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Later on Wednesday, Pompeo is expected in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the seven-sheikhdom federation of the UAE. There, he will speak with his Emirati counterpart and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-to-have-closed-door-meetings-with-royal-family-in-bahrain-uae-s-top-officials/story-zCmp5lRJnzPgOILmigdivM.html

Wang said that probe had an “entirely different origin” from the Australian proposal.Also read: China protests US spy plane watching live fire military drillsChina has maintained ministerial contacts with the United States as well as governments of other countries that supported Australia’s pandemic stance, including Japan, Germany and France.Wang denied China was singling out Australia for special treatment by freezing out ministers to send a message to other middle-powers not to speak out.“I think it’s a very lopsided interpretation of what happened between us,” Wang told reporters.He declined to say whether he thought Chinese-Australian relations would improve after the U.S. presidential election, saying Chinese comment on another country’s election would equate to interference in that nation’s internal affairs.China respects Australia’s strategy alliance with the United States, Wang said.“To have an ally is not a problem,” he said. “The problem is whether you target a third party with the strength of an alliance.”“If we find any tendency to use the strength of an alliance to strike China down, or press China down — what currently some of the U.S. politicians are doing — then we will express clearly our opposition and our position,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-envoy-says-australia-betrayed-china-for-us-on-covid-19/story-PKD1fPX8G1UpFtWnpiQnSI.html

It is titled ‘Melania & Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady’.Among the explosive claims made by Wolkoff in the memoir are the negative and harsh comments made by the first lady against Trump and his adult children. The comments were reportedly caught on tape by her.She claims in the book that Melania Trump was once furious at Ivanka for obstructions as she tried to appoint a new chief of staff, a number of publications reported.There are incidents of remarks against President Trump too, but those have not been made public. However, a journalist tweeted about the book and the claims made in it.“In her book, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff quotes the First Lady making disparaging remarks about Ivanka Trump and some of the president’s other adult children. She even makes some negative remarks about her husband, President Trump,” Yashar Ali said in a series of tweets on the topic. 4. I'm told that Wolkoff says in her book that most of Mrs. Trump's disparaging comments about the Trump family were reserved for Ivanka Trump. Again, multiple sources confirmed to me that Wolkoff taped some of her conversations with the first ladyhttps://t.co/XV45pvQkX6“It’s unclear what Wolkoff says that Mrs. Trump said about her family but I do know that the disparaging remarks are in the book and that Wolkoff taped conversations with Mrs. Trump without her knowing,” Ali further said. 5.

26-08-2020||World||Two Hong Kong opposition lawmakers arrested over anti-govt protests in 2019||Two prominent Hong Kong opposition lawmakers were among more than a dozen people arrested on Wednesday in a police operation focused on last year’s huge protests, part of a widening crackdown against the city’s democracy camp.Lam Cheuk-ting and Ted Hui were detained after early-morning raids on their homes, according to their political party and the police.Opposition figures decried the arrests, which add to a mounting toll of prosecutions targeting Beijing’s critics in the restless financial hub.“This is out-and-out political persecution,” James To, a veteran lawyer and member of the Democratic Party, told reporters after the arrests.A police source told AFP that 16 people -- including Lam and Hui -- were arrested during Wednesday’s operation, which focused on protests in July last year.Both are minority pro-democracy lawmakers in the city’s partially elected legislature and vocal critics of both Beijing and the Hong Kong government.A post on Lam’s Facebook page said he was arrested “on suspicion of participating in rioting on July 21” last year.That day, Lam and dozens of pro-democracy protesters were beaten by a gang of government supporters, some with “triad” organised crime links, in the town of Yuen Long.Police were late to arrive on the scene and were also filmed allowing some of the armed attackers to leave -- scenes that sent already swirling distrust of the force skyrocketing and helped fuel further months of protests.Lam was also charged with “conspiring to damage property and obstruction of justice outside Tuen Mun police station on July 6 last year”, the statement said.No reconciliation Hui’s office released video footage of his arrest where officers said they were charging him with attempted obstruction of justice, access to a computer with criminal or dishonest intent and criminal damage.He was later led from his house in handcuffs. The party said his charges also stemmed from a protest on July 6 last year.Police said a press conference would be held later in the day.Beginning in early June 2019, Hong Kong was hit by seven straight months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests in which more than 9,000 people were arrested.The popular unrest upended the city’s reputation for stability and sparked a crackdown by China that has gathered pace this year.In late June, Beijing imposed a sweeping new security law, tightening Communist Party control over the semi-autonomous city and ending the legal firewall between the two territories.Certain political views such as advocating independence or greater autonomy for Hong Kong became illegal overnight and arrests have followed.In response to the law, many Western nations ended extradition agreements with Hong Kong. The United States has placed sanctions on some Chinese and Hong Kong officials and declared the business hub no longer sufficiently autonomous from the authoritarian mainland.The democracy protests died down at the start of 2020 thanks to mass arrests and anti-coronavirus restrictions.City leader Carrie Lam began the year vowing to heal divisions.But police have since arrested dozens of prominent pro-democracy figures on a slew of charges related to the rallies, with the courts now filled with hearings and trials.Authorities have denied allegations the investigations are politically motivated.Wu Chi-wai, chairman of the Democratic Party, said the latest arrests would do little to heal divisions.“The government is wielding the legal system and the police force to suppress dissenting voices within society and create a chilling effect instead of trying to reconcile confrontation and polarisation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-hong-kong-opposition-lawmakers-arrested-over-anti-govt-protests-in-2019/story-lQvHIO2Zhaw6uoWpNGKagO.html
26-08-2020||World||Cops, protesters clash for 3rd night over black man’s shooting in Wisconsin’s Kenosha||Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters during a third night of unrest in this southeastern Wisconsin city following the shooting of a Black man whose attorney said he was paralyzed after being shot multiple times by police.A group of protesters walked toward a fence that was put in place Tuesday around the courthouse and started shaking it. Police behind it moved toward protesters as some threw water bottles and fireworks over the fence. Armoured vehicles then rolled in and tear gas was fired into the crowd.When police ordered protesters to disperse, the crowd responded by chanting “Black lives matter.” Police then fired rubber bullets.Jacob Blake, the man shot by police responding to a domestic disturbance on Sunday, is paralyzed, and it will “take a miracle” for him to walk again, his family’s attorney said Tuesday, while calling for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and others involved to lose their jobs.The shooting of Blake on Sunday in Kenosha — apparently in the back while three of his children looked on — was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests over racial injustice in several cities, some of which have devolved into unrest. It came just three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police touched off a wider reckoning on race.“They shot my son seven times, seven times, like he didn’t matter,” said Blake’s father, who is also named Jacob Blake and who spoke to reporters alongside other family members and lawyers. “But my son matters. He’s a human being and he matters.” The 29-year-old was in surgery, said attorney Ben Crump, adding that the bullets severed Blake’s spinal cord and shattered his vertebrae. Another attorney said there was also severe damage to organs.“It’s going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr. to ever walk again,” Crump said.The legal team plans to file a civil lawsuit against the police department over the shooting. Police have said little about what happened, other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute. The officers involved have not been named. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating.After a night during which protests devolved into unrest, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers had called for calm Tuesday, while also declaring a state of emergency under which he doubled the National Guard deployment in Kenosha from 125 to 250. The night before crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires in the city’s downtown.“We cannot allow the cycle of systemic racism and injustice to continue,” said Evers, who is facing mounting pressure from Republicans over his handling of the unrest. “We also cannot continue going down this path of damage and destruction.” Blake’s mother, Julia Jackson, said the damage in Kenosha does not reflect what her family wants and that, if her son could see it, he would be “very unpleased.” She said that the first thing her son said to her when she saw him was he was sorry.“He said, ‘I don’t want to be a burden on you guys,’“ Jackson said. “’I want to be with my children, and I don’t think I’ll walk again.’” Three of the younger Blake’s sons — aged 3, 5 and 8 — were in the car at the time of the shooting, Crump said. It was the 8-year-old’s birthday, he added.The man who said he made the cellphone video of the shooting, 22-year-old Raysean White, said he saw Blake scuffling with three officers and heard them yell, “Drop the knife! Drop the knife!” before the gunfire erupted. He said he didn’t see a knife in Blake’s hands.In the footage, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns drawn and shout at him. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard, though it isn’t clear how many struck Blake or how many officers fired.Blake’s father told the Chicago Sun-Times that his son had eight holes in his body.Anger over the shooting has spilled into the streets of Kenosha and other cities, including Los Angeles, Wisconsin’s capital of Madison and in Minneapolis, the epicenter of the Black Lives Matter movement this summer following Floyd’s death.Hundreds of protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew Monday night, massing in downtown Kenosha, where they were met by a wall of law enforcement officers, including members of the Wisconsin National Guard.Some clashed with officers and vandalized businesses. There were 34 fires associated with the unrest, with 30 businesses destroyed or damaged along with an unknown number of residences, Kenosha Fire Chief Charles Leipzig told the Kenosha News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cops-protesters-clash-for-3rd-night-over-black-man-s-shooting-in-wisconsin-s-kenosha/story-vzORByfPqT88y7D0ojDx6L.html

Doctors’ groups say such measures would worsen what’s already a cut-throat market.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSouth Korea’s Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention reported 320 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 237 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan region, which has been the center of a viral resurgence in recent weeks. Health workers have struggled to stem transmissions linked to various places and groups, including churches, schools, restaurants and door-to-door salespeople.Park’s ministry said more than 2,000 medical facilities nationwide had reported their intentions to close for Wednesday after doctors’ groups, including the Korean Medical Association and the Korean Intern Resident Association, expressed dissatisfaction over their negotiations with government officials.Park said doctors who refuse to return to work could possibly have their licenses suspended or revoked, or even face a prison term of less than 3 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-south-korea-urges-striking-doctors-to-return-to-work/story-LF2wjM6XzJuWveRge9TlZI.html
26-08-2020||World||Melania Trump addresses racial unrest, Covid-19 on Night 2 of convention||US First Lady Melania Trump acknowledged the devastating consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic on families and businesses in an address on the second night of the Republican convention in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump and his surrogate’s dismissive impatience with it.She struck a generally different note from speakers that preceded her, as also those on Monday. Unlike them, she sought to address the recent racial unrest with a unifying call, for instance. Her husband and his surrogates have used the protests to stoke fears about lawlessness and chaos.“I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed dramatically,” the first lady said, addressing at the outset an issue that had been largely ignored by other speakers. “I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone.”She pledged her husband was committed to finding a vaccine. “Donald will not rest” till then, she said.Notably, she went with the widely used name “Covid-19” for the epidemic and not “China Virus” or the “China Plague” or the “Kung Flu” that the president has preferred.The First Lady also addressed anti-race protests for what they were, without portraying them as a harbinger of lawlessness by “radical left” Democrats that will follow under Joe Biden, if he was elected president, as had been done by a string of speakers before her. “I urge people to come together, in a civil manner, so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals,” she said. “I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice. Never judge anyone based on the colour of their skin.”Speaking from the newly renovated Rose Garden of the White House, the First Lady also sought to portray her husband, who sat among socially distanced audience, as a straight-talker. “Whether you like it or not, you always know what he’s thinking,” she said.Melania Trump, who was the third member of the president’s family to address the convention on Tuesday after adult children Tiffany Trump and Eric Trump, delivered the most important speech of the night, one that earned her the grudging respect even of some Democrats, who have rarely had a good word for her husband.The focus of Night 2 of the convention — labelled the “Land of Opportunity” — was on the Trump administration’s economic successes before the Covid-19 epidemic hit the country and the recent signs of recovery; foreign policy achievements such as the recent Israel-UAE accord, aggressive steps towards China and Iran; and appealing to women voters.But it was also a day that President Trump and his senior aides faced a string criticism for deploying tools of federal government in his re-election bid, such as hosting a naturalization ceremony for immigrants at the White House, and grating presidential pardon to a former felon.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was criticised for bucking a decades-old practice of not addressing a political convention as secretary of state, observed by both parties. He spoke of the administration’s foreign policy through a pre-recorded video from Jerusalem, a venue chosen tactically as a reminder of administration recognising the city as Israel’s capital.In the pre-recorded message from Jerusalem, Pompeo offered a quick summary of the administration key foreign policy moves, such as China. “In China, he has pulled back the curtain on the predatory aggression of the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said and proceeded to mention the president’s attempts to hold China accountable for the Covid-19 epidemic, punishing or evicting spies and ending “ridiculously unfair trade deals”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-addresses-racial-unrest-covid-19-on-night-2-of-convention/story-f8wJt49b98eASKma8MBFrN.html
26-08-2020||World||Hurricane Laura poses biggest storm threat to US oil output in 15 years||The US energy industry on Tuesday was preparing for a major hurricane strike, cutting crude production at a rate approaching the level of 2005’s Hurricane Katrina and halting oil refining at plants along the Texas-Louisiana coast.Officials in the two states ordered hundreds of thousands of coastal residents to flee inland as Hurricane Laura strengthened and forecasters predicted it would become a major hurricane with sustained, 115 mile per hour (185 kph) winds. At least a 10-foot (3-meter) storm surge will likely hit the upper Texas coast later this week, said Chris Kerr, a meteorologist at agriculture, energy and weather data provider DTN. He said rapid intensification could even produce a devastating Category 4 hurricane.Oil producers on Tuesday had evacuated 310 offshore facilities and shut 1.56 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude output, 84% of Gulf of Mexico’s offshore production, near the 90% outage that Katrina brought 15 years ago. The storm will make landfall by early Thursday in an area that accounts for more than 45% of total US petroleum refining capacity and 17% of oil production, according to the Energy Information Administration. Refiners that produce gasoline and diesel fuel were taking steps to halt nine facilities that process nearly 2.9 million bpd of oil, 14.6% of the US total capacity, according to Reuters tallies. The impact on refineries so far is less than Hurricane Harvey, whose drenching rains took down nearly one quarter of US refining capacity three years ago. US gasoline futures have jumped as much as 10% since Friday, while crude benchmarks settled at a five-month high on Tuesday due to the shutdowns.“There will be a significant storm surge from Galveston (Texas) to the Sabine River,” an area encompassing some of the region’s largest refineries, said DTN’s Kerr. “There are ideal conditions in central and west Gulf for rapid intensification.”Officials in Texas and Louisiana called for mandatory evacuations affecting half a million people. Residents from areas of Houston east to Orange, Texas, should flee the area and seek shelter inland, Texas officials said. Cheniere Energy Inc, the largest US exporter of liquefied natural gas, evacuated staff and suspended operations at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal on the Texas/Louisiana border. Motiva Enterprises, Total SA and Valero Energy began cutting operations at their Port Arthur, Texas, refineries, according to people familiar with the matter. Total, Motiva and Valero confirmed the shutdowns, and a Valero spokeswoman said it also was reviewing the risks to its Texas City, plant southeast of Houston. Citgo Petroleum was halting operations at its 418,000 bpd refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and Chevron shut gasoline production at its 112,000 bpd Pasadena, Texas, refinery, spokespeople said. Exxon Mobil Corp began shutting production at its large Beaumont, Texas, refinery and reduced output at its Baytown, Texas, plant ahead of a possible shutdown.Exxon confirmed it was initiating a shutdown at Beaumont and was preparing for possible severe weather at its Baytown refinery and chemical complex, a spokesman said. If the Baytown plant fully halts processing, total shutdowns along the coast would hit 2.89 million bpd. Marathon Petroleum declined to comment on the status of its 585,000 bpd plant in Texas City, the second largest refinery in the United States after Motiva’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-laura-poses-biggest-storm-threat-to-us-oil-output-in-15-years/story-j5k1JrlQ5pYKkTgHRKdEGM.html
26-08-2020||World||China protests US spy plane watching live fire military drills||China has lodged “stern representations” with the United States, accusing it of sending a US U-2 reconnaissance plane into a no-fly zone over Chinese live-fire military drills on Tuesday, further ratcheting up tensions between Beijing and Washington.China has long denounced US surveillance activities, while the United States has complained of “unsafe” intercepts by Chinese aircraft. While such missions happen regularly, for China to talk about them publicly is unusual.China’s Defence Ministry said the U-2 flew without permission over a no-fly zone in the northern military region where live fire drills were taking place, “seriously interfering in normal exercise activities”.This could easily have caused a misunderstanding or misjudgement or an “unexpected incident”, the ministry added.“It was an act of naked provocation, and China is resolutely opposed to it, and have already lodged stern representations with the US side.”In a statement, the US military said a U-2 flight was conducted in the Indo-Pacific region and it was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights.”“Pacific Air Forces personnel will continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing,” the US military said in the statement.The U-2 aircraft can fly at over 70,000 feet and carry out reconnaissance activity from afar and would not necessarily have had to enter a no-fly zone.While China did not say exactly where the incident took place, it is currently carrying out drills in the Bohai Sea. Other exercises are also happening in the Yellow Sea and South China Sea.“China demands the US side immediately stop this kind of provocative behaviour and take actual steps to safeguard peace and stability in the region,” the ministry added.Relations between Washington and Beijing have worsened over everything from trade and human rights to what the United States sees as aggressive moves by China’s armed forces, especially in the disputed South China Sea and around Chinese-claimed Taiwan.In April 2001, an intercept of a US spy plane by a Chinese fighter jet resulted in a collision that killed the Chinese pilot and forced the American plane to make an emergency landing at a base on the southern Chinese island of Hainan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-protests-us-spy-plane-watching-live-fire-military-drills/story-AC3uzIUlP0dQMk8WsuMVRN.html
26-08-2020||World||‘Anything can happen’: Weather helps California firefighters, for now||Over 14,000 firefighters from half a dozen states carved out containment lines around some of the largest wildfires in California history on Tuesday, helped by cooler temperatures.Using bulldozers and hand tools, crews scraped fire breaks into the earth to block flames from around 24 major blazes sparked by dry lightning during a record heat wave. The worst fires, now the second and third largest in state history, burned in the greater San Francisco Bay Area and 136,000 people remained under evacuation orders.Higher humidity and gentler winds helped firefighters get a grip on the fires, but temperatures and winds were expected to pick up in coming days. “The weather has really cooperated with us. We are steadily getting a trickle of new resources in,” Cal Fire Operations Chief Mark Brunton said of a blaze north of Santa Cruz. Four people were still missing after the fire known as the CZU Lightning Complex destroyed 330 homes and other structures, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Chief Deputy Chris Clark told reporters.Some authorities blamed climate change for the fire in an area of coastal rainforests that do not normally burn.Since the dry-lightning siege began Aug. 15 over 650 fires have torched more than 1.25 million acres (505,860 hectares) in California, an area larger than the Grand Canyon.At least seven people have died and over 1,400 homes and other structures have been destroyed, with losses possibly rising to over 3,000 structures, Cal Fire Assistant Deputy Director Daniel Berlant said in an online briefing.Livestock owners evacuated animals to the county fairgrounds in Santa Rosa to protect them from a monster fire burning in hills 20 miles to the east. “If we get strong winds from an unexpected direction anything can happen,” said Kathleen Haase, 45, a farmer from Guerneville who evacuated 200 goats after three of her neighbors lost their homes. Firefighters cut a containment line around a third of the fire dubbed the LNU Lightning Complex, which is the third largest in state history at over 350,000 acres.To the south, containment ticked up to 15% on the state’s largest fire, in hills 10 miles east of San Jose. Thousands returned to homes in Santa Clara County as some evacuation orders were lifted around the fire known as the SCU Lightning complex. Smoke from fires created unhealthy air quality for a large swath of Northern California, with many San Francisco residents staying indoors.Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said California was facing “a different climate” after record temperatures siphoned off moisture from storms to create dry-lightning.The state’s five largest wildfires have burned in the last three years, the largest of which was the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018 which blackened 459,123 acres.A two to three degree Fahrenheit rise in average temperatures, combined with insect infestations, have created more dead trees and parched brush that act as kindling to supercharge fires that have long burned in California, according to bioclimatologists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anything-can-happen-weather-helps-california-firefighters-for-now/story-efMhrtjKAMc10hBeTOuREO.html
26-08-2020||World||Takeaways from Day Two of the Republican National Convention||First lady Melania Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lead an array of Americans making the case at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday for re-electing President Donald Trump over Democrat Joe Biden in November. Here is a takeaway from Tuesday’s program: Alternate historyLarry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, had a simple goal in his address on Tuesday night: Convince viewers that the American economy had sprung back to life again – even if it hasn’t.A strong economy was the Republican president’s biggest asset coming into the campaign, but the coronavirus pandemic sank that narrative. On Tuesday, Kudlow spoke as if the pandemic had passed and that all was well again, arguing that Trump had “successfully fought” the outbreak.There was no mention of jobless claims climbing past the 1 million mark last week, the unemployment rate remaining above 10%, or consumer confidence hitting a six-year low. Nor was there mention of the millions who lost jobless benefits after Congress was unable to agree on an extension of relief programs, or talk of the more than 177,000 US deaths from the pandemic.Most notably, Kudlow was speaking from his Connecticut home, not from Washington or the Republican convention site in Charlotte, North Carolina – a reminder that the virus remains with us.Controversial speakersOn a night when Melania Trump is scheduled to give her signature address of the 2020 campaign from the White House in a bid to appeal to suburban women voters, two other women who were on the convention speaking schedule may have done that cause no favours.Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate, and Mary Ann Mendoza, a fierce critic of illegal immigration whose son was killed by a drunk driver who was in the country illegally, were to speak back-to-back at the convention from an auditorium in Washington. Both have courted controversy.But the Trump campaign said Mendoza was pulled from the schedule after tweeting a link on Tuesday to a lengthy anti-Semitic conspiracy thread. She apologized on Twitter, saying: “That does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever.”Johnson, who has a biracial son among her eight children, said in a YouTube video in June after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis, that when her son is grown, police officers would have to be more careful around him, the Daily Beast reported.“Statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons,” she said, despite studies showing systemic biases in the criminal justice system that disproportionately punish Black men.Johnson has also said on Twitter than she supports “household voting” – in which each household has a single vote, potentially denying a woman an individual vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/takeaways-from-day-two-of-the-republican-national-convention/story-GBT1ZfQg4RbNGx9LQHYvjO.html
26-08-2020||World||Could US regulators authorise a Covid-19 vaccine before the election?||US President Donald Trump has said a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be available before the November 3 presidential election, sooner than most experts anticipate.A Covid-19 vaccine as early as October could become a reality if drugmakers deliver on optimistic timelines for completing large, late-stage clinical trials and regulators allow for its use prior to a full review and approval.HOW CAN U.S. REGULATORS SPEED UP AVAILABILITY OF A VACCINE?The US Food and Drug Administration can greenlight medical products during public health emergencies by issuing an emergency use authorization (EUA) before all the data are in to complete a formal review.The FDA has issued EUAs for many Covid-19 tests and for a few treatments. On Sunday, the FDA authorized on an emergency basis the use blood plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients as a treatment. The FDA commissioner later corrected data he cited at a news conference that significantly overstated the treatment’s known ability to save lives.EUA’s are not typically used for vaccines intended for healthy people to prevent infection. That presents a higher bar for approval than treatments for people with life-threatening disease. Nevertheless, the FDA in June released EUA guidance for Covid-19 vaccines. Once it grants an EUA, the agency eventually must issue a formal marketing approval or revoke emergency authorization. HOW MUCH TIME COULD AN EUA SAVE?Typical FDA approval reviews take eight months or longer, with a priority review shaving off a couple of months. But the agency has moved quickly during past public health crises. During the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, it only took two months to get an approved vaccine, but those were based on existing seasonal flu vaccines. An EUA for a vaccine using a new approach might only save a few weeks, some experts say. The FDA would still need substantial data, said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, former chairwoman of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee and scientific director at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program.“What they do seem to be telling us is that once you show that your vaccine works ... that might be a time when an EUA may be used” before the paperwork is completed, said Filip Dubovsky, chief medical officer of vaccine maker Novavax IncIS IT RISKY TO USE AN EUA FOR VACCINES?The U.S. government decided against an EUA for the H1N1 vaccine after a survey found 64% of Americans would not take it if it had not gone through the formal approval process.Consumer rights watchdog Public Citizen urged regulators not to use an EUA for Covid-19 vaccines, which it says could create the appearance of a rushed review. The FDA and other U.S. health experts say there must be sufficient safety and efficacy data before a vaccine is authorized for public use.“I certainly would not recommend nor would I ever allow myself to be injected with a vaccine that has not been thoroughly vetted and approved by the FDA,” said former FDA associate commissioner Dr. Peter Pitts, president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest.COULD TRUMP PRESSURE THE FDA TO ISSUE AN EUA WITHOUT SUFFICIENT DATA?Trump, without citing evidence, on Saturday accused “deep state” elements in the FDA of holding up vaccines and treatments in order to undermine his reelection prospects.FDA Commissioner Stephan Hahn has denied that assertion. Peter Marks, one of the FDA’s top drug reviewers, told Reuters he would resign if he felt the agency was pressured to approve a vaccine before it was ready.Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA chief scientist, said a vaccine EUA could undermine public confidence in the agency. He cited pressure around hydroxychloroquine, a treatment pushed by Trump and others in his administration, which received an EUA that was later revoked when data showed a lack of efficacy and safety issues.“We’re certainly seeing a situation where norms are not being respected government-wide,” Goodman said.WHICH DRUGMAKERS HAVE A SHOT AT A VIABLE VACCINE BEFORE THE ELECTION?AstraZeneca Plc
26-08-2020||World||Kim Jong Un calls for prevention efforts against coronavirus, looming typhoon: Reports||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for prevention efforts against the novel coronavirus and a typhoon, state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday.An enlarged meeting of the politburo of the Workers Party took place amid a pandemic that is putting additional pressure on the North Korean economy, battered by recent border closures and flood damage.The meeting assessed “some defects in the state emergency anti-epidemic work for checking the inroads of the malignant virus”, KCNA said in a statement.North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but Kim said last month that the virus “could be said to have entered” the country and imposed a lockdown after a man was reported to have symptoms. Later test results on the man were inconclusive, according to the World Health Organisation.Kim had this month lifted a three-week lockdown in the city of Kaesong after a suspected case of the coronavirus there.The meeting discussed state emergency measures on preventing crop damage and casualties from Typhoon Bavi, which is expected to hit the country within days, KCNA reported. Heavy rain and flooding have raised concern about food supplies in the isolated country.The ruling party had said it will hold a congress next year to decide a new five-year plan, after a party meeting noted serious delays in improving the national economy and living standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-calls-for-prevention-efforts-against-coronavirus-looming-typhoon-reports/story-elZs2viZ89ibHDE7EYecKL.html
26-08-2020||World||Losses from China overseas takeover binge are piling up fast||Chinese buyers have not only stopped snapping up iconic overseas assets, the coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the targets of deals that defined a headier era.Whereas some prolific acquirers such as HNA Group Co. and Anbang Insurance Group Co. began falling into disarray before the recent crisis, the impact on investments in sectors hit hardest by the outbreak means healthier owners are now feeling the pain.Conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. could soon see its 2015 investment in Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group wiped out, while PizzaExpress, owned by private equity firm Hony Capital, said this month it’s likely to hand control of the British chain to creditors. Baggage handler Swissport International AG is also negotiating with investors over a rescue that could see HNA exit the cash-strapped firm it bought in 2015, Bloomberg News has reported. HNA is also among Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. shareholders set to lose everything after the airline collapsed in April.“Some of the Chinese overseas investments that have recently imploded are legacy acquisitions from the debt-fueled deal spree in the years before 2018,” Lars Aagaard, head of mergers and acquisitions and financial sponsors for Asia Pacific at Barclays Plc based in Hong Kong, said in a phone interview.Even Chinese companies’ pre-Covid attempts to extricate themselves from investments are being tripped up by the pandemic.Dajia Insurance Group, the heir to troubled insurer Anbang, found itself suddenly without a buyer for a $5.8 billion portfolio of US luxury hotels when the virus struck. South Korea’s Mirae Asset Global Investments Co. did not consummate a deal agreed last fall by the April 17 deadline, prompting Dajia to sue. Mirae told the courts that hotel shutdowns caused by the Covid-19 virus are among its reasons why it canceled the transaction.To be sure, businesses in sectors such as transportation, tourism and hospitality are facing extreme challenges regardless of whether the owner is Chinese or someone else, Aagaard said.At $15.1 billion, the volume of Chinese outbound M&A so far this year represents a 25% drop from a year earlier and a far cry from the peak in 2016, when China National Chemical Corp. agreed to buy Swiss agrichemical maker Syngenta AG for $43 billion, according to Bloomberg data.The pandemic is not the only factor explaining the plunge in dealmaking activity. India, Australia and the European Union have increased scrutiny on foreign investment in moves widely viewed as targeting Chinese buyers. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have seen sanctions imposed on officials in China and Hong Kong over human rights issues, adding uncertainty for Chinese companies operating overseas.China Mengniu Dairy Co. on Tuesday scrapped its plans to buy Kirin Holdings Co.’s Australian beverage unit after being told the deal would likely be blocked, amid increasingly strained relations between Canberra and Beijing.“The great uncertainties in the relationship between China and the U.S. have inevitably made Chinese investors more cautious with their cross-border deals,” said Eric Liu, Shanghai-based managing partner of Zhao Sheng Law Firm. “While we do not see any indication of Chinese investors stopping ‘going abroad’, it is completely understandable that they need time to assess.”They may be cautious, but they are not completely averse. Earlier this month, China Three Gorges Corp. agreed to buy 13 Spanish solar park assets owned by X-Elio Energy SL, a renewable energy company co-owned by Brookfield Renewable Partners LP and private equity firm KKR & Co. The deal could become one of the few Chinese acquisitions in Europe this year.Barclays’ Aagaard sees continued Chinese interest in future outbound deals, though focused more on deals that complement buyers’ core businesses.“The desire to do selective and strategic acquisitions overseas is still there, especially in sectors such as power, infrastructure and utilities, technology and consumer,” Aagaard said. “Chinese companies, both private and state-owned enterprises, are now taking a much more sophisticated approach both as buyers and also as owners of businesses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/losses-from-china-overseas-takeover-binge-are-piling-up-fast/story-D7N3yj7QPjGDE3nzDkuIYI.html
26-08-2020||World||Wisconsin governor declares emergency after police shooting of Jacob Blake||Wisconsin’s governor declared a state of emergency Tuesday after some protesters vandalized businesses and set dozens of buildings on fire in a city where police shot a Black man multiple times, apparently in the back in view of his children.The shooting of Jacob Blake on Sunday in Kenosha was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests over racial injustice in several cities, just three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police touched off a wider reckoning on race.Blake’s father, also named Jacob Blake, told the Chicago Sun-Times that his son is paralyzed from the waist down and has “eight holes” in his body. The elder Blake said he didn’t know if his son’s paralysis was permanent.Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers called for protesters to be peaceful, while also saying the National Guard presence would be doubled from 125 to 250 in Kenosha after crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires on Monday night.“We cannot allow the cycle of systemic racism and injustice to continue,” said Evers, who is facing mounting pressure from Republicans over his handling of the unrest that has followed the shooting. “We also cannot continue going down this path of damage and destruction.”Blake’s father said that he learned Sunday night that officers had shot his 29-year-old son and shortly thereafter he watched the video, which appears to show his son being shot in the back.“I want to put my hand on my son’s cheek and kiss him on his forehead, and then I’ll be OK,” the father, who was traveling from North Carolina to Milwaukee, where his son is being treated, told the newspaper. “I’ll kiss him with my mask. The first thing I want to do is touch my son.”Three of the younger Blake’s sons — aged 3, 5 and 8 — were in the car at the time of the shooting, according to Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney representing the family. Crump scheduled a Tuesday afternoon news conference in Kenosha with Blake’s family members to address the shooting.Police in Kenosha have released almost no information about the shooting, beyond saying the officers were responding to a domestic dispute when they encountered Blake. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is leading the investigation, which is expected to take several weeks. The officers were placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice in such cases.The father has not returned multiple messages left by The Associated Press. He is slated to speak at a March on Washington commemoration on Friday organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton. His father and the victim’s grandfather, Jacob Blake Sr., was a prominent minister and civil rights leader in the Chicago area in the 1960s.The man who said he made the cellphone video of the shooting, 22-year-old Raysean White, said he saw Blake scuffling with three officers and heard them yell, “Drop the knife! Drop the knife!” before the gunfire erupted. He said he didn’t see a knife in Blake’s hands.In the footage, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns drawn and shout at him. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while Blake has his back turned. Seven shots can be heard, though it isn’t clear how many struck Blake or how many officers fired.Since the shooting, anger has spilled into the streets of Kenosha and other cities, including Los Angeles, Wisconsin’s capital of Madison and in Minneapolis, the epicenter of the Black Lives Matter movement this summer following Floyd’s death.Hundreds of protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew Monday night, massing in downtown Kenosha, where they were met by a wall of law enforcement officers, including 125 members of the Wisconsin National Guard.Some clashed with officers and vandalized businesses. There were 34 fires associated with the unrest, with 30 businesses destroyed or damaged along with an unknown number of residences, Kenosha Fire Chief Charles Leipzig told the Kenosha News.One of the buildings destroyed was the Wisconsin Department of Corrections’ probation and parole office. Most staff had already transitioned to working remotely, and all essential operations are continuing, said department spokeswoman Anna Neal.A city block was cordoned off Tuesday so officials could survey damage. Smoke filled the air and visibility was low as firefighters used water cannons on still smoldering buildings.“Nobody deserves this,” said Pat Oertle, owner of Computer Adventure. Computers were stolen, and the store was “destroyed,” she said.“This accomplishes nothing,” Oertle said. “This is not justice that they’re looking for.”US Sen. Ron Johnson and US Rep. Bryan Steil, both Republicans, called on the governor to do more to quell the unrest. Steil said he would request federal assistance if necessary.A Wisconsin state lawmaker said Evers, who is white, and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, encouraged violence with their comments after the shooting.“They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm,” Republican state Sen. Howard Marklein said. “They did encourage people to jump to conclusions and take negative action.”Evers continued to call for protesters to be peaceful.“Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability,” he said.In Madison, about 500 protesters marched to the state Capitol on Monday night, and some broke windows, stole from stores and sprayed graffiti along the way. Police used tear gas and pepper spray on the crowds and six people were arrested, according to Madison police.In Minneapolis, 11 were arrested after breaking windows at the county jail on Monday night. One police officer suffered a broken hand in an altercation with demonstrators, the sheriff’s department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/governor-declares-emergency-after-police-shooting-of-blake/story-LPBT5n0DUTAruJMNxTWC4L.html
26-08-2020||World||Alphabet’s Google appoints DeLaine Prado as new general counsel||Alphabet Inc.’s Google appointed Halimah DeLaine Prado, a company veteran and one of the technology giant’s most senior Black executives, as general counsel.DeLaine Prado’s promotion will likely be welcomed by Black employees at the company who have been pushing for more diversity. Earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai committed to increase leadership representation of underrepresented groups by 30% by 2025. Google’s 2019 diversity report said 2.6% of Google’s leaders were Black.Google hasn’t had a general counsel since 2018, when Kent Walker was promoted to senior vice president of global affairs, a position responsible for responding to the swell of regulatory and privacy-related issues the company has faced in recent years. DeLaine Prado will report to Walker.“Google has been my home for nearly 14 years, allowing me to work on some of the most complex and important legal issues of the digital age with a world-class legal team,” she said in a statement. “I am excited for this new opportunity and I cannot wait to get started.”DeLaine Prado was most recently a vice president in the legal department, where she ran a global legal team that advised on Google products including Ads, Search, Cloud, Hardware, Platforms & Ecosystems, and YouTube.“Halimah has been a trusted counselor and exceptional leader,” Walker said in a statement. “She is uniquely qualified to lead the Legal Department at this critical moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alphabet-s-google-appoints-delaine-prado-as-new-general-counsel/story-JWb2j02gpvKI4dOULik8CO.html

Brands, is telling fans not to worry.“The slogan will be back,” the statement said. “Just when the time is right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-kfc-suspends-its-finger-lickin-good-slogan-amid-pandemic/story-DFu9ChN83XYPN5UMAoy5HJ.html

To blackmail for NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) by defanging NAB (National Accountability Bureau, they would even have Pak put on FATF black list to destroy nation’s economy & increase poverty,” Imran Khan said.Pakistan had last returned to the FATF ‘grey list’ in June 2018 when the anti-terror funding watchdog found deficiencies in Islamabad’s money laundering and anti-terror funding laws and their implementation. Over the last one week, Khan has enacted laws and designated over 100 people as terrorists to evade the blacklist at the next FATF review expected in October.Also Read: Biggest pressure from FATF, says NSA Ajit Doval on Pakistan attempt to avoid blacklistKhan’s government had been able to get the two legislations - Anti-Money Laundering (Second Amendment) Bill and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Waqf Properties Bill - cleared by Pakistan’s lower house after a heated debate that mostly centered around the role of the National Accountability Bureau.But the twin legislations appeared to have hit a roadblock in the Senate. Opposition tries to hide behind facade of democracy to protect their loot & plunder. To blackmail for NRO by defanging NAB, they would even have Pak put on FATF black list to destroy nation's economy & increase poverty. They keep threatening to bring down govt unless given NRO.An upset Khan turned to Twitter, venting against the opposition leaders. Khan said the opposition leaders were looking for an immunity deal like the one offered by ex-President Pervez Musharraf back in 2007.The 2007 legislation, National Reconciliation Ordinance, was a controversial law promulgated by General Musharraf as part of a deal with Pakistan Peoples Party’s Benazir Bhutto. It allowed amnesty from legal action to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats accused of wrongdoing between January 1986 and October 1999. It was quashed by Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry soon after. Gen Musharraf sacked the chief justice, a move that plunged the country into a political and judicial crisis. Khan, who accused the opposition of threatening to pull down his government unless given a similar immunity deal, said he would not give in.“Let me make clear: No matter what happens, my govt will not allow any NRO as it would be betrayal of nation’s trust in holding plunderers of public wealth accountable. Musharraf gave NROs to the 2 pol ldrs which quadrupled our debt & destroyed economy. There will be no more NROs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sabotage-pak-effort-to-exit-grey-list-imran-khan-stings-oppn-for-defeating-fatf-linked-bills/story-NNNz6WQ0UQkTfhCUkUWKZP.html
26-08-2020||World||Covid-19 antibodies fade rapidly, raising risk of lost immunity||Recovering from Covid-19 may not offer much protection from future infections for those with only a mild case, according to a report that suggests caution regarding so-called herd immunity as well as vaccine durability.The correspondence in the New England Journal of Medicine outlined an analysis of antibodies taken from the blood of 34 patients who had recovered after suffering mainly mild symptoms that didn’t require intensive care. Just two needed supplemental oxygen and received an HIV medication, and none were on a ventilator or getting Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe first analysis was done on antibodies taken an average of 37 days after symptoms began, with a second after about 86 days, or less than three months. The researchers found that antibody levels fell quickly, with a half-life of about 73 days between the two time frames. The loss of antibodies occurred more quickly than with SARS, an earlier type of coronavirus infection.The antibody response is being closely studied by scientists worldwide for indications of how long-lasting immunity may be. While there’s little evidence to suggest reinfections are broadly occurring, health experts have yet to pin down specifics. The latest findings raise concern that protection from reinfection may not last long in those with mild symptoms, which accounts for the majority of cases.Further studies will be needed “to define a quantitative protection threshold and rate of decline of antiviral antibodies beyond 90 days,” according to the researchers led by F. Javier Ibarrondo, from the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles. The brief report was in the form of a correspondence published in the journal.While the protective role of antibodies against infection isn’t fully understood, they are generally considered a good representation of some protection against infection in general, according to the report.A recent study from King’s College London showed that the level of antibodies may drop to a degree that makes them undetectable as soon as three months after infection. However, the body also mounts other forms of immunity responses, including from so-called T-cells, which appear to play a role in protecting against reinfection with Covid-19.In Sweden, the nation’s top health authority said on Tuesday that people who have had the virus are likely to be immune for at least six months after being infected, whether they’ve developed antibodies or not. In new guidance, the Swedish Public Health Agency said it’s now considered safe for individuals who’ve been infected to come into contact with people in high-risk groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-antibodies-fade-rapidly-raising-risk-of-lost-immunity/story-8juXTn2qIZf3sRummDy0RM.html
