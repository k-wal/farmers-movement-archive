04-08-2020||World||Brazil, hotbed for Covid-19 vaccine testing, may struggle to produce its own||Brazilian officials say they can start making Covid-19 vaccines developed by British and Chinese researchers within a year. Experts say it will take at least twice as long, leaving Brazil reliant on imports to slow the world’s second-worst outbreak.If Brazil’s underfunded medical institutions are unable to meet their ambitious goals, it would mark the latest failure by President Jair Bolsonaro’s government to control the virus. It would also leave Brazil vulnerable to a frenzied global scramble for vaccine supplies.Some of the most advanced Covid-19 vaccine candidates - including from AstraZeneca Plc in partnership with Oxford University, and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd - are undergoing large clinical trials in Brazil, which has more than 2.7 million reported cases and almost 95,000 deaths, second only to the United States. Researchers can get results faster by testing vaccines where active virus spread is rampant.As part of their agreements with Brazilian authorities, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have promised the federal government and the Sao Paulo state government, respectively, tens of millions of doses of their potential vaccines. They also pledged to transfer technology so Brazil can eventually produce them domestically at leading biomedical institutes Fiocruz, in Rio de Janeiro, and Butantan, in Sao Paulo.The institutes say production of new vaccines will begin by the middle of 2021. Brazil’s federal government has said it will invest 1.9 billion reais ($355 million) to process and produce the AstraZeneca vaccine.But three experts told Reuters money alone would not be enough, saying it could take between two and 10 years for Brazil to produce Covid-19 vaccines, due to the difficulty of transferring technology and years of under-investment in the two production facilities. “It’s impossible,” José Gomes Temporão, a former Brazilian health minister, said of the 2021 goal. “This takes a long time. Maybe they can accelerate a bit, but not that much.”A former head of federal health regulator Anvisa, who asked not to be named to avoid professional conflicts, also doubted Brazil could become self sufficient in a timely manner.“A tech transfer process lasts five to 10 years, on average. When Brazil has the complete technology, a Covid-19 vaccine will probably not be necessary anymore,” the ex-Anvisa head said, adding that Brazil is likely to have to purchase vaccines rather than produce them domestically, for the foreseeable future.Brazil’s Health Ministry said such predictions are premature and will depend on vaccine trial results. But officials have admitted the announced timeline may be hard to attain. “Although it seems remote, there is a possibility of delay in the development of the vaccine,” Elcio Franco, Brazil’s No.2 public health official, told reporters on Monday.Sao Paulo’s state government, Fiocruz, Butantan, AstraZeneca and Sinovac did not respond to requests for comment.EXPENSIVE GAMBLEBrazil’s state and federal governments are discussing additional late-stage coronavirus vaccine trials with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc, China’s Sinopharm Group and Russian diplomats.But they quickly made big bets on the first two candidates to start testing in the country from AstraZeneca and Sinovac.The Sinovac deal obliges Butantan to invest 85 million reais ($16 million) to conduct trials of the Chinese vaccine. In exchange, the Sao Paulo government, which runs Butantan, will get enough doses to vaccinate 60 million people.The federal government’s memorandum of understanding with AstraZeneca requires it to buy 30 million doses of its still-unproven vaccine at a cost of $97 million, even if it fails in pivotal trials. The deal gives Brazil priority to buy 70 million more doses if the vaccine works.As part of that deal, Brazil pledged to invest 1.9 billion reais to produce the vaccine. About 1.3 billion will go toward technology transfer, and 95 million reais for updating Fiocruz facilities. The rest will be spent on processing the vaccine. The former Anvisa chief questioned Brazil’s big bet.“I really think these agreements are too risky vis-a-vis the investment,” said the source. “What will happen if the Phase III (trial) shows that these vaccines are not effective?”Brazil’s government has hedged its bets by joining the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative, which intends to guarantee fast and equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines, and aims to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.“The idea,” said a Health Ministry source not authorized to speak publicly, “is not to put all our eggs in one basket.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hotbed-for-covid-19-vaccine-testing-may-struggle-to-produce-its-own/story-8KeKYlGkGUuGL8hHUzdPMN.html

Official data “fail to reflect the true state of play in the country.”The Ministry of Health declined to comment when asked about the allegations of discrepancies.Turkey Eases Virus Measures After Declaring #MissionAccomplishedThe intervention caps days of criticism from opposition politicians and some doctors who say the daily case count provided by Health Minister Fahrettin Koca portrays a far rosier picture than the reality. Experts began to raise doubts after the official figures began to conflict with regional and provincial numbers.Aydin Barus, governor of eastern Malatya province, said on Aug. 1 that there had been more than 100 new daily cases there in the preceding four days, according to the Hurriyet newspaper. The government reported fewer than 50 cases during that period for a broader region including Malatya and seven other provinces.Koca has been warning of a potential spike in new cases due to poor social distancing, especially in coastal towns where millions of Turks flocked after the government declared victory against the virus in June and eased restrictions to rescue a deteriorating economy.Even so, the official daily count of new infections has remained stable at under 1,000, while authorities stopped providing a detailed breakdown of patients in intensive care units or on ventilators. Hospitals are fast running out of beds and new patients are being asked to quarantine and take medication at home.“It seems as if they are making an effort to keep the daily coronavirus number below 1,000,” Bulent Nazim Yilmaz, secretary general of the Turkish Medical Association, told Bloomberg by phone. “The numbers we receive on the infected and hospitalized patients are way above the official figures.”On Tuesday, the governor’s office in the capital, Ankara, ordered all coronavirus patients except those with serious conditions to be diagnosed, isolated and treated at home. Hospitals were instructed to reserve at least half of their beds for virus patients, according to instructions sent to healthcare officials seen by Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-doctors-dispute-official-count-of-coronavirus-infections/story-S7lKCeEswNLX5brWHmxawI.html

04-08-2020||World||Malaysia police raid Al Jazeera’s office, seize computers||Malaysian police raided the office of news broadcaster Al Jazeera and two local TV stations on Tuesday, seizing computers as part of an investigation into a documentary on undocumented migrants that enraged the government.Al Jazeera, a Qatari-state owned broadcaster, said in a statement that police seized two computers during the raid, which it called a “troubling escalation” in a government crackdown on media freedom. It urged Malaysian authorities to cease the criminal investigation.Police opened an investigation last month into the Al Jazeera documentary on the treatment of undocumented migrants after officials complained it was inaccurate and biased. Seven Al Jazeera staff members have been grilled by police as part of the probe for alleged sedition, defamation and violating the Communications and Multimedia Act.Police obtained court warrants to search the offices of Al Jazeera as well as local broadcasters Astro and Unifitv, criminal investigation chief Huzir Mohamed said in a statement. The two local TV stations had reportedly aired the video.Huzir said the raids were conducted jointly with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, which is also investigating the stations.He said police seized computers which will be sent for further analysis and took statements from witnesses during the raids. “No individual or entity will be spared from action if they have violated the law,” he said.Al Jazeera said the raid was “an attack on press freedom as a whole” and urged Malaysian authorities to cease the criminal investigation.“Conducting a raid on our office and seizing computers is a troubling escalation in the authorities’ crackdown on media freedom and shows the lengths they are prepared to take to try to intimidate journalists,” said Giles Trendle, managing director of Al Jazeera English.“Al Jazeera stands by our journalists and we stand by our reporting. Our staff did their jobs and they’ve got nothing to answer for or apologize for. Journalism is not a crime,” he said.The documentary, titled “Locked Up in Malaysia’s Lockdown,” investigated undocumented immigrants it said were at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. More than 2,000 migrant workers were arrested during raids in areas in Kuala Lumpur that were placed under tight virus lockdowns.Malaysian authorities also detained a Bangladeshi man interviewed in the documentary after revoking his work permit, and said they will deport him for criticizing the government over its handling of undocumented migrants.“The authorities’ relentless pursuit of Al Jazeera seems to be driven by a desire to punish journalists who aired Malaysia’s dirty laundry rather than a good faith application of the law,” said Matthew Bugher, head of the Asia program of British-based rights group ARTICLE 19.He said Malaysia should investigate the rights violations shown in the documentary instead of targeting the filmmakers.Rights activists have voiced concern over a clampdown on freedom of speech and media independence under new Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who took power in March.Astro was recently fined for airing an Al Jazeera documentary in 2015 about the 2006 murder of a Mongolian woman that allegedly contained “offensive content.”Popular online news portal Malaysiakini and its editor face rare contempt proceedings from the attorney general over comments posted by readers against the judiciary. Police also questioned an activist about a social media post alleging mistreatment of refugees at immigration detention centers.A journalist from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post was also questioned earlier about her reporting on migrant arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-police-raid-al-jazeera-s-office-seize-computers/story-kqEs1fR3CrmSyqquSNLYpL.html
04-08-2020||World||Donald Trump signs $3 billion-a-year plan to boost conservation, parks||President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed into law legislation that will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation and maintenance of national parks and other public lands. The measure was overwhelmingly approved by Congress.“There hasn’t been anything like this since Teddy Roosevelt, I suspect,” Trump said about the 26th president, who created many national parks, forests and monuments to preserve the nation’s natural resources.Supporters say the Great American Outdoors Act is the most significant conservation legislation enacted in nearly half a century. Opponents counter that the money isn’t enough to cover the estimated $20 billion maintenance backlog on federally owned lands.The law requires full, mandatory funding of the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund and addresses the maintenance backlog facing America’s national parks and public lands. The law would spend about $900 million a year — double current spending — on the conservation fund and another $1.9 billion per year on improvements at national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and range lands.Supporters say the legislation will create at least 100,000 jobs, while restoring national parks and repairing trails and forest systems.The park maintenance backlog has been a problem for decades, through Republican and Democratic administrations.The House and the Senate cleared both bills by overwhelming bipartisan margins this summer.Among the bills’ congressional champions are Republican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana. Both are among the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents, and each represents a state where the outdoor economy and tourism at sites such as the Rocky Mountain and Yellowstone national parks play an outsize role.Daines and Gardner persuaded Trump to support the legislation at a White House meeting this year, even though Trump has repeatedly tried to slash spending for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in his budget proposals.Ivanka Trump, the Republican president’s daughter and adviser, also supported the legislation.The legislation’s opponents, mostly Republicans, complain it would not eliminate an estimated $20 billion maintenance backlog on 640 acres (259 hectares) of federally owned lands. The legislation authorizes $9.5 billion for maintenance over five years.Lawmakers from Gulf Coast states also complained that their states receive too small a share of revenue from offshore oil and gas drilling that is used to pay for the conservation fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-3-billion-a-year-plan-to-boost-conservation-parks/story-Eknz3KPFiveywa77O2hJfK.html

The award was announced virtually during the 11th annual Fastmarkets Global Awards for Steel Excellence, which is one of the prestigious awards in the global steel industry. The award is for the company’s hydrologic sprinkler pipe.Paul’s office said in a statement on Tuesday that Bull Moose Tube utilised advanced metallurgy that imparts a stainless steel alloy layer onto the interior and exterior diameters of a low carbon steel core creating an ultra-smooth surface that reduces resistance and pressure loss of water carried by the pipe. The product’s development centered on a new spatially optimized diffusion alloy permanently bonded to the steel’s surface. For customers, its use in some applications will mean a reduction in material, labor and associated hardware costs as the product provides high stainless-steel pipe performance in a more economical, easier-to-handle form, the statement added.Thomas A. Modrowski, president and CEO of Bull Moose Tube, said: “We are incredibly honored to be recognized for our innovation in Hydrologic Sprinkler Pipe. The team’s dedication to excellence and innovation earned this honor for our company and demonstrates that success happens in an atmosphere of teamwork and collaboration among employees and with business partners and customers”.Judges for the award looked at contenders using a point-based qualitative approach that produced 71 finalists from around the world in 23 categories. Six finalists competed for the Best Innovation – Product category. Based in Chesterfield, Missouri, the company is part of the Caparo Bull Moose group. The company operates from seven plants – six in the USA (Chicago Heights, IL; Elkhart, IN; Gerald, MO; Masury, OH; Trenton, GA; and Casa Grande, AZ) and one in Canada (Burlington, Ontario).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swraj-paul-s-us-subsidiary-wins-global-steel-excellence-award/story-C3j4B44KIvFYLEb26s22aJ.html

A third security source said there were chemcials stored in the area.Footage of the blast shared around by residents on social media showed a column of smoke rising from the port district followed by an enormous blast. Those who filming what initially appeared to be a big blaze where thrown backwards by the shock.At least 10 bodies were taken to hospitals, a security source and a medical source told Reuters.It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze that set off the blast or what kind of explosives were in the warehouses. The governor of Beirut port told Sky News that a team of firefighters at the scene had “disappeared” after the explosion.“I saw a fireball and smoke billowing over Beirut. People were screaming and running, bleeding. Balconies were blown off buildings. Glass in high-rise buildings shattered and fell to the street,” said a Reuters witness.The health minister told Reuters there was a “very high number” of injured.

04-08-2020||World||French investigation finds evidence of sexual abuse from skating coaches||The French sports ministry said on Tuesday an investigation into figure skating had produced evidence about 21 coaches which was being referred to prosecutors, with more than half accused of sexual harassment.The probe was launched following the publication in January of a book by French ice skater Sarah Abitbol in which she accused her former coach Gilles Beyer of raping her several times between 1990 and 1992. The book sparked revelations by other skaters.Twelve of the coaches are accused of “sexual harassment or sexual assault”, including three with previous convictions and seven are suspected of “physical or verbal violence”. The other two coaches are dead.Didier Gailhaguet, the president of the French ice sports federation (FFSG) for more than 20 years, was forced to resign at the beginning of February. The sports ministry and the General Inspectorate of Education, Sport and Research (IGESR) also launched an investigation into the sport. “Since the investigation found facts that could be classified as criminal offences, the head of the IGESR informed ministers that she would forward the report to the public prosecutor in Paris,” the sports ministry said in a statement.“The volume of cases identified is indicative of repeated practices and behaviours that have been passed through generations of coaches in the FFSG’s main disciplines of figure skating and ice dancing. It is unparallelled internationally,” the ministry said. The investigation also criticised the way the FFSG was run, with “a strong concentration of powers involving only a few managers,” which could only “encourage a form of omerta over the suspicions about coaches and may have led to the absence of disciplinary procedures, or even simple investigations”. Beyer is also under investigation by the Paris public prosecutor’s office, notably for rape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-investigation-finds-evidence-of-sexual-abuse-from-skating-coaches/story-Igo9hB950v6jjos0etHeiK.html

And on Tuesday, the government fixed the date.“These 400 are those who have been convicted in killings from two to 40 people, drug trafficking, those sentenced to death and involved in major crimes, including kidnapping,” Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the president, said.He said a loya jirga, regarded in the constitutional as the highest expression of the Afghan people, was required as the president was not empowered to release prisoners convicted of such crimes.Held under a giant tent, the loya jirga is a centuries-old institution used to build consensus among competing tribes, factions and ethnic groups and to discuss matters of national importance, traditionally convened under extraordinary circumstances.On Sunday, as the government and Taliban were observing the last day of three-day ceasefire for Muslim Eid holidays, Islamic State militants launched a brazen attack at a prison in eastern Nangarhar province and freed hundreds of inmates.The violence comes at a sensitive time for Afghanistan as the U.S. attempts to usher a peace deal between Afghan government and the Taliban to end 19-year-old war. Since the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Febuary, 3,560 Afghan security forces personnel have been killed in attacks by militants, thousands more have been wounded, Ghani said last week.In the same week, U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a report that more than 1,280 Afghan civilians had been killed in the first six months of the year, mainly as a result of fighting between Afghan government forces and Taliban insurgents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-grand-assembly-on-fate-of-hundreds-of-taliban-prisoners-set-for-friday/story-YORCypoXxD4BZO7GrMkngN.html
04-08-2020||World||China, WHO in talks on plans to trace coronavirus origin||China and the World Health Organization are discussing plans to trace the origin of the coronavirus outbreak following a visit to the country by two experts from the UN agency, the foreign ministry said Tuesday.Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters the experts conducted “preparatory consultations on scientific research cooperation on virus tracing” during their two-week stay, which ended Sunday.Their talks touched on research in the areas of population, environment, molecules, animal traceability and transmission routes of the coronavirus, as well as plans for further scientific research, Wang said.The two sides also further investigated the possible animal source, intermediate host and transmission route of the coronavirus to “more effectively prevent and control the epidemic,” Wang said.Wang said the two sides worked on formulating a plan for China’s contribution to the global tracing effort under a resolution passed by the World Health Assembly under WHO. No word was given on when that effort will begin in earnest.The virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has been linked to a wholesale food market where wild animals were sold. Scientists think it likely jumped from a wild animal such as a bat to humans via an intermediary species, possibly the anteater-like pangolin.However, China says a full investigation may have to wait until the pandemic is under control and has rejected accusations that it delayed releasing information to WHO at the start of the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-who-in-talks-on-plans-to-trace-coronavirus-origin/story-gWzQvcWXJU9uDw12QsJxdK.html

Pyongyang has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017.The interim report, seen by Reuters, was submitted to the 15-member UN Security Council North Korea sanctions committee on Monday.“The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is continuing its nuclear program, including the production of highly enriched uranium and construction of an experimental light water reactor. A Member State assessed that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is continuing production of nuclear weapons,” the report said. North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). North Korea’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN report. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said last week there would be no more war as the country’s nuclear weapons guarantee its safety and future despite unabated outside pressure and military threats.The UN report said one country, which it did not identify, assessed that North Korea “may seek to further develop miniaturisation in order to allow incorporation of technological improvements such as penetration aid packages or, potentially, to develop multiple warhead systems.”‘LUCRATIVE’ CYBERATTACKSNorth Korea has been subjected to UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. While the Security Council has steadily strengthened sanctions in a bid to cut off funding for those programs.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea’s demands for an end to sanctions. In May 2018 North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its main nuclear test site, Punggye-ri, which Pyongyang said was proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing. But they did not allow experts to witness the dismantlement of the site.The UN report said that as only tunnel entrances were known to have been destroyed and there is no indication of a comprehensive demolition, one country had assessed that North Korea could rebuild and reinstall within three months the infrastructure needed to support a nuclear test.The UN experts said North Korea is violating sanctions, including “through illicit maritime exports of coal, though it suspended these temporarily between late January and early March 2020” due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last year the UN experts said North Korea has generated an estimated $2 billion using widespread and sophisticated cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.“The Panel continues to assess that virtual asset service providers and virtual assets will continue to remain lucrative targets for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to generate revenue, as well as mining cryptocurrencies,” the latest report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-has-probably-developed-nuclear-devices-to-fit-ballistic-missiles-un-report/story-aB2a9O5l5VXbdhPs1dWQpN.html
04-08-2020||World||American journalists in Hong Kong could be Beijing’s next target||China could take aim at American journalists in Hong Kong, if the US doesn’t renew visas for Chinese journalists, Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin said.“From what I know, given that the US side hasn’t renewed visa of Chinese journalists, Chinese side has prepared for the worst scenario that all Chinese journalists have to leave the US,” Hu said Tuesday on Twitter. “If that’s the case, Chinese side will retaliate, including targeting US journalists based in HK.”The Global Times is a tabloid run by the People’s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party. Hu’s tweets have become closely watched after accurately forecasting previous moves by China’s government.“Hong Kong is a part of China,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing later Tuesday. “When China is forced to make a necessary and legitimate response, it is within the legitimate diplomatic power of the Chinese government.”Wang said the US restrictions on Chinese journalists had “severely interfered with their normal operations in the US.”“The cause and responsibility for the current situation lies solely with the US,” he said. “If the US continues with its wrongdoings, China will be forced to make necessary and legitimate responses and resolutely safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests.”The US State Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In CrosshairsSuch a move would be an escalation of a tit-for-tat fight that has ensnared media employees in both countries. After the US imposed visa restrictions on Chinese journalists, Beijing in February expelled more than a dozen of their American counterparts, including three Wall Street Journal reporters.The Trump administration then ordered Chinese state-owned news outlets -- including the Xinhua News Agency -- to cut the size of their US-based staff, part of a broader response to Beijing’s restrictions on American journalists.Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong doesn’t issue journalist visas and is supposed to maintain independent control over immigration. But the city’s ability to determine its own immigration policy is being increasingly undermined.In 2018, Hong Kong denied a visa renewal for Victor Mallet of the Financial Times, following his hosting an event with a local independence activist at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club. It also refused entry to Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth. Some of the American reporters kicked out of China earlier this year weren’t allowed to go to Hong Kong.Steps to squeeze journalists in the semi-autonomous financial hub could fuel further tensions between the US and China. The world’s two biggest economies have seen relations worsen in recent months on everything from trade to Hong Kong, on which China has imposed sweeping national security legislation that’s raised fears about basic freedoms -- including of the press.The European Union said in a statement this week that the city’s proposed year-long postponement of key Legislative Council elections previously set for Sept. 6 “would delay the renewal of its democratic mandate and call into question the exercise of the democratic rights and freedoms guaranteed under Hong Kong’s Basic Law.”Hu said earlier that a number of Chinese journalists will see their visas expire on Aug. 6, and “none of them” have yet been renewed. Beijing is preparing for a worst-case scenario where the US forces it to withdraw all Chinese journalists, and will retaliate “fiercely” to refusals to renew their visas, Hu wrote on Weibo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-journalists-in-hong-kong-could-be-beijing-s-next-target/story-EIp3SY4yLzb8e3qFi2vgfI.html

04-08-2020||World||UN chief says 1 billion students affected by Covid-19 closures||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday the coronavirus pandemic has led to the largest disruption of education in history, with schools closed in more than 160 countries in mid-July, affecting over 1 billion students.In addition, the UN chief said at least 40 million children worldwide have missed out on education “in their critical preschool year.”As a result, Guterres warned that the world faces “a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities.”Even before the pandemic, Guterres said, the world faced “a learning crisis,” with more than 250 million children out of school, and only a quarter of secondary school youngsters in developing countries leaving school “with basic skills.”According to a global projection covering 180 countries by the UN education agency UNESCO and partner organizations, some 23.8 million additional children and youths from pre-primary school to university level are at risk of dropping out or not having access to school next year due to the pandemic’s economic impact.“We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people,” Guterres said in a video message and a 26-page policy briefing. “The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people, and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come.”According to the policy briefing, “the unparalleled education disruption” from the pandemic is far from over and as many as 100 countries have not yet announced a date for schools to reopen.Guterres called for action in four key areas, the first being reopening schools.“Once local transmission of Covid-19 is under control,” he said, “getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority.”UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Education Stefania Giannini told reporters the Paris-based agency plans to hold a high-level virtual meeting in the fall, likely during the second half of October, to secure commitments from world leaders and the international community to place education at the forefront of recovery agendas from the pandemic.“There may be economic trade-offs, but the longer schools remain closed the more devastating the impact, especially on the poorest and most vulnerable children,” Giannini warned.She stressed that schools are not only for learning but provide social protection and nutrition, especially for vulnerable youngsters.The coronavirus crisis has amplified digital, social and gender inequalities, Giannini said, with girls, refugees, the disabled, displaced and youngsters in rural areas the most vulnerable and facing limited opportunities to continue their learning.Guterres said increasing financing for education must be given priority.Before the pandemic, low- and middle-income countries faced an education funding gap of $1.5 trillion annually, he said, and the gap in education financing globally could increase by 30% because of the pandemic.The secretary-general said education initiatives must target “those at greatest risk of being left behind,” including youngsters in crises, minorities, and the displaced and disabled. And these initiatives should urgently seek to bridge the digital divide that has become even more evident during the Covid-19 crisis, he said.On a positive note, Guterres said the pandemic is providing “a generational opportunity to reimagine education” and leap forward to systems that deliver quality education.To achieve this, he called for investments in “digital literacy and infrastructure” and education systems that are more flexible, equitable and inclusive.UNESCO’s Giannini said innovations made so far during the pandemic, including online learning and education on radio and television, “proves change can happen quickly.”She said a coalition of global organizations launched a campaign Tuesday called “Save Our Future” to amplify the voices of children and young people and urge governments worldwide to recognize that investing in education is critical to Covid-19 recovery and to the future of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-says-1-billion-students-affected-by-covid-19-closures/story-ilq67xAfra52bi6KrZXE6H.html
04-08-2020||World||Indian mission in Israel extends essential support to communities amid Covid-19 movement restrictions||The Indian Embassy in Israel has launched a unique initiative to reach out to the Indian communities in the country to provide essential consular services amid the restrictions on movement and gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Indian embassy staff have been travelling to various parts of the country once a week so that Indians and Israelis of Indian-origin looking for consular support do not face problems with urgently required documents.The service seems to have created an excitement in the Indian community with many of them appreciating the “personal touch” which they feel is creating a “strong bond”.“The idea of regular consular camps grew out of our internal exercise to set quarterly goals for ourselves in the wake of Covid-19. Given the uncertainties and restrictions flowing from Covid-19, we thought it’ll be better to take the consular services closer to those who need them in these trying times, and all over Israel,” India’s Ambassador to Israel, Sanjeev Singla, told PTI.The staff of the Indian mission have so far been to Jerusalem and Beersheba during the past two weeks and have made announcement that they will be in Haifa in the north and even in Israel’s southernmost Red Sea coastal city of Eilat to meet and extend essential consular services to the Indian community.The services are being extended while following the government guidelines in view of Covid-19 pandemic.“I couldn’t believe it when I got a call saying that I could come and collect my passport at a place really close to my student dormitory. I have been worried about it as I have to do all the formalities related to my stay here which was not possible without the passport in hand”, Shashank Shekhar, a researcher at Beersheba’s Ben-Gurion University, told PTI.“We feel cared for,” said 80-year-old Eliyahu Yosef, an Israeli of Indian-origin.Pamela, who is an OCI and immigrated to Israel some 50 years ago, narrates something similar.She needed help with her husband’s application and had been waiting to travel to Tel Aviv for months.The new initiative has brought much needed relief to the Indian students, caregivers and also Israelis of Indian-origin.“I can’t explain to you the impact this gesture has had on the Indians in Israel. It is being talked about. The personal touch has resulted in further strengthening the strong bond we have with India”, Naor Gudker, who has served as the CEO of Israel Cricket Association in the past, emphasised.Indians in Eilat and Haifa welcomed the initiative with several of them waiting to meet embassy officials with their queries.“The students have been particularly concerned about flights and I went to understand how urgent travel could be managed amid these restrictions,” Nishant, a post-doctoral fellow at the Hebrew University, said.The Indian mission’s staff also went around the country providing masks and gloves to people in the community towards the beginning of the spread of the pandemic, assuring the community of all possible help.“The pandemic will not stop us! Our new normal is to reach out & provide consular services as much as possible. Officials from the embassy of India provided consular services at Beersheba. We will soon be visiting Eilat ( August 7) and Haifa (August 14)” a tweet from the official handle of the embassy said.A flight under the Vande Bharat Mission scheme evacuated 115 Indians on May 25 and the embassy and Air India have made announcements of another being planned later this month.Israel has so far reported 74,430 cases of coronavirus and 546 deaths due to the disease, according to Israel Coronavirus Statistics Tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-mission-in-israel-extends-essential-support-to-communities-amid-covid-19-movement-restrictions/story-cayGJdF8zJUtX7K1gWnNpI.html

India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.A two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb appointed the three lawyers on Monday as it held a hearing of the petition filed by the Pakistan government to appoint a lawyer for Jadhav.Amicus Curiae is a lawyer appointed by a court to assist in any matter or case.The court also ordered a larger bench to be set up for the case. It also directed the registrar of the court to fix the proceedings at 2 pm on September 3 before a larger bench.“We appoint Mr Abid Hassan Manto, Mr Hamid Khan, Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court and former presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and Mr Makhdoom Ali Khan, Senior Advocate Supreme Court and former Attorney General of Pakistan, as amici curiae for our legal assistance in general and, in particular, to ensure that the judgement of the International Court is effectively implemented,” the court said in its order.The Pakistan government in its petition has claimed that Jadhav refused to file a review petition or an application to reconsider the verdict against him by the military court.“We feel that in order to ensure the effectiveness of the review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Commander Jadhav, a reasonable opportunity ought to be extended to the latter and the Government of India to arrange legal representation and to file a petition.“We, therefore, at this stage restrain ourselves from appointing a counsel on behalf of Commander Jadhav and advise the Government of Pakistan to extend an opportunity to Jadhav and the Government of India for arranging legal representation in terms of Article 32(1)(c) of the Convention and in accordance with the applicable laws,” the court order said.The court also asked the Pakistan government to communicate the order to the Indian government Responding to the judge’s remarks, Pakistan’s Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan said an ordinance was issued to give an opportunity to India and Jadhav to file a review petition against the sentence.“We will contact India again through the Foreign Office,” he said.He told the court that Jadhav was being taken care of and was in good health. On July 16, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav, but the Indian government said the access was “neither meaningful nor credible” and he appeared visibly under stress.In New Delhi, External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last month said Pakistan has once again exposed its “farcical” approach by denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence which is also in contravention of the ICJ verdict, and asserted that India will explore further options in the case.Srivastava said Pakistan has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available to India in the case, while noting that New Delhi has so far requested consular access to Jadhav for 12 times over the past one year.The MEA spokesperson said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of ICJ, but also of its own ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-appoints-three-senior-lawyers-as-amici-curiae-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-s-case/story-ulT8u4H0wiDnfEG2yy9sUJ.html

04-08-2020||World||Indian-origin woman researcher killed while jogging in US: Report||A 43-year-old Indian-origin woman researcher in the US was killed while she was out jogging in Plano, a suburb near Dallas, and police have initiated a homicide investigation, according to media reports.According to the police, Sarmistha Sen, who was based in Plano, Texas, was randomly attacked and killed while jogging on August 1 near the Chisholm Trail Park.Her body was found lying in the creek-area near Legacy Drive and Marchman Way by a passer-by, according to a report in the WFAA.com.Sen was a pharmacist and researcher who studied molecular biology and worked with cancer patients.She originally was from Sindri in Jharkhand and moved to Plano after her marriage to Arindam Roy. She has two young sons.According to the Dallasnews.com, a person of interest in the case has been arrested on a burglary charge.The suspect is identified as 29-year old Bakari Moncrief and is being held on a USD 1 million bond for the burglary charge.“We have our suspicions, but we have to have proof,” Plano police spokesperson David Tilley said.“And that’s what they’re looking for right now is trying to obtain proof as to whether or not this individual is or is not responsible for her death,” he said.Police say around the same time of the murder, someone broke into a house nearby on the 3400 block of Michael Drive, fox4news.com reported.“This is not something we see and definitely something very very random,” Plano police spokesperson David Tilley was quoted as saying by the WFAA.com.“For something like this to happen, clearly it concerns all of us. And we’re very hopeful that this is going to be an isolated incident,” he said.The medical examiner has not released the cause of death, and police are not saying how Sen died.An athlete, Sen used to run the popular Chisholm Trail nearly every morning before her children woke up, the report in the fox4news.com said.The incident led to an outpouring of grief and support for the family.Her family says she went for her regular run on Saturday morning and never came back.Her elder brother, Sumit Sen, a doctor, has flown in from California after hearing the news.He said that Sen had a go-getter spirit and was an avid runner.“She just immediately connected with anybody she met on a deeply personal level with a very infectious smile and energy,” Sumit, her brother, said.A day after the incident, strangers, neighbours and friends surrounded two trees near the park with flowers and hundreds of running shoes.“It touched me. It’s great when I’ve seen hundreds of shoes because you know what, people care,” Mario Major, close friend of the family, was quoted as saying by WFAA.com.“Why would something like this happen to someone who’s such a great human being?” Major said.Aneesh Chintala, who visited the memorial on Sunday to pay his respects, said, “I’m upset. I feel really bad for the family. My heart goes out to them because I know they were a nice family.” Her neighbours are also planning a memorial run next Saturday in her memory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-woman-researcher-killed-while-jogging-in-us-report/story-kK2P8YYtw9rGmxVu3pzHCM.html

The groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the temple would take place on August 5 in the holy town of Ayodhya and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be attending the event.Temples across the US will perform special poojas and prayers, while a large number of Indian-Americans have said that they would lit diya to celebrate the bhoomi poojan of the Ram Temple.Indian-Americans from in and around Washington DC said that a tableau truck with a big LED display on Sri Ram Mandir will go around the Capitol Hill and the White house on Tuesday night. “Ayodhya Sri Ram Mandir Tableau will go around the US Capitol Hill marking the beginning of the historic Temple construction at the holiest site for billion strong Hindus around the World,” a statement issued by the community leaders here said.The Hindu Mandir Executives’ Conference and Hindu Mandir Priests’ Conference have also called for a virtual collective national prayer across America to rejoice the upcoming Shree Ram Mandir Poojan at Ayodhya.Similarly in the city of New York as well, Hindu community leaders have decided to celebrate the historic occasion.Images of Lord Ram and 3D portraits of the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya will be beamed across the giant billboards in the iconic Times Square on August 5.Prominent community leader and President of the American India Public Affairs Committee Jagdish Sewhani said that among the prominent billboards that are being leased for the occasion are the giant Nasdaq screen and the 17,000-square-foot wrap-around LED display screen, considered among the largest continuous exterior displays in the world and the highest-resolution exterior LED screen in Times Square.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-to-celebrate-ram-temple-foundation-laying-ceremony/story-kWOgQeVKGFxU99RhiFfE8O.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe number of new Covid-19 cases reported last week fell 5% from the previous week to about 435,000, according to the Reuters tally of state and county reports. California, Florida and Texas collectively accounted for nearly 180,000 of the new cases, though new infections were lower in all three states compared to the previous week.Cases rose week-over-week in 20 states, including in Oklahoma where cases have risen for nine weeks in a row, in Montana where cases are up for eight straight weeks, and in Missouri where infections have risen for seven weeks.Testing for Covid-19 fell by 6% in the United States last week, the first decline since late May, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. Nationally, 8.2% of tests came back positive for the novel coronavirus, still higher than the 5% level that the World Health Organization considers concerning because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered.Thirty-one states had positivity test rates above 5%, according to the analysis, including Alabama at 22%, Mississippi at 21%, and Florida and Kansas at 19%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-rise-for-fourth-week-new-cases-drop-5/story-eDOstCL8omA5aPUvcyRIgO.html
04-08-2020||World||US teachers protest school reopenings, coronavirus cases down in south, west||Teachers at dozens of school districts protested from their cars on Monday over plans by some US governors to resume in-class instruction during the coronavirus pandemic, while Arizona, Florida, California and Texas saw declines in new cases. The teachers, who painted messages on their cars and formed caravans with other school employees, want instruction conducted online until testing shows that classrooms are safe and districts hire more nurses and counselors.The Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association, the union representing public school teachers statewide, posted pictures on Twitter of protesters making cardboard gravestones with messages such as “Here lies a third grade student from Green Bay who caught Covid at school” and “RIP Grandma caught Covid helping grand kids with homework.” Teachers in Chicago, Milwaukee and Philadelphia honked their horns in car protests. Demonstrators rallied outside the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce building, and in Connecticut about 400 formed a car march that passed Governor Ned Lamont’s home.“I do not want to put my students or myself in harm’s way. I do not want to be an experiment,” Chicago elementary school teacher Andrea Parker told reporters.More than 155,000 people have died nationwide from Covid-19 since the virus was first identified in the United States in January. Cases nationally fell for a second week in a row but rose week-over-week in 20 states, including Missouri, Montana and Oklahoma.Deaths in the United States rose for a fourth week in a row to more than 8,500 people in the seven days ended Aug. 2, a Reuters analysis found. Cases trend down in sunbelt statesArizona, California, Florida and Texas, US states with some of the largest populations, saw fewer cases and hospitalizations.Californian Governor Gavin Newsom said intensive care unit admissions were also down in his state but it was too early to celebrate.“This virus is not going away,” Newsom said at a briefing. “It’s not going to take Labor Day weekend off or Halloween off or the holidays off. Until we have a vaccine, we are going to be living with this virus.” The governor said the decline was not enough to merit a change in his order that Californian schools begin the August term with online learning.The Los Angeles teachers union and education officials on Monday agreed to a plan for resuming online-only classes later this month in the nation’s second-largest school district. [L1N2F52C4]Schools are at the center of negotiations between Democrats in Congress and the administration of President Donald Trump over a coronavirus economic relief bill. Democratic leaders and White House negotiators both said on Monday they had made progress in those talks, though the administration said Trump could act alone if no deal is reached. With Democrat Joe Biden leading in polls ahead of the November presidential election, Trump, a Republican, has made school reopenings part of his re-election campaign.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, said in an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association on Monday that states with spiraling case numbers should consider re-imposing lockdown restrictions on residents and businesses.But Fauci told a news conference with Connecticut’s Lamont that he favored getting students back in class, citing negative psychological impacts of keeping them home as well as the role schools play in feeding children.“The default position should be to try as best as you possibly can to open up the schools for in-person learning,” Fauci said.Previously hard-hit parts of New York and New Jersey with dense populations have seen an increase in new cases in recent days, prompting New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy to reduce indoor limits to 25 people per room from 100.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he would announce later this week whether to reopen schools in his state, which has recorded by far the greatest number of Covid-19 deaths, more than 32,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-teachers-protest-school-reopenings-coronavirus-cases-down-in-south-west/story-cgL9a60pWfTcMxYiBUI84O.html

The building fund is expected to deliver 45,000 new homes and the brownfield program 26,000, the government said.“As we get Britain building we are also laying the foundations for a green recovery by investing in vital infrastructure for local communities, creating jobs and building environmentally-friendly homes,” Jenrick said in an emailed statement.Among the projects that will receive funding is a new high-speed railway station at Thanet, on England’s south east coast, and a new commercial space in Manchester, north west England. Across all the funded projects, the government estimates the investment will create 85,000 new jobs.The details of the Green Homes Grant program, helping 600,000 homeowners to make their properties more energy efficient, were announced at the same time. The grants will cover as much as 5,000 pounds of work. Lower income households can claim as much as 10,000 pounds each.The program will cover insulation and double-glazing, as well as the installation of ground source heat pumps, energy efficient doors and heat controls. Households will be offered a list of approved tradespeople within their local area to carry out the work, and vouchers will be issued from September.The grants will “help to protect and create jobs, while also saving people money and cutting carbon,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-1-7-billion-in-building-projects-to-boost-economy/story-IAIbF9QWTmBujh3WtNnL1N.html

The new restrictions took effect from June 24. The H1B visa, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. “Today I am signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule, higher American,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House before signing the order against hiring H-1B visa holders for federal contracts.Trump told reporters that his administration will not tolerate firing of hardworking Americans in the pursuit of cheap foreign labour. “As we speak, we’re finalising the H-1B regulation so that no American workers be replaced ever again. H-1B should be used for top highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labour programmes and destroy American job,” said the president who was surrounded across the Cabinet Room table with individuals campaigning against job outsourcing. Prominent among them were Sara Blackwell, founder and president of Florida-based Protect US Workers organisation; Jonathan Hicks, a software engineer in the Tennessee Valley Authority; and Kevin Lynn, founder of Pennsylvania-based US Tech Workers.The executive order requires all federal agencies to complete an internal audit and assess whether they are in compliance with the requirement that only US citizens and nationals are appointed to the competitive service. As a result, the Department of Labour will also finalise guidlines to prevent H-1B employers from moving H-1B workers to other employers’ job sites to displace Americans workers.Trump’s order follows the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) announcement that it will outsource 20 per cent of its technology jobs to companies based in foreign countries. TVA’s action could cause more than 200 highly-skilled American tech workers in Tennessee to lose their jobs to low-wage, foreign workers hired on temporary work visas, the president said.Outsourcing hundreds of workers is especially detrimental in the middle of a pandemic, which has already cost millions of Americans their jobs, the White House said in a statement. Given the current climate of rampant intellectual property theft, outsourcing IT jobs that involve sensitive information could pose a national security risk, it said.According to the White House, Trump’s actions will help combat employers’ misuse of H-1B visas, which were never intended to replace qualified American workers with low-cost foreign labour. One of the participants present during the signing of the order told the president that as many as 70 per cent of the H-1B visa goes to people from India.Trump said he favours a merit-based immigration system that brings in high-skilled people that creates jobs inside the US and not take jobs of Americans.“We are going to be discussing very shortly an immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It will be a very, very comprehensive bill. It’s a word that some people love, and some people hate. But it’d be very comprehensive only in the sense that it covered just about everything. It will be based on merit. It will cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to,” Trump said.The bill, he said, will be signed after the convention. “Immigration will be very merit based, but it’ll be, it’ll be great for the worker. And it’ll be great for people coming into our country, but coming into our country legally and loving the country and wanting to help our country as opposed to people coming in. And they don’t like our country,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-order-against-hiring-h-1b-visa-holders-for-us-federal-contracts/story-qHtIQVSS6eM2tkIJHKBsMP.html

04-08-2020||World||Hurricane Isaias makes landfall in North Carolina||Hurricane Isaias has made landfall near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane made landfall just after 11 p.m. on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (136 km/h).Coastal shops and restaurants closed early, power began to flicker at oceanfront hotels and even the most adventurous of beachgoers abandoned the sand Monday night as newly restrengthened Hurricane Isaias sped toward the Carolinas.The US National Hurricane Center warned oceanside home dwellers to brace for storm surge up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) and up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in spots, as Isaias moved up the coast. The Carolinas weren’t the only states at risk.“All those rains could produce flash flooding across portions of the eastern Carolinas and mid-Atlantic, and even in the northeast US,” said Daniel Brown, senior hurricane specialist at the US National Hurricane Center. A tropical storm warning extended all the way up to Maine, where flash flooding was possible in some areas on Wednesday.The center also warned of possible tornadoes in North Carolina on Monday night and early Tuesday, and from eastern Virginia to southern New England later Tuesday.Isaias (pronounced ees-ah-EE-ahs) was upgraded again from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane at 11 p.m. EDT. The storm was centered about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east northeast of Myrtle Beach. It was moving north northeast at 22 mph (35 kph). The Hurricane Center said it expected the storm to make landfall early Tuesday near southern North Carolina.Isaias killed two people in the Caribbean and roughed up the Bahamas but remained at sea as it brushed past Florida over the weekend, providing some welcome relief to emergency managers who had to accommodate mask-wearing evacuees in storm shelters.President Donald Trump on Monday described Isaias as “very serious.”“Storm surge and inland flooding are possible and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes,” Trump said.Authorities in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, ordered swimmers out of the water to avoid rough surf and strong rip currents. By nightfall, power began to flicker at beachfront hotels as Isaias crossed the last bit of warm water on its path toward the US mainland.Still, on this part of the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts that has been affected to varying degrees by seven tropical storms or hurricanes since 2014, residents weren’t panicking.“It’s just going to be a lot of wind and high tide,” said Mike Fuller, who has lived along the coast for more than a decade.As the storm neared the shore, a gauge on a pier in Myrtle Beach recorded its third highest water level since it was set up in 1976. Only Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 pushed more salt water inland.Oceanfront streets throughout the area flooded as the sea ended up nearly 10 feet (3 meters) above low tide.Up the coast in southern North Carolina, high winds from Isaias’ inner core knocked down trees and power lines, blocking roads. No major damage was initially reported.Shops and restaurants appeared quieter than usual for a summertime Monday in North Myrtle Beach, but locals blamed Covid-19 more than Isaias. No businesses were boarding up their windows, although some moved outside furniture inside.Wayne Stanley and his family came to the city over the weekend from Julian, North Carolina. He’s never experienced a hurricane, but said he never considered canceling his family’s weeklong vacation either.“I was pretty scared to start off with,” Stanley said Monday. “Then we thought maybe it’s not going to be that bad.”Officials in frequently flooded Charleston, South Carolina, handed out sandbags and opened parking garages so residents on the low-lying peninsula could stow their cars above ground. Forecasters had warned earlier of possible major flooding, but the storm passed faster than expected and only about a dozen streets were flooded.Farther up the coast into North Carolina, the hurricane center predicted storm surges of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters) when Isaias moves onshore.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents on Monday that the storm could be dangerous regardless of its strength. He urged those evacuating to turn to shelters as a last resort, citing coronavirus risks and the need to operate shelters at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing.“Whether it’s labeled a tropical storm or a hurricane, you should take this storm seriously, and make sure your family is ready,” Cooper said.Ferry operators wrapped up evacuations from Ocracoke Island in North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Monday, moving more than 3,500 people and 1,700 vehicles off the island over four days. Island officials were taking no chances after taking a beating less than a year ago from Hurricane Dorian. Evacuation orders also have been issued for Hatteras Island north of Ocracoke.Morgan Stewart said many evacuating residents had come into the store where she works in the inland community of Kinston to buy tarps, batteries, flashlights and other supplies.“You can tell they’re worried,” said Stewart, who saw cars parked on higher ground over the weekend as she secured her boat at a marina.Since forming last week, Isaias has been buffeted by competing forces both trying to kill and strengthen it, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.“Of all the places it could be, it found the warmest water it could,” which fuels storm development, McNoldy said. “And yet it is struggling.”That’s because dry air kept working its way into the storm at low and mid-levels, which chokes storms.Isaias’ passage near Florida over the weekend was particularly unwelcome to authorities already dealing with surging coronavirus caseloads. The storm brought heavy rain and flooding to the state, forcing authorities to close outdoor virus testing sights, as well as beaches and parks. Officials lashed signs to palm trees so they wouldn’t blow away.About 150 people had to keep masks on while sheltering in Palm Beach County, which had a voluntary evacuation order for people living in homes that can’t withstand dangerous winds, said emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-isaias-makes-landfall-in-north-carolina/story-MSYXlpxdnBxYa1oxpAaY0H.html

04-08-2020||World||Manhattan DA probing Trump and his business over more than ‘hush-money’ payments||Manhattan’s district attorney on Monday suggested a grand jury subpoena for US President Donald Trump’s tax returns was part of an investigation of “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,” including alleged insurance and bank fraud. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance raised the scope of the probe in court papers filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday. He is seeking to dismiss Trump’s latest challenge to the subpoena for eight years of personal and corporate tax records.Asked about the investigation at a coronavirus press briefing on Monday, Trump repeated that he believed he is the victim of a political “witch hunt,” which he said was “Democrats’ stuff” and started “even before I got in” to office.“There is nothing that I know even about it,” he added.Trump is scheduled to respond to Vance’s motion to dismiss by Aug. 10. In a court filing last week, Trump’s lawyers argued the subpoena was “wildly overbroad” and issued in “bad faith.”Vance noted in the court papers that when the subpoena was issued last August, there were “public allegations of possible criminal activity” at the Trump Organization dating back a decade. He said public reports show a basis for each category and timeframe of documents sought from Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA.Trump’s argument that the subpoena is overbroad “rests on the false premise that the grand jury’s investigation is limited to so-called ‘hush-money’ payments made by Michael Cohen” on Trump’s behalf in 2016, Vance said.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign violations tied to the payments to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former model Karen McDougal, who claimed they had affairs with Trump, which he denies. In a footnote to Monday’s filing, Vance cited media reports on Trump’s alleged role in the hush-money scheme and on the “unorthodox strategies” he used to expand his real estate empire. He also cited reports of questionable financial statements by Trump, such as when he claimed 55 zoned lots ready for sale at his golf course in Southern California when there were only 31; a 2,000 acre Virginia vineyard that is really only 1,200 acres, and 68 stories at his Trump Tower, 10 higher than the Manhattan property.Cohen testified to Congress last year that Trump inflated his assets when it served his purposes, and deflated them to reduce his real estate taxes. He called his former boss a “con man” and “cheat.”Trump has tweeted that Cohen is a “rat” who was lying to reduce his prison time. The dispute over Trump’s taxes already was subject to a ruling from the US Supreme Court last month that the president was not immune from state criminal probes. Vance urged the court to dismiss Trump’s latest challenge to the subpoena “without delay,” arguing the complaint “merely regurgitates allegations and arguments this court has rejected before.” Vance brought in a high-profile lawyer to assist with the case: Former acting solicitor general Walter Dellinger, onetime head of the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel.Last month, the DA’s office warned US District Court Judge Victor Marrero against allowing statutes of limitations to expire on the alleged crimes.A spokesman for Vance declined comment on the court papers. Grand jury deliberations are secret, and the public may not learn what the subpoena uncovers until after the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manhattan-da-probing-trump-and-his-business-over-more-than-hush-money-payments/story-wo4OVtUWHaoi5lRf4cj9NM.html
04-08-2020||World||Trump seeks TikTok payment to US, despite no clear authority||President Donald Trump repeatedly insisted on Monday that any sale of TikTok’s US operations would have to include a substantial payment to the US -- but it wasn’t clear under what authority he can extract a payout.It would be unprecedented, based on recent history, for the US government to collect a cut of a transaction involving companies in which it doesn’t hold a stake. Trump said the money would come from China or an American buyer such as Microsoft Corp.“The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we’re making it possible,” Trump told reporters at a news conference Monday evening. “Whatever the number is, it would come from the sale, which nobody else would be thinking out but me, but that’s the way I think. And I think it’s very fair.”Earlier in the day, Trump said TikTok will have to close in the US by Sept. 15 -- unless there’s a deal to sell the social network’s domestic operations to Microsoft or another American company.Trump set off a furious scramble over the fate of the Chinese-owned app on Friday, when he said he would ban the company’s operations through an executive action on Saturday. But the weekend passed without any official move from the White House, after the president spoke with Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella about his company’s efforts to purchase the viral video application.Clock tickingMicrosoft said in a blog post that it was aiming to complete a deal for TikTok’s operations in the US, as well as in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, no later than Sept. 15. The White House had insisted upon that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter. It could prove an uphill climb, with key details for the deal -- including price -- still not worked out, people familiar with the discussions said.Microsoft’s blog post also said it’s committed to “providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.” That language referred to tax revenue and job creation, according to a person familiar with the matter -- rather than some sort of special transaction fee.Trump compared the arrangement to landlord-tenant dynamics. “Without the lease, the tenant doesn’t have the value,” he said. “Well, we’re sort of in a certain way the lease. We make it possible to have this great success.”The US assesses fees associated with deals under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which investigates overseas acquisitions of US businesses. But those charges -- set on a sliding scale and going no higher than $300,000 -- didn’t fit what Trump described.CFIUS has been reviewing ByteDance Ltd.’s 2017 purchase of the lip-synching app Musical.ly that was later folded into TikTok.The White House has said it’s concerned that ByteDance could be compelled to hand over American users’ data to Beijing or use the app to influence the 165 million Americans, and more than 2 billion users globally, who have downloaded it. And Trump has looked to ratchet up pressure on China ahead of November’s election, frustrated by slow implementation of the trade pact inked earlier this year and the spread of the coronavirus for which he blames China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-seeks-tiktok-payment-to-us-despite-no-clear-authority/story-CRw6RjTN5mHJ9nLj0FeM5N.html
04-08-2020||World||Vehicle malfunction sparked Southern California wildfire||A wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles that has forced thousands of people from their homes was sparked by a malfunctioning diesel vehicle, fire officials said Monday.The vehicle spewed burning carbon from its exhaust system, igniting several fires Friday on Oak Glen Road in Cherry Valley, and authorities were asking anyone who may have seen such a vehicle at the time to contact investigators, according to a statement from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The blaze in Riverside County, among several wildfires across California, had consumed more than 41 square miles (about 106 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber since it broke out Friday evening, fire officials said.As of Monday afternoon, it was just 5% contained and the fire along with coronavirus precautions made for added stress at an evacuation center, said John Medina, an American Red Cross spokesman.Volunteers used to “close contact” with evacuees have had to adjust their approach during a time of social distancing, Medina said.“I mean, that’s part of the recovery of a disaster, is that you have to show warmth and love and caring. And that’s hard when you’re standing 6 feet away. So that’s the biggest challenge,” Medina told KESQ-TV.Bill Boehm helped his mother evacuate her home with her three horses and said the pandemic hasn’t stopped people from coming together to assist each other.“Everyone seemed to be wearing masks and such, so that type of precaution was still going on,” Boehm told the news station.The blaze began as two adjacent fires in a rural area near the city of Beaumont, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.Flames raced along brushy ridge tops and came close to houses while firefighters attacked from the ground and air.One home and two outbuildings were destroyed, California fire officials said. No injuries were reported.In Northern California, evacuations were ordered after a wildfire that sparked Sunday afternoon spread quickly and burned near homes near the East Park Reservoir in Colusa County. Complicating firefighters’ efforts were temperatures in the area north of Sacramento climbed to 98 degrees (37 Celsius) by Monday afternoon. The fire was 40% contained.On California’s central coast, a fire in San Luis Obispo County was 60% contained Monday after burning more than 2 square miles (6 square kilometers) of brush east of the community of Santa Margarita. Two structures were destroyed but officials said it was unclear whether they were homes.In Riverside County, officials allowed flames from the Apple Fire to run up the side of Mount San Gorgonio, an 11,000-foot (3,350-meter) peak, because it wasn’t safe to let crews work in such steep, rugged terrain, said Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.Evacuation orders and advisories were issued for about 2,500 homes in mountain, canyon and foothill neighborhoods. Campgrounds and hiking trails were closed in the San Gorgonio Wilderness area of the San Bernardino National Forest.A smoke plume was visible for miles around and contributed to poor air quality.Firefighters fought the blaze in scorching weather. The temperature hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) on Monday in nearby Palm Spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vehicle-malfunction-sparked-southern-california-wildfire/story-oIQPGCoSzxqaSVpjn75QsI.html
04-08-2020||World||Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume dies at 83||John Hume, the visionary politician who won a Nobel Peace Prize for fashioning the agreement that ended violence in his native Northern Ireland, has died at 83, his family said Monday.The Catholic leader of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party, Hume was seen as the principal architect of Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace agreement. He shared the prize later that year with the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, for their efforts to end the sectarian violence that plagued the region for three decades and left more than 3,500 people dead.“I want to see Ireland as an example to men and women everywhere of what can be achieved by living for ideals, rather than fighting for them, and by viewing each and every person as worthy of respect and honor,” he said in 1998. “I want to see an Ireland of partnership, where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalized and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.”Hume died Monday morning after suffering from ill health for several years, his family said.Born on Jan. 18, 1937, in Northern Ireland’s second city — Londonderry to British Unionists, Derry to Irish nationalists — Hume trained for the priesthood before becoming a fixture on Northern Ireland’s political landscape. An advocate of nonviolence, he fought for equal rights in what was then a Protestant-ruled state, but he condemned the Irish Republican Army because of his certainty that no injustice was worth a human life.Although he advocated for a united Ireland, Hume believed change could not come to Northern Ireland without the consent of its Protestant majority. He also realized that better relations needed to be forged between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and between London and Dublin.He championed the notion of extending self-government to Northern Ireland with power divided among the groups forming it.“Ireland is not a romantic dream; it is not a flag; it is 4.5 million people divided into two powerful traditions,″ he said. “The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real division of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.”While both Hume and Trimble credited the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for approving a referendum that led to power sharing, it was Hume’s diplomacy that offered the impetus to the peace process that led to the 1998 Good Friday accord.Hume won the breakthrough in Belfast’s political landscape in 1993 by courting Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire. That dialogue burnished Adams’ international credibility and led to two IRA cease-fires in 1994 and 1997.Like most Protestant politicians at the time, Trimble had opposed efforts to share power with Catholics as something that would jeopardize Northern Ireland’s union with Britain. He at first refused to speak directly with Adams, insisting that IRA commanders needed to prove they were willing to abandon violence.He ultimately relented and became pivotal in peacemaking efforts.Hume had envisioned a broad agenda for the discussions, arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the British and Irish governments. The process was overseen by neutral figures like U.S. mediator George Mitchell, with the decisions overwhelmingly ratified by public referendums in both parts of Ireland.“Without John Hume, there would not have been a peace process,” Mitchell said at the time the prize was announced. ”Without David Trimble, there would not have been a peace agreement.”Hume and Trimble were said to have had a frosty relationship. But Trimble on Monday described a thawing after the Nobel ceremony in Oslo, recalling that the hotel at which they were staying had suggested the two men chose to relax away from each other.“We didn’t do that. We relaxed and in some sense celebrated the occasion jointly, and that for me spelt out the principle for how we were going to proceed in the years after that,” he told the BBC.Tributes poured in after’s Hume’s death was announced, including praise from Adams, who called him a “giant in Irish politics.” Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was in office at the time the accord was signed, lauded Hume’s “epic” contribution to the peace process.Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement describing their sadness.“Through his faith in principled compromise, and his ability to see his adversaries as human beings, John helped forge the peace that has held to this day,’’ they said.U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Northern Ireland of today is Hume’s legacy.“He stood proudly in the tradition that was totally opposed to violence and committed to pursuing his objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means,’’ Johnson said on Twitter. “His vision paved the way for the stability, positivity and dynamism of the Northern Ireland of today and his passing is a powerful reminder of how far Northern Ireland has come.’’Hume’s family said his funeral would be in keeping with strict guidelines on attendees because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A memorial will be arranged later.“We are grateful for your condolences and support, and we appreciate that you will respect the family’s right to privacy at this time of great loss,’’ the family said in a statement. “It seems particularly apt for these strange and fearful days to remember the phrase that gave hope to John and so many of us through dark times: ‘We shall overcome.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-peace-prize-winner-john-hume-dies-at-83/story-IKpZ4FuT7ewMgQBgTJ7P9J.html
04-08-2020||World||France halts ratification of Hong Kong extradition treaty||France on Monday said it was halting ratification of an extradition treaty with Hong Kong over China’s controversial national security law for the city, just hours after Beijing suspended a similar pact with New Zealand. “In light of the latest developments, France will not proceed as it stands with the ratification of the extradition agreement signed on May 4, 2017 between France and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement.Earlier in the day, China suspended Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with New Zealand. France and New Zealand are the latest to join a string of Western powers including Canada, UK, Australia and Germany that suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong since the controversial law was introduced in late June.China has already hit back by suspending Hong Kong’s extradition treaties with Canada, Britain and Australia. “New Zealand’s practices... grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said while announcing Beijing’s decision to suspend any judicial cooperation with Wellington.Critics say the security law will erode civil liberties and human rights enjoyed by residents in the former British colony, which was returned to China in 1997.New Zealand has also tightened restrictions on military and dual-use exports to Hong Kong.Chinese and Australian diplomats sparred on Twitter over Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea following Australia’s endorsement of a US statement that it would recognise virtually none of China’s territorial claims there.Australia recently filed a memorandum with the United Nations saying the claims were “without legal basis,” plunging Canberra into the controversy that has drawn angry responses from Beijing. Australian High Commissioner Barry O’Farrell tweeted on Thursday he told Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar that China’s moves were “destabilising and could provoke escalation.”Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong responded on Friday by accusing O’Farrell of “disregarding facts,” writing: “It’s clear who safeguard peace&stability & destabilise&provoke escalations in the region.”O’Farrell shot back saying China should follow a 2016 international tribunal ruling that rejected most of Beijing’s claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-halts-ratification-of-hong-kong-extradition-treaty/story-kaYufRuJGYfiIT0XH3Un9N.html
04-08-2020||World||Ex Pope Benedict’s condition ‘not particularly worrying’: Vatican||The Vatican, responding to a German newspaper report that former Pope Benedict XVI was seriously ill, said on Monday his condition was “not particularly worrying” and that he was overcoming a painful but not grave ailment.The clarification came hours after Benedict’s biographer, Peter Seewald, sparked alarm by telling the Passauer Neue Presse that he had found the 93-year-old ex-pope exceptionally frail when he visited him on Saturday.Seewald said Benedict, who has been in shaky health for some time, was now suffering from shingles, a viral infection that causes painful rashes and is common among older people.“The health conditions of the Pope Emeritus are not particularly worrying, apart from being those of an old man of 93 who is overcoming the most acute phase of a painful but not grave illness,” the statement said.Seewald said Benedict’s voice was barely audible - echoing something other visitors have said for months - and that the former pope told him he might pick up writing again if he regains his strength.In June, Benedict, who lives in a former convent in the Vatican gardens, left Italy for the first time since his resignation in 2013 for an emotional farewell visit to his older brother Georg in their native Bavaria.Georg Ratzinger died on July 1 aged 96. The two brothers were ordained priests on the same day in 1951.Benedict, who was elected in 2005 to succeed the widely popular Pope John Paul II after a reign of nearly 27 years, shocked the world and even his closest aides on Feb. 11, 2013, when he announced in Latin he was stepping down.He told a gathering of cardinals that he was too old and frail to lead an institution with more than 1.3 billion members.At the time of Benedict’s resignation the Vatican was mired in a raft of financial woes, sexual abuse scandals and infighting among bureaucrats that led to leaks of important documents.Benedict said his resignation was for exclusively health reasons.Hardline conservatives in the Church who have been alarmed by Pope Francis’ progressive moves have looked to Benedict as their standard bearer. This forced the former pope on several occasions to remind them that there is only one pope - Francis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-pope-benedict-s-condition-not-particularly-worrying-vatican/story-qPJgu9wULTzCJJkodOIUaO.html

In the absence of a vaccine or cure, states are deploying Bluetooth wireless technology to log contacts and alert people when someone they have been near tests positive.Spain used a new system developed by Google and Apple which holds data on individual devices to ensure privacy, to build an app it tested on La Gomera, an island next to the tourist hotspot of Tenerife in the Canary archipelago, in July.Now the government aims to offer it to regional health authorities who could have it ready by mid-September, and from Aug. 10 to tourism-dependent areas or places where cases are rising, said Carme Artigas, head of the state digital and artificial intelligence unit.“The app sees more than we see because we only remember contacts with people we know, but the app also remembers contacts with strangers,” Artigas said.“It is anonymous and much less intrusive than receiving a call from someone who wants to reconstruct everything you have done for the past 15 days,” Artigas added.Some 3,200 people downloaded the app, just pipping a target of 3,000.Participants anonymously entered randomly distributed codes into the app, some of which falsely indicated a positive Covid-19 test, which then alerted everyone with whom they had spent a minimum of 15 minutes at a proximity of 2 metres (6.5 ft) or less.For every virtual positive diagnosis, the app identified an average 6.4 contacts with others, Artigas’s ministry said in a statement, compared with an average 3.5 contacts identified by human tracers in the Canary Islands. The spread of the disease in Spain slowed as the government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe and as many countries limited international travel, but new cases have started rising again, hitting a post-lockdown record of 1,525 on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-to-roll-out-covid-19-app-twice-as-effective-as-human-tracers-in-pilot/story-GDsiDHQHQbNYwwEnnJwIyN.html
04-08-2020||World||Spain’s new wave of infections hits the young, middle-aged||Like most Spaniards, Emma Gaya thought the worst of the pandemic was behind her.Spain’s government had ended a three-month lockdown after an Covid-19 onslaught that claimed at least 28,400 lives in the European Union nation. To kickstart its stalled economy, Spaniards were encouraged to cautiously resume their lives under a “new normality” based on wearing face masks, washing hands and social distancing.The respite didn’t last long.Outbreaks among farm workers and young people desperate to resume socializing after being cooped up have spread across northern Spain, spawning what some health officials fear could be the start of a dreaded “second wave” of infections.“It pains me to think that we could be right back where we were,” Gaya said after getting tested for coronavirus at her local health clinic in Sant Sadurni D’Anoia, a village near Barcelona. She came in because she had a fever, one of the typical symptoms of Covid-19, along with a dry cough and the loss of a sense of smell.“I think we had done things well. Now I don’t know if we are doing it well at all. I’m not sure at what point we are safe,” Gaya said.On June 22, the day after Spain ended a national state of emergency and restored free movement around the country, the health ministry registered 125 new cases in 24 hours. Six weeks later, the daily count has jumped, hitting 1,525 on Friday.Spain is leading Western Europe’s major countries with an average of 60 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants. While the country’s south and the Canary and Balearic Islands remain in good shape, the regions of Navarra, Aragón, and Catalonia have registered more than 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a 14-day period, making Spain’s northeast the biggest European hot spot along with parts of Romania, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.In contrast to the darkest weeks of March and April, when the virus ripped through Spain’s elderly in nursing homes and pushed the country’s hospitals to the breaking point, the pressure is now on Spain’s neighborhood health clinics. They are trying to screen and isolate the new infections, which are taking place mostly among the young, who in Spain and countries across the world are ignoring social distancing, and the middle-aged.The average age of a virus patient in Spain has fallen from 63 in the spring to 45 now and “the pressure on the health system is low,” said Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa. Since the virus takes a heavier toll on the elderly, younger coronavirus patients means more who have milder symptoms.Spain’s improved testing capacity makes a comparison to the start of the pandemic difficult. In February, March and April, a shortage of tests meant that only the very sick who were admitted to hospitals were tested and that a significant number of coronavirus cases went undetected.Now, local clinics are discovering many more infections among those who don’t show symptoms.“We are in a different situation (than the spring) because right now we have tests available,” said Dr. Miriam Ceña, director of the health clinics in Sant Sadurni D’Anoia, which is seeing a jump in cases like the area around Barcelona, Catalonia’s largest city.“We are in a situation of risk and alert. We don’t want to alarm the population, but we want the population to be responsible,” Ceña said. “In March, there was the lockdown so the situation was under more control. Right now, there is free movement and socializing and those are a risk of contagion.”The surge in new infections is sure to add to the drastic contraction of Spain’s economy by slamming hopes of reactivating the country’s critical tourism sector. The economy has already dropped 18% in the second quarter — its biggest dip since Spain’s 1936-39 Civil War.Britain has placed a 14-day quarantine on travelers returning from Spain, while France, Germany, and Belgium have all issued travel warnings or discouraged trips to northeast Spain.Authorities have for several weeks warned about the danger of new outbreaks, but experts predicted they would likely occur in the colder months. Instead, the surge has come in mid-summer, when Spaniards are eager to reconnect with family and friends, and hotels, restaurants and shops are counting on both domestic and foreign tourists to cushion the pandemic’s blow to their balance sheets.Spain must now pull off the delicate balancing act of managing the health crisis while reactivating its economy. Officials desperately hope they can avoid another full lockdown that would be catastrophic to businesses and jobs despite the expected injection of massive aid from the European Union.Catalonia and many other regions have reintroduced restrictions, making masks obligatory at all times outside the home and reclosing nightclubs due to their links to outbreaks.“We must be obsessive about complying with the protection measures,” said Catalonia’s public health director, Josep Argimon.Catalonia, however, is only now deploying 600 workers to its clinics to help nurses and doctors handle the demands of contact tracing, which has been insufficient so far. That lack of urgency has drawn strong criticism from health workers and mayors.Spain’s government is rolling out a phone app to help contract tracers find and stamp out new infections, while making a renewed appeal for individuals to act responsibly.“There are many citizens who feel anguish upon seeing the outbreaks that are happening in different parts of our country,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Friday. “Because we have all had to make an enormous effort to be disciplined, show resistance and muster the will to defeat the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-s-new-wave-of-infections-hits-the-young-middle-aged/story-yvZBexEX0NpEoGJm4lumwN.html
04-08-2020||World||With loan money gone, restaurants are at mercy of coronavirus||The check has arrived and beleaguered restaurant owners across America are looking down on their empty wallets.Government coronavirus loans in the spring helped eating establishments rehire laid-off employees and ride out the pandemic’s initial surge and wave of shutdown orders.But that Paycheck Protection Program money has now been spent at many restaurants, leaving them in the same precarious position they were in during outbreak’s early days: Thousands of restaurants are being forced to close down again on mandates from state and local officials combating the virus’s resurgence, particularly in the South and West.And even in parts of the country where the outbreak appears contained, restaurants’ revenue is far below normal because social distancing requirements — and wary diners — mean fewer tables, fewer customers and limited hours.John Pepper used a PPP loan to pay employees and reopen four of his eight Boloco restaurants when Massachusetts lifted its shutdown order in early May. But with the money spent and business at the restaurants down as much as 70%, Pepper had to again close two locations. The staff of 125 he had before the virus outbreak is down to 50.“A lot of this is out of our hands at this point,” Pepper says. “At this moment, I don’t see getting my full payroll back.”Congress is debating another relief bill that potentially will have more help for small businesses, but even with more loan or grant money, restaurants will remain at the mercy of the virus that has decimated their business.The virus’s resurgence has prompted officials in California, Texas, Florida and other states to order restaurants shut again. In the Northeast and other parts of the country where infection rates appear more stable, no one expects limits on inside dining to be lifted anytime soon.Restaurants generally have a low profit margin, between 5% and 6%, and they achieve that only if they have a full house virtually every day, says Sean Kennedy, executive vice president for the trade group National Restaurant Association. They also tend to have only about two weeks of cash on hand, making them highly vulnerable when their sales are down.“They aren’t designed to have an on-off switch. They’re designed to be used seven days a week, 14 to 15 hours a day at 100% of capacity,” Kennedy says.Gerry Cea was forced to shut his Miami restaurant, Cafe Prima Pasta, from March into May when the outbreak first began. Now, he has again closed the dining room as local officials try to contain the virus; the Miami/Dade area is one of Florida’s hit hardest by the virus.Cea is still able to serve customers outside, but the intense South Florida heat and frequent summer rains are limiting him to about 40 diners a night instead of the hundreds he served before the pandemic hit. And Cea is mindful that the peak hurricane season is still to come.“With the PPP money we received, we were able to pay 48 employees but that has run out now, so we are left with very few alternatives” for funding, Cea says. He’s hoping for more help from the government, even if it’s a loan that must be repaid.In the meantime, Cea says, “the only reason we are pretty much surviving is because we own the building,” he says.The pandemic has devastated an industry that expected to have nearly $900 billion in sales this year. Before the outbreak, the Labor Department counted 12 million workers in restaurants and bars, and nearly two-thirds worked at small businesses with fewer than 500 workers. In April, employment in restaurants and bars of all sizes had been cut by nearly half as establishments across the country were closed.Restaurants were among the small businesses the Paycheck Protection Program was intended to help, but some owners say it was of limited use.The program so far has given about $42 billion in loans to restaurants, bars and lodging companies. But many restaurants burned through loans quickly because the original terms of the program required them to use the money within eight weeks in order to get loan forgiveness. Many establishments couldn’t reopen but paid staffers not to work anyway. Then when they reopened with revenue limited by social distancing, they couldn’t afford their full payrolls. Congress changed the spending requirement to 24 weeks in early June, but that was too late for many restaurants.It’s not yet known what small business help will be in any upcoming relief package, although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has mentioned the possibility that small businesses with big revenue declines could get a second PPP loan.But restaurants need a long-term solution that addresses their particular needs, Kennedy says. For example, allowing families that get food stamp assistance to use their benefits in restaurants.“We’re going to be limping along or shutting down altogether” without long-term help, Kennedy says.Stephanie Williams still hasn’t fully reopened two of her Bennu Coffee shops in Austin, Texas, and continues to operate with curbside service and delivery only; a third location that opened over the weekend does have socially distanced seating. Williams has spent the PPP money she got in early May — she had recalled furloughed workers but with revenue at one store down by half and the other by nearly two-thirds, Williams had to let 20 staffers go again.“We assumed at the end of eight weeks, this will be over. But here in Texas, things are drastically worse than when we shut down in March,” Williams says. Like other states where the virus is resurgent, Texas saw cases increase after it ended shutdown orders in early May.Even in areas where the virus appears stable and restaurants can have inside dining, they’re struggling. Wolf’s Ridge Brewing, a Columbus, Ohio, restaurant and brewery, has had to close its dining room and return to takeout and delivery, having used its PPP money and not having enough revenue due to social distancing.“What the PPP did was put us in a position where we brought people back before we had enough business to support them,” co-founder Bob Szuter says. He’s trying to figure out new ways to bring in revenue, focusing more on the brewery side of the business until it’s safe to have a full dining room.Jason Brauner’s restaurant, Bourbon Bistro, exhausted its PPP loan, is operating at 50% of capacity and not making enough to cover its expenses. Brauner is worried that the virus’s resurgence will force the Louisville, Kentucky, establishment to close; he had shut completely for two weeks in March before switching to curbside service and then gradually reopened. He’s paid his full staff throughout.Brauner is hoping to get a grant from the city and he’d welcome another PPP loan. A separate economic injury disaster loan from the SBA give him some breathing room, but also presents a dilemma. Like many restaurant owners, Brauner worries about carrying long-term debt when the future is uncertain.“I’m almost tempted to give it back,” he says. “We just have to see how it all plays out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-loan-money-gone-restaurants-are-at-mercy-of-coronavirus/story-sm8YQlvZoqO1ZDRvWA3RPN.html
04-08-2020||World||Vietnam capital short of test kits as national coronavirus cases climb||Vietnam reported 10 new Covid-19 infections and two deaths on Tuesday, lifting its total cases to 652, with eight dead, as the capital Hanoi said it was running short of the rapid testing kits being used to keep a new outbreak at bay.Targeted testing and strict quarantining had helped Vietnam contain earlier outbreaks, but it is battling a new cluster of infections after going more than three months without detecting any domestic transmission.The new outbreak has infected more than 200 people since July 25, the majority in the central city of Danang, but it has spread to at least eight other cities and provinces, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where entertainment venues are closed and gatherings restricted to prevent infections.Danang and Buon Ma Thuot in the coffee-growing Central Highlands have been placed on lockdown. A government spokesman on Monday said Vietnam does not plan a nationwide lockdown. More than 88,000 people have returned to Hanoi from Danang since July 8, but only 70,689 were tested, the health ministry said. Only two of those were positive. The gap is due to a shortage of rapid testing kits used to screen thousands of residents at a time, according to state media.The health ministry said it would assign Hanoi medical institutions and hospitals to boost testing capacity. The rapid test kits, which can diagnose a blood sample in minutes but are prone to inaccuracies, are used to identify potentially positive cases which are then confirmed with the more accurate, swab-based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.Phan Quoc Viet, chairman of test kit manufacturer Viet A Corp, said he was not concerned about stocks.“Vietnam is not short,” Viet told Reuters. “We have enough for two million PCR tests and are willing to provide enough kits for the country to conduct a widespread testing programme”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-capital-short-of-test-kits-as-national-coronavirus-cases-climb/story-mhvGyb9fBuypITHE6jjB2H.html
