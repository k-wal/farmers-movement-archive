Over the last few years, there have been many claims, some with similar warnings, and others that said the fears of a crisis being uncalled for.The study, by Dr Melvin Vopson, a senior lecturer at the School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Portsmouth, is a red flag.Considering the present requirements of storing data and extrapolating it with a growth rate of 50%, Dr Vopson said that the energy requirement will reach 18.5 terawatt (TW). This is the net energy being produced in the world today and powers everything from transport to households and industries. “It’s certainly interesting to attempt such a thought experiment but I believe it (the new study) is oversimplifying the matter,” said Dr Fabian Natterer, a professor at the department of physics of the University of Zurich who independently reviewed the study. He was part of the IBM team that, in 2017, managed to encode a bit onto an atom.Bits are binary codes -- appearing in 0s and 1s -- that is used to encode everything from the English alphabet to pictures in a form that machines can understand. Under existing technologies, almost 100,000 atoms are required to store one bit.Researchers have been trying to compress data onto the smallest area of material, giving us smaller devices with great capabilities. There have been attempts at even coding data into new materials, such as plastic and even, DNA. March of technologyDr. Natterer said that the new study did not touch upon the latest technology.“The latest developments in data recording, such as using the tunnel effect to write information to bits, would have drastically lower energy requirements per writing operation,” he said. “One could also note that it is conceivable to store more than one bit per atom, since atoms have more inner structure that could be exploited.”But such technologies are decades away, argued Dr Vopson.“It is not only the complexity around the writing and storing information in such a small volume, but developing sensitive enough read heads to retrieve back the information is another beast,” he said.Power requirements The complexity and sensitivity, in part, has to do with keeping noise -- disturbances to a signal -- out, which will require protecting bits from outside interference.In Dr Natterer’s work, for example, a rare atom had to be cooled to -233℃ for it to have the stability to hold a single bit. This, as anyone who owns an air conditioner would know, is expensive and energy consuming.“Practical systems cannot hold off noise completely and when we reach the quantum level, it is going to be highly fragile,” said Dr Shayan Srinivasa Garani of the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science. “Even to isolate an atom, you need to put an enormous amount of energy. So I’m sceptical about information bits being stored in every atom.”But data centers are advancing in terms of efficiency. A study in Science reported between 2010 and 2018, for example, while computing output had increased six-fold, the power increase was only six per cent. They concluded that though this trend is expected to continue for a few years, beyond that was anyone’s guess. “To store tons and tons of data, you’ll have to put up huge data centres where you’ll have to expend energy. That is a big concern,” said Dr. Garani.“According to IBM and other Big Data research sources, 90% of the world’s data today has been created in the last 10 years alone. I didn’t want to sound alarmist in the article, but the growth values used are rather conservative,” said Dr Vopson. “In some ways, the current Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated this process as more digital content is used and produced than ever before.” Dr Natterer, however, was more reserved in his assessment. “Since the scope of the (AIP Advances) author’s work extends to hundreds and thousands of years, it is conceivable that technology will catch up as well by then,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-200-years-data-generation-to-take-up-as-much-power-as-the-world-produces-today-study/story-cD53zIa6t9r4S4wzI731hL.html

As research laboratories around the world race to develop a vaccine, manufacturers have received financing to help them prepare to have millions of doses ready to administer in 2021 or even before the end of the year.Oxford University, working with the Swedish-British pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca, hopes to have results by September while the US biotech company Moderna, partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), is aiming for the end of the year, possibly November.- US: 700 million doses -President Donald Trump has launched “Operation Warp Speed” in a bid to develop, manufacture and distribute a Covid-19 vaccine to all Americans by January 2021.Hundreds of millions of dollars have been directed to vaccine developers including nearly $500 million to Johnson & Johnson at the end of March.The United States has allocated funding to more companies than other nation in the hope that one of them will come up with the vaccine to counter the highly contagious virus.So far, Washington has handed out at a total of least 9.4 billion dollars to seven vaccine developers and signed manufacturing contracts with five of them to provide 700 million doses.The companies involved are: Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Oxford/AztraZeneca, Novavax, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sanofi/GSK, Merck Sharp and Dohme. - Europe: 700 million dosesTwo vaccine developers -- Oxford/AztraZeneca and Sanofi/GSK -- have signed or are in advanced negotiations with the European Commission to provide a combined 700 million vaccine doses.- Britain, Japan, Brazil -Britain, because of Brexit, is negotiating a separate pre-order of 250 million doses from four developers.Japan is counting on 490 million doses from three suppliers including 250 million from Novavax of the United States.Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda bought the rights to a Novavax vaccine for Japan, which has funded the research. It would be produced locally.Brazil chose a similar model, ordering 100 million doses from AstraZeneca, and partnering with China’s Sinovac to produce 120 millions of “CoronaVac,” which is already undergoing testing with Brazilians.- China, Russia -Clinical tests of two Chinese vaccine candidates -- Sinovac and Sinopharm -- are well underway but only a few international partnerships have been announced, the one with Brazil and a possible one with Indonesia.Russia said 20 nations have pre-ordered one billion doses of Sputnik V and that with foreign partners it would be able to produce 500 million doses a year in five countries.- Developing countries -The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), launched in 2017 by Norway, India, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, seeks to ensure that there is “equitable access” to future vaccines.It has pre-ordered 300 million doses from AstraZeneca for dozens of developing countries in a partnership with The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi).Billions of doses would be produced for Asia and elsewhere by the giant Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest vaccine producer in the world.Novavax and AstraZeneca have separately signed agreements with SII to produce a billion doses each for India and low- and middle-income countries on the condition, of course, that they prove their efficacy in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pre-orders-of-covid-19-vaccine-top-five-billion/story-4JOtt9KymlPfkQeFonDFXL.html

The Yantai city government said in a statement the seafood was from an imported shipment that landed at Dalian but did not say where it originated.In July, customs officers in Dalian, a major port in the northeastern province of Liaoning, found the coronavirus in the packaging of frozen shrimps imported from Ecuador, and China then suspended imports from three Ecuadorean shrimp producers.The novel coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a market that sold seafood and wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.It has since spread around the world, with some new cases brought back into China from returning travellers.Some of the seafood that the three Yantai companies bought had been processed for export, while the rest had been kept in cold storage and has not entered the market, the Yantai government said.When asked if any of the processed seafood had been exported, a member of staff at a coronavirus outbreak response unit in Yantai declined to elaborate, referring Reuters to the Yantai city government statement.Authorities had sealed off the goods, the city government said. Everyone who handled the goods was under quarantine and have tested negative for the coronavirus, it said.The latest outbreak of coronavirus in Dalian city started in late July, with the first case working at a seafood processing company. By Aug. 9, Dalian has reported a total of 92 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-found-on-frozen-seafood-in-china/story-Lh77GCmu8Xl3IrML2hyj9K.html

The United States has never had a female vice president, and the move comes four years after the country’s first female presidential nominee lost her White House bid.Of Biden’s vow to choose a woman, Trump said, “Some people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it’s fine.”Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said Trump is “easily threatened.”“And because of his insulting negligence and erratic, failed leadership, over 5 million Americans have been infected with coronavirus, over 160,000 died, and tens of millions remain jobless,” Bates said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-would-be-inclined-to-go-a-different-route-trump-says-people-insulted-that-biden-vowed-to-name-female-vp/story-0vsqZZ4zjm41IcAVeDH7eJ.html
11-08-2020||World||Watchdog report: Mike Pompeo acted properly in Saudi arms sale||The State Department’s internal watchdog has found that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not act improperly last year when he approved billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia without the consent of Congress.The State Department Office of Inspector General concluded in a report released Tuesday that Pompeo had the legal authority to declare an emergency and bypass Congress under the Arms Export Control Act.Republicans joined with Democrats in Congress to oppose the sales, but President Donald Trump, who has made close relations to Saudi Arabia a priority, vetoed resolutions in July 2019 to block the transfers and there were not enough votes to override him.The inspector general report itself has become the focus of congressional scrutiny after former Inspector General Steve Linick, who was removed from his post in May by Trump, testified to Congress that senior State Department officials had sought to block his inquiry.Senior State Department officials have said Linick was removed from his watchdog position for leaking another report and not because of his probe of the arms sales, which came amid bipartisan congressional concerns about civilian casualties in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.At least one prominent congressional critic, New York Rep. Eliot Engel, cautioned before the report’s release that it should be treated with skepticism. He noted that it features a classified annex that the public can’t read and that the State Department official in charge of arms sales review has declined to answer questions from a committee investigating Linick’s ouster.Engel, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, dismissed the emergency certification used to authorize the sales as “phony.”The report examined the process that Pompeo used to make the emergency certification. Pompeo cited the threat posed by Iran and its support for rebels in Yemen to justify approving arms sales totaling $8.1 billion to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.The report concluded that the law grants the secretary the discretion to decide what constitutes an emergency, something three previous administrations have done with respect to arms sales to Saudi Arabia.It also noted that the State Department did not “fully assess” the risks of civilian casualties from the sale of certain types of weapons, and that it “regularly” approved arms transfers to Saudi Arabia and the UAE that fell below the reporting threshold to Congress.A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters Monday on condition of anonymity to preview the report, said there was disagreement on the threshold for reporting to Congress and that there was already an effort underway to try to reduce the potential for civilian casualties with American weapons provided to allies.The official said the “big takeaway” from the report is that Pompeo and the department acted “in accordance with the law” as it sought to aid the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The report notes that the grinding, five-year-old civil war in Yemen has led to what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/watchdog-report-mike-pompeo-acted-properly-in-saudi-arms-sale/story-2Cm9RYzn3QmWrK2rgGrxyH.html
11-08-2020||World||Canadian finance minister’s job appears unsure, markets fret over distraction||Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s job appeared uncertain on Tuesday after reports he had clashed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, prompting analysts to fret about Ottawa becoming distracted as it tackles the coronavirus crisis.The Globe and Mail cited unnamed sources as saying Trudeau was uncertain whether Morneau was the right person to handle the recovery. Morneau was unhappy at how much money Trudeau wanted to spend to deal with the outbreak, it added.Morneau, 57, has been finance minister since the ruling Liberals took power in late 2015.“To have turnover in such a key role in the middle of an economic crisis ... could rattle investor confidence in Canada and in turn weigh on the Canadian dollar,” said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive.The report was the first public sign of tension inside government over how to handle the pandemic. Canada has provided more than C$212 billion ($159.7 billion) in direct Covid-19 support and nearly 14% of gross domestic product in total support.Also read: Canada’s GDP fell by nearly 12% in April due to Covid-19 lockdownCanada’s budget deficit this fiscal year is expected to hit C$343.2 billion, the largest shortfall since World War Two.Trudeau’s office, asked whether he still had faith in Morneau, said it would respond later. Morneau’s office did not reply to a request for comment.Morneau is also under pressure over his failure to promptly repay travel expenses covered for him by a charity at the heart of an ethics investigation. Although Morneau apologized, opposition legislators say he must resign.“The bus has been rolling toward Mr. Morneau for weeks. Market participants understand that he has become a major political liability,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments.But he added: “Rocking the canoe might increase downside risk for the loonie (the Canadian dollar) and for markets more generally. And a distracted government is the last thing the economy needs,” he said.Potential replacements include Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Mark Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, the paper said.Trudeau is also being probed over possible ethics violation after the charity - which has ties to his family - was chosen to manage a major student grant program. He apologized but denied the charity has received any preferential treatment over the deal, which has been scrapped.($1=1.3279 Canadian dollars)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-finance-minister-s-job-appears-unsure-markets-fret-over-distraction/story-sjYIGOkjQaYnK0d20c0uKI.html

The company has received funding from the US government to develop its coronavirus vaccine, and in July lost a bid to invalidate a US patent owned by Arbutus Biopharma Corp that poses a potential obstacle to Moderna’s efforts to develop next-generation vaccines.“We cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, including mRNA-1273,” the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-uncertain-about-coronavirus-vaccine-patent-exclusivity/story-GQaL199CoZzJAyvowU7BcN.html
11-08-2020||World||Lebanon marks one week since deadly Beirut explosion||A nation still burying its dead on Tuesday marked a week since the explosion in Beirut that flattened much of the Lebanese capital’s port, damaged buildings and left thousands of people dead and injured.Several events, including a moment of silence at 6:08 p.m. local time when the blast happened, were planned to commemorate the explosion. It was caused by the ignition of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been sitting at Beirut port for more than six years. A candlelight vigil was also planned.The explosion has fuelled popular outrage against the country’s top political leaders and security agencies, and led to the resignation of the government on Monday. In the wake of the disaster, documents have come to light that show that top Lebanese officials knew about the existence of the stockpile in the heart of Beirut near residential areas, and did nothing about it.It still wasn’t clear what caused the fire in a port warehouse that triggered the explosion of the chemicals, which created a shockwave so powerful it was felt as far away as the island of Cyprus more than 200 kilometers across the Mediterranean. “From one minute to the next, the world changed for people in Beirut,” said Basma Tabaja, deputy head of the International Committee of the Red Cross’s delegation in Lebanon on Tuesday. The explosion, which obliterated the capital’s port, damaged thousands of apartments and offices in the capital and came on top of an unprecedented economic and financial crisis the country the country has been mired in since late last year, compounding the nation’s collective distress. Meanwhile, behind the scenes contacts got underway Tuesday for the formation of a new government, a day after Prime Minister Hassan Diab resigned. Diab’s government, which was supported by the militant group Hezbollah and its allies, unraveled after the deadly blast, with three ministers announcing they were quitting. Diab’s government was formed after his predecessor, Saad Hariri, stepped down in October in response to anti-government demonstrations over endemic corruption. It took months of bickering among the leadership factions before they settled on Diab.Lebanese have demanded an independent Cabinet not backed by any of the political political parties they blame for the mess they are in. Many are also calling for an independent investigation into the port explosion, saying they had zero trust in a local probe. Lebanese officials have rejected an international investigation. The government, in the last decision it made before resigning Monday, referred the case to the Supreme Judicial Council, Lebanon’s top judicial body, which handles crimes infringing on Lebanon’s national security as well as political and state security crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-marks-one-week-since-deadly-beirut-explosion/story-O8T4BQ2sdV3mvZeeMu9IBP.html

The point is to have a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people and the people of the world.” He says it’s important to have transparent data on the vaccine to prove its safety and efficacy. He also noted that the US has six vaccines in development under the Operation Warp Speed initiative.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe US has the highest death and case count in the world, with more than 163,000 deaths and over 5 million cases.Meanwhile, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway expressed skepticism about the testing backing up Russia’s claim that it has developed a Covid-19 vaccine.“The US standards are so much more stringent,” Conway said Tuesday on Fox “Fox & Friends.” “Our FDA in our country sets the standards and what I understand from the Russia announcement is this is nowhere near where we are.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-skeptical-of-russia-s-coronavirus-vaccine-safety/story-uEMszyYUSAEDlIZ9aTYgkJ.html
11-08-2020||World||Oxford launches literary book club to help deal with Covid-19||As lockdowns and restrictions in various countries encourage many to dust-off old books and revel in the delights of literature, the University of Oxford on Tuesday launched a book club that will weekly release a selected book extract that could be read in 10 minutes. Called the ‘Ten-Minute Book Club’, the initiative by academics from the English faculty will see extracts from prominent books released every week until October, starting this week. The first selection is from W.E.B.Du Bois’ 1903 book, ‘The Souls of Black Folk’.The extracts, they said, will include books by Indian writers, among others, and from a wide selection of genres, such as novels, essays, poetry and short stories. Each will be accompanied by a short introduction (in text, video or audio format) by an academic suggesting themes or contexts and suggestions for further reading - with a free link to the full text.Academic Alexandra Paddock said: “We noticed during lockdown that so many people turned to literature for escape, connection and excitement but, at the same time, the pressures of lockdown were making long, intense stretches of reading harder”“That is why we set up Ten-Minute Book Club - although we strongly believe its content will be relevant and useful long after the current restrictions have been removed”.The list of authors includes nineteenth century Bengali poet and translator Toru Dutt, Mary Prince, Geoffrey Chaucer and Patience Agbabi, Olaudah Equiano, Katherine Mansfield, Elizabeth Keckley, James Joyce, Mary Shelley and Charlotte Brontë. The readings are intended to be enjoyed alone or to spark discussion with family, friends, colleagues or anyone else. The selection is a mixture of classic well-known literature and outstanding works which deserve more prominence, mostly from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Paddock said: “All the works are originally written in English, by authors from all over the world, including New Zealand, Ireland, the Caribbean, India, United States and Britain”.Karen O’Brien, project founder, added: “We believe literature is more important than ever, as we live through the current pandemic and come to terms with its challenges and meaning for all of our lives”.“Ten-Minute Book Club aims to make a great conversation about literature possible, and to offer a quick and accessible way into some of the greatest writing by extraordinary writers from all backgrounds, guided by Oxford’s expertise on exciting authors and books.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-launches-literary-book-club-to-help-deal-with-covid-19/story-u4BOsfm8kD7NV259otAgdK.html
11-08-2020||World||German authorities conduct raids in money laundering probe||German authorities raided an import-export company and the home of a businessman in the state of Brandenburg on Tuesday on suspicion he was involved in a scheme to launder millions of euros (dollars) for Russian criminals, prosecutors said.The suspect is accused of receiving some 7 million euros ($8.3 million) in illegally obtained money, laundering it in Germany and then transferring it to offshore accounts for “individuals from Russia,” the Frankfurt prosecutors office said.The suspect, whose name wasn’t released, is alleged to have been part of the so-called “Troika Laundromat” - a money laundering network linked to the former Russian investment bank Troika Dialog, which is said to have maintained a network of offshore companies with accounts in Baltic banks, prosecutors said in a press release.Federal German police have been investigating the network since the beginning of 2019, prosecutors said.Authorities gave no further details on the investigation or the suspect, and prosecutors’ spokeswoman Nadja Niesen said she could not comment beyond the release.German authorities have been cracking down on Russian money laundering schemes, and last year seized properties worth more than 40 million euros ($47 million) they alleged were purchased through another network, known as the Russian Laundromat.That scheme, they said at the time, involved moving some $22 billion from Russia into Europe through banks in Moldova and Latvia using fictitious companies.Much of what is publicly known of the laundromat operations comes from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, whose journalists were also involved in the Panama Papers revelations, reporting how documents from a Panamanian law firm showed hundreds of rich and powerful people registered companies in tax havens.The OCCRP, citing documents obtained by it and the Lithuanian news site 15min.lt, has reported that the main purpose of the Troika Laundromat was to channel billions of dollars out of Russia, allowing Russian oligarchs and politicians to secretly acquire shares in state-owned companies, buy property in Russia and abroad and more.The Troika was made up of at least 75 companies in a complex financial web, which functioned from 2006 to early 2013, the OCCRP reported last year.The Kremlin has dismissed the OCCRP reports as being untrue or distorted, and “nothing particularly novel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-authorities-conduct-raids-in-money-laundering-probe/story-wnp4wRkJaUAZh4ygtyzanI.html

Russia and China are active and seeking greater roles throughout the continent in the energy, infrastructure and telecommunications sectors, a trend the United States is keen to reverse.Pompeo on Tuesday was opening his visit in the Czech city of Pilsen, where he was to visit the Patton Museum and memorial to the World War II liberation of western Czechoslovakia by U.S. troops.In his talks, Pompeo will likely face questions about the Trump administration’s decision to reduce the U.S. military presence in Germany. President Donald Trump wants to withdraw thousands of American troops from bases in Germany and redeploy some of them eastward, including to neighboring Poland, the last stop on Pompeo’s week-long trip.Two of Pompeo’s other three destinations — the Czech Republic and Austria — also share a border with Germany, while Slovakia borders Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is pointedly not on Pompeo’s itinerary.In Prague on Wednesday, Pompeo will meet Czech President Milos Zeman and Prime Minister Andrej Babis to discuss nuclear energy cooperation and “efforts to counter malign actions of Russia and communist China,” the State Department said.Energy and the tenuous political situation in the Balkans will top Pompeo’s agenda with Slovenian officials in Ljubljana, where he is expected to deliver a statement with the foreign minister about the security of 5G networks, the department said.In Vienna, Pompeo will meet Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to review trade relations and regional security. Pompeo will also hold talks with the head of the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with monitoring Iran’s adherence to the 2015 nuclear deal from which the U.S. has withdrawn.The Trump administration is trying to convince other members of the U.N. Security Council to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran that is due to expire in October, under terms of the nuclear deal.In Warsaw, Poland, Pompeo plans talks with President Andrzej Duda, who recently won a narrow reelection after a bitter campaign that concerned human rights advocates and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-opens-anti-china-anti-russia-tour-in-czech-republic/story-ArhtAztBNHDENIjMutc8cP.html

TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, is already under investigation over privacy concerns by U.S., European Union and Dutch authorities. “A complaint about TikTok was received in May. This complaint is now under investigation,” a CNIL spokesman said, confirming a Bloomberg report. He declined to elaborate on the nature of the complaint or the identity of the plaintiff.Asked for comment, TikTok said: “Protecting TikTok users’ privacy and safety is our top priority. We are aware of the investigation by the CNIL and are fully cooperating with them.”In the United States, officials have said that TikTok poses a national security risk because of the personal data it handles. President Donald Trump has threatened to ban TikTok and has given ByteDance 45 days to negotiate a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft.In June, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) said it would set up a task force to assess TikTok’s activities across the bloc after a request from an EU lawmaker concerned about its data collection and security and privacy risks.In May, the Dutch privacy watchdog said it would investigate how TikTok handles the data of millions of young users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-privacy-watchdog-opens-preliminary-investigation-into-tiktok/story-uAe06CaGXEiJHtlXAIMvLK.html

The Americans have refused to extradite her to stand trial for dangerous driving in the death of 19-year-old motorcycle rider Harry Dunn.Sacoolas’ husband was an intelligence officer at RAF Croughton, a military base in central England used by U.S. forces. The crash occurred near the base.Dunn’s family has urged her to return and face British justice, and met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington as part of their campaign.Britain’s Press Association reported that lawmaker Andrea Leadsom wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Monday to put forward the idea of a virtual trial or a trial in absentia as a “way to achieve closure... without undermining the U.S. decision not to accept the extradition request.”“She could remain on U.S. soil, have a virtual trial with a U.K. court, and should there be a custodial sentence, she could serve it in the U.S. under the existing prisoner transfer agreement,” Leadsom wrote.Leadsom also wrote to the solicitor general, the foreign secretary and the Crown Prosecution Service.The family’s spokesman Radd Seiger said the family “would not object” if a decision were taken to conduct a remote trial.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the extradition request in January. He described it at the time as “final.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmaker-asks-for-virtual-trial-in-diplomat-s-wife-crash/story-oDXJxvZLqtrh1idEvO2kKO.html
11-08-2020||World||Covid-19: For many Britons, Monday-to-Wednesday is the new weekend||It is a weekend atmosphere in thousands of pubs and restaurants across the UK from Monday to Wednesday, thanks to chancellor Rishi Sunak’s novel scheme that pays 50 per cent of restaurant bills up to a maximum of £10 per person, on food and non-alcoholic drinks.The scheme, intended to encourage people to eat out and help the struggling restaurant industry hit by the coronavirus pandemic, began on August 3 and runs until the end of the month. The Boris Johnson government has set aside £500 million for the scheme.In its first week, it has been used 10.5 million times, worth £50 million to the exchequer. Over 83,000 outlets have signed up offer the scheme, including pubs, restaurants, cafes, dining rooms within members’ clubs, and workplace and school canteens.Participating restaurants include many Indian restaurants. While many outlets have reported ‘berserk business’ during the three days, particularly chains such as Wetherspoons and Wagamama, Indian restaurants in areas such as Southall saw a marginal spike.Among those struggling are upmarket Indian restaurants in central London, where rents and other fixed costs are high. Indian Accent, which has branches in New Delhi and New York, and opened in Mayfair in 2017, closed due to the pandemic’s adverse effects.Says celebrity chef Cyrus Todiwala, who has restaurants in central London: “For us, due to our location the scheme has not been great. Our problem is the hesitation of people to avoid public transport, besides the congestion charge to drive into central London”.“Many London restaurants have complained to the mayor but it is of no use. So if you were to spend £30 to come to us for dinner, why would you? But many love us and take the extra trouble and costs to dine with us”, he adds.For Manoj Vasaikar of India Zing, Sunak’s scheme has driven business from Monday to Wednesday, but his restaurants have seen a sharp downturn during the weekend.He says: “We have seen a spike in business from Monday to Wednesday, but we suffer badly on Friday, Saturday. It is the same experience overall in most of the industry, but then the customer benefits, so it is fine”.Sunak described the scheme’s first-week figures as “amazing”, after official figures showed that 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and that 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportion in any sector.“Britons are eating out to help out in big numbers. And they aren’t just getting a great deal - they’re supporting the almost 2 million people employed in this sector,” Sunak said.Before Sunak rolled out the scheme, Jim Harra, chief executive of revenue and customs, questioned its value for money, writing to him: “By nature, this is a novel scheme meaning there are also particular value for money risks surrounding the level of potential losses that could arise”.The Guardian called the scheme ‘junk policy’ in an editorial: “As policy…it is glib, gimmicky and, even Mr Sunak admits, a waste of millions of pounds. Junk, then, served up by a politician who should know much better”.“(His) error is in treating the slump in trade as driven by cost, rather than caution. Discounts and VAT cuts…will not lure out those diners who are worried that they may pick up a lethal virus, or that they may be about to lose their job”.“Others will take up the government’s offer by enjoying a slap-up meal at a discount on a Wednesday night rather than at full price on a Friday, thus defeating the entire purpose of the policy”, the editorial added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-for-many-in-uk-monday-to-wednesday-is-the-new-weekend/story-OeIuDUKvk9LUGl9UzNWBJO.html
11-08-2020||World||Russia names new Covid-19 vaccine ‘Sputnik V’ in reference to Cold War space race||Russia has named its first approved Covid-19 vaccine ‘Sputnik V’ for foreign markets, a reference to the world’s first satellite and what Moscow sees as its success at becoming the first country to approve a vaccine, a top official said on Tuesday. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the country’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, said Russia had already received requests from more than 20 countries for 1 billion doses of its newly-registered Covid-19 vaccine.He was speaking after President Vladimir Putin announced the approval after less than two months of human testing.The speed at which Russia is moving to roll out the vaccine has prompted some international scientists to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before solid science and safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-dubs-new-coronavirus-vaccine-sputnik-after-soviet-satellite/story-KSKhuYQzunfxOfOXZKOd4H.html
11-08-2020||World||Hong Kong residents defend free press as China cracks down||Last year, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Hong Kong to demand full democracy, many egged on by a tabloid newspaper critical of China’s ruling Communist Party.On Tuesday, they lined up at newsstands across the city to buy that same paper, handing over 10 Hong Kong dollars ($1.25) a copy in a bid to help the Apple Daily — and press freedom — survive.The public show of support came a day after police rounded up 10 people, including the paper’s founder, and raided its headquarters. The move reinforced fears that a new national security law would be used to suppress dissent in Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests shook the city’s leadership and the central government in Beijing last year.Police have expanded their use of the law since it took effect six weeks ago, first arresting protesters with slogans deemed to be in violation and then activists over online posts. Media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the Apple Daily founder, and his Next Digital media group were the largest targets to date.That people protested by buying a newspaper rather than by taking to the streets shows how much the climate has changed since the stormy protests last year. People also bought Next Digital stock to show support, driving its price up more than 300% on Tuesday,The Apple Daily, known for its celebrity coverage as well as its condemnation of China’s authoritarian rule, remained defiant, printing 350,000 copies — five times its usual print run — after police investigators left Next Digital and told employees they could go back to work.Lines formed at newsstands Tuesday in a public show of support, and Apple Daily said it would print an additional 200,000 copies. “Apple Daily will fight on,” the newspaper said on its front page.“I do not like the way Apple Daily reports news but I think it symbolizes press freedom in Hong Kong,” Tiffany Chan said after buying a copy at a convenience store. “I cannot just sit and watch the government destroy press freedom. This is the least I can do.”One newsstand operator said he had sold 200 of his allotment of about 300 papers by late morning. On a typical day, he sells about 100 copies, he said.Hong Kong, and to a lesser degree Taiwan, have become battlegrounds for the competing world views of China and the United States. The U.S. imposed sanctions on 11 Hong Kong and Chinese officials last week, including city leader Carrie Lam, over the security law. China responded Monday by sanctioning 11 Americans, including six members of Congress.The Trump administration, which is feuding with China on multiple fronts, sent Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to Taiwan this week for the highest-level visit by a U.S. official since the United States broke off diplomatic relations to recognize Beijing as the government of China in 1979.Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, meeting Azar on Tuesday, said the self-governing island is fortunate to have U.S. support at a time when “our life has become increasingly difficult as China continues to pressure Taiwan into accepting its political conditions, conditions that will turn Taiwan into the next Hong Kong.”The fate of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million residents ultimately lies in the hands of the Communist Party leadership in Beijing.“You can’t really worry about it, it is what it is,” said Anna Yuen, a retiree who said her family could leave if the situation really deteriorates. “But I can’t bear to leave Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong people are really admirable, especially the youth.”The fear in Hong Kong, which has its own laws and courts and greater freedoms than mainland China, is that the Communist Party wants to mold the territory over time into a city similar to those on the mainland.Press freedom is just one characteristic that separates Hong Kong from the rest of China.“If they crack down on Apple Daily today, they will go down the list of media that do not support the Communist Party or the Hong Kong government, and what will be left is just news that sings the praises of the Communist Party,” Chan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-residents-defend-free-press-as-china-cracks-down/story-GciU1HDAtf7Xe2pIdjo5YN.html
11-08-2020||World||Indonesia kicks off third phase of Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccine testing||Indonesia began the third phase of a Covid-19 vaccine trial made by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. with a target to begin commercial production in six months.As many as 1,620 volunteers are participating in the trial that began on Tuesday and supervised by the faculty of medicine at Padjadjaran University in Bandung in West Java. Once the vaccine clears the trials successfully, state-owned PT Bio Farma may begin production from January, President Joko Widodo said.Indonesia is betting on the success of the phase 3-trial, the final stage in the vaccine development, to fully stamp out the pandemic that’s shown little signs of easing. The country has signed up with Sinovac to secure access to a vaccine as its own efforts to develop a deterrent against the pathogen is expected to take longer.Indonesia is cooperating with multiple partners as the world’s fourth-most populous nation wants to vaccinate all its people, Jokowi, as the president is commonly known, said. A home-grown vaccine, named “red and white vaccine” after the Indonesian flag and based on the strain of coronavirus prevalent in the archipelago, is expected to be ready by middle of 2021, he said.PT Kalbe Farma, Indonesia’s largest pharmaceutical company by market value, has entered into an agreement with South Korea’s Genexine Inc. to organize clinical trials for its GX-19 vaccine. Separately, Bio Farma along with the Ministry of Research and Technology and the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology has formed a consortium for vaccine development targeted for commercial production in early 2022.Bio Farma will ramp up its manufacturing capacity to 250 million doses by the end of the year from about 100 million now, the company said last week.The Southeast Asia’s biggest economy is still grappling with a surge in infections following the easing of partial lockdown rules since the end of May that allowed business activities to resume gradually. The number of new cases rose by 1,693 in the past 24 hours through Tuesday noon, taking the total to 128,776, official data showed. Fifty-nine more people succumbed to the disease, bringing the total to 5,824, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-kicks-off-third-phase-of-sinovac-s-covid-19-vaccine-testing/story-Y5a5qoNXsyYkduSxSrYC5J.html

This will remain in place for three days, and the rest of the country will go to level 2 restrictions that include social distancing and limits on the size of gatherings.The news comes after New Zealand recorded 102 days of no community transmission of Covid-19, managing to detect cases at the border with returned travelers going into mandatory quarantine. Health officials had warned it was only a matter of time before the virus returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-puts-auckland-into-lockdown-as-fresh-covid-19-cases-emerge/story-GQsA54hVoWRkpMGI9s7IsI.html

11-08-2020||World||Hong Kong sees fewest coronavirus cases since start of latest outbreak||Hong Kong’s worst coronavirus outbreak is showing signs of coming under control as the city reported the lowest number of new local infections since its resurgence began over a month ago.The Asian financial hub reported 32 new local cases on Tuesday, a marked drop from the high double-digit tallies of the past week. New infections have sustained a decline since the peak of 145 local cases on July 30 and have stayed below a hundred daily since Aug. 3.The drop is a reprieve for Hong Kong after a sudden flareup strained its health-care infrastructure and testing capacity, and confined its residents largely to their homes -- the smallest apartments in the world. While the city’s total outbreak of around 4,000 is still modest compared to many countries, the resurgence arrived after months of near-zero community transmission and has affected older patients than before, causing the death toll to spike.Almost 90% of Covid-19 deaths in Hong Kong happened in the past month as the outbreak entered nursing and elderly care homes -- 48 deaths as of Monday, seven times the toll of the entire first half of the year.The fall in case numbers reflects that tightened social distancing rules, which now ban public gatherings of more of two people and mandate masks in all public places, are working to slow the virus’s spread. The current measures, which also forbid dining in at restaurants between 6 p.m. and 5 a.m., have been extended to Aug. 18.China, which has tightened its political grip over the city, has sent help to boost Hong Kong’s testing and hospitalization capacity.Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Friday that Hong Kong will offer a free, voluntary virus test to every resident as a way of identifying asymptomatic carriers who are spreading the virus silently. The ability to test the entire city of over 7 million, despite Hong Kong’s public institutions being able to process only 15,000 samples daily, reflects China’s powerful boost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-sees-fewest-coronavirus-cases-since-start-of-latest-outbreak/story-eElXyfeSwqmWWUTeCQZ6CP.html
11-08-2020||World||Mississauga city council allows broadcasting of Hanuman Chalisa, Gayatri Mantra||A city in Canada has made history by permitting local temples to broadcast sacred Hindu hymns during an auspicious period as regular worship remains impacted by restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Regular rules relating to noise bylaws disallow places of worship from using loudspeakers. However, the city of Mississauga’s council voted unanimously to relax those norms and let temples broadcast hymns like the Hanuman Chalisa or Gayatri Mantra. Mississauga lies in the Great Toronto Area and is in the province of Ontario.The city council had earlier not taken a decision on the matter and referred it to the Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee or DIAC, which thereafter voted in support of temporarily easing the noise bylaws. The matter returned to the city council abided by the DIAC’s decision, with all members voting in favour of the motion. Among its supporters was city Mayor Bonnie Crombie.This matter had been moved by the Hindu Forum Canada which sought permission for temples to broadcast from August 11 to September 1, for five minutes each evening at 7 pm. It had argued that this period was particularly significant for Hindus as it included Krishna Janmashthami, Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi.Among the original proponents of the measures was Indo-Canadian councillor Dipika Damerla, a former provincial Minister, who described it as a “small ask.” After the motion’s passage, she said she was “very happy” that this accommodation had been put in place for the religious group.Proponents have argued that the restrictions due to the coronavirus crisis have affected the faithful especially seniors.In fact, in April this year, many municipalities in Canada, including Mississauga, made an exception for the month of Ramzan, as restrictions similarly impacted Muslims in the country.With a precedent in place, an apex Indo-Canadian organisation has called upon cities to give similar permission to mandirs in the province of Ontario and beyond. The Canada India Foundation or CIF argued that to “be able to listen to the holy hymns and participate while being restricted to individual homes, is expected to act as a morale booster to the community.” Its chair Anil Shah underscored this argument, as he said, “We are in full agreement with the request to the various municipalities for accommodation regarding these religious events. This would be a great gesture that would strengthen our multicultural fabric even more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mississauga-city-council-allows-broadcasting-of-hanuman-chalisa-gayatri-mantra/story-G8UXOpkigKUn2rwpagK9mO.html
11-08-2020||World||Russian Covid vaccine is safe, says Prez Putin; his daughter gets 2 shots||Russia on Tuesday became the first country to officially register a coronavirus vaccine and declare it ready for use, despite international scepticism. President Vladimir Putin said that one of his daughters has already been inoculated.Putin emphasized that the vaccine underwent the necessary tests and has proven efficient, offering a lasting immunity from the coronavirus. However, scientists at home and abroad have been sounding the alarm that the rush to start using the vaccine before Phase 3 trials — which normally last for months and involve thousands of people — could backfire.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSpeaking at a government meeting Tuesday, Putin said that the vaccine has undergone proper testing and is safe.“I would like to repeat that it has passed all the necessary tests,” he said. “The most important thing is to ensure full safety of using the vaccine and its efficiency.”The Russian leader added that one of his two adult daughters has received two shots of the vaccine. “She has taken part in the experiment,” Putin said.Putin said that his daughter had a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit) on the day of the first vaccine injection, and then it dropped to just over 37 degrees (98.6 Fahrenheit) on the following day. After the second shot she again had a slight increase in temperature, but then it was all over.Also read: Russian Covid-19 vaccine is ‘Pandora’s Box,’ industry body warns“She’s feeling well and has high number of antibodies,” Putin added. He didn’t specify which of his two daughters — Maria or Katerina — received the vaccine.Russian authorities have said that medical workers, teachers and other risk groups will be the first to be inoculated. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said that the vaccination of doctors could start as early as this month.The Health Ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that the vaccine is expected to provide immunity from the coronavirus for up to two years.Putin emphasized that vaccination will be voluntary.Russian officials have said that large-scale production of the vaccine will start in September, and mass vaccination may begin as early as October.When the pandemic struck Russia, Putin ordered state officials to shorten the time of clinical trials for potential coronavirus vaccines.Becoming the first country in the world to develop a vaccine was a matter of national prestige for the Kremlin as it tries to assert the image of Russia as a global power. State television stations and other media have praised scientists working on it and presented the work the envy of other nations.Professor Alexander Gintsburg, head of the Gamaleya institute that developed the vaccine, raised eyebrows in May when he said that he and other researchers tried the vaccine on themselves.Human studies started June 17 among 76 volunteers. Half were injected with a vaccine in liquid form and the other half with a vaccine that came as soluble powder. Some in the first half were recruited from the military, which raised concerns that servicemen may have been pressured to participate.Amid Russia’s rush to become the first to create a vaccine, the U.S., Britain and Canada last month accused Russia of using hackers to steal vaccine research from Western labs.As the trials were declared completed, questions arose about the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. Some experts scoffed at Russian authorities’ assurances that the vaccine drug produced the desired immune response and caused no significant side effects, pointing out that such claims need to be backed by published scientific data.The World Health Organization said all vaccine candidates should go through full stages of testing before being rolled out. Experts have warned that vaccines that are not properly tested can cause harm in many ways — from a negative impact on health to creating a false sense of security or undermining trust in vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-has-developed-first-covid-19-vaccine-says-president-putin/story-O0jsaC8znG8BbxT5sTGuJL.html

Some vendors have reopened their stalls elsewhere.Wuhan has also had time to look back on its trauma, though only some memories make it into the official narrative.At a pandemic-themed exhibition, families peer through glass at autographed hazmat suits used by medical workers at the height of Wuhan’s outbreak, in an attempt to document an unprecedented period in the city’s history.China has largely brought its domestic epidemic under control, but sporadic outbreaks and a summer of severe flooding have exacerbated the economic fallout.Despite fears of a resurgence, some Wuhan residents are keen to enjoy the city’s recovery.“Now I enjoy every day as if it were the last,” says Hu Fenglian.“I don’t want to worry too much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shadow-of-covid-19-slowly-lifts-from-epicentre-wuhan/story-B6gSwgni2GxPycptVliy8O.html
11-08-2020||World||Pakistan-Saudi Arabia tiff widens? As Islamabad returns loan, questions rise||There appears to be a shift in policy of Saudi Arabia towards Pakistan. The differences in their relations surfaced when Pakistan was made to pay back US $1 billion to Saudi Arabia last week.Pakistan has also not received the oil on deferred payments from Saudi Arabia since May as a deal signed between the two close allies for provision of US $3.2 billion worth of the fuel under the arrangement expired two months ago.Here are the developments in the past few months which are being keenly watched:• Pakistan has been insisting that Saudi Arabia should allow it to marshal the support of the Islamic world on the Kashmir issue. In February, it had asked for a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on the issue, but Saudi Arabia turned down the request. The OIC is a group of 57 Muslim countries in which Saudi Arabia holds considerable sway.• Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has been openly demanding that Saudi Arabia should convene an OIC council meeting on Kashmir after India’s move to scrap Article 370 which gave special status to the erstwhile state.• Qureshi even criticised Saudi Arabia for not heeding to its request. In a television interview, he said that if Saudi Arabia cannot support Pakistan, it will call a meeting of those Islamic countries “who stand with us on the Kashmir issue”. But the remarks drew criticism at home, with some experts saying Qureshi should have been careful.• “It should not have been expected that as Saudi Arabia is a friend of Pakistan so it will automatically be against India’s stance on Kashmir. This is not a college but an international arena,” a Pakistani journalist Amir Mateen was quoted as saying by news outlets in the country.• Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Muhammad bin Salman had signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) worth US $20 billion during his visit to Pakistan in February 2019. Experts feel Pakistan’s continued insistence could jeopardise this entire investment; they say that the present dispensation in Islamabad should handle the issue carefully because “prince Salman is young and has impulsive behaviour”.• After Pakistan failed to gather support from the OIC members on Kashmir on May 22, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said, “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We cannot even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”• Other experts say that even China is wary and treading a cautious line not to become involved in the Middle Eastern politics.• Pakistan has already returned US $1 billion Saudi loan - four months ahead of its repayment period - a news report said. Citing sources, it said Pakistan could also return the remaining US $2 billion cash loan, subject to availability of a similar facility from China.• The agreement over US $3 billion cash support and US $3.2 billion oil facility per annum had the provision of renewal for two more years.• The UAE had also announced a US $6.2 billion package for Pakistan in December 2018, including a US $3.2 billion oil facility. But later on, the UAE reduced its financial assistance to US $2 billion and also shelved the plan to give a US $3.2 billion oil facility on deferred payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-saudi-arabia-tiff-widens-as-islamabad-returns-loan-questions-rise/story-SmlrxvYUdMsLAqtmsLxCLK.html
11-08-2020||World||Pakistan FM Qureshi criticised at home for slamming Saudi Arabia over Kashmir||Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s remarks against Saudi Arabia after Riyadh refused to interfere on Kashmir issue, have invited criticism at home.The differences in their relations surfaced when Pakistan was made to pay back USD 1 billion to Saudi Arabia. This reflected the fact that Islamabad is gradually losing the support of other Muslim countries.Recently two Pakistani journalists -- Rauf Klasra and Amir Mateen -- held a discussion on the sudden policy shift of Saudi Arabia towards Pakistan.While criticising Qureshi for making such statements, Mateen said, “Sometimes Qureshi speaks emotionally. He gets carried away.”As Pakistan, which is in a financial crisis, is dependent on Saudi Arabia, Qureshi should have been cautious of making any statements, he said.“As we are very much dependent on Saudi Arabia, we should complain only to a limit. Amid such a situation, Qureshi should have been careful because Mohammed bin Salman is young and has impulsive behaviour.”Mateen further said, “It should not have been expected that as Saudi Arabia is a friend of Pakistan so it will automatically be against India’s stance on Kashmir. This is not a college but an international arena.”The development comes even as Pakistan has been pushing for the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) since India abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.In a report published by Dawn, a Pakistan diplomatic source confirmed that Saudi Arabia had shown reluctance to accept Islamabad’s request for an immediate meeting of OIC foreign ministers’ on Kashmir.After Pakistan failed to gather support from the OIC members on Kashmir on May 22, Prime Minister Imran Khan said, “The reason is that we have no voice and there is a total division amongst (us). We cannot even come together as a whole on the OIC meeting on Kashmir.”Though Pakistan reportedly made attempts to push its narrative of raising the issue of rising Islamophobia in India in its agenda, Maldives, an ally of India, thwarted the move and said, “Isolated statements by motivated people and disinformation campaigns on social media should not be construed as representative of the feelings of 1.3 billion.”Maldives Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Thilmeeza Hussain, said that alleging Islamophobia in the context of India would be factually incorrect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fm-qureshi-criticised-at-home-for-slamming-saudi-arabia-over-kashmir/story-YX6ahZUOMQwGFUHqrdtDbM.html
11-08-2020||World||New York’s true nursing home Covid-19 death toll cloaked in secrecy||Riverdale Nursing Home in the Bronx appears, on paper, to have escaped the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, with an official state count of just four deaths in its 146-bed facility.The truth, according to the home, is far worse: 21 dead, most transported to hospitals before they succumbed.“It was a cascading effect,” administrator Emil Fuzayov recalled. “One after the other.”New York’s coronavirus death toll in nursing homes, already among the highest in the nation, could actually be a significant undercount. Unlike every other state with major outbreaks, New York only counts residents who died on nursing home property and not those who were transported to hospitals and died there.That statistic that could add thousands to the state’s official care home death toll of just over 6,600. But so far the administration of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has refused to divulge the number, leading to speculation the state is manipulating the figures to make it appear it is doing a better than other states and to make a tragic situation less dire.“That’s a problem, bro,” state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat, told New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker during a legislative hearing on nursing homes earlier this month. “It seems, sir, that in this case you are choosing to define it differently so that you can look better.”How big a difference could it make? Since May, federal regulators have required nursing homes to submit data on coronavirus deaths each week, whether or not residents died in the facility or at a hospital. Because the requirement came after the height of New York’s outbreak, the available data is relatively small. According to the federal data, roughly a fifth of the state’s homes reported resident deaths from early June to mid July — a tally of 323 dead, 65 percent higher than the state’s count of 195 during that time period. Even if half that undercount had held true from the start of the pandemic, that would translate into thousands more nursing home resident deaths than the state has acknowledged.Another group of numbers also suggests an undercount. State health department surveys show 21,000 nursing home beds are lying empty this year, 13,000 more than expected — an increase of almost double the official state nursing home death tally. While some of that increase can be attributed to fewer new admissions and people pulling their loved ones out, it suggests that many others who aren’t there anymore died.However flawed New York’s count, Cuomo has not been shy about comparing it to tallies in other states.Nearly every time Cuomo is questioned about New York’s nursing home death toll, he brushes off criticism as politically motivated and notes that his state’s percentage of nursing home deaths out of its overall Covid-19 death toll is around 20%, far less than Pennsylvania’s 68%, Massachusetts’ 64% and New Jersey’s 44%.“Look at the basic facts where New York is versus other states,” Cuomo said during a briefing Monday. “You look at where New York is as a percentage of nursing home deaths, it’s all the way at the bottom of the list.”In another briefing last month, he touted New York’s percentage ranking as 35th in the nation. “Go talk to 34 other states first. Go talk to the Republican states now — Florida, Texas, Arizona — ask them what is happening in nursing homes. It’s all politics.”Boston University geriatrics expert Thomas Perls said it doesn’t make sense that nursing home resident deaths as a percentage of total deaths in many nearby states are more than triple what was reported in New York.“Whatever the cause, there is no way New York could be truly at 20%,” Perls said.A running tally by The Associated Press shows that more than 68,200 residents and staff at nursing homes and long-term facilities across the nation have died from the coronarivus, out of more than 163,000 overall deaths.For all 43 states that break out nursing home data, resident deaths make up 44% of total Covid deaths in their states, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Assuming the same proportion held in New York, that would translate to more than 11,000 nursing home deaths.To be sure, comparing coronavirus deaths in nursing homes across states can be difficult because of the differences in how states conduct their counts. New York is among several states that include probable Covid-19 deaths as well as those confirmed by a test. Some states don’t count deaths from homes where fewer than five have died. Others don’t always give precise numbers, providing ranges instead. And all ultimately rely on the nursing homes themselves to provide the raw data.“Everybody is doing it however they feel like doing it. We don’t have very good data. It’s just all over the place, all over the country,” said Toby Edelman of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit representing nursing home residents.New York health chief Zucker explained during the legislative hearing that New York only counts deaths on the nursing home property to avoid “double-counting” deaths in both the home and the hospital. And while he acknowledged the state keeps a running count of nursing home resident deaths at hospitals, he declined to provide even a rough estimate to lawmakers.“I will not provide information that I have not ensured is absolutely accurate,” Zucker said. “This is too big an issue and it’s too serious an issue.”Zucker promised to provide lawmakers the numbers as soon as that doublechecking is complete. They are still waiting. The AP has also been denied access to similar nursing home death data despite filing a public records request with the state health department nearly three months ago.Dr. Michael Wasserman, president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine, said it is unethical of New York to not break out the deaths of nursing home residents at hospitals. “From an epidemiological and scientific perspective, there is absolutely no reason not to count them.”Nursing homes have become a particular sore point for the Cuomo administration, which has generally received praise for steps that flattened the curve of infections and New York’s highest-in-the-nation 32,781 overall deaths.But a controversial March 25 order to send recovering Covid-19 patients from hospitals into nursing homes that was designed to free up hospital bed space at the height of the pandemic has drawn withering criticism from relatives and patient advocates who contend it accelerated nursing home outbreaks.Cuomo reversed the order under pressure in early May. And his health department later released an internal report that concluded asymptomatic nursing home staffers were the real spreaders of the virus, not the 6,300 recovering patients released from hospitals into nursing homes.But epidemiologists and academics derided the study for a flawed methodology that sidestepped key questions and relied on selective stats, including the state’s official death toll figures.“We’re trying to find out what worked and what didn’t work and that means trying to find patterns,” said Bill Hammond, who works on health policy for the nonprofit Empire Center think tank. “You can’t do that if you have the wrong data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-s-true-nursing-home-covid-19-death-toll-cloaked-in-secrecy/story-FeLJT9iTCQdaA0zhY4qmGI.html

11-08-2020||World||Trump proposes to hold G-7 summit post US presidential elections||President Donald Trump on Monday said he was “more inclined” to host the upcoming summit of the G-7, which his administration had intended to use to rally the world’s richest economies to focus on the threat from China, after the US presidential elections in November. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to attend at the American leader’s invitation.“I’m much more inclined to do it sometime after the election; we were going to do it in September,” the president told reporters at a White House news briefing that he left briefly because of a shooting outside. He returned a few minutes later, saying things were “under control”.Continuing to talk about the G-7 Summit, Trump said, “We could do it through teleconference or we could do it through a meeting,” adding that it was only past Sunday that he had suggested to his aides to reschedule the summit to after the election in a “better …. calmer atmosphere”.The presidency of the G7 rotates annually, and Trump is this year’s chair.President Trump will continue in office if he wins, but even if he were to lose, he will still be around till the inauguration of his successor in January of 2021.Just a few minutes into the start of the briefing, Trump was escorted off the dais in the White House briefing room by the Secret Service, which confirmed a shooting involving one of its agents shortly after the president had returned to resume the briefing.“A male subject and a USSS (US Secret Service) officer were both transported to a local hospital,” the secret service said in an update, adding, “At no time during this incident was the White House complex breached or were any protectees in danger.”Trump first spoke of his plans to invite Modi and leaders of Australia, South Korea and Russia to the G-7 summit in May. He had also expressed his desire at the time to include these nations in an expanded group called “G-10 or G-11”. He had then planned to hold the summit in the week before the UN general assembly meetings around September 15.The US President extended an invitation to Modi to attend the summit in a phone call a week later. He also conveyed his “desire” to expand the group to India, which was mistaken among some policy circles in India as an invitation to the expanded group, which is call to be taken jointly by the other members.Modi had “commended President Trump for his creative and far-sighted approach, acknowledging the fact that such an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-COVID world” about the offer. And he had gone on to assure Trump of India’s willingness to “work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit.”Though not a member of the G-7, India has been at some of its summits at the invitation of host countries. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had attended the 2005 summit in Gleneagles, the UK (the group was called G-8 back then and included Russia, which was thrown out in 2014 for annexing Crimea), and Prime Minister Modi attended the 2019 summit in Biarritz, France.“I’m postponing it because I don’t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what’s going on in the world,” Trump had told reporters on Air Force One on the way back from the historic launch of the first manned mission into space by a private company, SpaceX in May. “It’s a very outdated group of countries.”Alyssa Alexandra Farah, head of the president’s team on strategic communications, had told reporters then that the summit was an attempt to bring together “our traditional allies to talk about how to deal with the future of China”.The Group of Seven, called G-7, is an intergovernmental organisation of some of the world’s largest economies, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. India is a member of the larger version of the body that is called the G-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-postpones-until-after-us-elections-g-7-meet-pm-modi-was-to-attend-at-his-invitation/story-AX6zfrzP3Lv1D10R4lBGjO.html
11-08-2020||World||Lebanon prez Aoun was warned in July about explosives at port: Report||Lebanese security officials warned the prime minister and president last month that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut’s port posed a security risk and could destroy the capital if it exploded, according to documents seen by Reuters and senior security sources.Just over two weeks later, the industrial chemicals exploded in a massive blast that obliterated most of the port, killed at least 163 people, injured 6,000 more and destroyed some 6,000 buildings, according to municipal authorities.A report by the General Directorate of State Security about events leading up to the explosion included a reference to a private letter sent to President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Hassan Diab on July 20.While the content of the letter was not in the report seen by Reuters, a senior security official said it summed up the findings of a judicial investigation launched in January which concluded the chemicals needed to be secured immediately.The state security report, which confirmed the correspondence to the president and the prime minister, has not previously been reported.“There was a danger that this material, if stolen, could be used in a terrorist attack,” the official told Reuters.“At the end of the investigation, Prosecutor General (Ghassan) Oweidat prepared a final report which was sent to the authorities,” he said, referring to the letter sent to the prime minister and president by the General Directorate of State Security, which oversees port security.“I warned them that this could destroy Beirut if it exploded,” said the official, who was involved in writing the letter and declined to be named.Reuters could not independently confirm his description of the letter.The prime minister’s office and the presidency did not respond to requests for comment about the July 20 letter. The prosecutor general did not respond to requests for comment.‘DO WHAT IS NECESSARY’The correspondence could fuel further criticism and public fury that the blast is just the latest, if not most dramatic, example of the government negligence and corruption that has already pushed Lebanon to economic collapse.As protests over the blast raged in Lebanon on Monday, Diab’s government resigned, though it will remain as a caretaker administration until a new cabinet is formed.The rebuilding of Beirut alone is expected to cost up to $15 billion, in a country already effectively bankrupt with total banking system losses exceeding $100 billion.Aoun confirmed last week that he had been informed about the material. He told reporters he had directed the secretary general of the supreme defence council, an umbrella group of Lebanon’s security and military agencies chaired by the president, to “do what is necessary”.“(The state security service) said it is dangerous. I am not responsible! I don’t know where it was put and I didn’t know how dangerous it was. I have no authority to deal with the port directly. There is a hierarchy and all those who knew should have known their duties to do the necessary,” Aoun said.Many questions remain over why the shipment of ammonium nitrate docked in Beirut in late 2013. Even more baffling is why such a huge stash of dangerous material, used in bombs and fertilisers, was allowed to remain there for so long.The letter sent to Lebanon’s president and prime minister followed a string of memos and letters sent to the country’s courts over the previous six years by port, custom and security officials, repeatedly urging judges to order the removal of the ammonium nitrate from its position so close to the city centre.The General Directorate of State Security’s report seen by Reuters said many requests had been submitted, without giving an exact number. It said the port’s manifest department sent several written requests to the customs directorate up until 2016 asking them to call on a judge to order the material be re-exported immediately.“But until now, no decision has been issued over this matter. After consulting one of our chemical specialists, the expert confirmed that this material is dangerous and is used to produce explosives,” the General Directorate of State Security report said.HAZARDOUS MATERIALThe road to last week’s tragedy began seven years ago, when the Rhosus, a Russian-chartered, Moldovan-flagged vessel carrying ammonium nitrate from Georgia to Mozambique, docked in Beirut to try to take on extra cargo to raise the fees for passage through the Suez Canal, according to the ship’s captain.Port authorities impounded the Rhosus on December 2013 by judicial order 2013/1031 due to outstanding debts owed to two companies that filed claims in Beirut courts, the state security report showed.In May 2014, the ship was deemed unseaworthy and its cargo was unloaded in October 2014 and warehoused in what was known as Hangar 12. The ship sank near the port’s breakwater on Feb. 18, 2018, the security report showed.Moldova lists the owner of the ship as Panama-based Briarwood Corp. Briarwood could not immediately be reached for comment.In February 2015, Nadim Zwain, a judge from the Summary Affairs Court, which deals with urgent issues, appointed an expert to inspect the cargo, according to the security report.The report said the expert concluded that the material was hazardous and, through the port authorities, requested it be transferred to the army. Reuters could not independently confirm the expert’s account.Lebanese army command rejected the request and recommended the chemicals be transferred or sold to the privately-owned Lebanese Explosives Company, the state security report said.The report did not say why the army had refused to accept the cargo. A security official told Reuters it was because they didn’t need it. The army declined to comment.The explosive company’s management told Reuters it had not been interested in purchasing confiscated material and that the firm had its own suppliers and government import licences.From then on, customs and security officials wrote to judges roughly every six months asking for the removal of the material, according to the requests seen by Reuters.Judges and customs officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment.A number of customs and port officials have since been detained as part of the investigation into the blast.‘BAD STORAGE AND BAD JUDGMENT’In January 2020, a judge launched an official investigation after it was discovered that Hangar 12 was unguarded, had a hole in its southern wall and one of its doors dislodged, meaning the hazardous material was at risk of being stolen.In his final report following the investigation, Prosecutor General Oweidat “gave orders immediately” to ensure hangar doors and holes were repaired and security provided, a second high-ranking security official who also requested anonymity said.On June 4, based on those orders, state security instructed port authorities to provide guards at Hangar 12, appoint a director for the warehouse and secure all the doors and repair the hole in the southern wall, according to the state security report and security officials.The port authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.“The maintenance started and (port authorities) sent a team of Syrian workers (but) there was no one supervising them when they entered to fix the holes,” the security official said. During the work, sparks from the welding took hold and fire started to spread, the official said.“Given that there were fireworks stored in the same hangar, after an hour a big fire was set off by the fireworks and that spread to the material that exploded when the temperature exceeded 210 degrees,” the high-ranking security official said.The official blamed the port authorities for not supervising the repair crew and for storing fireworks alongside a vast deposit of high explosives.Reuters could not determine what happened to the workers repairing the hangar.“Only because the hangar faces the sea, the impact of the explosion was reduced. Otherwise all of Beirut would have been destroyed,” he said. “The issue is all about negligence, irresponsibility, bad storage and bad judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanon-prez-aoun-was-warned-in-july-about-explosives-at-port-report/story-sBj4nuoGlBeXutJ95crXaM.html
11-08-2020||World||Media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s arrest sends warning to Hong Kong’s free press||Right before China retook control of Hong Kong in 1997, tycoon Jimmy Lai started Apple Daily in part to promote democracy in the city. For 25 years the newspaper survived advertising boycotts and political pressure but never backed off its tough coverage of the Chinese government and pro-Beijing lawmakers.It may not last through the summer. Hong Kong police arrested Lai and several of his top executives on Monday and sent hundreds of officers to search the Apple Daily offices, a demonstration of the broad potential for the new national security law to silence criticism and dissent beyond pro-democracy protests and activism.Passed in June, the legislation bars “crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces” as interpreted by the Chinese government and enforced by Beijing’s new security office in Hong Kong. Lai’s arrest wasn’t entirely unexpected, but it still shook the foundations of press freedom in the financial center and raised fears about what might come next.For the global business community, which relies on the rule of law and stability that Hong Kong offers, threats to the free press are troubling, said Imogen T. Liu, a political economist affiliated with Maastricht University in the Netherlands. “Hong Kong is attractive to international investors because it has a reputation for market discipline and transparency that was institutionalized under British rule,” she said. “Free speech is part of this liberal image, along with free market competition and government non-intervention.”Hong Kong stocks rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.3% as of 10:07 a.m. Casinos were among leading gainers on news China will start issuing tourist visas to Macau. Tencent Holdings Ltd. snapped a two day decline to gain 3.9%.Lai’s Next Digital Ltd. soared as much as 210%, a day after social media posts urged investors to buy shares of the company following his arrest and police raid of his flagship newspaper.Journalists have been concerned about China’s tightening grip on free speech in Hong Kong at least since 2018, when local authorities declined to renew the work visa of the Asia news editor for the Financial Times. It was thought to be the first expulsion of a foreign journalist since the 1997 handover and suggested a bolder Chinese influence on the city.Those concerns only grew this year. After the U.S. placed restrictions on Chinese media, the government in Beijing expelled Americans working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and said they weren’t welcome in Hong Kong. In July, the New York Times announced it was moving its digital news operation from Hong Kong to Seoul.The Foreign Correspondents Club, Hong Kong, which advocates for press freedom in Asia, condemned the arrests and newsroom raid on Monday, saying they “signal a dark new phase in the erosion of the city’s global reputation.” Last week the club had called for both the U.S. and the Chinese governments to stop using journalists as political canon fodder: “This downward spiral of retaliatory actions aimed at journalists helps no one, not least of all the public that needs accurate, professionally produced information now more than ever.”‘Highly unusual’That statement also said that journalists have reported delays in new or renewed visas, which it called “highly unusual for Hong Kong.” Meanwhile, local outlet the Standard reported that journalist visas were now being vetted by a “national security unit” within the Hong Kong Immigration department, a new process that more closely mirrors China’s close scrutiny of foreign media.Locally, Wilson Li Chung-chak, a freelancer for Britain’s ITV and former member of the now-disbanded student activist group Scholarism, was arrested for collusion with a foreign country or external elements, the first time a freelance journalist was charged under the new law, according to the South China Morning Post.The effects have been chilling. Selina Cheng, an investigative reporter at local news outlet HK01, said senior management has begun to restrict the kinds of stories their reporters can work on. “When editors are worried about getting into trouble they naturally won’t push reporters to do more reporting on topics they don’t feel comfortable with,” she said.Even Apple Daily had taken steps to protect its reporters and stopped printing bylines after the law passed.“Other media outlets looking at what happened to Apple Daily today know that if they speak out against the government -- like Apple Daily did -- they will face the same consequences,” said Martin Lam, a reporter who’s covered Hong Kong politics for the paper for 13 years. “They will be more cautious of what they report in the near future.”‘Exactly how the law is supposed to work’The new law has also taken aim at literature. Several books by pro-democracy activists were removed from Hong Kong libraries and are currently “under review” to see if they run afoul of the new law.“Pulling books out of the library, arresting pro-democracy activists -- this is exactly how the law is supposed to work,” said Jimmy Chan Hing-chi, a political economics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “In the long run, as freedom of expression is undermined further and further, Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial center may gradually erode.”Minh Bui Jones, editor-in-chief of the pan-Asian literary magazine, Mekong Review, said less than three weeks after the law passed, his printing company told him it had been ordered by authorities to stop printing the magazine. Jones’ attempts to follow up went unanswered, and he found a different printer.“I would still like to publish in Hong Kong,” said Jones, praising the printers, the location, and the legacy of other Hong Kong-based publications including the Far Eastern Economic Review. “But it’s getting harder and harder, and at some point you’ll just give up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-s-arrest-sends-warning-to-hong-kong-s-free-press/story-pqmqeuevU6fEYgzSlTW6PM.html

11-08-2020||World||As global Covid-19 tally surpasses 20 million, WHO urges people not to despair||The coronavirus pandemic chalked up another horrific milestone Monday as the world surpassed 20 million recorded cases of infection from the tiny killer that has upended life just about everywhere.The number as of 2215 GMT was 20,002,577 cases, with 733,842 deaths recorded, according to an AFP tally of official sources.In yet another staggering landmark, the death toll is expected to surpass 750,000 in a matter of days as the global health crisis that began late last year in China rages on.As more things once unthinkable became harsh reality -- having to wear a facemask in touristy spots in Paris, or reserve a spot on Copacabana beach in Rio via an app and then social distance on the sand -- the World Health Organization urged people not to despair.“Behind these statistics is a great deal of pain and suffering... But I want to be clear: there are green shoots of hope,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“It’s never too late to turn the outbreak around,” he said.He gave examples of countries that had successfully clamped down on Covid-19, such as Rwanda and New Zealand, which said Monday it plans to open a virus-free “travel bubble” with the Cook Islands.With much of the world caught in a cycle of dispiriting outbreaks and economically crushing lockdowns, all eyes are on the race for a vaccine.A WHO overview said 165 candidate vaccines are being worked on around the world, with six reaching Phase 3 of clinical evaluation.But the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan warned that a vaccine was “only part of the answer,” pointing to polio and measles as diseases with vaccines that have not been fully eradicated.“You’ve got to be able to deliver that vaccine to a population that want and demand to have that vaccine,” he said.Europe feels the heat Infections have been rising ominously in Western Europe, which has also been sweltering through a heatwave, with temperatures soaring above 35 degrees Celsius (95 F).The blistering heat sent crowds flocking to beaches at the weekend despite health warnings about the risk of infection.In the Paris region, people aged 11 and over are now required to wear masks in crowded areas and tourists hotspots. These include the banks of the Seine River and more than 100 streets in the French capital.Marion, a 24-year-old in central Paris, said the masks are “restrictive” but necessary “if we want to avoid a second wave.” “Anything except a second lockdown,” she added.Several French towns and cities have already introduced similar measures, as well as parts of Belgium, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain.In Berlin, thousands of children returned to school on Monday after the summer break, sporting masks, which are compulsory in common areas like school courtyards.Greece meanwhile announced a night curfew for restaurants and bars in some of its top tourist destinations after its number of new cases increased.In Italy, the coronavirus spikes of its neighbours caused alarm.“France, Spain and the Balkans... Italy is surrounded by contagions,” Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza lamented.It was a different story in Pakistan, which allowed all restaurants and parks to reopen on Monday, after the country saw a drop in new cases over several weeks.Grim US, Brazil milestones As of Monday evening, the United States -- the world’s worst-hit country -- had recorded 163,370 deaths and 5,085,821 cases of infection, according to the tracker at Johns Hopkins University.As the caseload shot past five million on Sunday, President Donald Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential election, Joe Biden, tweeted that the number “boggles the mind and breaks the heart.”The figure came as Trump was accused of flouting the constitution by unilaterally extending a virus relief package.The package -- announced by Trump on Saturday after talks between Republican and Democrat lawmakers hit a wall -- was “absurdly unconstitutional,” senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi told CNN.But with the world’s largest economy still struggling to dig itself out of an enormous hole, Democrats appeared skittish about any legal challenge to a relief package they see as seriously inadequate.After the US, Brazil has the most cases, and over the weekend it became the second country to pass 100,000 fatalities.President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the coronavirus threat, and after Brazil’s latest milestone, the country’s most widely viewed TV network Globo asked: “Has the president of the republic done his duty?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-global-covid-19-tally-surpasses-20-million-who-urges-people-not-to-despair/story-AprBWEjhfclzS7iqQLR3eI.html

11-08-2020||World||‘Pushing for it very hard but not for votes’: Trump hopeful Covid-19 vaccine will be out by end of 2020||(Bloomberg) -- Even if the most optimistic projections hold true and a Covid-19 vaccine is cleared for U.S. use in November, the vast majority of Americans won’t be able to get the shots until spring or summer next year at the earliest.That likely timeline, based on interviews and remarks from top specialists including Anthony Fauci of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, means businesses, schoolchildren and families will continue to wait.In an interview, Fauci, who has also been involved with White House’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine program, said it may take until well into 2021 for vaccines to reach the much of the general public.“I would hope that by the time we get well into the second half of 2021 that the companies will have delivered the hundreds of millions of doses they have promised,” said Fauci.The reasons are many. US health regulators will have only a tiny sliver of the usual safety and efficacy data. The leading products require two doses, which will limit how many people early supplies can help. And government health officials are still developing a plan for who will get the shots, how they’ll be distributed, and how their effectiveness and safety will be tracked afterward.“For three, to six, to nine months, there will be more people wanting a vaccine than there are vaccines,” said Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna Inc., the biotechnology company developing one of the furthest-along inoculations.Bancel said he expects his company’s product may get an emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for “a very narrow population at very high risk.” Vaccines for the general population will need full FDA approval, which will likely take significantly longer, he said in an interview.Those comments run counter to the timeline portrayed by President Donald Trump, who has said a vaccine may be ready by election day on Nov. 3.“I’m pushing everybody. If you had another president other than me, you wouldn’t be talking vaccines for two years. I will push it very hard,” Trump said last week during a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera. “But I’m not doing it for votes, I’m doing it because that’s the right thing to do and I’m doing it to save lives.”On Monday in Washington, Trump echoed his ambitious timeline: “I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year and it’ll be put in service maybe even as we get it, because we’re all set militarily, we’re using our military to distribute the vaccine.”Limited AccessOperation Warp Speed seeks to do what’s never been done before: research, develop and produce a vaccine for a new virus in months. It’s a monumental, risky undertaking that will probably result in billions of dollars of waste, but could shave years off of typical development timelines. But even if it’s successful, warp speed will move faster for some people than others. Two other key government officials described a gradually widening trickle of access over months and months, not the sudden, widespread availability of a vaccine. During an Aug. 7 presentation to a panel of experts convened by the National Academy of Medicine, which is helping decide who will be first in line for a shot, Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui said significant production ramp-up should start in November. It will continue accelerating over the following months until it is producing a ‘very large number of doses’ on a monthly basis in the second quarter of 2021, Slaoui said.Along with $8 billion in U.S. funds granted for vaccine development and manufacturing through Warp Speed, the Health and Defense departments have doled out contracts totaling almost $500 million to increase domestic manufacturing of vials and prefilled syringes for Covid-19 vaccines. The consulting company Deloitte also has a $15 million contract to track vaccine distribution and administration. The firm didn’t respond to a request for comment.On July 27, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins warned that the first round of vaccines will be carefully allocated.“There will be tens of millions of doses at the time that the first vaccine gets approved,” Collins said. “It won’t be enough for everybody, and so decisions will have to be made about priorities.”Vaccine trials typically require tens of thousands of patients and months of follow up to show they’re safe enough to give to healthy people. A lack of long-term data could limit access until health officials can better assess any risks.Moderna’s trial has signed up about 10% of the 30,000 people it aims to enroll, Fauci said on Aug. 6. Trial participants need to get the shots, which are spaced apart, and then be monitored to find out if they get infected or have any side effects.By the early fall, the FDA may only have a few weeks of data. That may be enough to give the shot to health-care and other front-line workers and other groups at higher risk from the virus, but it almost certainly won’t be enough for lower-risk people.That data won’t come until next year, said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVB Leerink, in a July 20 note to clients.The first announcement of federal clearance for a vaccine will more likely become a political event “with the reality of the availability, effectiveness and utility of the vaccine falling far short of the promotion by government officials,” he said.Early Plans Despite the demand for a vaccine and the logistical challenges of rolling it out to hundreds of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is still early in the planning phases for how that immense effort will go.The Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are expected to be heavily involved, and the role of the private sector is less clear.“It may not be going through CVS,” Fauci told Bloomberg, referring to the drugstore chain CVS Health Corp. “The DOD together with the CDC is getting very involved in how you get the supply chain to the people. That has not yet been worked out.”The Warp Speed program is also looking at using the military, said Jonathan Hoffman, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said during a press briefing July 30.The Defense Department is examining “how do we take advantage of the commercial capability of the private sector to handle things like distribution, and where will either the DOD step in to help manage that process, or if necessary will DOD be required to step in and actually physically deliver items itself,” he said.At least four states, California, Minnesota, North Dakota and Florida, are helping develop the early stages of a plan to distribute vaccine once it’s available, CQ Roll Call reported on Monday. The early stage plan is meant to explore “model approaches” on vaccine distribution, the publication reported, describing the program as a highly preliminary effort.In a message to Bloomberg, California’s Department of Public Health described the program as a “joint planning mission.” Florida’s health department confirmed its participation, though said no agenda for the meeting had been set. In the meantime, companies and scientists developing the vaccines are rushing to get data to back their use, or move onto more promising targets.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which have a competing vaccine, are also signing up patients. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said at a Washington Post event last week that the drugmaker expects rapid approval from the FDA, at least for emergency use, and will have enough of the shot to begin distribution this fall.“The main goal right now is to make sure we have a vaccine,” Bourla said. “There are two enemies — the virus, and time.”(Adds Trump comment in the 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pushing-for-it-very-hard-but-not-for-votes-trump-hopeful-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-out-by-end-of-2020/story-O4uYPh62zKeu4LJlHTg6GI.html
11-08-2020||World||Looting in Chicago leads to more than 100 arrests, cops place restrictions||Authorities in Chicago are restricting access to the city’s downtown after caravans of looters smashed windows, damaged storefronts and stole merchandise across downtown overnight, leading to the arrests of more than 100 people.Two people, a civilian and a security guard, were shot amid the melee, as crowds descended overnight on major commercial areas, including the iconic Magnificent Mile, superintendent David Brown said during a press conference on Monday. More than 400 officers were dispatched to downtown after seeing social media posts encouraging looting in the wake of an officer-involved shooting on Sunday on the South Side, Brown said. Thirteen officers were hurt in incidents that included broken windows, stolen merchandise and shots fired at police, he said.“This was an assault on our city,” said Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, who appeared with Brown during the press conference. “It undermines public safety and breeds a sense of insecurity among our residents. It also undermines our recovery efforts. These same stores that were hit last night, were hit previously, not just by the looting but by closures related to Covid-19.”Bus and train services were temporarily suspended in the downtown area. Downtown access was to be restricted overnight, and the city’s iconic bridges over the Chicago River were raised to limit access into the city’s loop.Some unrest had started on Sunday with a crowd growing in a South side neighbourhood following a shooting incident involving police and a 20-year-old man, who was injured but is expected to have survived, according to Brown. Police had responded to a call of a man with a gun, and the individual had pointed the gun at officers, Brown said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/looting-in-chicago-leads-to-more-than-100-arrests-cops-place-restrictions/story-eOKrWqHJu71LxlpsQl8T5M.html

Every life lost matters. I know many of you are grieving and that this is a difficult moment for the world. “But I want to be clear: there are green shoots of hope.”He stressed it’s not too late to take action to suppress the crisis that has gripped the planet.From Monday, face masks became compulsory in tourist hotspots in Paris amid warnings of a resurgence of cases, as infections in the US, the world’s worst-hit country, topped 5 million.UN-Water, a United Nations body, said that a severe household water shortage facing two out of five people in the world is undermining efforts to contain the pandemic.Some 3 billion people don’t have access to running water and soap at home, and 4 billion suffer from severe water scarcity for at least one month a year, UN-Water said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-sees-hope-despite-looming-750k-death-toll-from-pandemic/story-S61eTyNbRfmqdmo1x5cKFP.html

China, which claims the island as its own, condemned the visit which comes at a period of sharply deteriorating relations between China and the US.China flew J-11 and J-10 fighter aircraft onto Taiwan’s side of the sensitive strait that separates it from its giant neighbour, at around 9am local time, shortly before Azar met Taiwan President Tsai Ing Wen, Taiwan’s air force said.Beijing, meanwhile, sanctioned 11 US lawmakers and individuals in a tit-for-tat move against a US move to sanction 11 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over the passing of the security law. A foreign ministry spokesperson said the US should stop official interactions and the upgrading of substantive relations with Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-after-chinese-fighters-fly-close-to-taiwan/story-KQiKrPlBBibneiKA9OLjMK.html

High winds and waves are pounding the MV Wakashio, which was showing signs of splitting apart and dumping its remaining cargo oil into the waters surrounding Mauritius. The bulk carrier had run aground on a coral reef on July 25. and later started to leak oil.The Mauritius PM’s office said on Monday the situation was still very serious and they were preparing for “a worst case scenario”.Mauritian Wildlife Foundation manager Jean Hugues Gardenne said, “We are expecting the worst. The ship is showing really big, big cracks. We believe it will break into two at any time, at the maximum within two days. So much oil remains in the ship, so the disaster could become much worse. Helicopters are taking out the fuel little by little.”French experts arrived from the nearby island of Reunion and were deploying booms to contain any new oil spill. France sent a navy ship, military aircraft and technical advisers after Mauritius appealed for international help. Efforts were also underway to get other ships to pump oil out of the MV Wakashio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mauritius-races-to-halt-oil-spill-from-ship/story-EbBw4HGRp1LzAgojYOkZnK.html

He returned minutes later, saying there was a “shooting” outside the White House that was “under control.”“There was an actual shooting and somebody’s been taken to the hospital,” Trump said. The president said the shots were fired by law enforcement, saying he believed the individual who was shot was armed. “It was the suspect who was shot,” Trump said.Trump said he was escorted to the Oval Office by the agent. The White House was placed on lockdown following the incident.The shooting took place near 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue just blocks from the White House, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Law enforcement officials were still trying to determine the suspect’s motive.The suspect was transferred to a local hospital, and the District of Columbia fire department said the man suffered serious or possibly critical injuries. Authorities were investigating whether the individual has a history of mental illness.Trump praised the work of Secret Service personnel for their work in keeping him safe.

11-08-2020||World||UN sends 50,000 tons of wheat to Lebanon to avert food crisis||The United Nations is sending grain to Lebanon to avert a food crisis following last week’s explosion in Beirut that killed 160 people and destroyed grain silos.The World Food Programme will ship 50,000 tons of wheat flour to Beirut, enough to supply Lebanon for three months, it and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, another UN body, said Tuesday. The first batch of 17,500 tons will arrive in 10 days.The shipments will go to bakeries and millers and “ensure there is no food shortage,” OCHA said.A huge blast on Aug. 4 tore through major grain silos in Beirut’s port, stoking fears of scarcities in a nation that imports nearly all its food and was already reeling from an economic crisis. The explosion, which caused billions of dollars-worth of damage, occurred next to a grain store and left the country with only six weeks of flour reserves, half the standard amount to ensure food security, according to the UN.“Grain silos have been mostly destroyed, causing fears of skyrocketing food prices,” the WFP said.Lebanon relies on privately owned mills to ship wheat from Ukraine, Russia and other European countries. The government used to buy grain from local farmers at above-market prices but hasn’t done so in years.The explosion exacerbates the plight of the Arab nation, which has been battered this year by the coronavirus pandemic and a financial meltdown. The government defaulted on around $30 billion of Eurobonds in March and has been trying to get a bailout of around $10 billion from the International Monetary Fund.Foreign exchange dried up, causing a collapse in the Lebanese pound and shortages of food and fuel. Overall inflation in June stood at 90%, and for food alone it was almost 250%, according to the government’s statistics agency.The WFP plans to expand its cash-assistance program in the country almost 10-fold to one million people. It’s also increasing the value of its food cards by 73% to 70,000 Lebanese pounds ($46 at the official exchange rate; $9.33 at the black-market rate most Lebanese people have to use) because of the high inflation.The WFP has started airlifting mobile-storage units for grain to Beirut to replace the silos until they’re repaired. The first plane landed in the city on Saturday and two more are on their way, it said.Beirut’s container terminal was only partially affected by the blast and it restarted the offloading of ships on Aug. 8, according to the UN.“WFP has the capacity to launch a shipping operation that does not require port infrastructure,” the UN said. “WFP has the capacity to ship, deliver and unload wheat flour and bulk wheat grains directly into Beirut.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-sends-50-000-tons-of-wheat-to-lebanon-to-avert-food-crisis/story-mU5CSCoWwioBjwbxw8kcXK.html

The auction is to be held on August 21, with the next bid already set at a minimum of £55,000.The glasses were sent last week to the auction house in an ordinary envelope put in its letter-box by an unnamed vendor who did not realise its value. The glasses were in the vendor’s family for nearly a century, given to his uncle by Gandhi between 1920 and 1930.The uncle was working with British Petroleum in South Africa, where Gandhi spent years before returning to India to launch the freedom struggle. “It can be presumed that these (glasses) were gifted by way of thanks from Gandhi for some good deed. A note from the vendor is included”, the auctioneer said.Stowe said research confirmed the authenticity of the spectacles, calling the item a “special piece”.The glasses are described by the auctioneer as being “of usual form, with sprung gold plated arms and prescription lenses. Jointed by a gold plated nose bar. The spectacles formed an important and somewhat iconic part of Gandhi’s overall appearance”.“It was known that he would often give away his old or unwanted pairs to those in need or those who had helped him. A rare and important pair of spectacles”, it added.Another Bristol-based company, Paul Fraser Collectibles, has put up for sale cutlery used by Gandhi during his incarceration at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune and at the house of shipping magnate Sumati Morarjee in Mumbai for £70,000.The lot on sale since 2014 includes Gandhi’s metal food bowl, two wooden spoons and a wooden fork.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bids-over-55-000-for-mahatma-gandhi-s-glasses-from-south-africa/story-Eb5wouU6HR0MdNn11gnWII.html
