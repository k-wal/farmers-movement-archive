Netanyahu has insisted the annexation plans are only on “temporary hold” at the request of the United States.The UAE, like most of the Arab world, long rejected official diplomatic ties with Israel, saying recognition should only come in return for concessions in peace talks. Its accord with Israel breaks that long-held tenet and could usher in agreements with other Arab states, undermining an Arab consensus that was a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.“According to the Palestinians, and to many others in the world who agreed with them, peace can’t be reached without conceding to the Palestinians’ demands, including uprooting settlements, dividing Jerusalem and withdrawal to 1967 lines,” Netanyahu said in a video statement. “No more. This concept of ‘peace through withdrawal and weakness’ has passed from the world.”The Palestinians want the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for their hoped-for state, and peacemaking with them since the 1990s has been based on withdrawal from those lands to make way for a Palestinian homeland. Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Mideast war, although it withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005.But what has been a wall of Arab support for the Palestinians and their demands has begun to crack in recent years, in large part because of the shared enmity of Israel and other Arab states toward Iran and Iranian proxies in the region.The Palestinians bristled at Netanyahu’s remarks.“Peace should be established on the basis of the Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital. This is the Arab and international consensus and anything else has no value,” said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.Netanyahu also reiterated Sunday his interpretation of the UAE deal: that annexation was only being suspended and that it was still on the table, so long as it was done in coordination with Washington. UAE officials have indicated that the deal means annexation has been shelved entirely.After President Donald Trump released his Mideast plan earlier this year, which was favorable to Israel, Netanyahu said he would forge ahead with annexing parts of the West Bank. Netanyahu backed away from moving forward with annexation last month in the face of fierce international opposition and misgivings by White House officials.But Netanyahu, who has seen his popularity plummet over his handling of the coronavirus crisis, has faced searing criticism from settler leaders and their representatives in parliament over the annexation backtrack, and he has tried to reassure them that he remains committed to the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-says-uae-deal-signals-end-to-land-for-peace/story-brjiZeUDctQgozYkQdcpsL.html
16-08-2020||World||White House’s Meadows says he accepts Kamala Harris eligible for VP||White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Sunday he accepts that Sen. Kamala Harris is eligible to serve as vice president, rejecting a false and racist conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump had promoted.“Sure,” said Meadows, when asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” whether he acknowledges the fact that she meets the constitutional requirements to be president or vice president. “And I think the president spoke to this yesterday. This is not something that we’re going to pursue.”Trump twice this past week declined to say whether he believed she met the requirements when asked about social media claims that the California senator and former presidential candidate couldn’t serve in the White House because her parents were immigrants to the United States.Trump initially said Thursday that he had just heard the claim and had “no idea if that’s right,” but that the charge was serious and he would look into it. Pressed again Saturday to accept her eligibility, Trump demurred, saying at a news conference at his New Jersey golf club that it didn’t bother him but he had “not got into it in great detail.”Harris is without question eligible for the office.Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California, making her a natural-born U.S. citizen and eligible to be president if Biden were unable to serve a full term. Her father, an economist from Jamaica, and her mother, a cancer researcher from India, met at the University of California, Berkeley, as graduate students.The Constitution requires a vice president to meet the eligibility requirements to be president. That includes being a natural-born U.S. citizen, at least 35 years old and a resident in the U.S. for at least 14 years — all criteria that Harris fulfills.When asked about Trump’s promotion of the conspiracy theory about her, Harris said in an interview released Sunday that she and Biden fully expect Trump and his campaign to engage in “lies” and “deception” in a bid to beat Democrats in the Nov. 3 election.“They’re going to engage in an attempt to distract from the real issues that are impacting the American people,” she told TheGrio. “And I expect that they will engage in dirty tactics. And this is going to be a knockdown, drag-out. And we’re ready.”Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket. Trump in past years indulged in the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born abroad. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.Jason Miller, a Trump campaign adviser, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that the campaign would not be promoting the conspiracy theory.“This is something that the media brings up to him in his press conferences or interview formats,” he said. “It’s not something that anyone in our campaign is talking about.”“It’s case closed. End of story.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-s-meadows-says-he-accepts-kamala-harris-eligible-for-vp/story-D1kbUOLx1e3M1tganFSBhK.html
16-08-2020||World||At least 18 shot, with 4 dead, across Cincinnati, say police||At least 18 people were shot, including four killed, as gunfire erupted in several places around the city overnight, authorities said Sunday.Officers responded just after 12:30 am Sunday to the Avondale neighborhood and found 21-year-old Antonio Blair with gunshot wounds, police said in a statement. He was taken to University Hospital and died there, they said. Three other gunshot victims were also taken to the hospital.At about 2:15 am, officers responded to a report of gunfire in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood where 10 people were shot, police said. One died at the scene and another at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center; they were identified in a statement as 34-year-old Robert Rogers and 30-year-old Jaquiez Grant.Three people were shot at about midnight Saturday in the Walnut Hills neighbourhood, about a block away from the Harriet Beecher Stowe house, police said.News outlets reported the shootings took place within 60 to 90 minutes of each other, but Assistant Police Chief Paul Neudigate told reporters that they “seem to be separate independent incidents but horrific and tragic.”Police didn’t immediately provide details about the fourth fatal shooting but confirmed that it occurred on the city’s West End, where television news reports indicated that one person was shot later Sunday morning and was pronounced dead at the scene.No suspect information was immediately available in any of the cases.“One extremely violent night in the city of Cincinnati. Looking at possibly 17 victims, up to four that could be fatal at this time. Why? That’s going to be the question,” Neudigate had said before the fourth shooting was announced.Cincinnati’s police chief later Sunday called the level of violence “unacceptable.”“I am calling on all citizens of this great city to say enough is enough! We must not sit by silently and say we can’t do anything to end gun violence,” Chief Eliot Isaac said in a statement. “We all have a moral obligation to stop the violence and stop the killing in our communities.”Police said the department would shift officers from other assignments to beef up the number of uniformed officers in the affected communities and would call on federal prosecutors and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “to focus on repeat shooters and aggressively bring illegal gun charges.”Mayor John Cranley called it “senseless gun violence that ruined lives and will cause immeasurable suffering” at a time the city was facing “unprecedented circumstances and challenges” in fighting crime during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the city has seen an uptick as people gather in private homes and public places when the bars close.“Guns are far too prevalent at these gatherings. Please do not attend gatherings because you could end up as an innocent victim,” he said in a statement.He stressed, however, that those firing were responsible for the shootings — which he called “attempted or actual murder” — and vowed to bring them to justice.“I am also calling on everyone to help put an end this culture of resolving personal disputes with guns as well as to reduce the far too prevalent availability of illegal guns on our streets,” he said. “The very sad reality is people are getting in trouble when they have nowhere to go and nothing to do.”In July, the Enquirer reported that the city had experienced a rise in shootings and homicides from gun violence during the first half of the year as compared to the same time period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-at-least-18-shot-with-4-dead-across-cincinnati/story-Q3BzhKTZMBoAG85q0IlWjJ.html
16-08-2020||World||Telephone service begins between UAE and Israel amid deal||Telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel began working Sunday as the two countries opened diplomatic ties.Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and cellular phones.Officials in Israel and the UAE did not immediately acknowledge the lines had begun working. They declined to immediately answer questions from the AP.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would play saying calls to the +972 country code could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, though these too were often interrupted. Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phone numbers, which the UAE could call.Also Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, like the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced Thursday they are establishing full diplomatic relations in a U.S.-brokered deal that required Israel to halt its contentious plan to annex occupied West Bank land sought by the Palestinians.The historic deal delivered a key foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about archenemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/telephone-service-begins-between-uae-and-israel-amid-deal/story-iEx6DpZVt53gkk5dPbXWQP.html
16-08-2020||World||Trump says he is considering pardon for leaker Edward Snowden||US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is considering a pardon for Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency contractor - now living in Russia - whose spectacular leaks shook the US intelligence community in 2013.The Republican president’s comments followed an interview, Trump gave to the New York Post this week in which he said of Snowden that “there are a lot of people that think that he is not being treated fairly” by US law enforcement. “I’m going to start looking at it,” Trump told reporters about a possible pardon, speaking at a news conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club.US authorities for years have wanted Snowden returned to the United States to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.Snowden fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia after he leaked a trove of secret files in 2013 to news organizations that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the NSA.Snowden’s Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, told RIA news agency the United States should not simply pardon him, but should drop all possible prosecutions against Snowden as he had not committed any crimes.“He was acting not only in the interest of the American citizens, but in the interest of all the humankind,” Kucherena said. Trump’s softening stance toward Snowden represents a sharp reversal. Shortly after the leaks, Trump expressed hostility toward Snowden, calling him “a spy who should be executed.”Trump said on Saturday he thinks Americans on both the political left and the right are divided on Snowden.“It seems to be a split decision,” Trump told reporters. “Many people think he should be somehow treated differently. And other people think he did very bad things.”Domestic spyingSome civil libertarians have praised Snowden for revealing the extraordinary scope of America’s digital espionage operations including domestic spying programs that senior US officials had publicly insisted did not exist.But such a move would horrify many in the US intelligence community, some of whose most important secrets were exposed. Trump has harshly criticized past leaders of the US intelligence community and FBI, and on Thursday took aim at the bureau’s current director Christopher Wray, his own appointee.The US Justice Department filed a lawsuit last September against Snowden, arguing that the memoir he published last year, “Permanent Record,” violated non-disclosure agreements.The Justice Department said Snowden published the book without submitting it to intelligence agencies for review, adding that speeches given by Snowden also violated nondisclosure agreements.Trump’s use of his executive clemency powers including pardons has often benefited allies and well-connected political figures.Last month he commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election to boost Trump’s candidacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-is-considering-pardon-for-leaker-edward-snowden/story-W4YnBYOXMoHR4lAi11r4EM.html
16-08-2020||World||Russia says Saudi Arabia will test controversial coronavirus vaccine||Russia has reached an agreement in principle to conduct clinical trials of its controversial coronavirus vaccine in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to the head of its sovereign wealth fund.The Russians are working with a pharmaceutical company in the kingdom and have shared data from Phase I and Phase II trials with Saudi partners, the chief executive officer of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, told Arab News. The company wasn’t identified.“We’ll really engage with Saudi scientists and the Saudi Health Ministry,” Dmitriev said. “We believe that Saudi will be a very strong partner for our joint work on the Sputnik V vaccine.”Earlier this month Russia approved a coronavirus shot before crucial tests have shown it’s safe and effective. The plan is to begin mass inoculation soon. A local association of multinational pharmaceutical companies has called the rushed regulatory approval risky.Russia also shared its data with the UAE and is expecting to start its trials there later in August, Dmitriev said. Additionally, it plans to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines and Brazil as well as at home, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-saudi-arabia-will-test-controversial-coronavirus-vaccine/story-y6WUmiwDhP4AJhv9QqwqaL.html
16-08-2020||World||US watchdog clears emergency use of new saliva test for faster detection of Covid-19||The US health watchdog has authorised the emergency use of a new and expensive saliva based laboratory diagnostic test for Covid-19 that could be a game changer in the diagnosis of the infection as it will enable rapid testing amongst more people easily.Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drugs Administration Commissioner, said the new saliva test would increase efficiency and avoid shortage of crucial test components like reagents.“Providing this type of flexibility for processing saliva samples to test for Covid-19 infection is groundbreaking in terms of efficiency and avoiding shortages of crucial test components like reagents,” he said in a statement.The agency has previously authorised four other tests that use saliva for sampling, but these yielded varying results. Authorisation of the new test occurs amid ongoing disarray over Covid-19 testing.The US has been plagued by an inconsistent strategy for detecting the virus, thanks in part to persistent shortages and the use of a variety of different tests that have sometimes yielded unreliable results.The new method called SalivaDirect is being further validated as a test for asymptomatic individuals through a programme that tests players and staff from the National Basketball Association (NBA).SalivaDirect is simpler, less expensive and less invasive than the traditional method for such testing known as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabbing.Results so far have found that SalivaDirect is highly sensitive and yields similar outcomes as NP swabbing. With the FDA’s emergency use authorisation, the testing method is immediately available to other diagnostic laboratories that want to start using the new test, which can be scaled up quickly for use across the nation and, perhaps, beyond — in the coming weeks, researchers said.A key component of SalivaDirect, the researchers note, is that the method has been validated with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors.This flexibility enables continued testing if some vendors encounter supply chain issues as experienced early in the pandemic.“This is a huge step forward to make testing more accessible,” said Chantal Vogels, a Yale postdoctoral fellow, who led the laboratory development and validation along with Doug Brackney, an adjunct assistant clinical professor.“This started off as an idea in our lab soon after we found saliva to be a promising sample type of the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and now it has the potential to be used on a large scale to help protect public health. We are delighted to make this contribution to the fight against coronavirus,” he said. Development of SalivaDirect as a means of rapidly expanding SARS-CoV-2 testing was spearheaded this spring by Nathan Grubaugh and Anne Wyllie, assistant professor and associate research scientist, respectively, at Yale School of Public Health.After finding saliva to be a promising sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, they wanted to improve the method further.“With saliva being quick and easy to collect, we realised it could be a game-changer in Covid-19 diagnostics,” said Wyllie.With testing urgently needed, the Yale team was determined to decrease both testing times and costs, to make testing widely accessible.“Wide-spread testing is critical for our control efforts. We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents and we expect that labs will only charge about USD 10 per sample. If cheap alternatives like SalivaDirect can be implemented across the country, we may finally get a handle on this pandemic, even before a vaccine,” said Grubaugh.Grubaugh and Wyllie said that they are not seeking to commercialise the method rather want the simplified testing method to help those most in need.Testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been a major stumbling block in the fight against the pandemic, with long delays and shortages of testing.Some experts have said that up to 4 million tests are needed per day and SalivaDirect provides one pathway toward that goal, the researchers said.“Using SalivaDirect, our lab can double our testing capacity,” said Professor Chen Liu, chair of Yale Pathology, who oversaw the clinical validation of the study. Globally, coronavirus has infected 20,950,402 people while the disease has killed so far 760,213 others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-watchdog-clears-emergency-use-of-new-saliva-test-for-faster-detection-of-covid-19/story-XfsDIZZtch4iv4LiJS1exH.html
16-08-2020||World||Covid-19: Italy produces 10% less garbage during lockdown||Italy produced 10% less garbage during its coronavirus lockdown, but environmentalists warn that increased reliance on disposable masks and packaging is imperiling efforts to curb single-use plastics that end up in oceans and seas.Italian researchers estimate that during the peak months of Italy’s lockdown in March and April, urban waste production fell by 500,000 tons. That decrease is enabling dumps in Italy — where trash collection in major cities has often become a hot-button political issue — to absorb the 300,000 tons of extra waste from protective masks and gloves estimated to be used this year, according to the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research.“Substantially, the figures will balance each other by the end of this year,” Valeria Frittelloni, the institute’s head of waste management and circular economy, told The Associated Press.But the pandemic dealt a blow to efforts to move away from single-use plastics in many places where they were just beginning to become mainstream. UN, Greenpeace, Italy’s Marevivo environmental organization and other such groups are warning that continued reliance on single-use plastics will pose longer-term risks to the environment.That’s particularly true for a country with a long coastline along the Mediterranean Sea, which is plagued by the tiny bits of broken-down plastic known as microplastics.“We don’t have an estimate yet of how much of those objects were dumped in the environment, but what is sure is that all those that have been abandoned sooner or later will reach the sea,” said Giuseppe Ungherese, head of anti-pollution campaigns at Greenpeace Italy.After years of reducing reliance on products like plastic bags and cutlery, in line with European Union directives, Italy saw a huge spike in plastic use during the coronavirus emergency. The Italian National Consortium for the Collection and Recycling of Plastic Packages said the increase in online shopping and its related packaging led to an 8% increase in plastic waste, even within an overall decrease in garbage production.Keiron Roberts, an environmental research fellow at the University of Portsmouth in England, said other countries saw similar demand for plastics and cardboard as a result of the so-called Amazon effect — referring to a surge in reliance on the internet retailer as people holed up to abide by stay-at-home orders. But he concurred that within Europe, Italy was in a particularly vulnerable spot.“Because you are surrounded by coastline, you just need to have some rain events that will wash these masks into the sewage system or into the rivers and the waterways and they will eventually make their ways into the ocean,” he said.“There’s no area of the Mediterranean now where plastic hasn’t impacted,” he added.Italy’s National Center for Research reported in 2018 that the presence of microplastics on surface seawater off Italy’s coasts was comparable to levels found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the collection of ocean debris that spans part of that ocean.Globally, the UN Environment Program has warned that the increased use of single-use plastics in protective equipment could lead to uncontrolled dumping and add to marine pollution, and it has urged countries to develop adequate disposal plans. The UN Trade body, UNCTAD, estimates that worldwide global sales of face masks alone will reach $166 billion this year, up from $800 million in 2019.Even before the Covid-19 crisis, only a quarter of Italy’s waste was recycled, with an estimated 53 kilotons of plastics leaking into the Mediterranean each year, according to the environmental group WWF.“Plastics and global warming are the main threats, and we need to act now to prevent our planet and sea from transforming into a hostile and unlivable environment,” said Greenpeace’s Ungherese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italy-produces-10-less-garbage-during-lockdown/story-LlmH9bw1q2Jy2kgLyNuNrM.html

Jun Kwang-hoon, a controversial pastor and an outspoken government critic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe health ministry said it will file a complaint against Jun later on Sunday, accusing him of violating self-isolation rules by participating in a rally on Saturday and “obstructing” epidemiological investigation by failing to submit a full list of church members for testing and tracing. Thousands of demonstrators took to the street on the Aug. 15 liberation day on Tuesday, protesting against President Moon Jae-in’s policies and defying a ban on rallies in the capital.The surge in Covid-19 cases prompted authorities on Sunday to reimpose tighter social distancing curbs, and President Moon warned of “stern and strong measures” against “some churches”, calling their behaviour an “unforgivable act that threatens public lives.” Jun’s church did not respond to telephone calls from Reuters seeking comment. Another Christian sect, Shincheonji Church of Jesus, was at the centre of the country’s largest outbreak of Covid-19 infections in February. The secretive group was linked to 36% of South Korea’s total cases, and on Aug.1, South Korean authorities arrested its founder, Lee Man-hee, for allegedly hiding crucial information from contact-tracers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-accuses-religious-sect-leader-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-2CjUcEaFCDPWUZNyzWFfNN.html
16-08-2020||World||Joe Biden says he will stand with India as it confronts ‘new threats’||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, on Saturday pledged closer ties with India and a better deal for Indian Americans in a short, policy-laden Independence Day message. He will stand with India in confronting “new threats its faces in its own region and along its own border”, he said.Kamala Harris, his running mate, struck a personal note. She spoke of her visits to “Madras” (as Chennai was called then), stories she heard from her grandfather of heroes of Indian independence and her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris’s efforts to instill in her “a love of good Idli”.Biden’s campaign had earlier in the day issued an expansive agenda on relations with India and the welfare of Indian Americans if he wins in November. The Biden administration will not allow China to threaten its neighbours with “impunity” and will have “no tolerance” for cross-border terrorism.Biden built on it in a pre-recorded message played at a virtual outreach to the Indian American community to celebrate Indian Independence Day. Recalling his leading efforts to ratify the civil nuclear deal in 2008 as a senator, he said he had held then that if India and the United States “became closer friends and partners, the world would be a safer place”“If elected president, I will continue to believe it,” he went on to say and added that he will “continue what I have long called for — including standing with India in confronting new threats it faces n its own region and along its border.”The former vice-president covered an entire range of issues for cooperation in the future, such as trade, climate change and public health. And also have “honest conversations on all issues as friends”, which is diplomatese for discussing disagreements and difficult issues.Biden spoke disapprovingly of rising hate crimes and crackdown on legal immigration in recent years — “the sudden and harmful actions on H-1B, which for decades made America stronger and brought our nations closer”.The expansive agenda, address by Biden and Harris, and the participation of senior members of the campaign -former deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken, former National Security Adviser to former vice-president Biden Jake Sullivan, speechwriter Vinay Reddy and Seema Sadanandan - was part of the campaign efforts to woo the 1.2 million Indian American voters who can help in closely fought swing states. Former US ambassador to India Rich Verma and former assistant secretary of state Nisha Biswal also participated in the discussions,Harris spoke largely in personal terms. She spoke of her grandfather P V Gopalan and grandmother Rajam, and the values that her mother Shyamala Gopalan learnt from them — “if you see injustice in the world you have an obligation to do something about it”.Growing up, Gopalan would take Harris and her sister Maya Harris to “what was then called Madras” so that they could understand where she came from and what was their ancestry. “And, of course, she wanted to instill in us a love of good Idli,” said the presumptive vice-presidential nominee.Harris has faced criticism among some Indian Americans — and a section of Indians — for not embracing her Indianness enough, and for projecting herself more Black. She wrote in her autobiography that she and her sister were raised by their mother to be “confident, proud black women”. On Saturday, Harris may have checked a few boxes for her critics as she spoke also of stories her grandfather told her about the heroes who were responsible India’s independence. “He would explain to us that it was on us to pick up where they left off,” she said, adding, “those lessons are a big reason why I am who I am today.”Blinken, who is expected a top portfolio in a Biden administration such as secretary of state or national security adviser, took the vice-president’s pledge of closer ties with India further and suggested that cooperation between the two countries should “extend even beyond the region to the world as large”.Blinken went to say the Biden administration will support a larger role for India in international institutions — including a permanent seat in a reformed UN security council. The US first extent support for India’s claim to a permanent during President Barack Obama’s first visit to India in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-he-will-stand-with-india-as-it-confronts-new-threats/story-tgVqo7xkJBiABMs5eDoYYI.html

The protesters on Friday chanted slogans for the freedom of victims of enforced disappearances in Sindh. They held placards with pictures of victims of enforced disappearances, according to a statement issued by Sindhi Foundation which organised the protest. Present in the protest were Sindhi, Baloch and Pakhtoon leaders, besides people from Gilgit Baltistan. The protesters demanded the release of all victims of enforced disappearances, especially teacher and scholar Sarang Joyo who was abducted from his house in Karachi on Tuesday. “I want to appreciate efforts of my sisters Aqsa Dayo, Shazia Chandio, Shabana Junejo, Sohni Joyo, Sindhu Joyo, Sorath Lohar and Sasui Lohar who have inspired all of us by leading the protests against victims of enforced disappearances for past many months,” said Sufi Laghari, executive director of Sindhi Foundation. He also appreciated the initiative taken by Sindhi Inam and said it is his struggle that has inspired “all of us to come out and protest against the enforced disappearances”. Laghari also mentioned that Taj Joyo, a Sindhi poet and writer who is father of Sarang Joyo has rejected to receive Presidential Performance Award from Pakistan. The protesters demanded an end to all enforced disappearances in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sindhi-community-holds-protest-against-enforced-disappearances-in-pakistan/story-w5GFJJQLi0xV12yQJfrDoJ.html

16-08-2020||World||US, South Korea to begin scaled-down drills amid Covid-19 spike||The United States and South Korea will begin their annual joint military exercises this week, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Sunday. But a spreading coronavirus outbreak has apparently forced the allies to scale back an already low-key training program mainly involving computer-simulated war scenarios.The drills from Tuesday to Aug. 28 could still irk North Korea, which portrays the allies’ training as invasion rehearsals and has threatened to abandon stalled nuclear talks if Washington persists with what it perceives as “hostile policies” toward Pyongyang.The exercises also come at a delicate time after President Donald Trump openly complained about the costs of maintaining 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea to protect against North Korean threats. The allies have so far failed to sign a new cost-sharing agreement after the last one expired at the end of 2019.The drills involve so-called combined command post training, which is focused on computerized simulations aimed at preparing the two militaries for various battle scenarios, such as a surprise North Korean attack.The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify how many troops will participate. But it’s clear the size would be smaller than the summer drills of previous years, which often involved tens of thousands of troops on both sides, and combined computer simulations with field training. This time, the coronavirus pandemic has limited the number of US troops who could be brought in from abroad.The US and South Korean militaries had canceled their springtime drills following a Covid-19 outbreak in the southern city of Daegu and nearby towns that was stabilized by April.But South Korea is now dealing with a virus resurgence in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan region, home to half of the country’s 51 million people. It forced US Forces Korea to designate the capital and surrounding areas off-limits to personnel who don’t live there. The 279 new cases South Korea reported on Sunday are the highest daily jump since early March.There have been around 150 Covid-19 infections among US troops stationed in South Korea since February, which prompted Gyeonggi Province near Seoul last month to openly call for the cancellation of the August drills. Gyeonggi includes the city of Pyeongtaek, the site of US military headquarters.The allies have downsized much of their combined training activity after Trump unilaterally suspended large-scale field training with South Korea after his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018. Trump then seemed to adopt North Korea’s traditional view of such drills, criticizing them as a “provocative” drain of money.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered since the collapse of Trump’s second meeting with Kim in February last year in Vietnam, where the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The North reacted to last year’s summertime drills by ramping up its short-range missile tests and unleashing verbal vitriol toward South Korea, which had lobbied hard to revive nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-south-korea-to-begin-scaled-down-drills-amid-covid-19-spike/story-MNJrmapVobhGdhdON8mLoN.html

In an interview with American news broadcaster PBS, Fauci said it shouldn’t take later than the start of the next year to get the vaccine. Fauci added that even half an effective vaccine would be good enough to bring the world back to normalcy within a year.Although President Donald Trump has said a vaccine may be ready by election day on November 3, Fauci is of the opinion that it may take until well into 2021 for shots to reach the general public.Also read: Covid-19 - Victoria extends state of emergency as deaths top 300On the Russian vaccine candidate, the expert said that just because there is a vaccine does not mean it should be administered to the public. “You need to be looking if a vaccine is safe and effective,” he told the PBS.Russia’s decision to approve a coronavirus shot before crucial tests have raised questions over its safety and efficacy, raising worries that politics will trump public health in the quest for a vaccine against the deadly contagion.Russia, however, has dismissed concerns about the vaccine, describing it as Western jealousy. President Vladimir Putin had vouched for its efficacy and said that one of his daughters has already been given the shot and felt better afterwards.The country plans to start mass inoculations as soon as October. Experts believe Moscow’s plan could put pressure on other governments to rush ahead of regulators and skip key steps in order to push a vaccine out in the market, putting public health at risk.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-top-us-expert-fauci-believes-half-an-effective-vaccine-enough-to-control-crisis/story-24gSi8ZAVl2IKv0nhhSE1O.html

Some had taken the bus from their homes across town to join white students from the affluent hillside neighborhoods in Berkeley, California. A pensive Harris sits on the floor, dutifully looking ahead, a child in the center of an experiment in racial integration.Also read: Kamala Harris recounts childhood India visits, long walks with grandfather“That’s how it started. There’s no question!” Harris, 55, texted back to Aaron Peskin, the former classmate who is now a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.Fifty years after she was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley’s public schools, Harris is now the first Black woman and first Asian American woman named to a major party presidential ticket.From her earliest years, Harris’ path toward the second-highest office in the United States has tracked the nation’s struggle for racial equality. The start-and-stop progress and sometimes messy debate have shaped her life, from an upbringing by immigrant parents, a childhood among civil rights activists, a career at the helm of a flawed criminal justice system and her rapid ascent to the top of Democratic politics.Those experiences forged a politician who is unafraid to buck the political powers that be, but also charts a cautious course through policy debates. As a senator and candidate, she’s emerged as a leader who knows the power of tough questioning and a viral moment, and also the weight of her role as a voice for women of color.“She’s the right thing at the right time in this country,” said Peskin. “She understands how complicated life is, and what the promises of America are.”Also read: American weekly magazine apologizes for op-ed questioning Harris eligibilityHarris’s political rise, while fast, has not been without criticism and setbacks.She’s been criticized for shifting policy positions. She faced questions familiar to women in politics, particularly women of color, about her ambition. Republican President Donald Trump labeled her “nasty” for her piercing interrogation of his nominees, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Some progressive Democrats, meanwhile, view her work as a prosecutor skeptically, questioning her use of policies they say are discriminatory.Her own presidential bid, announced before 20,000 people in her hometown of Oakland, California, flamed out before primary season voting began. She struggled to raise money and present a clear vision.Now she’s back in an election she calls the most consequential of her lifetime.“My mother Shyamala raised my sister Maya and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching,” Harris said Wednesday in her first speech after Biden announced his selection. “She’d tell us: Don’t sit around and complain about things.

The state reported 279 new cases and 16 deaths, the health department said. Eleven of the cases were linked to aged-care facilities, facing a major crisis amid the spread of the virus.Andrews warned against complacency as infection numbers slowed. The Stage 4 lockdown was working and infection numbers were heading in the right direction, he said. While he was cautiously optimistic, he said Victorians didn’t have “the luxury of backing off.”Local media reported Melburnians were out in droves on Saturday to take advantage of good weather despite the strict restrictions, which include a curfew in Melbourne.“They speak to a strategy that is working,” Andrews said. “At the same time, no one day necessarily guarantees the outcome, that is a long hard slog. This is an endurance race, it is not a sprint in any way.”The state reported 372 cases on Friday and 303 on Saturday as new infections continue trending down after hitting a daily record of 725 infections on August 5. Victoria reported 14 deaths on Friday and four on Saturday. Its total number of Covid-19 fatalities is 309.Australia’s second-most populous state is approaching almost six months of being in a state of emergency after first declaring it on March 16 to combat the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-victoria-extends-state-of-emergency-as-deaths-top-300/story-p8kYhqIGWgVL2C0XiU3g3N.html

The United States ordered its Chinese owner ByteDance on Friday to divest the US operations of TikTok within 90 days, the latest effort to ramp up pressure over concerns about the safety of the personal data it handles.Trump, who has made changing the US-China trade relationship a central theme of his presidency, has been sharply critical of China while also praising its purchases of agriculture products such as soybeans and corn as part of a trade agreement reached late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/looking-at-pressuring-other-chinese-companies-after-bytedance-trump/story-JAknne7tzpCmcRoMU8CUsJ.html

Harris, 55, who is the first black to be selected as a vice-presidential candidate of a major party, took a trip down the memory lane, mentioning her “long walks” in Madras (now Chennai) with her grandfather who would tell her about the “heroes” responsible for the birth of the world’s largest democracy.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, 77, scripted history by selecting Harris, an Indian-American and an African-American, as his running mate in the presidential election on November 3.Born to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, California senator Harris, if elected, would be second in line of succession after Biden.“Today on August 15, 2020. I stand before you as the first candidate for vice president of the United States of South Asian descent,” Harris said in her address organised by Indians for Biden National Council.Joined by Biden, she greeted Indian Americans on the occasion of India’s Independence Day.“To the people of India and to Indian Americans all across the US, I want to wish you a happy Indian Independence Day. On August 15, 1947, men and women all over India rejoiced in the declaration of the independence of the country of India,” Harris said during the virtual inaugural meet of the council.Harris was born on October 20 in 1964, at Oakland in California. Her mother Shyamala Gopalan migrated to the US from Tamil Nadu in India, while her father, Donald J Harris, moved to the US from Jamaica. “When my mother, Shyamala stepped off the plane in California as a 19-year- old, she didn’t have much in the way of belongings. But she carried with her lessons from back home, including ones she learned from her parents, my grandmother Rajan, and her father, my grandfather P V Gopalan. They taught her that when you see injustice in the world, you have an obligation to do something about it,” Harris said.“Which is what inspired my mother to march and shout on the streets of Oakland, at the height of the civil rights movement, a movement where leaders including Dr Martin Luther King Jr, were themselves inspired by the non-violent activism of Mahatma Gandhi,” she said.Harris said it was during those protests that her mother met her father. The rest, as they say, is history, she said.“Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry. And of course, she always wanted to instil in us, a love of good idli,” Harris said.“In Madras I would go on long walks with my grandfather, who at that point was retired. We would take morning walks where I’d hold his hand and he would tell me about the heroes who are responsible for the birth of the world’s biggest democracy. He would explain that it’s on us to pick up where they left off. Those lessons are a big reason why I am who I am today,” Harris said explaining the deep influence of the Indian heritage on her. “Our community is bound together by so much more than our shared history and culture,” she said. The reason there is a kinship between everyone who are a product of the South Asian diaspora, no matter how diverse our backgrounds may be, “is because we also share a set of values: values forged by overcoming colonial past, not only in one nation but in two”, Harris said.“Values like tolerance pluralism, and diversity and reflecting on the past 73 years it’s remarkable how much progress, people have made in the fight for justice. And should be proud. But we wouldn’t be if we didn’t commit ourselves to building an even better future. So, I hope you celebrate today, and then tomorrow, I hope you join me in getting to work,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-stand-before-you-as-first-candidate-for-us-vice-president-of-south-asian-descent-kamala-harris/story-DfVZsmTPSjz7yLxRmK2wGI.html
16-08-2020||World||Mexico needs 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses; shots could start in April||Mexico will need up to 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses, according to a senior government official, and inoculation of its 120 million inhabitants could start as early as April if clinical trials and regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca Plc go as planned.In partnership with the governments of Mexico and Argentina, AstraZeneca initially plans to produce 150 million doses in early 2021 and eventually make at least 400 million doses for distribution throughout Latin America. AstraZeneca is among those working on Covid-19 vaccine candidates now in development around the world.Mexico’s government also has said it is considering other options for bringing a vaccine quickly to its population, the second-largest in Latin America.Also read| Covid-19 vaccine trial likely to conclude by Nov, production may start in early 2021: AstraZenecaAstraZeneca will be able to produce between 30 and 35 million vaccines per month, Martha Delgado, a Mexican deputy foreign minister, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The vaccine could require two doses to be effective, Delgado said. “If we need 200 million, we’re going to be vaccinating for a long time,” Delgado added. Last-stage so-called Phase III trials are expected to conclude by November or December, after which AstraZeneca will seek government approvals if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective. If that goes smoothly, Delgado estimated the first vaccines in Mexico could be administered in April. Mexico’s death toll of 55,908 stands as the world’s third highest, behind the United States and Brazil. Latin America’s 6 million cases and more than 237,000 deaths make it the world’s hardest-hit region.To ensure all Mexicans have access to a vaccine, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s government is in talks with other pharmaceutical laboratories in different stages of developing a vaccine.“Astra’s production isn’t going to be enough for Mexico. We need to supplement that with a couple of more vaccines,” Delgado said.Mexico’s government has completed memorandums of understanding with French drugmaker Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit and Chinese companies CanSino Biologics Inc and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd.CanSino and Walvax are interested in producing a vaccine in Mexico for delivery to the Latin American market.Mexico’s health authorities are evaluating the Phase I and II clinical trials of those four companies and will determine the viability of Phase III studies in Mexico in the coming weeks, Delgado said. The earlier phase trials represent an initial test of a vaccine’s safety and effectiveness among small numbers of subjects.To save time, Mexico’s federal health regulator COFEPRIS will start analyzing AstraZeneca’s completed studies and accelerate approvals if Phase III is successful.“This is the country’s strategy to diversify our possibilities of having access to the vaccine as soon as possible ... and obviously at an affordable cost for the country,” Delgado said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-needs-200-million-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-shots-could-start-in-april/story-bV0e2Jup8yCX6Q2vmKk1JJ.html
16-08-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, flu shot makers see record US production||Global influenza vaccine makers have produced a record number of doses for the coming flu season, as authorities try to ease the burden on hospitals ahead of an expected Covid-19 resurgence.In the US, pharmaceutical companies plan to make around 196 million doses to serve the population of 330 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is up from 175 million last year, an 11 percent increase. Major pharmacy chain CVS, which administers flu vaccines without prescription, is ordering 18 million doses, double the amount in 2019.Vaccine maker Seqirus plans to increase production by roughly 15 percent in the US -- from 52 million to 60 million doses, as does Sanofi -- from 70 to 80 million.“There’s been a huge demand from our customers from the healthcare system,” Sanofi’s Michael Greenberg, regional medical head for vaccines in North America, told AFP.Sanofi, Seqirus and GSK are the three biggest companies in the market. GSK did not respond to a request for its vaccine production plans.Sanofi shipped its first batches on July 22, three weeks earlier than in 2019.The CDC estimates flu killed between 24,000 and 62,000 last year.Widespread flu vaccination could thus help free up hospital beds, a vital public health measure to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I’m really worried about the autumn,” Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University, told AFP.Gostin recently wrote an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for a flu vaccine offensive, including potentially mandatory vaccines at schools.“People aren’t thinking about flu, they’re thinking about Covid,” he said.Americans are already among the most vaccinated peoples against the flu in the world: vaccination is recommended from the age of six months. Other countries, such as France, recommend it to people at risk of complications, including those 65 and older.As a result, 63 percent of children and 45 percent of adults were vaccinated in 2018-2019. In the over-65 age bracket, the figure was 68 percent.But this year, Americans might have to look at new places to receive their shots.“It’s going to be hard for people to get their flu vaccinations because they usually get it at work or at school, but many workplaces and many schools are closed,” said Gostin. Silver lining?Every year the World Health Organization and national health authorities select in February and March the four strains of influenza virus most likely to be in circulation the following winter in the northern hemisphere.Hundreds of millions of eggs -- the traditional medium for incubating viruses before inactivating them and making them into vaccines -- are delivered to laboratories, with production continuing through the spring, until syringes are filled in summer.In the United States, Sanofi carries out these processes in two factories in the states of Pennsylvania and New York. The same factories could produce a future vaccine against the coronavirus -- but for now there is no competition between the two, said Greenberg. At any rate, Washington has also given the company $2 billion to expand its production capacity.“There are no concerns for supply now,” said Dave Ross, vice president of commercial operations in North America for Seqirus, adding that the firm was working with partners to ensure adequate vial and syringe production for future Covid-19 vaccines.There are some causes for optimism. Public health practices like social distancing and mask wearing put in place to stem the coronavirus should also reduce the spread of other respiratory illnesses including the flu.“All of those things hopefully will pay dividends and there’ll be less flu around,” said Henry Bernstein, a pediatrics professor at the Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine who is on a committee advising the CDC on immunization practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-flu-shot-makers-see-record-us-production/story-3ZlHZZlW1AtJuctlStEFwK.html

16-08-2020||World||US President Donald Trump’s younger brother Robert Trump dies at 71||President Donald Trump’s younger brother, Robert Trump, a businessman known for an even keel that seemed almost incompatible with the family name, died Saturday night after being hospitalised in New York, the president said in a statement. He was 71.The president visited his brother at a New York City hospital on Friday after White House officials said he had become seriously ill.It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,” Donald Trump said in a statement. “He was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.” The youngest of the Trump siblings remained close to the 74-year-old president and, as recently as June, filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Trump family that unsuccessfully sought to stop publication of a tell-all book by the president’s niece, Mary.Robert Trump had reportedly been hospitalised in the intensive care unit for several days that same month.Both longtime businessmen, Robert and Donald had strikingly different personalities. Donald Trump once described his younger brother as “much quieter and easygoing than I am,” and “the only guy in my life whom I ever call ‘honey.’” Robert Trump began his career on Wall Street working in corporate finance but later joined the family business, managing real estate holdings as a top executive in the Trump Organization.“When he worked in the Trump Organization, he was known as the nice Trump,” Gwenda Blair, a Trump family biographer, told The Associated Press. “Robert was the one people would try to get to intervene if there was a problem.” Robert Stewart Trump was born in 1948, the youngest of New York City real estate developer Fred Trump’s five children.The president, two years older than Robert, admittedly bullied his brother in their younger years, even as he praised his loyalty and laid-back demeanor.“I think it must be hard to have me for a brother but he’s never said anything about it and we’re very close,” Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 bestseller “The Art of the Deal.”“Robert gets along with almost everyone,” he added, “which is great for me since I sometimes have to be the bad guy.” In the 1980s, Donald Trump tapped Robert Trump to oversee an Atlantic City casino project, calling him the perfect fit for the job. When it cannibalised his other casinos, though, “he pointed the finger of blame at Robert,” said Blair, author of “The Trumps: Three Generations that Built an Empire.” “When the slot machines jammed the opening weekend at the Taj Mahal, he very specifically and furiously denounced Robert, and Robert walked out and never worked for his brother again,” Blair said.A Boston University graduate, Robert Trump later managed the Brooklyn portion of father Fred Trump’s real estate empire, which was eventually sold.Once a regular boldface name in Manhattan’s social pages, Robert Trump had kept a lower profile in recent years. “He was not a newsmaker,” Blair said.Before divorcing his first wife, Blaine Trump, more than a decade ago, Robert Trump had been active on Manhattan’s Upper East Side charity circuit.He avoided the limelight during his elder brother’s presidency, having retired to the Hudson Valley. But he described himself as a big supporter of the White House run in a 2016 interview with the New York Post.“I support Donald one thousand percent,” Robert Trump said.In early March of 2020, he married his longtime girlfriend, Ann Marie Pallan.The eldest Trump sibling and Mary’s father, Fred Trump Jr., struggled with alcoholism and died in 1981 at the age of 43. The president’s surviving siblings include Elizabeth Trump Grau and Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal appeals judge.Authors Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher described Robert Trump as soft spoken but cerebral in “Trump Revealed: The Definitive Biography of the 45th President”: “He lacked Donald’s charismatic showmanship, and he was happy to leave the bravado to his brother, but he could show flashes of Trump temper.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-s-younger-brother-robert-trump-dies-at-71/story-O8wIyHPFjfRNond9yb6z8N.html
16-08-2020||World||WHO team to assist South Africa in reinforcing Covid-19 response||A World Health Organisation (WHO) surge team will assist South Africa in bolstering its national Covid-19 response, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has said.The team comprises 43 members and 16 arrived in the country on Friday.Over the last three weeks, the number of new confirmed cases in South Africa has dropped from a peak of over 12,000 a day to an average over the past week of around 5,000 a day. The recovery rate has increased from 48 per cent to 80 per cent.“We have received queries on why there would be a need for the (WHO) surge team if we are past the surge,” Mkhize said.“I would like to emphasise for our people that we are not past anything: we are still the country with the fifth highest positive cases in the world,” the minister said.South Africa, at present, has the world’s fifth largest virus caseload with over 5,79,000 confirmed cases and has reported more than 11,000 deaths, according to the tally by the Johns Hopkins University.Mkhize said apart from the impact on the health system that the coronavirus has had, “we are still faced with the devastation it has caused in our social lives, our well-being, the economy and the environment”.“With the threat of resurgence remaining very real, we would not want to repeat recent history witnessed in some countries and allow a second surge to wreak even further destruction,” he said.The WHO team will be looking at the South African situation “with fresh eyes and may be able to identify blind spots or offer a perspective we might not have considered”, the health minister said.Citing the WHO’s assistance to the country with earlier outbreaks of cholera and listeriosis, Mkhize said South Africa has a proud record of partnership with the organisation.The WHO had provided invaluable guidance during the FIFA 2010 World Cup, which coincided with the global H1N1 outbreak and threatened to scupper the football spectacle that was hosted for the first time on the African continent in 2010, he said.“Whilst the WHO name was well known and trusted, it was usually not part of everyday civilian conversation - now (because of the Covid-19 pandemic) the WHO is part of our work language, our dinner conversations, our social media banter, and a lot of arguments,” Mkhize said.“What I am most proud of is that the WHO has remained committed to all nations despite some being critical and even withdrawing sorely needed funding and resources,” the minister said. On Saturday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the National State of Disaster, which was declared in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, has been extended till September 15 in South Africa. The government, however, has lowered the nationwide lockdown to Level-2 of its five-level strategic approach to deal with the pandemic to allow economic activity to resume in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-to-assist-south-africa-in-reinforcing-covid-19-response/story-doxY8YDcajWS9yWFfov1HP.html
16-08-2020||World||American weekly magazine apologizes for op-ed questioning Harris eligibility||Newsweek has apologized for an op-ed that questioned Sen. Kamala Harris’ US citizenship and her eligibility to be Joe Biden’s running mate, a false and racist conspiracy theory which President Donald Trump has not dismissed.“This op-ed is being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize,” read Newsweek’s editor’s note on Friday, which replaced the magazine’s earlier detailed defense of the op-ed.“We entirely failed to anticipate the ways in which the essay would be interpreted, distorted and weaponized,” read the apology, signed by Josh Hammer, opinion editor, and Nancy Cooper, global editor in chief. But they ended the note by saying that the op-ed would remain on the site, with their note attached.The op-ed was written by John Eastman, a conservative attorney who argues that the US Constitution doesn’t grant birthright citizenship. Eastman sowed doubt about Harris’ eligibility based on her parents’ immigration status. Harris’ mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica.Newsweek earlier defended the piece, arguing that Eastman “was focusing on a long-standing, somewhat arcane legal debate” about the 14th Amendment and not trying to “ignite a racist conspiracy theory around Kamala Harris’ candidacy.”But the theory is false. Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements. The question is not even considered complex, according to constitutional lawyers.Trump built his political career on questioning a political opponent’s legitimacy. He was a high-profile force behind the “birther movement” — the lie that questioned whether President Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, was eligible to serve. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.Asked about the matter at the White House on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious.”Trump was asked to revisit the topic during a news conference on Saturday. He refused to say whether he believes the California-born senator does or doesn’t meet the constitutional requirements of the office he holds.“I have nothing to do with it. I read something about it,” Trump said. He added: “It’s not something that bothers me. ... It’s not something that we will be pursuing.” Asked point blank if Harris is eligible, Trump replied: “I just told you. I have not got into it in great detail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-weekly-magazine-apologizes-for-op-ed-questioning-harris-eligibility/story-K6q9C59rZTfT10hTIz3keN.html

The disease has claimed more than 766,000 lives so far.Putin’s announcement on Tuesday about the vaccine was met with caution from scientists and the World Health Organization who said it still needed a rigorous safety review.“The first batch of the novel coronavirus vaccine developed by the Gamaleya research institute has been produced,” the health ministry said on Saturday. The vaccine is called Sputnik V.With more than 915,000 infections, Russia’s caseload is fourth in the world after the United States, Brazil and India.Meanwhile, a projection by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the pandemic could claim 2,00,000 lives in the US by September 5.California on Friday became the first US state to surpass 600,000 cases and the Midwest saw several record one-day rises as some states struggled to contain the pandemic even as a few welcomed students back to school campuses.Also, thousands of British tourists beat a hasty retreat from France, packing out planes, trains and ferries to return to the UK by the early hours of Saturday morning to avoid a mandatory 14-day quarantine at home.Many British travellers in the country opted to cut short their vacations to meet the Saturday 4am deadline that had been announced the night before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-produces-first-batch-of-itscovid-19-vaccine/story-vlrYefDpWrDxcr3WvuYvQL.html
16-08-2020||World||Thousands in Belarus rally where protester died||Thousands of demonstrators in Belarus gathered on Saturday at the spot in the capital where a protester died in clashes with police, calling for President Alexander Lukashenko to resign after 26 years in power.It was the seventh consecutive day of large protests against the results of the August 9 presidential election in which election officials say Lukashenko won a sixth term in office.Despite harsh police action against the protesters, including the detention of some 7,000 people, the demonstrations have swelled into the largest and most sustained protest wave since Lukashenko took power in 1994.Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the protests in a call on Saturday, the first publicly known direct contact between the two leaders since the election. “It is important that these problems are not used by destructive forces aimed at causing injury to the cooperation of the two countries in the framework of the union state,” the Kremlin said.Russia and Belarus reached an agreement in 1997 about closer ties between the neighbouring ex-Soviet countries in a union stopping short of a full merger, although that has collided with recent disputes between the countries and Luksashenko’s suspicions that Putin’s government wants to absorb Belarus.A funeral was held on Saturday for Alexander Taraikovsky, a 34-year-old protester who died on Monday in the capital of Minsk under disputed circumstances. Belarusian police said he died when an explosive device he intended to throw at police blew up in his hand.But his partner, Elena German, said that when she saw his body in a morgue on Friday, his hands showed no damage and he had a perforation in his chest that she believes is a bullet wound.About 5,000 demonstrators gathered on Saturday in the area where Taraikovsky died. There were no immediate reports of detentions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-belarus-rally-where-protester-died/story-1MXDprzsTko3p40W6efR8N.html
16-08-2020||World||I have more Indians than she has: Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump attacked Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Friday, claiming that he has more support from Indian-origin voters than Joe Biden’s running mate.On his opponent Biden for the November 3 race, Trump said “no one will be safe in Biden’s America”, adding that California Senator Harris is a “step worse”.According to an ANI report, Trump said, “If Joe Biden would become the president, he will immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America and probably Kamala (Harris) is a step worse. She is of Indian heritage. I have more Indians than she has.”Trump took a sharp aim at Harris as being hostile towards police, suggesting that she and Biden were at the centre of “a left-wing war on cops”.He continued to criticise Biden, saying, “This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect... No one will be safe in Biden’s America.”He was speaking to members of New York City’s Police Benevolent Association (NYC PBA), which on Friday endorsed the US president’s re-election campaign.Speaking on the occasion, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani slammed Harris’ prosecutorial record, claiming that when she was attorney general, “she prosecuted little people but wouldn’t prosecute big people”.Biden, meanwhile, levelled fierce criticism at Trump, with his campaign saying the US president has resorted to “abhorrent” lies about Harris’ eligibility to be vice-president.“I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements,” Trump had said on Thursday, citing a controversial news article that questions the immigration status of Harris’ parents at the time of her birth.Trump “has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart,” Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-have-more-indians-than-she-has-donald-trump/story-9wtupt986wZmC5vb9016LO.html
