Does it justify what the police have done? Was it as per the ethical standards of policing?, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan asked additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi. The bench was hearing a bunch of pleas pertaining to the Jamia violence, seeking relief and registration of FIRs against erring police personnel.The court’s poser came after ASG Lekhi contended that the police action was warranted and the police had asked the students to maintain restrain. He said the students inside the varsity, however, got violent and started pelting stones, bricks, bottles, etc at the police.“Despite multiple warnings, students continued to pelt stones and destroy barricades,” he said.He submitted said that the unruly mob did not even spare school buses and six buses were burnt. He said the mob had blocked the roads and there was heavy stone pelting from inside the campus.“A university is supposed to have books and academics, where did all these objects come from? A university has to be a place of learning and not of violence and arson,” Lekhi said.“The objective of that mob was to overawe the law with the use of criminal force,” he said, while adding that the facts squarely fit into the definition of an unlawful assembly, and hence the police action was warranted.Following arguments, the court posted the matter for further hearing to September 18.Violence has broken out in the varsity after student protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Police have been accused of entering the university campus and assaulting students after a protest against the Citizenship(Amendment) Act turned violent on December 15.At least 10 vehicles were allegedly torched by protesters. The Jamia students had said they were not involved in the violence and that their peaceful march was hijacked by outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/was-police-action-in-jamia-proportionate-high-court-asks-asg/story-2hrxBl4SlOgWY9tm0SgEcL.html

They said she escaped serious injuries as the slab from the second floor fell mostly on a beam which deflected it from directly contacting the woman.According to the police, the incident took place around 11.30 am when the woman, Mandakini Kaul, was standing in the rear balcony on the first floor of her house. Her children and her husband were in the adjacent rooms. No one was on the second floor of the house.The police said the entire second floor balcony, over nine-feet long and at least five-feet wide, along with its grille, fell on the first-floor balcony where Kaul stood. The fallen slab took the first-floor balcony, along with Kaul, to the ground with a thud. Several labourers, who were working nearby, and residents in the area rushed to the house and pulled her out.A police officer, requesting anonymity, said, “We received a call from the police control room and rushed to the area. Though she was caught underneath the rubble, she escaped any serious injuries. The beams created a gap somehow which prevented a major injury. When the woman was pulled out and was in the ambulance, she was stable. She suffered some bruises on her feet and is currently undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Sushant Lok 1. The doctors have declared her unfit for giving a statement since they are running some tests on her.”Jagbir Singh, station house officer (SHO), Sector 29, said, “The woman did not have any external injuries. Her statement is yet to be recorded. The incident took place in Palm Avenue in DLF Phase 4. It is an independent house. ” According to private developer DLF, the colony does not belong to them.The police did not receive any complaint in the matter.A team of fire department officials had also visited the spot. Deepanshu Mehlawat, fire station officer, Sector 29, said, “The woman sustained minor injuries. She was conscious at the time we reached the area and was pulled out with the help of residents and passersby.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/45-year-old-woman-injured-after-balcony-collapses-in-gurugram-s-dlf-phase-4/story-Q0UUfCd5WjDTo1O3cSSpjP.html
28-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Public gatherings, parties behind recent spurt in Covid cases, say officials||With the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) increasing in the city, the district administration has called the current situation a “wake-up call” for citizens. According to the administration, infection is once again on the rise as people have started organising and attending public gatherings and parties and are not following rules of social distancing.Health officials said that contact tracing in many of the newly detected Covid-19 cases shows that in some instances, family members are turning out to be positive after attending a social function or a private gathering. Gurugram Police, however, said that they have been taking action against people who are organising parties, violating social distancing norms.Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri on Friday, while addressing the media at Mini Secretariat, said, “There is an upward trend in the Covid-19 cases in the district. More than 100 new cases are being reported every day, which was not the situation a few weeks back. It is a wake-up call for people to maintain social distancing and avoid private or public gatherings.” In Gurugram, 126 new cases were reported on Friday, taking the overall count of infected persons to 11,555. Out of these, at least 973 are active cases, while 10,450 have recovered from the illness. The Covid-19 toll stands at 132, while the fatality rate stand at 1.15%. The growth rate of new infection has climbed up to 1.2%. It has also led a drop in the doubling rate from 104 days earlier to 81 days this week.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The positivity rate of the district is maintained at 6.77% but infectivity is increasing, especially among people who are moving out and attending functions or gatherings. In one Large Outbreak Region ( LOR), our team came across a case where 15 people from a family got infected on the same day.” To tackle the cases, Yadav, who was also present at the meet, said that the health department will focus upon proper 14-day quarantine of people who have come in contact with infected people. “If there is a need to admit people in a Covid Care Centre, we would even do that to break the chain of transmission. Also, more symptomatic cases will be identified, tested and isolated,” said Yadav. Gurugram police, on the other hand, said that they have been taking strict action against people who are organising these parties and functions in the present phase of Unlock. “Eighty people, who were found partying and drinking in public places, have been arrested till now,” said K K Rao, commissioner of police. “Special teams have been formed who are keeping check on party venues. Anyone found organising parties will be arrested. Party organisers are on the police radar and the cyber cell is keeping a tab on social media to see if anyone is promoting any page for a night party,” said Rao. He also said that people partying in Gurugram are mostly from Delhi and Noida and get in touch with party organisers on social media. People are still posting online advertisements for weekend parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-public-gatherings-parties-behind-recent-spurt-in-covid-cases-say-officials/story-EMHcSkCNzgTuOG1O85PmHO.html

The Supreme Court had issued stern warnings then to the state governments and did so again this week to Haryana.The two “luxurious” farmhouses had come up illegally in the Bandhwari village of the Aravallis, along with 17 others that were demolished too over the last three days.One official from the department town and country planing, which along with the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) oversaw the demolition, described it as “spread over two acres, with swimming pools and large lawns”.“In one, we found around 400 plates and assorted crockery usually found in hotels. The rooms were furnished and equipped like commercial property and even a spa was part of the establishment,” said the official who did not wish to be named.The two farmhouses were large and well built that the authorities had to call for heavier earthmovers than the usual ones that are usually deployed during demolition drives. RS Bhath, district town planner, said though no one was found living in these farmhouses, they met the owner of one large farmhouse. “They came on and off to take care of the property,” he said.MCG joint commissioner Hari Om Atri said, “These two farmhouses were huge and it took an entire day to demolish these structures. A large boundary wall in acres built by a school was also demolished as it was illegal.”Bhath said that with Friday’s operation, all illegal farmhouses in the area were demolished. “We are now analysing the violations that were carried out by the developer as per urban areas act and municipal act so that a police case is registered against the developer,” he said.The authorities did not offer comment on how these large farmhouses came to be without their knowledge.The DTCP official said that a formal report on the demolition drive would be submitted to the deputy commissioner of Gurugram. “As per the directions of the government 19 farmhouses in various stages of construction, boundary walls, plinths and related constructions were demolished in the last three days. The director of DTCP has also been apprised of the action taken. A police complaint would also be lodged against the accused after compiling the violations as per different departments,” he said.Earlier on Thursday, Vinay Pratap Singh, MCG commisioner had said the Haryana chief secretary had ordered the demolition. “We will also work on collaboration with forest department and based on their recommendations take all steps to restore the forest in the area,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-large-farmhouses-worth-crores-demolished-in-protected-aravallis/story-E6uQ6JUykHZ7Zbqk1fBJyO.html

The councillors of the civic body took this decision in a House meeting on Friday. The committee will comprise five councillors and five officials from MCG’s engineering wing, said officials familiar with the matter. The development comes just a week after three underpasses on GCR were inundated, following two days of heavy rain. Further, basements and ground floors of houses in sectors 27 and 28 were also flooded.The House meeting took place at a community centre in Sector 27. It was the second meeting to take place since the outbreak of Covid-19, and the first where councillors and officials were physically present. The last House meeting was held via video conference. RS Rathee, councillor of Ward 34, had raised the agenda for discussing the drainage situation, following which, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh announced for the formation of the committee.“At both GCR as well as sectors 27 and 28, there is an absence of open drains that resulted in heavy waterlogging last week. The committee will closely examine the carrying capacity and the condition of existing drainage lines, along with the stretches where such lines are completely absent. It will also identify spots where new lines need to be laid on a priority basis,” said Rathee, who added that, by next week, the names of the 10 councillors and MCG officials will be finalised.Singh also said that the committee will closely work with the recently formed flood control committee of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). The GMDA committee comprises officials from GMDA, MCG, private developer DLF, and Haryana Shahri Vikas Prahikaran (HSVP) and is meant to propose both short-term and long-term solutions waterlogging problems in the city. “The MCG committee will work in tandem with the flood control committee. After a month of observation, they will submit their findings, based on which solutions would be found for the existing drainage issues,” said Singh.Following the heavy floods last week, GMDA has installed four large capacity motor pumps on GCR, and one each in sectors 27 and 28. MCG chief engineer Raman Sharma also announced that a private firm headed by former HSVP chief engineer KK Bhugra is preparing a detailed drainage plan for sectors 27 and 28. Another key agenda discussed during the meeting was MCG’s sapling drive.The civic body had a set a target of planting nearly 1.25 lakh saplings during this monsoons season. During the meeting, Singh announced that so far, more than 75,000 saplings have been planted across the city. The remaining saplings will be planted next month.Councillors also sought an update regarding the status of taking over of various private colonies. To this, MCG’s planning branch officials said that the civic body has requested the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to submit copies of approved service plan designs and estimates for Ardee City, Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Uppal Southend, Rosewood City, and Mayfield Garden. Following this, a deficiency assessment survey would be initiated by the civic body in these colonies.Councillors told MCG officials that Sushant Lok 2 and 3 should also be added to this list and, in the future, the transfer process of all eight colonies should be undertaken together.An agenda for developing an urban forest around the vacant plots reclaimed by MCG from encroachers in Sikanderpur last month was also passed unanimously. Meanwhile Singh directed officials to stop illegal garbage collection in Sushant Lok 1, seize illegal garbage collection vehicles in the area, and file a case against the violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-form-committee-to-address-drainage-issues-in-golf-course-road-sectors-27-and-28/story-w2nVH1zCsLITqMQWiNgJ8K.html
28-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Community volunteers to help school students get access to smart phones for online classes||The directorate of school education is planning to launch an initiative that seeks to bridge the digital divide, by appointing community volunteers who’ll ensure that students who don’t have access to smart phones can remain in touch with their teachers.As a part of the initiative, titled ‘Shiksha Mitr’, teachers would need to identify one member from the student’s family or the neighbourhood with an internet-enabled smart phone. The owner of the phone will then share it with the student for a certain duration of the day so that he or she can be in touch with the teachers for the online classes. The department has directed all teachers to identify and register a Shiksha Mitr for every student in their class. Additionally, teachers are also supposed to carry out local awareness campaigns so that students as well as the community are aware of the role of these volunteers.In a directive shared with district education officers on Thursday, the department said that each teacher would need to ensure that one Shiksha Mitr is assigned to every student who doesn’t have access to digital devices for online classes. “In order to minimise the digital divide among students of government schools, it is recommended that a Shiksha Mitra is assigned to every student to ensure that they are connected to their teachers and the department’s e-learning initiatives,” the department stated in its directive, which is yet to be communicated with the teachers of the students. As per the department’s directive, a Shiksha Mitr can be any parent, sibling, relative, neighbour or community volunteer, who has an internet-enabled smart phone and is in a position to lend the phone to the student daily for some time. Asha Miglani, principal of Government Model Sanskriti Senior Secondary School, Sector 43, said there were students who either didn’t have access to smart phones or were struggling with internet connections. “While students in middle school can still reach out to their classmates to keep a tab on lessons, connecting with students of primary classes has been relatively difficult during the lockdown. While we have been encouraging them to borrow phones from neighbours or parents for lessons, there has been a significant lag in learning. Through the new initiative, we are hoping to cover all students in a more formal manner,” said Miglani.Sangeeta Chaudhary, district elementary education officer-cum-district project coordinator, said that teachers had been facing issues since the online database for registering details was under stress. “There are certain households where students don’t have a TV or a mobile phone. In other households, only one parent has a mobile phone. As parents were home during the complete lockdown, children could access smart phones but since people are getting back to work now, children are not able to log in as regularly as before. Keeping these issues in mind, we decided to designate community volunteers for students,” said Chaudhary.Manjubala, an English teacher at the Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that while directions regarding the new initiative had not been shared so far, these volunteers were expected to act as a bridge between the school and students. “Some students have been facing access issues due to the lack of smartphones at home. So far, we had been making calls and asking such students to take notes from other children in their neighbourhood. With the new initiative, we hope to get support from local volunteers who will share their smartphone with our students on a daily basis. This will, hopefully, ensure regular engagement with lessons,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-community-volunteers-to-help-school-students-get-access-to-smart-phones-for-online-classes/story-MMzJXr9UWR8qJB2MyNlD6O.html

The victim, Surendra Kumar Bansal, lost the money in more than 100 bank transactions over a period of 10 months, his family members and lawyer said. The police have registered an FIR against nine suspects and are investigating the case, a senior police official said on Friday. Bansal, a retired official from a private firm, lost all his retirement savings and also the money borrowed from his two daughters. Vandana Agarwal, one of his daughters, had filed a complaint with the cyber cell of the Noida police. “My father had some retirement savings. In January last year, he received a dubious call from the suspect, Jagmohan Shukla, who pretended to be an official from the ministry of finance. He said that my father’s insurance policies have matured and money is due. But he conditioned that the money would be released after making some payment,” Vandana, who lives in Singapore, said. The senior citizen got convinced and transferred ₹2 lakh in the given bank account on February 1, 2019. However, the gang members perceived Bansal as vulnerable and started demanding more money citing different terms and conditions. In the next few months, nine suspects – Jagmohan Shukla, Seema Aggarwal, Punam, Pratibha Agarwal, Shyamlal Gupta, Savitri Mahajan, Swami, Vandana, and Khurana – repeatedly called Bansal pretending as insurance company officials or bank officials and extracted the money. The transaction details showed that from ₹2-10 lakh was transferred in each transaction, Vandana said, adding that she transferred ₹18 lakh in her father’s bank account on his request in July last year. “I believed he may have some work, and did not discuss the matter. Later, I was talking to my sister who revealed that she had also transferred ₹28 lakh to our father’s account sometime back. Then I got suspicious,” she said. Vandana said she arrived in Noida in November last year and got to know about the fraud. She then contacted a lawyer and filed a police complaint. Jaikush Hoon, the victim’s lawyer, said that when we enquired about the transactions, we came to know that the money was transferred in the accounts of some shell companies in Rajasthan, Delhi, Dehradun, Karnal, etc. “The suspects duped ₹2.63 crore in 101 transactions between February and November last year. The suspects had also sent a forged bank draft named on Bansal and mentioning ₹3.55 crore via email, and demanded more money to release it,” he said. Hoon said that he had filed a complaint against the cyber fraud in November last year, but did not get any update. A complaint was also filed with the Noida police on July 28 this year, he said.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that primary investigation in the matter was conducted by the DCP (headquarters), who directed the Sector 20 police to register an FIR. “Based on the complaint, a case has been registered against nine suspects under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (breach of trust) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code. After the investigation, action will be taken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/senior-citizen-loses-2-63-crore-in-insurance-fraud-police-book-nine-suspects/story-jg0JYZ3HewwTQX9RdJbiPP.html
28-08-2020||City||Farmers demand full compensation before handing over land for Noida airport||Farmers, whose land is earmarked for the Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar, along the Yamuna Expressway, are demanding the entire land compensation amount before giving possession of their land for the project.They said they will not give possession of their land if the Gautam Budh Nagar administration does not resolve their demands related with land compensation.“The administration paid the compensation for the agricultural land to acquire the area for the airport. But it is yet to compensate for the tubewell, trees, crops and other benefits that they had promised. Our demand is that they pay up the first compensation for tubewell, trees and other benefits such as Rs 5.5 lakh for each farmer, before taking possession,” said Balbhadar Singh, a Ranhera village farmer, who has given 100 bigha of land for the airport.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has acquired 1,334 hectares under phase 1 out of the total 5,000 hectares required for the airport project. Work on the first phase of the airport is likely to start soon after the Covid 19 crisis is over. The project is scheduled to be operational by 2023 if all goes as per plan.Going by the compensation decided by the state, if a farmer accepts Rs 2,300 per square metres then the government will provide them a 50 square metres residential plot and R5 lakh for construction purposes. If the farmer does not want a plot and R 5 lakh perk then they can accept Rs 2,500 per square metres rate. There are many farmers who opted for the first plan and need Rs5 lakh for construction of their houses.“The administration is not paying Rs 5 lakh before taking possession of their land. And the administration is also hell bent on destroying the standing crop without waiting for the yield. Farmers will continue to resist the administration’s move of taking over the land,” said Ajay Singh, a farmer of Dayanatpur village.The administration, meanwhile, said all issues of the farmers are being resolved properly.“We have decided to set up camps in villages to address their grievances related to land compensation. We will address all issues of farmers in the next two weeks’ time via these camps. And farmers are not resisting or protesting; they just want to discuss the issues that they have. We are discussing all issues to resolve them as per rules,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-demand-full-compensation-before-handing-over-land-for-noida-airport/story-uP01Z4xGxfW4NuVOOX1luJ.html
28-08-2020||Gurugram||Man challenges Gurugram police to catch him, behind bars in 7 hrs||Seven hours after a man challenged the Gurugram city police to find him claiming he was all but untraceable, they did.On August 26, a Sector 18 resident had filed a missing person complaint at the Sector 17/18 police station, stating that his wife had not returned after having left for work a day earlier. The police registered a case under Section 346 (wrongful confinement). He had not named any suspects.The same day, the man received a phone call from his wife’s colleague 30-year-old Krishan Kumar, who is from Rajasthan’s Sikar. “He allegedly told him that his wife was with him,” said Subhash Boken, spokesperson for the city police.Soon enough, the man passed on this information to Sector 17/18 station house officer (SHO) Sudhir Kumar, who told him to join the investigation. “Then he boasted that he could not be found and challenged the police to find him before cutting the call,” said the spokesperson.The police team traced his phone number.Boken said, “The police traced and raided his suspected location in Aliyar, Manesar, but he was not there. He had procured a SIM card from a local retailer in Manesar using forged documents. The police arrested the retailer, who confessed that he had sold the SIM card to Kumar on a fake ID. After further probe, police traced his location to a hotel in Rewari.”The police said there too, Kumar and the woman had given fake documents at the time of checking in at the hotel.“Kumar was arrested on Wednesday within seven hours of him challenging the police to locate him. The man’s wife and he are colleagues. They said that they thought since they had procured the SIM card using fake addresses and had given forged documents at the hotel, no one would be able to trace them,” said Boken. “But we did,” he added. Kumar, the woman and the SIM card retailer, identified as Santosh Kumar, were all arrested and booked under forgery and other related sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-challenges-gurugram-police-to-catch-him-behind-bars-in-7-hrs/story-C3LZ981PEz2Z6zbUl7FhxL.html

The screening process of the 1,200 applicants will take place between September 1 and 10 across various estates of the district. HSVP officials said they will go through the submissions of all the applicants carefully to determine whether they are eligible for the oustees quota or not. As per HSVP rules, a landowner, who had to give up over 75% land in an estate and who is shown to be the proprietor of the land in revenue records is entitled to a plot. Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP Gurugram, said that screening would be conducted by a committee, comprising the senior town planner, the district town planner, the land acquisition officer, estate officers to ensure that all applicants in a particular zone are heard and their applications are processed. “After deciding upon the claims of the applicants, recommendations would be sent to Chandigarh for approval. Once the nod comes from headquarters, a draw of lots would be held to allot plots to the eligible applicants,” Yadav said, adding that, during the hearing, the size of the plot to be given to the oustees will also be decided as per the HSVP policy. As per the policy, the landowners who are eligible for these plots will also be given a discount by the authority to buy the same. Around 1,200 applicants have applied for plots under the oustees quota online. Claims of those who have applied for the same manually are not being considered. Yadav said that claims of those landowners who applied for the plots through an offline mode would not be considered. The amount they have deposited with the authority would also be refunded.As per HSVP officials, next in the agenda is to settle the claims of allottees seeking alternative plots. HSVP is settling the claims to the oustees on a priority basis so that it can secure a free hand in auctioning its residential and commercial properties in the district — a process that is currently stuck due to multiple court cases, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-to-screen-settle-claims-of-1-200-oustees-between-september-1-and-10/story-gAWIp4g0DpinlwnyIk5ISI.html
28-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Malls, shops to shut on Mondays and Tuesdays now, instead of weekends||Gurugram: Instead of weekends, all shopping malls and shops, except those dealing with essential goods and services, will now stay closed on Mondays and Tuesdays in urban areas, as per a revised order issued by the Haryana government on Friday.On August 21, the government had ordered that all public and private offices, malls, markets, and shops should remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays in a bid to control the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. Although there was no restriction on traffic movement, traders in the city had said their businesses would be hit by the decision and had protested against it earlier this week.The latest order comes after the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) reconsidered the matter and released fresh orders on closing only malls and shops in market places of urban areas of Haryana on the two weekdays. Public and private offices, however, won’t be closed on these days. The directive was issued by Keshani Anand Arora, chief secretary, who is also the chairperson of the state executive committee under SDMA. The decision comes at a time when Covid-19 tally in Haryana has crossed 60,596 and at least 661 deaths till Friday, according to the daily state health bulletin.“There is no bar on opening shops and shopping malls on Saturday and Sunday in these areas,” reads the order. “The decision was taken to revive the economy which has already been hit hard by the national lockdown for months. Even before the lockdown, most of the shops used to be closed either on Monday or Tuesday. By closing markets and malls, the urban local body will get time to properly sanitise these areas,” said a senior official privy to the matter, requesting not to be named. In a press statement issued from state capital Chandigarh, the government said these directives shall remain in force till further orders.According to the official quoted above, the state home department is not happy with the move but the decision was taken as the country is in the unlock phase whereby businesses and industries are opening up. The decision to keep shops closed on weekends was declared by state home minister Anil Vij on Twitter on the evening of August 21. Many expressed their disgruntlement on platforms run by social media companies citing how businesses are suffering terribly, difficulty in getting back to normalcy and the burden of retaining employees.The decision of weekend lockdown was also opposed by restaurant owners, although they are now allowed to serve alcohol at the table after getting their liquor licenses renewed. Restaurant owners said they would be running in losses if the weekend lockdown is not lifted as they earn their maximum revenue during the weekend.Shopping malls and market associations in Gurugram, meanwhile, felt encouraged with the government’s move. “Even during normal days, before the pandemic struck, buyers hardly rushed to shops on Mondays and Tuesdays, so closing shops on these two days won’t affect business much. The crowd is almost four times more on Saturdays and Sundays than weekdays, and keeping establishments on weekend days is good for business,” said Aman Bajaj, member, Metropolitan Mall Association. According to him, last weekend, due to closing of malls in Gurugram, people went to malls in South Delhi.Harinder Rana, president, Palam Vyapar Kendra Market Association, also welcomed the move. “Generally, shops in our area are closed on Tuesdays.

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown effect: Restrictions, police presence block drug supply in Chandigarh||Restrictions on inter-state movement and increased police presence on the ground seems to have snapped the drug supply chain in the city as the number of cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in the city has come down drastically this year. As per the Chandigarh police records, only 100 NDPS cases have so far been registered in different police stations of the city since January this year. This is also the lowest number of drug cases registered in the last five years. The city had seen 226 drug cases in the first eight months of 2019, 167 cases in 2018, 244 cases in 2017, 144 cases in 2016, and 173 in 2015. Acting senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vineet Kumar said, “We had managed to break the supply chain of the drugs and even arrested a few big suppliers in 2019. There has been a consistent effort by the police to not allow peddlers to build their supply chain again.” He added, “The increased patrolling owing to the pandemic, restrictions on interstate movement and night curfew have also worked as deterrents to drug peddling.” 101 ARRESTED SINCE JANUARY As per the UT police, as many as 34 persons were arrested in 31 drug cases in March, April and May, when complete lockdown was in place. Since January, 101 persons were arrested under the NDPS Act, of which 11 were women drug peddlers. SUPPLY OF VIALS REGISTERED DIP Medicinal drugs, such as injections of Buprenorphine, Pheniramine Maleate, are popular owing to easy availability and low cost. This year police recovered 529 such banned vials from addicts. In 2019, a total of 1,633 vials were recovered while in 2018, 4,193 vials were seized. Heroin and opium recoveries have also seen a dip this year. As per police records, 1.5kg heroin was recovered this year as compared to 3.1kg in 2019 and 1.4 kg in 2018. The opium recovery stood at 500gm this year against 934gm in 2019 and 3.9kg in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-effect-restrictions-police-presence-block-drug-supply-in-chandigarh/story-sIhTavUqfWKFnxBJEEgebM.html
28-08-2020||City||Only 10% of RT-PCR samples getting tested in Ghaziabad’s new lab||In absence of sufficient resources, Ghaziabad’s only laboratory for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, is presently testing only around 10% of samples meant for RT-PCR testing for Covid-19 daily in the district. Made operational on August 14, the RT-PCR lab at MMG district hospital—which was supposed to help enhance testing capacity in the district— has only been able to process nearly 90 samples everyday, said officials.Till August 26, the lab had tested only 1,203 samples (out of which 32 tested positive) even as 800-900 samples are collected for RT-PCR testing—considered the gold-standard method for Covid-19 testing—in the district everyday. Around 90% of these samples are still being sent outside the district for Covid-19 testing and results of the tests sometimes take as long as five days to come, health department officials said.Till August 27, the district was waiting for a total of 2,667 RT-PCR test reports. The district collects a total of nearly 3,000-3500 samples daily, of which around more than 2,100-2,600 samples are tested through rapid anitgen testing kits and rest through RT-PCR testing.The MMG district hospital authorities said fewer tests are being conducted at the RT-PCR lab as they don’t have the necessary equipment that enables faster testing of samples for Covid-19. “The new laboratory is conducting around 90 tests per day, and we can test about 1,000 samples in the future if we get an RNA extraction machine ( a machine which extracts ribonucleic acid from the samples for the RT-PCR machine to study the viral load to confirm the presence of coronavirus) . At present, the work for RNA extraction is taking place manually at the lab. We have apprised the concerned authorities (district health department) about the need for RNA extractor,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of MMG district hospital.“We are also awaiting one of our non-medical scientists to join duties at the lab. Once we get an RNA extraction machine and the scientist joins the lab, we can process at least 1,000 per day. Currently, we are testing samples collectedat the sampling centre at the hospital itself,” he added.A lion share of the samples collected for RT-PCR testing in the district continue to be sent to Noida, Delhi and Meerut as the testing capacities district’s sole lab remain underutilised. “Since the new laboratory is not testing many samples, majority of our RT-PCR samples are sent to laboratories in Noida and even outside districts. These are about 700-800 samples (out of 800-900 collected daily) which we send everyday to labs outside Ghaziabad and then wait for the reports to come which take two to five days. If the new laboratory at MMG starts testing more, our samples can be tested in Ghaziabad itself,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“The MMG Hospital authorities have told us verbally about the requirement of an RNA extractor. We have asked them to submit a written proposal for the same. Once this is done, we can forward the demand for the machine to the district committee,” the CMO added.Earlier, this month the Uttar Pradesh government had provided contingency funds of about ₹5 crore to different districts, including Ghaziabad, having more than 25 lakh population. The funds are sanctioned at the district level to meet Covid-19 related requirements including the purchase of consumables and equipment among others. A district committee, headed by the district magistrate, decides on how the funds are to be utilised. As the district’s sole RT-PCR testing lab fails to make a major contribution in enhancing testing capacities, the district continues to rely heavily on rapid antigen kits for Covid-19 testing. Till August 27, out of total of 184,193 tests conducted around 57.55% of tests (106,013) were conducted using the less-sensitive on-site kits.On Thursday, the UP government-appointed nodal officer, Senthil Pandian C, during a review with district officials meeting had directed that the administration should enhance the RT-PCR testing in comparison to rapid antigen kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-10-of-rt-pcr-samples-getting-tested-in-ghaziabad-s-new-lab/story-hTHuqnWYomepn286WctskN.html

Her husband and mother-in-law were arrested for allegedly harassing her, police officers said.According to the police, they found a video in the victim’s mobile phone in which she is saying that she was harassed, officers said. “We have registered a first information report and arrested her mother-in-law and husband,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). Based on a complaint by the victim’s parents, the police registered a first information report against the two suspects under sections 304b (dowry death) and 398a (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as levied provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The first information report was registered at Vijay Nagar police station. Ghaziabad does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and 011-23389090 from SUMAITRI (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-woman-ends-life-blames-in-laws-in-video/story-1P4yYAoCGkBvhDBMejxAbL.html
28-08-2020||City||NHAI plans automatic registration plate readers for cashless travel on Delhi-Meerut Expressway||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has planned cashless fare deduction for the 60km stretch of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) and a proposal has been mooted for the installation of ‘automatic number plate readers (ANPRs)’ at all the six entry/exit points near Akshardham in Delhi and Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh. The DME project spans 8.7km in phase 1 from Akshardham to UP Gate; 19.28km in phase 2 from UP Gate to Dasna; and 31.78km in phase 4 from Dasna to Meerut which is a dedicated access-controlled expressway. The NHAI officials said the exit/entry points will be Akshardham, Indirapuram, near ABES College, Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Bhojpur in Ghaziabad and the final one at Partapur in Meerut. “We have proposed installation of ANPRs at all entry/exit points. The device will read the vehicle’s front and rear number plates at the entry point and calculate the fare when the vehicle arrives at the exit point. The fare will automatically be deducted from the wallet account of the commuter. For this, commuters will have to register like they did for Fastags,” Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI, said. “In case the vehicle has a non-standard registration plate, the exit gates will not open. In such a case, the commuter will have to pay in cash and that too for the entire 60km stretch, irrespective of from where (s)he got on. The systems will be installed in November for phase 1, which is an operational phase, and in December for phase 2 and phase 4 once the construction work is complete. A proposal has also been sent to headquarters and it is likely to get cleared,” he said. The officials said the fare will be charged according to the per kilometre of distance travelled by the vehicle. At present, officials estimate that the DME from Delhi to Meerut will cater to about 48,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day. The phase 1 caters to about 1.2 lakh PCUs while the phase 2 is expected to cater to about 60,000 PCUs per day. The DME stretch from Delhi to Meerut will have total of 14 lanes of which six towards the centre will be dedicated as an expressway while the outer four lanes on each side will be dedicated as highway lanes and will not be chargeable for local commuters. The phase 3 from Dasna to Hapur is also operational and having one toll plaza at Pilkhuwa. The previous toll plaza from Dasna in Ghaziabad was shifted to Pilkhuwa after the stretch became operational on September 30, 2019. The two phases -- phase 2 and phase 4 -- of the DME are under construction and are likely to be ready by the end of the year. According to officials, the phase 4 is about 73% ready while the phase 2 is about 83% complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nhai-plans-automatic-registration-plate-readers-for-cashless-travel-on-delhi-meerut-expressway/story-lXIK41VMOgnywT6nhCUfRN.html

Now, due to the new restrictions, half of the shops are open for just three days in a week and the remaining only two. How will traders pay rent, loan instalments and salaries?” he questioned.The Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) has also opposed the odd-even rule. “If the government really wants to break the chain of infection, a lockdown can be announced for an entire week. But, the odd-even rule is only disturbing the business environment,” said Gurmeet Singh Kular, president, FICO. Body’s senior vice-president Manjinder Singh Sachdeva said,“How can traders survive when they are allowed to open shops only for 16 or 24 hours a week?” The odd-even rule had also confused customers, say shopkeepers. “All shops should be allowed to remain open for a limited number of days,” said president of the Chaura Bazaar Shopkeepers Association, Parampal Singh Witty.Babanpreet Singh, who has a shop in Ghumar Mandi, said,“Our savings are depleting quickly. The government should pay heed to our problems, else this slowdown will result in large scale-unemployment.” Some market associations, including those in Ghumar Mandi and Mall Road, have suggested that only shops on one side of a road be allowed to remain open on a certain day. This way, shops in one row can remain on one day and the opposite row on the next day, they said. “This will at least help allay confusion among the customers about which shop they can visit,” said Pawan Batra, president of the Ghumar Mandi Market Association.FIVE SHOPKEEPERS BOOKED Meanwhile, since August 24, when the odd-even rule was enforced, the Division Number 8 police have registered five FIRs against shopkeepers in Ghumar Mandi for violating the norms. The FIRs have been registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC. FIRs are also being registered against shopkeepers who keep their shops open after 6.30pm ahead of the night curfew that begins at 7pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odd-even-rule-financial-uncertainty-taking-toll-on-mental-health-say-ludhiana-traders/story-DczyayVevgxQa51wCmKbnL.html

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||RWAs in Chandigarh threaten to surrender parks over delay in payment of maintenance fee||Many residents welfare associations (RWAs) in Chandigarh are threatening to surrender parks being maintained by them, claiming that the municipal corporation (MC) hasn’t paid their maintenance fee since June. The RWAs said they are having to dig into their own pockets to pay salaries of gardeners and sweepers.There are around 1,800 neighborhood parks in Chandigarh, of which almost 700 are maintained by the RWAs. They are paid ₹2.48 per square meter, and the rates haven’t been revised since 2013.Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri said many RWAs have complained to him about these charges. “Around 20 RWAs have come forward and said they are ready to surrender the parks if payment doesn’t come through. We will take a collective call and approach MC officials regarding this on Monday,” he said. Puri added that they have already written two letters to the MC asking them to release funds, but no action has been taken.President of the Sector 21-B RWA, Kuldeep Singh Gill, said, “We are ready to surrender the park maintained by us. However, as all RWAs facing this problem, we need to do this together. The MC will not be affected if just one or two RWAs surrender the parks.” President of the Sector 38 A and B RWA, Joginder Singh, said that although he was in favour of surrendering the park for the same reason, the RWA has no other alternative. “Once the MC starts maintaining the park, they will hire contractors for sweeping, cleaning grass and weed cutting. This has failed in the other parks they maintain and we don’t want ours to get neglected the same way,” he said, adding that park maintenance fee for April was received by them in July.Rajinder Garg, president of the Sector 46-A RWA, said that they have already surrendered the park being maintained by them, owing to the delayed payments. “We surrendered the park being maintained by our RWA around ten days back. We are still helping to maintain the park because the MC hasn’t taken the initiative. Those maintained by the MC have overgrown grass and aren’t pruned enough. Further, the civic body’s memo to impose tax deducted on source (TDS) on our park maintenance payment wasn’t acceptable,” he said.Meanwhile, municipal officials said payments are being made as per protocol. A senior official from the horticulture wing, said, “We have not received any complaints regarding payment of maintenance fee. There is no fund crunch and we have been paying RWAs as per protocol.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rwas-in-chandigarh-threaten-to-surrender-parks-over-delay-in-payment-of-maintenance-fee/story-OJ7wOqQzU8JUSjIMZU23iK.html

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: To improve Swachh Survekshan rankings, make haste, clear waste||Blame game takes it tollHaving failed to work out a solution with the Jaypee Group,the municipal corporation authorities are not taking the blame for the huge amount of mixed garbage at Dadumajra, which fouls up the air in a 10-kilometre radius around it. One way out of the mess is that residents should use wet waste for composting. The existing limited installed capacity of the Dadumajra plant can be to some extent be sorted out if waste is segregated at source. MC must get its act together and ensure the entire garbage does not get mixed in transit and offloaded as such at the disposal site. The MC commissioner hopes that things will get sorted out by October, so we have to wait and watch and hope for improvements in the city’s rankings next year. SC LuthraControl waste, let locals take responsibilityThere is a saying: “Charity begins at home. We the residents are also to be blamed for throwing waste in the open and not segregating at source. Stray cattle and dogs can be seen in all residential areas, defecating on roads, parks and other public places. MC authorities are not taking any drastic measures to control this menace. Apart from cleanliness of the area, waste management is the need of the hour. Residents must cooperate with authorities and ensure that waste is not discarded in public places like gardens, roads, nullahs, drains, etc. MC authorities should work on a war footing and ensure that waste is disposed of regularly as per norms and not allowed to to accumulate at collection centres set up by MC authorities. Col TBS Bedi (retd), ChandigarhAwareness programmes for clean, green city a mustWaste management is the key to ‘swachh bharat’, and that is where the tricity, especially Chandigarh, has been failing repeatedly. The private door-to-door waste collection model has not worked. The MC has failed miserably on the three R’s of waste management: Reduce, reuse and recycle, and MC commissioner KK Yadav is as usual blaming citizens, resident welfare associations and his own staff. The garbage dumping scenario is getting worse each passing day. The Sehaj Safai Kendra’s (SSKs) are in a bad state and the arrangement between the Jaypee garbage processing plant at Dadumajra and the MC has fallen through. Toxins such as dioxins and furans are being released into the atmosphere. The compost unit has operational deficiencies. Instead of treating effluents the Jaypee plant caused serious pollution. The processing capacity does not have the capacity to handle garbage from the city and its disposal is a matter of concern. Though the Chandigarh Pollution Control Board could not resolve issues, the National Green Tribunal took cognisance of the matter in March 2019 and the UT administration submitted a compliance report on solid, plastic and biomedical waste management, outlining steps taken for air quality control. It specified that by June 1, 2019, systems should be in place, which was revised to September 2019, but till date, a year later, nothing concrete has been done at the ground level. There are fines in place for littering and dumping unprocessed construction/ demolition waste in low lying areas, landfills and public places, but implementation is a problem. Creating awareness by conducting road shows, multimedia campaigns, visiting schools and educating children and making them aware about how to keep our city ‘clean and green’, have to be ongoing exercises.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurRWAs, authorities have to work togetherThe City Beautiful cannot make it to the top rung in cleanliness programmes until the citizens, RWAs and the administration work together. It is the people of the city who can only take this initiative and decide whether they want to live in a clean city or not. Once they make up their minds putting a good plan in place will not be a problem. Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh.Take a page from the Indore modelIt is the joint responsibility of the residents as well as the MC to keep the city clean, with the former taking firm measures to stop littering and instead dumping garbage only at the assigned spots. Segregating waste is most important. Those found littering or defecating in the open and not segregating waste should be fined immediately. Public toilets have to be cleaned regularly and kept open on all seven days – sometimes they are locked on Sundays. Sweeping of the roads should be done at night. Look at how well Indore has been faring in the rankings, MC should do everything possible to adopt that model. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliStudents, local leaders should take chargeFixing responsibility is a way to ensure the city’s cleanliness, but overpopulation, internal MC politics and the issue of sorting out the waste management issue is leading to problems. Holding MC employees accountable for a slip in rankings should be done when all other steps have failed. Locals, especially private persons such as students and local leaders should take charge and ensure no one litters. Budget for waste management should also be increased. Avinash Goyal, Chandigarh Give incentives for innovation and good workFixing responsibility for the city’s slip in rankings will not be easy and logically conclusive because no project is a one-man show and the blame will be passed on from one department to the other. The better line of action is motivation and incentives given for innovation and good work. This annual exercise is not to secure a qualifying score but to ensure that all the 4,242 participating cities and towns vie for the best ranking. This warrants specific efforts as any complacency will mean a poor performance – to target key categories and sub-categories which need to be publicised among all stakeholders. All endeavours go for a six when waste dumps, roads and localities get inundated after rain. Stormwater infrastructure should be augmented. Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaStrict control over MC spending requiredNow it has been reported that segregation of garbage, the main point of deficiency in the waste management system, at people’s doorsteps, is set to start by October with Chandigarh Smart City by purchasing 390 twin-bin BS6 vehicles to lift dry and wet garbage separately. The responsibility of segregation, instead of Chandigarh municipal Corporation, now rests on the shoulders of Chandigarh Smart City Limited. The MC earlier used to be cash rich but now because of financial constraints due to poor planning it has been forced to even put off development work. It can perhaps cut costs by stopping spending on refreshments at every monthly meeting as all councillors are local and get allowances for attending this and other meetings. The authorities should not sanction local and foreign tours, fuel expenses, or give out laptops to those who do not know how to operate them. Night food streets should be revived once the pandemic is over. The corporation can earn revenues by starting mini buses for local routes. Also, all projects handed over to contractors should be now run by MC staff with officials concerned responsible for their working and promoted/demoted on the success of the project.SK Khosla, ChandigarhAuthorities, residents to blameThe civic authorities and residents are equally responsible for not maintaining the city’s cleanliness. One can see heaps of garbage at spots near the Central Library, in Sector 34, Chandigarh, for instance. The city’s upkeep is way down the priority list of the authorities. Littering should be penalised strictly, which is not being done as yet. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliNeed for effective waste recyclingThe MC is accountable to the residents for inaction, apathy and mismanagement. It should look into and adopt the latest measures for recycling garbage. Garden/kitchen waste can be used as manure through composting. Construction waste can be used for making bricks, for which MC can get in touch with brick kiln owners and make it mandatory to supply waste to the kiln. Study tours by councillors to various cities should be stopped as these don’t seem to have worked so far.Usha Verma, ChandigarhImpose strict penalty for litteringFixing accountability to improve the city’s cleanliness is not the only way to deal with the slide in rankings. We cannot always blame the government for collection of garbage because it is the duty of the citizens too to segregate wasted and dispose it too. The government has made public toilets so that the city is open defecation free but these are not maintained properly. Penalty for littering should be imposed strictly. Secondly, the Ghaggar river is getting polluted by the day, so there should be a strict ban on dumping garbage in it. It is also the duty of the residents to manage waste effectively and do not throw garbage in the streets, adopting composting as a way of life. Ishita NaraRecycling garbage the way forwardYes, accountability has to be fixed to improve the city’s ranking in cleanliness. That is from the officials of the MC and UT. But, along with that, we have to develop a good got to develop a good civic sense, not only to solve the problem of garbage disposal but also to keep the city clean. Fines by the MC are in order, but that alone will not help. We have to develop the habit of keeping our own homes and surroundings clean. Specifically, an effective way to dispose of garbage is by chemical decomposition. In Chandigarh, garbage can be turned into fuel energy, and manure. With IITs and so many engineering colleges in the country, why can’t we find ways to convert garbage into an asset, rather than a problem? Recycling and conversion is the way forward. Let it be a people’s movement, starting collection from each house, and ending up in industrial units. If the garbage collectors do not turn up, we should ourselves dispose it on the way to work. Take initiative, do it yourself. Don’t keep blaming others. Colonel RD Singh (retd), AmbalaREADER OF THE WEEKReassurance of getting trucks for waste segregation a bluffWhat standards of accountability can be fixed, when the Central agencies are monitoring and declaring the ranking of the cities across the country for almost five years now? Thousands of tonnes of waste are unprocessed even after the plant has been taken over by the MC. However, except for a visit by a team of expert the assess the viability of the machines at the plant, nothing was being done to upgrade or replace them. Now the MC is trying to reassure the citizens that they will get 390 trucks for 100% waste segregation in the next two months and will be able to improve its ranking by next years. Can there be a bigger bluff than this? When the MC does not have money to complete urgent repairs of the roads, and when a tender for the 390 trucks is yet to be floated, how quickly will the vehicles be put to use? All the officials in Chandigarh know they are here for a short duration, to expect accountability is out of the question.Suresh Verma, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-readers-take-for-swachh-survekshan-rankings-make-haste-clear-waste/story-36rxqX226sokLsNbXTrUdP.html

With 9,546 Covid-19 cases and 361 fatalities, the district has five containment zones and 34 micro-containment zones, and the number is expected to rise. Micro containment involves sealing only a certain locality in a large area.When the cases were 3,935 and deaths 122 in the beginning of August, the administration had declared 10 areas as micro-containment zones, while a month ago, the district had just two containment zones. As per officials, in Punjab, areas where positive cases exceed 15 are declared containment zones, while those with cases between five and 15 are declared micro-containment zones. Among the areas to get the tag recently are tony city areas, such as B-block of BRS Nagar (25 positive cases, containment zone) and parts of Model Town Extension, Aggar Nagar Block A, Sector 32, Chandigarh Road and Atam Nagar (micro-containment zones). The highest positive cases at 39 are from the narrow lanes of Dhandari Kalan, a congested area, which was declared a containment zone on August 17. In the rural parts of the district, confined areas near Heavenly Palace, Doraha, is a containment zone with 17 cases, while areas near Macchhiwara Sahib, Ram Nagar Jagraon, Kalakh Majra Dehlon, village Manakwal, village Akalgarh, among others have been declared micro-containment zones. According to Ludhiana additional deputy commissioner (development) Sandeep Kumar, the residents of these zones are allowed access to only essential services within their area and movement is severely restricted. “Boundaries are decided keeping in view the cases in that particular area. While the containment zone is initially declared for a minimum of 10 days, decision on whether to extend it is taken following analysis of the last positive case there,” he said. Amid all these steps by the administration, managing a large population with blatant containment zone violations remains a challenge. “People venture out several kilometres away from their house for all sorts of errands by pleading ‘emergencies’. Confining the public amid the sheer disregard towards the rising pandemic is a major challenge,” said a police official deputed at a containment zone. RESISTANCE TO TESTING District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar said their aim was to collect samples from 100% population of a contained area. “But, despite our best efforts, we face a lot of resistance from residents. Some even refuse to open doors out of fear that they will be declared positive. They do not cooperate with us.” Containment zonesHeavenly Palace, Doraha (17 cases), Salempura (16), Dhandari Kalan (39), New Model Town, Sahnewal (16), Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, Block B (25).Micro containment zones: Macchiwara Sahib, New Azad Nagar, Daulat Colony, Maya Nagar, Cartoon Woods Flat Jhammat, Basant Avenue, Prince Colony, Daad village, 355-A Model Town Extension, Sector 32, Chandigarh Road, Atam Nagar, Basant City, Pakhowal Road, Allaour Manpur village, New Durga Puri Haibowal, New Moti Nagar, Ram Nagar Jagraon, part of Shimlapuri, Mohalla Bogia, Jagraon, Model House Model Town, Kalakh Majri, Dehlon, Gurpreet Nagar Daba Road, Manakwaal village near Lovleen Studio, parts of Shakti Nagar, Ashok Nagar near bus stand, Akalgarh village, Guru Ramdas Nagar, G Block BRS Nagar, Aggar Nagar A Block, Shivaji Nagar, Issa Nagri, New Madopuri (gali 4 and 4.1/2), ward number 19 Sunder Nagar, Jyotisaroop Watica near Saai Daam, New Subhash Nagar gali 5/3, gali number 5, Indira Colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/swelling-covid-19-cases-in-ludhiana-cage-thousands-in-39-restricted-zones/story-Jn1ZqcMaPVbWOobdxsRfhP.html

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Revenue augmentation to be top agenda at Chandigarh MC House meet||At the top of the agenda of the municipal corporation (MC) General House meet, slated for August 31, will be a slew of recommendations of the revenue generation committee for augmenting its revenue. A one-time scheme for water bill defaulters, regularisation of water connection outside lal dora, door-to-door waste collection charges, running gyms on PPP model, optimum utilisation of the Mahila Bhawan in Sector 38, advertisement at parks, on toilets, MC vehicles and at connecting passes in Sector 17, will be taken up for the House’s approval. For recovering around Rs 40 crore in pending water bills, under the one-time scheme, water bill defaults will be regularised at 10% for one-time payment, 7% for two installments and 5% for three installments. This will be applicable for general public and government institutions. For augmenting its revenue, the fund-starved MC is preparing to put its assets such as community centres and Mahila Bhawan in Sector 38, to better use for generating additional revenue. While it plans to employ public-private partnership model for running the gyms at community centres, it also plans to rent out rooms, exhibition halls, gym and canteen at the Mahila Bhawan, Sector 38. The city has 42 community centers, some of which have gym facilities and health centres, but don’t generate any revenue and instead end up putting additional financial burden on the MC in the form of maintenance costs. Mahila Bhawan in Sector 38-C, even after more than five years of its opening, is yet to be fully utilised. Only a part of the bhawan, which was built at a cost of around Rs 22 crore, is being used by the UT culture department. Now, the MC is projecting to earn Rs 64 lakh annually from the bhawan, which is spread over 1.3 acre, by leasing out rooms and dormitories at Rs 35 lakh to Rs 40 lakh per year. The licencee will rent out the rooms on per bed basis. Similarly, other facilities at the bhawan such as exhibition halls, library, gym hall, and conference halls are being proposed to be rented out or leased out. Significantly, a similar proposal was rejected by the MC in July earlier this year. The MC house will also take up the matter of giving in-principle approval for using MC land for providing houses under the affordable rental housing complexes (ARHC) scheme as part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. If approved, a seven-member committee, comprising officials and councilors, will be constituted for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/revenue-augmentation-to-be-top-agenda-at-chandigarh-mc-house-meet/story-BhL6P6KfYIBu5LscCgVEIO.html

The MC officials said that an FIR is being recommended against the employees and MC’s deputy controller finance and accounts (DCFA) has been asked to hold back the benefits of the inspector, who is retiring soon.As per information, one of the machines was given to the inspector, who had further handed over the same to JE, who assisted him in recovery. But a few days back, the machine was caught from the possession of a woman employee. When the seniors inquired into the matter, it was found that receipts worth ₹45 lakhs were issued through the machine, but the employees submitted only ₹17.5 lakhs in the MC accounts. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The ePOS machines were given for increasing transparency and facilitating the residents. But strict action would be taken against the embezzlements. I have asked additional commissioner Rishipal Singh to inspect records of ePOS machines and action would be taken if any anomalies are found.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-50l-embezzlement-in-mc-office-ludhiana-civic-body-to-inspect-records-of-all-epos-machines/story-r4ZRjLl0eQnqMFvftrUfZI.html

Weather is still inclement.”“Due to rains, the highway restoration work has not been completed. Till the landslides are removed, traffic movement will remain suspended,” he added.Over 2,000 vehicles are stranded at various places in Qazigund, Chenani, Udhampur and Nagrota, said another official.A local from Ramban said the landslide at Cafeteria Morh was a massive, and that incessant rains have rendered machines defunct as they could not clear the debris due to mud and slush on the affected stretches in the district.“Intensity of rains reduced to drizzle this morning. Around 300 vehicles are stranded in Ramban district,” he added.Light to moderate rains also lashed twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, south of Pir Panjal on Friday morning.MUGHAL ROAD OPENED FOR TRAFFICThe Mughal Road, which is an alternate link between Jammu and Kashmir, was opened for traffic on Friday. “Vehicles were released towards Poonch as traffic was restored on Mughal Road,” said IG traffic.However, Poonch deputy magistrate Rahul Yadav informed that the road has not been opened for all kind of traffic.“All are informed that no such order has been issued and traffic on Mughal Road is allowed only for downward movement of fruit trucks, empty oil tankers from Kashmir to Jammu.

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Revoking of senator’s registration: HC division bench upholds order quashing PU’s decision||Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday upheld a single bench order in which Panjab University (PU)’s decision of revoking the registration of senator Munish Verma as a graduate constituency member in 2019, was quashed. The registration allows former students to elect and contest polls for the varsity’s apex governing body. His registration was cancelled and he was barred from participating in future senate elections after he was indicted of wrongfully hiring three persons as centre and assistant superintendents in the 2014 annual examinations at MR Government College, Fazilka, Punjab.The single judge bench had in July quashed the decision, observing that as per PU Act, a person’s name can be struck off from the register of registered graduates with the concurrence of not less than 2/3 of the members of the senate. However, there were a total of 91 members and 2/3rd of the same comes to 61, but when decision on revoking registration was taken, only 38 members were present. Hence, the quorum of the meeting was not complete. The high court, however, upheld PU’s decision to constitute a committee to probe the 2014 incident. The ‘fraud’ had came to light on April 4, 2014, when a flying squad of the university visited the examination centre and recommended the removal of all three centre and assistant superintendents who were appointed illegally. After that, a committee constituted by the Panjab University vice-chancellor in 2015 had indicted the senator of cheating the varsity while deputing the three persons. The PU had argued that a single judge bench has decided the case on technical grounds. The matter should have been sent to the senate for a fresh decision. It further submitted that Verma never sought that there should be voting in senate on probe report and other related aspects of the case. No member, who could not attend the meeting raised any objection to the decision, the PU had submitted, adding that it was a unanimous decision of all members who had attended the meeting on May 26, 2019. PU had also stated that 62 members were present in the meeting and not 38, as depicted in the single bench order. The matter was taken up by the bench of justice Daya Chaudhary and justice Meenakshi, which dismissed the appeal. A detailed order is awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/revoking-of-senator-s-registration-hc-division-bench-upholds-order-quashing-pu-s-decision/story-99y0y8zVgyG32chowgar7K.html

The recent inquiry that the Akal Takht had ordered put the number of missing saroops at 328. Taking action against those indicted in the report of inquiry that advocate Ishar Singh-led panel conducted, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) executive has already dismissed six staffers, suspended five and terminated the services of a controversial Chartered Accountancy (CA) firm on Thursday. This was done on the Akal Takht’s directions. SGPC member and former general secretary Kiranjot Kaur said, “The SGPC has decided that who is to be blamed for the missing 328 birs. The original question still stands where are the missing birs?”.“The Punjab Human Rights Organization (PHRO) wants to know the fate of 328 missing saroops, plus the 186, which were printed and issued to devotees without authorisation and proper entries, and persons on whose directions these saroops were provided,” said Sarbjit Singh Verka, chief investigator of the human rights advocacy group, which brought the matter to light, sending the apex gurdwara body into a fix.Panthic Talmel Sangathan, the umbrella organisation representing several Sikh groups, said, “The million-dollar question is where are the missing saroops and in which condition they are? The SGPC is silent on this question.” Former Khalsa College principal Baljinder Singh had also raised the same question, while cornering the SGPC on the issue.“If the chief secretary owns moral responsibility and resigns from his post, does the president have no moral responsibility? The SGPC functions on the orders of its president, while the staff led by chief secretary is responsible for implementation of these orders. The president cannot evade moral responsibility,” added Kaur.Verka added, “Longowal and the SGPC executive committee should resign in lieu of this letter to them in 2018 in which statutory auditors have pointed out irregularities and embezzlements on which no action was taken. Erring officials of the SGPC were protected.” He also made the letter public. There is also demand to make the inquiry report public. “It is necessary to make the inquiry report public, because everyone wants to know if action has been taken as per report and which aspects are highlighted and which issues have been ignored,” said Giani Kewal Singh, convener, and advocate Jaswinder Singh, co-convener of the panthic sangathan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikh-voices-question-sgpc-akal-takht-on-328-missing-saroops/story-3maZaJ2QYRIPVt1xU71nxH.html

The complainants had alleged that the store was arbitrarily charging goods and services tax (GST) and using misleading advertisements. In all five cases, notices were issued to Brand Factory, but no one turned up even after 30 days, following which a fine of Rs 32,000 was imposed in each case. The store is to pay Rs 7,000 to the complainant and Rs 25,000 to the legal-aid fund of the commission in each case. Commission president Sanjiv Dutt Sharma said that it is a clear admission on the part of owners of Brand factory that they have arbitrarily charged GST from the complainant by adopting unfair trade practice and have also committed deficiency in service. In the first case, Anuj Mehta, a resident of Phase-5, Mohali, had alleged that he had purchased a pair of socks from the store. The MRP of the product was Rs.169, inclusive of all taxes, and there was a 30% discount on it. It is alleged that he was to pay only Rs.118.2, but instead of charging this amount, the owners added 5% GST and charged him Rs 124 for the product. Despite repeated requests by the customer, no clarification was provided by the shop owner. It was therefore alleged that it was a case of misleading advertisement and unfair trade practice. In the second case, Anuj Mehta alleged that he bought a T-shirt, the MRP of which was Rs.399, inclusive of all taxes. The T-shirt had a 50% discount on it, which meant he was to pay only Rs 199.49. But instead of charging this amount, the store owner added 5% GST and charged him Rs 209. In the third case, Sumeet Singh, a resident of Gillco Valley, Sector 127, Kharar, alleged that he also bought a T-shirt from the same clothing store. The MRP of the shirt was Rs.399, inclusive of all taxes, and there was a 50% discount on it. He was made to pay Rs.209 by adding 5% GST. In the fourth case, Summet Singh alleged that he purchased handkerchiefs that had an MRP of Rs 299, inclusive of all taxes. With a 60% discount, he was to pay only Rs 119.60 but he was charged Rs.126. In the fifth case, Summet alleged that he was charged Rs 146 for a pair of socks that would have cost him only Rs 139 had the store not arbitrarily charged a GST of 5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brand-factory-store-in-mohali-mall-to-pay-rs-1-6-lakh-fine-for-unfair-trade-practices/story-xdlwkIygtzdpm9R8sp0ZGL.html

Unidentified militants last week released an audio message claiming to have killed the panchayat member.The police had then said the clip seemed to be fake and added they were investigating the matter.In the 2.56-minute-long clip, they claimed that Bhat has been killed and buried at an unidentified place.An unidentified person was purportedly heard saying in the clip that the panchayat member was involved in “anti-movement” activities” and had met his fate. “We have been after him for a long time and finally got him.”The message claimed the body was not handed over to his family because of Covid-19 pandemic.Bhat went missing days after Shakir Manzoor, a Territorial Army solider, was abducted from neighbouring Kulgam district. His burnt vehicle was found later. A similar message was released which claimed that Manzoor was killed and buried at an undisclosed location.Over the last two months five Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including two sarpanches (village heads), have been killed in Kashmir. In July, Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita was killed in Anantnag district which forced many panchayat members to resign. Wasim Bari, a BJP functionary, was killed along with his father and brother in July.The government shifted dozens of panchayat members, majority of them from the BJP, to safer places after an evaluation of threats from militants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmir-body-found-suspected-to-be-that-of-missing-panchayat-member/story-xnmuCXi5qRQfEQ2dbOMSpI.html

There were given the doses on Wednesday.According to Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Hospital, Katraj campus, the first two candidates, both men, aged 32 and 48 years, have not reported any complaints and all their vital parameters appeared to be normal even after 24 hours. “I have not reported any fever or pain since Wednesday. I have also started my routine work,” said one of the candidates who come from the health sector and was also a candidate for the swine flu vaccine in 2009. A day later, three more volunteers, two females and a male were given shots of the vaccine, which is one of the front-runners in global efforts of vaccines to prevent deadly virus Sars-Cov-2 which causes the Covid-19 infection. These were tested on Wednesday to ascertain if they have antibodies, the absence of which made them eligible to be a candidate for human trials. Besides Bharati Vidyapeeth, another city-based hospital KEM is involved in conducting human trials. The KEM hospital has carried out Covid and antibodies test on five volunteers and go ahead administering vaccine shots if they come negative at its Vadhu campus. All these candidates, according to Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Hospital, will once again be given another dose after a month. “We are in touch with the two candidates who were given vaccine doses. Neither of them has reported systemic illness or pain and fever in the 24 hours ending Thursday afternoon. We will continue to monitor all the candidates being given the shots,” said Dr Oswal. The hospital has deputed doctors to monitor the health condition of each candidate daily. All the five volunteers were allowed to go home within minutes of being administered the vaccine, said hospital’s medical director Dr Sanjay Lalwani. Serum Institute of India had asked the hospital to carry out clinical trials on over 300 candidates. “We are planning to inject vaccine doses in at least 25 candidates within a week,” said Lalwani. According to him, the eligibility criteria is that the person must be aged between 18-99 years without any co-morbidities.

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||No Covid lockdown in Chandigarh this weekend||Chandigarh: The Chandigarh administration on Friday decided that there will be no weekend lockdown in the Union Territory. Shops and malls will remain open on Saturday and Sunday. The administration, however, decided to continue with the odd-even system that is operational in the city’s 11 congested markets. These decisions were taken at the war room review meeting on Friday. Reacting to weekend restrictions imposed in Punjab and Haryana in the wake of surge in Covid-19 cases, the UT had on August 21 ordered the closure of all shops and malls on Saturday and Sunday in the city. With the Haryana government on Friday deciding to allow shops to open on weekends in the state, the UT also decided to follow it in Chandigarh. UT adviser Manoj Parida, said, “Haryana has opened its markets on Saturday and Sunday. The lockdown restrictions in the city won’t work unless the tricity (of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali) is closed.” Withdrawing the order on weekend closure of shops, Haryana has directed the closing of shops and malls on Monday and Tuesday instead. But the UT will not follow suit in this regard, Parida said. Stating that there is no proof that only markets spread coronavirus infection, Parida, said, “How long can restrictions go on? Our literate residents have got the message to behave hygienically.” PRESSURE FROM TRADERS The revival of economy and trade in the city also weighed in favour of the administration’s decision to allow the opening of shops and markets on weekends. The UT’s August 21 decision to shut shops on weekends had come under criticism from traders, who held protests and submitted memoranda to the administration. Traders said the weekend lockdown along with the odd-even system was causing loss to them. Trader bodies welcomed the administration’s decision on the withdrawal of the weekend lockdown. Charanjiv Singh, the chairman of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “There is no rush in the markets on both weekdays and weekends as the footfall has come down to 25% as compared to pre-Covid days. So, social distancing can be easily maintained. We also want the odd-even system withdrawn, too.” At present, the odd-even system is operational in the electronics market in Sector 18, Sector 8 internal market, Patel Market in Sector 15, Palika Bazaar and Sadar Market in Sector 19, Azad Market and Palace Market in Sector 20, Booth Market in Sector 21, Shastri Market in Sector 22, Janta Market in Sector 27, Krishna Market in Sector 41 and market area near the old PNB Bank/Bihari Garment, Burail Chowk. The basements of seven shops in the mobile market will continue to remain closed, while the scooter market of Sector 43 will remain closed on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-covid-lockdown-in-chandigarh-this-weekend/story-i1Mytbdrmya8RkwPwpX0KN.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Moderate rain in Mumbai, yellow alert issued for Saturday||Mumbai and its suburbs received continuous spells of light to moderate rain from Friday morning, interspersed with a few intense spells of rain.Against a light to moderate rain alert for Friday, the Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 26.4mm rain while the Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 19 mm rain between 8.30am and 2.30pm. Over six hours, the eastern suburbs recorded the most rain with 91.4mm in Chembur while Thane and Navi Mumbai saw rainfall between 40-70 mm. Areas in central Mumbai such as Bandra Kurla Complex recorded 46.4mm of rain while northern and western suburbs recorded 10-20 mm of rain. Over the past 24 hours (8.30am Thursday to 8.30am Friday), Mumbai suburbs recorded 5.2mm of rain while south Mumbai recorded 6.4mm of rain.Also Read: August records 24% excess rain in India, highest since 1983The India Meteorological Department (IMD) updated its district-wise rain forecast at 1pm with a yellow alert (heavy rain at isolated areas) for the rest of Friday and for Saturday. IMD has issued an alert for Mumbai and Thane. It has also issued an orange alert (heavy to very rain) for Palghar and Raigad for Saturday, and heavy rain warning for Pune, Kolhapur, and the entire Vidarbha subdivision.KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD, said, “Monsoon conditions are active across coastal Maharashtra, closer to central India under the influence of a well-marked low pressure weather system over north Chhattisgarh adjoining east Madhya Pradesh. It is likely this system will move in the west-northwest direction over southern Uttar Pradesh over the next 48 hours, allowing the rain intensity to be similar to what is being observed over Mumbai on Friday. Additionally, convergence due to strong lower level southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterly winds from Bay of Bengal during this period would enhance rain activity.”He added that satellite and radar images indicated intense cloud formation over the north Konkan coast. “Dense cloud patches were observed towards the eastern suburbs, the Chembur rain figure indicates that,” said Hosalikar.Also Read: La Niña may develop between Sept and Nov; likely to hamper post-monsoon season in IndiaMeanwhile, Mumbai is just 20mm short of crossing the 3,000mm-mark this monsoon, with another month for the season to end.The forecast for the rest of Friday and Saturday read: “Generally cloudy conditions with moderate rain and possibly heavy spells at isolated areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/moderate-rain-in-mumbai-yellow-alert-issued-for-saturday/story-L8YHxmGxvW9vkMD8r5eDjP.html
28-08-2020||City||Jalandhar police fine 400 persons a day for not wearing mask||Jalandhar At a time, when discipline and resolve is the only real ‘vaccine’ against the coronavirus, Jalandhar, the district second on the list of covid-19 cases in the state, with around 59,000 patients and 1,374 deaths till Thursday is attaining the dubious distinction of residents flouting government directions not wearing masks. On an average, 400 people a day have been fined Rs 500 each for ignoring this critical norm since the outbreak of the pandemic. Police data show that since March 23 (around 150 days ago), around 58,000 persons have been fined for roaming in public places without wearing a mask. The City Police have issued 34,776 challans and imposed a fine of Rs 1.7 crore. Urban areas have more cases than the rural segments. The rural police have issued 23,142 challans to people roaming in public places without a mask and collected Rs 1.1 crore fine. Not only this, residents have also violated quarantine norms and other mandatory rules, even as the Congress government has called for war-like preparedness against covid-19.Police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said to date, a fine of Rs 86,000 had been imposed on 46 violations of home quarantine instructions, and 453 persons have been fined Rs 1.2 lakh for spitting in a public place.Bhullar added 236 people had been fined for violating social distancing norms and 77 four-wheelers and 34 auto-rickshaws had been penalised for transporting more number of persons than permitted. In rural areas, 39 persons have been fined for violating home quarantine, 105 penalised for spitting in public places and 43 fined for violating social distancing norms. A senior administration official said the casual and indifferent attitude of people was dangerous and increased the risk of infection for the entire society. Be it morning walkers or shopkeepers, those who resided in containment zones were also seen not covering their faces for protection. He added people wore the mask only when they spotted a policeman, which was counterproductive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-police-fine-400-persons-a-day-for-not-wearing-mask/story-fyypP3XNIu9SS7MlWJQNHK.html

28-08-2020||Mumbai||Wildlife regularly uses 27 overpasses built over Maharashtra canal: Irrigation department||Wild animals, including tigers, are using overpasses built atop an irrigation project on the Wainganga river in Maharashtra, underscoring the importance of built-in mitigation measures for linear infrastructure and other developmental projects.The state irrigation department informed a sub-committee of the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) authorities during a meeting on Thursday evening that they had completed constructing 27 of 54 overpasses that are on average 30 to 50 metre (m) wide each. The underpasses are built over the 99-kilometre (km) Gosikhurd irrigation canal, which extends from Bhandara to Chandrapur districts. The canal passes through protected areas such as Umred Pauni Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary and Tiger Reserve as well as the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR).Irrigation department officials stated that tigers were using the overpasses across at least two locations in south Brahmapuri region surrounded by fragmented forest patches. They also shared photographs to bolster their contention. “We have documented tiger movement across Halda and Wandra areas in this region, where photographs have been taken over the past year at two specific overpasses. However, there are reports of several other areas, where local villagers have spotted tigers and other animals, including deer, boars, wild dogs etc, all using these overpasses,” said JM Shaikh, chief engineer (projects), Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC).The Gosikhurd project starts from Pauni in Bhandara district and it was inaugurated on April 22, 1988, to divert water to Wainganga, Wardha and Tapi basin and annually irrigate 3.38 lakh hectares (ha) in around 720 villages in western Vidarbha. The break-up of the areas irrigated annually in Bhandara, Nagpur and Chandrapur districts are 89,856 ha, 19,481 ha and Chandrapur 1,41,463 ha, respectively, in a bid to boost commercial crop production. This is the first irrigation project in Maharashtra that has built-in wildlife mitigation measures, the state forest department authorities said. “The feasibility of these overpasses shows that we need many more such structures to ensure the uninterrupted movement of big cats and other animals and are not deterred due to developmental models,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forests (PPCF) (wildlife), Maharashtra. He claimed that this could be one of the first wildlife passages built over a canal in the country.The forest department has planned a study by setting up camera traps in the area. “Over six months, we hope to get an idea of how many tigers or other animals are using these structures,” said Kakodkar.A February 2020 report by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, had recorded 5,450 wild animal photographs captured through camera traps over a 10 month period – between March and December 2019 -- across nine underpasses along the National Highway (NH)-7 near the Pench Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. The study documented 18 animal species using these mitigation measures, including 11 tigers using six of the nine underpasses.Kishor Rithe, member, SBWL, said, “At present, these wildlife overpasses are concrete structures. The fact that it is being used is the first step. We have suggested that there should be greening of these structures with soil and vegetation to resemble forest in a bid to encourage the animals to use them regularly. Besides, they should be made in such a way to discourage local villagers from using their vehicles. Boulders can be put up to ensure unhindered movement of animals.”Though the original proposal was to build 64 overpasses, it was realised that 54 overpasses were sufficient following site-specific studies, said Shaikh. While 27 have been constructed across the 99-km stretch since 2017, 10 are under construction ranging from 47 to 99 km. Of the remaining proposed underpasses, local villagers have opposed the construction of five that are located within the first 30 km. “However, three structures can be built,” said Shaikh.Kakodkar said, “The irrigation department has informed us about the opposition from local villagers due to fear of tigers and other carnivores entering the agricultural landscape leading to conflict.”Rithe said a team of non-government members and forest officials from the sub-committee would visit the site to assess alternate options for constructing the five overpasses.COMMITTEE ASKS MSEDCL TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO ADDRESS ANIMAL ELECTROCUTION DEATHSAnother major issue discussed by the SBWL sub-committee on Thursday involved addressing cases of animal electrocution due to transmission lines in TATR buffer zone. In 2016 and 2018, 16 and 11 animal deaths, respectively, were electrocuted by live wires in agricultural patches that are located close to forest areas. Majority of these areas are located in the TATR buffer zone.In October 2016, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had issued guidelines underlining safe practices to avoid animal deaths due to electrocution by power transmission lines.The ministry had directed electricity distribution companies to preferably use air bunching of cables (ABC), including both overhead and underground, as much as possible.The SBWL sub-committee in its previous meetings had directed the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Ltd. (MSEDCL) authorities to undertake ABC across the TATR buffer zone to address the electrocution issue. Though initially MSEDCL had identified 49 locations for this exercise, later it had whittled down its estimate. The cost of implementing ABC for 16 locations amounted to Rs 14.65 crore and the forest department was asked to bear the expenses, which coughed up Rs. 2.45 crore. Tenders were issued by MSEDCL using this Rs. 2.45 crore for two locations such as Chichpalli to Mamala and Padmapur to Mamala, while awaiting funds for the rest of the project.“We have asked MSEDCL authorities to explore the possibility of allocating funds for ABC,” said Kakodkar. Rithe objected to the paltry allocation for ABC by the wildlife department. Ultimately, it was decided that the matter would be taken up before a ministerial-level committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wildlife-regularly-uses-27-overpasses-built-over-maharashtra-canal-irrigation-department/story-Lil4nyfWFhptEQz5QI256N.html

28-08-2020||Delhi||Inspired by ‘Special 26’ film, criminals dupe people by posing as ED and ACB officials||Bollywood flick Special 26 appeared to have inspired five men, who duped unsuspecting public until the law caught up with them on Thursday, Delhi Police said. The arrested accused took to the crime after they had lost their jobs in insurance companies about two years ago, the police said.The five men allegedly stole customers’ data while leaving their insurance companies to target the public and make a fast buck.The modus operandi was simple. Initially, they duped the victims on the pretext of offering hefty bonuses on their insurance policies. Later, they would extort money from them by posing as Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) officials and offering to help them recover their lost money, the police said. The racket was busted on Thursday after they had sent a fake notice in ED’s name to one of the victims, who alerted the authorities about a possible fraud. “The criminals had used fake addresses and identity proofs to get SIM (subscriber identification module) cards to make these calls and opened a bank account in which the booty made out of deceiving people was deposited. But they would use ATMs (automated teller machines) to withdraw the cash. The CCTV (closed-circuit TV) footage in the ATM booths provided us clues to their identities and we nabbed all five of them,” said Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (crime branch), Delhi Police. The five men, who are aged between 24 and 35, are residents of Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad in the national capital region (NCR).Delhi Police’s crime branch tweeted, “Crime Branch busted a gang of interstate criminals with the arrest of five. Inspired by Special 26 they were posing as officials of ED and ACB . ATM and SIM cards on fake KYC (know your customer) and laptop used in the crime recovered.”The police said that the crime was brought to the ED’s notice by a man, whose identity has been kept under wraps. The complainant had been purchasing insurance policies since 2013.Sometime last year, the complainant started receiving calls from people, who claimed to be insurance officials. “They told him that he had won a hefty bonus on his insurance policy, but had to pay an advance tax and a processing fee,” said the DCP. Over the next few months, the complainant received multiple such calls and finally deposited Rs 10.6 lakh in a bank account. Last August, he started receiving phone calls from people, who claimed to be ED officials. “Initially, they approached him on the pretext of helping him recover his lost money. Later, they tried to extort money from him by threatening him of action by ED,” said DCP Deo. They even sent him a fake summon in ED’s name in a bid to lend a credible ring to their con job.“When he received the summon, he contacted the ED authorities, who found the document to be fake. On August 17, the deputy director of ED brought it to our notice and we began our probe,” said the DCP. Though the SIM cards and the bank account were found registered against fake identities, Delhi Police focused on the cash withdrawal mechanism of the suspects that was found to be from ATMs in Delhi-NCR.“Clues from CCTV footage helped us track them down to Kaushambi (in Ghaziabad),” said the DCP. The officer said that the mastermind of the crime was Rahul Singh (30), who had earlier worked for a private firm in Noida that used to deal in insurance brokerage.“The firm was fined and had to shut down in 2018 after the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) hauled it up for violations. Singh had stolen the customers’ data before he had quit the company,” said the DCP. Singh also allegedly went on to rope in Shadab and Junaid, who, too, had lost their jobs in the same company. Soon, two other partners-in-crime -- Sumit Sharma and Naveen Kumar – joined them, as they had also lost their jobs at another insurance company, but had managed to steal customers’ data. “Since January 2019, they had been targeting unsuspecting insurance policyholders. In the beginning, some of them would dupe the customers on the pretext of offering hefty bonuses on their policies. Later, other members of the gang would pose as ED and ACB officials to further extort from their victims,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/inspired-by-special-26-film-criminals-dupe-people-by-posing-as-ed-and-acb-officials/story-Zj8hrvfCzoiie9iIiUPzxK.html

Jain cited a note issued by Vikram Dev Dutt, principal secretary (health), Delhi, who had proposed that the opinion of the central government’s committee led by Dr VK Paul be sought in this matter. The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) dismissed the allegation as “false” and “baseless”.“Now, that there is clarity that the Delhi government will go ahead on this independently, a proper strategy is needed on how it is to be done. The work started from Friday followed a meeting chaired by minister Jain. The state government has decided to draft an SOP as well,” said the government official cited above.The decision to double the number of Covid-19 tests -- from around 20,000 being conducted at present to 40,000 per day -- was announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this week following a spike in the viral infection in the national capital.Delhi recorded 1,840 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday -- the highest single-day spike in 48 days – as the average went up to 1,464 fresh cases for the past seven days.The Delhi government would also take into consideration formulating a strategy to ensure that real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are increased along with the rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, which are less accurate but produce results in a brief span of time and also much cheaper..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-chalks-out-a-plan-to-ramp-up-covid-testing/story-zE8EXlB4Z5zWaeJ5iRpOiJ.html
28-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Yamuna water level nears warning mark||On Friday morning, the water level of the Yamuna river at Delhi’s Old Railway Bridge was recorded at 204.3 metres (m), which is close to the warning level of 204.5 m.The level rose after 11,055 cusecs of water was released from Haryana’s Hathni Kund Barrage into the Yamuna at 8 am on Friday. While the water level was slightly higher than Thursday’s 203.7 m recorded at 8 am, it was still lower than Monday’s level of 204.3 m -- the first time this year, when it was recorded to be close to the warning mark. The Delhi government’s Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) department officials said that the level recorded is much below the warning mark and might go up only if a higher volume of water is released, or if the national capital is lashed by heavy rains. “Some parts of Delhi received light rainfall on Friday. If the intensity of the rainfall increases coupled with the release of more water from the barrage, the level may surge further,” said an official from the state flood control department. “The water is released into the barrage every four hours. On a regular basis, only 350 cusecs of water is being released. During monsoon, because of higher volume of water in the barrage coupled with rainfall in the hilly regions, more water is released. This leads to a rising water level in the Yamuna. It takes between 36 and 72 hours for the released water to reach the river in Delhi. We are continuously monitoring the water level,” he added.Last year, Haryana had released over eight lakh cusecs of water in a day into the river after which the water level had breached the danger mark of 205.3 m. I&FC officials said that preparations are underway in case a higher volume of water is released and evacuation operations needed to be initiated. “We have identified suitable locations for pitching tents. Since social distancing is a norm due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, we have identified schools that are closed because of the viral outbreak. The flood-hit people will be provided shelter in these closed schools while maintaining adequate social distancing norms,” the official said. Delhi had reported a major flood in 1978, when the river’s water level had risen to the highest ever at 207.4 m..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-yamuna-water-level-nears-warning-mark/story-zYcDnsDs59WfPFkmvv2rXK.html
28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Raids in Chandigarh, Mohali to arrest former Punjab Police chief Sumedh Singh Saini in murder case, hours before he gets court’s stay||Mohali: A special investigation team (SIT), led by superintendent of police (SP) Harmandeep Singh Hans, raided the residences of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in Chandigarh and Mohali early on Friday to arrest him in connection with the murder of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee in 1991. The raids were conducted at Saini’s residences in Sector 20, Chandigarh, and his farmhouse in Mohali but the SIT returned empty-handed. “When we arrived to issue summons to him at his residence in Sector 20 on August 21, he was not there. The summons were pasted outside the residence. We raided his residences on Friday morning, but he was not there again. We are hopeful of arresting him soon,” an SIT member said, requesting anonymity. Saini faces arrest for murdering Multani after the SIT added Section 302 (murder) of the IPC to the first information report against him after two co-accused turned approvers. Around 10am, the court of additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) Rajnish Garg granted stay on the arrest till the final orders are pronounced in the case involving the disappearance and subsequent murder of Multani. The next date of hearing has been fixed for September 1. Saini’s counsel APS Deol said: “In the orders on Thursday, the court missed the extension of the stay of arrest. Today, we approached the court, following which it granted stay on arrest till the final orders in the case are pronounced.” On Thursday, the court reserved its orders on Saini’s anticipatory bail petition for August 29 for staying his arrest. The judge has not passed any orders on the interim stay on the arrest of the ex-DGP. Special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula said this meant that Saini could be arrested, as the stay on his arrest ended on August 27. In previous orders, Garg had ordered the SIT to give three-day notice to Saini, after adding murder sections to the FIR. The three-day notice ended at 6pm on August 24 and before that Saini had filed an application seeking anticipatory bail.

There are many who have to borrow from friends to run their houses. It has been more than six months that gyms have been shut.

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Cotton harvesting in Punjab to get delayed, picking begins from September 15||BATHINDA: Cotton harvesting in Punjab, particularly the south Malwa region, is set to commence after September 15, a delay of two weeks than the usual practice. Agriculture experts attribute the postponement in the raw cotton picking schedule to a delay in sowing period due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cotton is the economic lifeline of farmers in the semi-arid belt of south Malwa as the crop is sown in eight districts, mainly in Fazilka, Mansa, Bathinda and Muktsar. The sowing period in the state starts from April 18 based on the recommendations of agriculture scientists. Amid the shortage of migrant farm workers due to the coronavirus outbreak, Punjab this year has set a record by bringing 5.01 lakh hectares under cotton cultivation, which is the highest since 2010-11 kharif or summer-sown crop season. State agriculture officials and farmers are hopeful of a bumper crop this season. Chief agriculture officer (Bathinda) Bahadur Singh said normally cotton picking starts by the end of August. “However due to pandemic, sowing began in the end of April and lasted till the first week of June. Braving challenging Covid time, our field teams ensured farmers get purchasing the right types of seed, and checking the crop regularly so that any pests spotted at an early stage can be managed accordingly,” he said. Bathinda is the leading district in cotton cultivation at 1.72 lakh hectares. A progressive cotton grower from Bajak village Baldev Singh said this season there was no major pest attack and a high yield is expected. “I saved on pesticides as there was no infestation of whitefly or other diseases in the crop fields,” he said. FAZILKA VILLAGES FLOODED Cotton and paddy fields at about 50 villages near Abohar town are flooded after a breach was reported in an overflowing Abul Khurana drain last week. Jalour Singh, who is officiating as Fazilka chief agriculture officer, said about 15,000-acre land had been affected and crop loss assessment is underway. “Efforts are being made to drain out water from these villages located in the low-lying areas. Excess water may not impact the rice fields but cotton plants will be adversely affected if water is not drained out in the next 2-3 days,” said Singh. The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to buy cotton from Oct 1: State cotton coordinator Rajnish Goel said as the CCI will commence buying cotton on minimum support price (MSP) from October 1, farmers should bring crop in the mandis with 8-12% moisture for the best price. “A token purchase of 15 quintal cotton was recorded in Abohar on Monday. It was purchased by private traders at Rs 5,051 per quintal. But it should not be confused with regular cotton arrival. This is an annual feature as private buyers symbolically show cotton market functioning on before the rituals of shradh,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cotton-harvesting-in-punjab-to-get-delayed-picking-begins-from-september-15/story-WLCKnlMlu7BYrSZAtGlLLL.html

28-08-2020||Mumbai||Situation in Ladakh as severe as 1962, says Shiv Sena||Shiv Sena on Friday said that the current situation in Ladakh is as severe as that of 1962, apparently referring to India-China war, but asserted that the Indian Army will not allow the history to repeat.In its mouthpiece Saamana, the party said that Chinese “infiltration” and “land grabbing” activities have not reduced even as the country acknowledges India now has become more powerful.“The Chinese dragon’s actions there have not stopped, nor have their intentions changed. The Chinese and Indian Army may be undergoing discussions, but the guns of the two countries are stacked on each other along the Ladakh border. India is saying that China withdrew from Ladakh, while China is saying that India too should move from ‘finger four’ to its border first....,” the editorial said.“Today’s India is not that of 1962. It is much more powerful than that. Despite acknowledging this, Chinese infiltration and land grabbing activities have not reduced. Indian Army will not allow the repeat of the history of 1962. The situation in Ladakh currently is as severe as that of 1962. We cannot deny that,” it said. India and China remain in a standoff position in Ladakh after twenty Indian soldiers were killed in violent clashes with Chinese troops in Galwan valley on June 15. Talks between both countries regarding disengagement are going on but it has not produced any fruitful results.The editorial said that China’s aggressive intentions became clear only after a “few kilometres of incursion” by the Chinese into Ladakh in June.“The army is fully prepared. Our army chief visited the entire border. The Prime Minister also went to Ladakh and boosted the morale of the soldiers. The new guest of the Hindustani Air Force ‘Rafale’ has challenged the Chinese dragon while monitoring the border,” it said.Sena also said that India has given economic shocks to China by banning many Chinese apps.“It became clear that China withdrew a few steps from the region in which the tension in the two countries reached a peak due to the conflict in Galwan valley. This may have made China a little bit, but it has softened, creating such a ‘feel good’ atmosphere across the country. But now Foreign Minister Jaishankar in Ladakh, speaking of the most serious situation after 1962, can shock this environment. That means China’s crisis remains on the Ladakh border,” the editorial said. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

BMC authorities said that Covid-19 patients, who are not showing any signs of recovery, must be shifted to dedicated hospitals for the viral infection at the earliest.Mumbai’s case fatality rate (CFR) is 5.3%, as compared to Maharashtra’s at 3.2%.BMC, which is aiming to bring down the CFR to below 3%, has found out that Covid-19-related fatalities are higher in private healthcare facilities.The civic body has been conducting weekly meetings with top 10 hospitals that have been registering higher Covid-19-related death rates. BMC data showed that Covid-19-related deaths in private hospitals rose to over 40% in August, as compared to between 15% and 20% in June.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, health, BMC, said, “We have suggested private hospital authorities to refer critical Covid-19 patients to our major government-run hospitals and CCCs. They have also been directed to seek the opinion of external experts such as deans of government-run hospitals or members from the Maharashtra task force for Covid-19 management. This initiative is being done under our ‘Mission Save Lives’ strategy, where we want to bring down fatalities.”Mission Save Lives, which was launched on June 30, is a nine-point strategy.

28-08-2020||Patna||SC asks Bihar governor to take a call on B.Ed entrance test within 5 days||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the governor-cum-chancellor of universities in Bihar to decide the mode of admission in B.Ed course across the state since the combined entrance test (CET) for admission to B.Ed (CET-B.Ed) courses for 2020-2022 session has remained stuck due to Covid-19 pandemic. “We have heard the counsels for all sides. The counsel, appearing for the state nodal officer for the exam, informs us that the chancellor can take a decision as to whether there ought to be a central qualifying examination or whether the marks obtained till graduation are sufficient for the purpose of entrance into the B.Ed,” said the bench of Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and Justice Navin Sinha.The matter will come up on September 2 again for hearing.“The Chancellor is requested to positively decide and communicate his decision, given the serious pandemic situation and the flood situation in the State of Bihar, to the court within five days stating whether the Common Entrance Test ought not to be shelved for this year and as to whether the qualifying examination could be on some other basis,” the bench said.With the CET-B.Ed for 2020-2022 on hold, Bihar’s teachers’ training colleges and their teachers and employees have been facing as many difficulties as being faced by over 1.22-lakh applicants, fearing the loss of a session.OSD-Judicial at the Raj Bhawan, Vinod Tiwari, said that the Raj Bhawan would soon take a decision regarding admissions in B.Ed course and apprise the apex court about it. “We will work on it in a day or two in the light of the apex court’s order,” he added. Also Read: JEE-NEET: To hold or not to holdDue to the lockdown in the wake of Covid 19 pandemic and the subsequent rise of infections, the entrance examinations have been postponed thrice. The private B.Ed colleges have been demanding permission to admit students on the basis of marks received in their last qualifying examination. They wrote to the chancellor and also knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court for relief.Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU), Darbhanga, which is the nodal university for conducting 2020 CET-B.Ed, had also approached the apex court for further guidance.“We have proposed a tentative date of September 22 in anticipation that things will get better by then. We had made all the preparations for the test on March 29 itself, but the lockdown prevented its conduct. Later, we planned it on June 14, July 19, and September 13. Now, we will go by the SC order or the Raj Bhawan direction,” said LNMU nodal officer Ajit Kumar Singh.Watch: Odisha CM asks PM Modi to postpone JEE-NEET amid flood-like situation, Covid Officials in the Raj Bhawan said a way out of the current logjam would be worked out to hold the examination.As two-year B.Ed programme in Bihar is mostly run by the private colleges in self-financing mode on a fee of Rs 1.5-lakh-- fixed by the Raj Bhawan-- the institutions are hard pressed, fearing wash out of the session after having to bear with losses due to vacant seats for two consecutive years. Many proprietors of the B.Ed colleges said they were in no position to pay salary to their staff due to no admission in the current session. The Supreme Court, while hearing a case of a UP‘s Maa Vaishno Devi Mahila College in 2012, had ordered “adherence to admission schedule and strict conformity by all concerned, without exception”. “The authorities will also ensure that the students admitted complete the mandatory period of 200 days’ course in the B.Ed. as per norms of the NCTE,” it had observed. With the admission process likely to extend up to December, even if the exam is held on September 23, mandatory teaching for 200-days is just not possible. “Therefore, we urged the apex court to direct the authorities to take admissions on the basis of marks this year. The colleges are facing an acute financial crisis due to the lack of admissions. We have been suffering for the last two years due to one reason or the other,” said Dr Sanjay Kumar, convenor, Bihar state teachers’ training colleges association, who had approached the court for admission on marks-basis this year.In Bihar, there are around 350 teachers’ training colleges, out of which, over 90% are private institutions, employing over 5,500 teachers and around 3,000 non-teaching staff. Dhruv Kumar, head, department of education, Nalanda College, Bihar Sharif said that the new session should ideally begin in July first week. “Due to the extraordinary situation in the wake of the pandemic, there is no harm in allowing admissions on the marks-basis for the 2020-22 session. Some states like Chhatisgarh have already announced admission on the basis of marks this year, as conducting exams will not be easy due to high risks involved,” he added.The CET-B.Ed was an initiative of the Chancellor office to regulate the mushrooming of private teachers’ training colleges in the state. Compared to the first year in 2018, the number of candidates registered and appearing in the examination dropped last year. This year, 1.22-lakh candidates filled up the form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/sc-asks-bihar-governor-to-take-a-call-on-b-ed-entrance-test-within-5-days/story-5pyZOnQbW35jjlcQCbBy2K.html

JEE-Main and NEET for undergraduate engineering and medical course aspirants, respectively, will be held between September 1 and 6 and on September 13, respectively. CM Banerjee has said that millions of students and parents accompanying them to examination centres would be exposed to the risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders said that Banerjee would address a virtual rally on Friday afternoon and it is expected to be the party’s second big event during the Covid-19 pandemic after the annual Martyrs’ Day programme on July 21. Friday’s virtual rally will be broadcast live on social media. Also Read: JEE and NEET: 5 things you need to know todayWhile jointly convening a virtual meeting of CMs from non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states along with Congress’s interim president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday, Banerjee proposed that these states should move the Supreme Court (SC). “Didi (Banerjee) is happy with the response from the other CMs. At the meeting she said that Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik (who did not attend the meeting) might join his counterparts. On Thursday, Patnaik, who heads the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested him not to hold the examinations in September,” said a senior TMC leader, who did not want to be quoted. “This is Didi’s success,” he added. The BJP reacted sharply on Thursday. “WB CM Mamata Banerjee, after pleading inability to facilitate JEE/NEET exams, has now ordered a state-wide lockdown on September 11 and 12, to create difficulties for NEET examinees to reach the examination venue on September 13. In order to achieve her political goals, is she treading a dangerous path?” Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s national information technology (IT) cell, tweeted.Every year, TMC celebrates August 28 with a rally held near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the Maidan in central Kolkata. A small rally will be held on Friday morning because of the pandemic, when TMCP members will demand postponement of NEET and JEE. Other opposition parties in Bengal have also taken a stand, as the issue is expected to influence young and first-time voters in the assembly polls slated to be held next year. The Bengal unit of the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or the CPI (M), have demanded the postponement of the examinations. On Thursday, leader of the opposition in the West Bengal assembly and veteran Congress leader Abdul Mannan and CPI (M) lawmaker Sujan Chakraborty jointly wrote letter to Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, seeking postponement of NEET and JEE-Main examinations. Chhatra Parishad, the students’ wing of the Congress, will also celebrate its 67th foundation day through protests on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/mamata-banerjee-to-make-neet-jee-key-issue-on-tmc-students-wing-foundation-day/story-LGGWCrkw58YKC4P7EPxT7K.html

They were booked under section 420 (fraud) of IPC and relevant sections of IT Act 2000 on Wednesday. One of the accused, Kaushal Singh Bais of Delhi, is absconding, said police. Bhopal additional director general of police Upendra Jain said, “A nine-month investigation into a case in which an agriculture department officer in Bhopal lost Rs 80,000 from her bank account led us to this crime. The officer, Bhawna Pandey, received a call in which the caller claimed to be a bank employee and said her credit card limit would be increased if she shared some details. Later, she lost Rs 80,000 from her account.” Cybercrime cell of Bhopal police, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Sandesh Jain said, “The team investigating the matter found links of the gang after tracing a mobile number issued from Gwalior on a fake ID.” “Mohit Gupta and Mohan Gupta, who are brothers, used to create fake Aadhaar cards and voter ID cards by using a fake ID-maker application. They used their own photos on the fake IDs. Then they used these ID cards to create fake SIM cards. Since the SIM cards were fake, there was no verification required by the telecom companies. Then, they created fake accounts of a renowned e-commerce payment system on the basis of the fake SIM cards. The gang used to sell these fake SIM cards and fake accounts of the e-commerce payment system to gangs involved in cyber crimes. For each of the SIM cards and the fake accounts, they got Rs 500 each,” said Jain. He said the gang used another modus operandi too to dupe people and had created three WhatsApp groups to keep in touch with criminals in the other states. The accused were produced before the court on Wednesday and the court sent them on a three-day police remand. Police are interrogating them and also getting details of people who were associated with this gang through the WhatsApp groups, said Sandesh Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bhopal-police-arrests-7-in-fake-aadhaar-card-voter-id-scam/story-Bjs27BGjpMVW0YdJqY5iGP.html

The resignations paved the way for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s return to power in the state.Three more Congress lawmakers resigned from the state assembly and joined the BJP in July. The remaining two seats had fallen vacant due to the death of the sitting lawmakers. In the 230-member state assembly, the BJP has 107 lawmakers, Congress 97, BSP three and Samajwadi Party (SP) two. There are also four independent members in the House. After the bypolls, the majority mark in the state assembly will be 116.BSP, SP and three independent lawmakers announced their support to the BJP in March.State Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta said even in 2018 the BSP contested elections against the Congress but got just three seats. “The voters of the Congress are committed and the BSP’s decision to contest the byelections will not affect our prospects.”BJP leader Rajneesh Agrawal said every party has the right to field its candidates. “But we are going to win all the seats in the bypolls.”State BSP office secretary CL Gautam said, “The next list of the candidates will follow. We will contest all the 27 seats.”The other parties are yet to announce their candidates for the bypolls that are expected to be held by September. Political analyst Bhagwandev Israni said, “There is not going to be a major difference in the political situation during the bypolls in comparison to what state witnessed during 2018 assembly elections. Though BSP has some base in Gwalior-Chambal region and it can affect the prospects of a few candidates in certain constituencies, the contest will be mainly between the Congress and BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bsp-announces-names-of-eight-candidates-for-mp-bypolls/story-z2FamdPiNNXnQEPUqYEyxN.html

They arrested two suspects within 20 minutes of the crime. Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south), said that the robbers wanted to rob the two visually impaired passengers as well, but they didn’t find any items on them during the hurried robbery. The crime took place around 12.30am on Wednesday. Two visually challenged men hired a taxi to go to Mehrauli. “When the taxi reached Mehrauli, neither the driver nor the passengers knew the route ahead. So, the driver offered his mobile phone to one of the visually challenged passengers to call someone and ask for help,” another police officer said. In the meantime, the two suspects, who were loitering in the area, realised that the passengers were visually challenged and decided to take advantage of the situation. “They turned off the car’s ignition, held the driver down by the neck, threatened him against raising the alarm, and robbed his phone and Rs 1,000 in cash. They then turned their attention to the two passengers, but couldn’t find anything valuable on them. They then ran away,” DCP Thakur said. As soon as they were gone, the driver Shiv Charan, began shouting for help. “Soon, a police van reached the spot. Realising that the robbers couldn’t have made it very far since they were on foot, they asked the driver to accompany them in the vehicle as they went about looking for the suspects,” said the DCP. Within 10 minutes, one of the suspects was found in a parked Gramin Sewa vehicle. He was nabbed and, at his instance, his alleged associate too was caught within 20 minutes of the crime. The robbed cash and phone were recovered from them. The nabbed suspects were identified as Akash Khatta and Rohit (who goes by his first name)—both 23 years old. While Khatta had four previous cases of robbery and snatching registered against him, Rohit had been involved in one other crime, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-robbers-target-taxi-driver-visually-impaired-passengers-arrested-within-20-minutes/story-pL8RXhk52k1KtcWfmHTzuO.html

The truncated session began with obituary references at 11am and was adjourned for an hour after paying tributes to 28 personalities, including the Galwan bravehearts and former member of Parliament Gurdas Singh Badal. The assembly was convened amid the pandemic to fulfil the constitutional obligation of meeting within six months of the last session. SAD members skipped the meet due to the Covid-19 protocol after 30 state MLAs tested positive. Aam Aadmi Party legislators, however, chose to attend the session in personal protective equipment (PPE) gear. While 42 Congress legislators attended the session, six AAP MLAs, and two each from the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Lok Insaf Party were present in the House. Three AAP legislators, including leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, were not allowed in the House despite showing their Covid negative reports. The House was adjourned sine die at 2.10pm.AKALIS MISSED SESSION DELIBERATELY: CMMoving the resolution against the Centres’s farm ordinances, the chief minister said that the SAD should have attended the session. “They deliberately missed it as they knew this resolution will be passed in the assembly,” he said.Barring the BJP members, all MLAs unanimously supported the resolution.“Murder of democracy by Cong govt. Now police force posted outside SAD MLAs’ houses to prevent them from attending 1 hr assembly session. Such kind of oppression seen for first even though SAD announced it will act responsibly. We appeal to Governor, Pb to intervene & restore order,” Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia said in a tweet.CLINICAL ESTABLISHMENT BILL PASSEDThe Punjab Clinical Establishment Bill, the Guru Teg Bahadur Bill and the Punjab Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Amendment Bill were passed The AAP raised the issue of the post-matric scholarship scam with Master Baldev Singh asking Speaker Rana KP Singh to suspend cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot. Lok Insaf Party member Simarjeet Singh Bains also raised the issue and praised additional chief secretary Kirpa Shankar Saroj for submitting a report against the minister.COVID PROTOCOL AND ADVICEEarlier, AAP MLAs, including leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, Aman Arora, Meet Hayer and Sarabjit Kaur Manuke, reached the assembly wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. Cheema, Hayer, Manuke and Baldev Singh held a protest outside the assembly, alleging that despite their negative coronavirus test reports, they were not being allowed to attend the session.On Thursday, the chief minister and Speaker had appealed to all legislators, who had come in contact with COVID-positive MLAs, to avoid attending the day-long assembly session. Of the 30 MLAs who have tested positive so far, 20 are from the Congress, six from SAD and four from AAP, including a party rebel. Of them, seven have recovered. However, the AAP legislators, whose three colleagues tested positive this week, decided to attend the session, ignoring their advice. “Barring those who have tested positive, the other nine party MLAs will attend the session. Besides coronavirus, there are other issues such as Scheduled Caste (SC) scholarships, illicit liquor, the Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal and sand mafia that need to be raised. We took the decision at a virtual meeting,” Cheema said.Budhram and Manjit Singh Bilaspur, who have tested positive, had attended the AAP legislature party meeting three days ago in which seven other members were present. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) legislature group, on the other hand, decided not to attend the session as its MLAs had come in contact with their colleague Gurpartap Singh Wadala, who later tested positive. SAD legislature party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said the party was following Vidhan Sabha rules and Covid-19 guidelines. The decision was taken at a meeting of the legislature party on Friday morning.The Speaker had given the advice after a group of AAP MLAs met him and the SAD legislature party leader wrote to him. According to the Covid-19 protocol, all contacts of positive persons have to quarantine themselves for 14 days. PROTESTS OUTSIDE THE HOUSELok Insaaf Party members Simarjeet Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains protested against the Scheduled Caste scholarship scam outside Punjab Bhawan. Both demanded the dismissal of social welfare minister Dharamsot.Though the SAD MLAs stayed away, youth Akali activists, led by state chief Parambans Banti Romana, were detained by Chandigarh Police for protesting outside the Vidhan Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-day-monsoon-session-of-punjab-assembly-begins-at-11am-under-covid-shadow-suspense-over-participation-of-aap-sad-mlas/story-UGyd0j2kkO65DEw36ploaK.html

28-08-2020||Lucknow||NEET, JEE amid pandemic leave UP candidates, parents a worried lot||The forthcoming Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) – to be held between September 1 and 6 and on September 13 for undergraduate engineering and medical course aspirants, respectively -- amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak have left several candidates and their parents a worried lot. Diwakar Gupta, the father of Dipesh Gupta, a NEET candidate and a resident of a village in Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Sitapur district, has been anxious over the past few days. He has been in constant touch with a local taxi driver and sought his assurance to drive Gupta to his examination centre on the date of the examination on September 13, as the transportation facility from his native village is few and far between. Transport woes have further worsened because of the pandemic.“My NEET examination centre is around 60 kilometres (km) from my home. My father has booked a private vehicle since there is no direct transport between my home and the examination centre,” said Dipesh. Though Diwakar Gupta has already paid Rs 6,000 in advance to the taxi driver, he still can’t rest easy.“Will it be safe for my son to travel such a long distance, when Covid-19 cases are on the rise? Is it not like playing with the lives of our children?” he thought aloud. “The leaders, who have decided to go ahead with conducting these examinations, must review their decision and postpone it until Covid-19 is under control,” he added.National Testing Agency (NTA), the nodal body that conducts entrance tests for higher educational institutions, has assured taking measures to ensure safety of the candidates.The agency has increased the number of examination centres in a bid to enforce social distancing norms at each centres. Steps are also being taken to ensure candidates can appear at “centres that are close to their homes”. On Tuesday, NTA had issued a press statement that showed UP has the second-highest number of candidates, who are slated to appear for NEET. A total of 1,66,582 students will appear for NEET in 320 centres in UP on September 13, as compared 1,39,497 candidates in 188 centres last year. NEET is a pen-and-paper examination, unlike JEE-Main, an online exercise.JEE-Main will be conducted in 66 centres in UP between September 1 and 6 in shifts. A total of 1,00,706 candidates from UP are expected to appear for JEE-Main this year. Last year, 85,898 JEE-Main candidates from UP had appeared for the examination that was held in 47 centres, NTA data showed. The testing agency has claimed to have distributed the examination centres across UP, despite allegations of bias towards candidates from urban areas. Yashwant Singh, a JEE-Main candidate, who lives in a village in UP’s Badaun district, said, “I will have to travel over 120 km to reach the exam centre. This is a risky proposition amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Candidates, who live in urban areas, will have to travel a much shorter distance to reach their respective examination centres,” said Singh. Several students have claimed that their preparations for the upcoming examinations were affected because of the pandemic and many are still hoping that the examinations will be postponed owing to the pandemic..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/neet-jee-amid-pandemic-leave-up-candidates-parents-a-worried-lot/story-Jd0JVS0YLozQT4KbjHLKiO.html

The basic education department had paid Rs 32 lakh for the construction of the school building to Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) at the time but the building never got completed, officials of the education department admitted. Two multi-storey schools were sanctioned by the then Mayawati-led BSP state government in 2010-11 under the Sarwa Shiksha Abhiyan at Jhalwa and Phaphamau at Kanshiram Awas Yojana. The plan was to make available quality education to students of class 1 to class 8 under the same roof here. The state government had even sanctioned Rs 32 lakh each for the construction of the two school buildings. The task of the construction was entrusted to PDA (then Allahabad development Authority) which started the construction work of both buildings in 2011.

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Five doctors at AIIMS, Bathinda, test positive for Covid-19 over past 10 days||Bathinda: Five doctors at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bathinda have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 10 days. AIIMS director Dr DK Singh is among those in home quarantine after three doctors tested positive on Thursday. Official sources said the cases started surfacing after the AIIMS staff, including the management of the central institute, took part in the Independence Day function on the campus. Social distancing was not observed at the function and AIIMS staff was seen posing for photos without masks. Officials were seen interacting with colleagues and guests at the event. AIIMS deputy director Col Devender Rawat (retd) said on Friday that additional medical superintendent Dr Satish Gupta was the first person from the institute to test positive last week. He said eight staff members of the institute are in home quarantine though none of them has a serious health condition. The official said the report of more staff members is awaited. Rawat did not deny that Covid-19 guidelines were violated on the campus on August 15. “It is unfair to associate the triggering of infection cases with the Independence Day function. Had it been the case, several more of our team members would have been found infected by now. We have been taking all measures to check any Covid suspect on the campus,” he said. The AIIMS director and Dr Gupta were present at the function. Bathinda chief medical officer Amrik Singh Sandhu did not respond to phone calls and text messages to know precautionary steps being taken by the health department as the outpatient department service (OPD) is operational at AIIMS. After it resumed OPD services on April 7, AIIMS made arrangements where patients are attended only in the spacious reception area. Doctors listen to visiting patients through intercom phone lines placed outside rooms with glass partitions. Rawat said all precautions are being taken at the OPD and only doctors who are not showing any symptom of the infection, are put on duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-doctors-at-aiims-bathinda-test-positive-for-covid-19-over-past-10-days/story-WHUecpEUOC9xbKAECfqCDO.html

28-08-2020||City||Paan stall owner held for killing employee near Mumbai||The Kalyan crime branch on Thursday arrested a 28-year-old paan shop owner for allegedly murdering his employee on August 21 on the suspicion that the victim stole money from his stall. The paan shop is located on the Manpada Road in Dombivli. The victim Surij Pal, 18, was a resident of Uttar Pradesh and had come to Dombivli seeking employment. He worked for the accused, Sunil Patel,along with two more employees, who are also allegedly involved in the murder. On August 21 between 2pm and 3.30pm, an argument broke out between Patel and Pal at the paan shop. Patel accused Pal of stealing money from the shop. During the argument Pal was assaulted with wooden sticks, gas pipe and belt and his head was also smashed to the floor and wall, leading to his death. To destroy the evidences, Patel along with the two other workers covered Pal’s body in a sack and carried it to the nearby lake and dumped into it. The crime came to limelight after police naik Rajendra Khilare of Kalyan crime branch unit 3 realised that Pal was absent at the shop from some days. He then began inquiring about Pal with his sources in the area. “I always saw Pal in the shop or the nearby areas. But as he was missing from the past few days, I enquired to others about him. Someone claimed that he was not well, so I offered to help as he was poor. However, when he could not be traced, I got suspicious and informed my seniors,” said Khilare. The crime branch then started investigating the case after Khilare’s report. Senior inspector Sanju John from crime branch, unit 3, said, “Some informers told us about the fight. So we searched for the paan stall owner and nabbed him from at Pandurang Vaze compound, Manpada, and interrogated him. During the questioning, he revealed that with the help of his other labourers, he killed Pal.” The crime branch is now searching for the other two accused. Patel will be produced before the Kalyan court on Friday. A case under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered with the Manpada police station on Thursday. “After the revelations by Patel, the crime branch team searched the lake and found the sack with Pal’s body. The body was sent to Rukminibai Hospital in Kalyan for post-mortem,” added John. Kalyan deputy commissioner of police Vivek Pansare said, “Even though the crime took place a week ago, there was no missing report filed at the police station. The crime unfolded because Khilare managed to find out that Pal was missing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paan-stall-owner-held-for-killing-staffer/story-d1louAIxKwG3qW6R7jZKnM.html
28-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Chai served with a crossword puzzle||It’s like a crossword puzzle. Sirajuddin tea stall is one of the city’s most fascinating street-side chai stops. Its uniqueness is found in a shelf clamped onto the wall. This has wooden slabs running from top to bottom, and from left to right. This divides the shelf into an array of square-shaped spaces, making it look like the sort of crossword puzzles you often find in newspapers.Except, of course, that instead of alphabet letters, the little boxes are casually crammed up with tea things. One box has ginger sprigs and a pink mug. Another has a kettle, whose chipped texture is so evocative of the everyday chai civilisation that an Anand Niketan aesthete might feel like stealing it for her drawing room display. An adjacent box is filled with tea glasses, along with white China cups, while the box below is stocked with a tiny metal trunk—possibly a cash box. A box on the top row is over-crowded with rusting metallic tea carriers that can hold several chai glasses together.The stall was founded in 1977 in Old Delhi’s Turkman Gate bazaar by Muhammed Sirajuddin, who gave it his name. He lies buried in the Dilli Gate graveyard in ITO, and the little landmark is now run by his two sons. Alimuddin, who sits during the first half of the day, is full of jokes and gossip, but he is also capable of sudden flashes of anger—which however dissipate within moments. Younger brother, Sirajuddin, is quieter by contrast and mostly communicates via his gentle smile, as if he was secretly amused at the ways of the world.“Everything about this chai stall was set up by our father, including this wooden shelf,” confirms Alimuddin. The brothers’ home is just a few steps away.The stall has a couple of steps strung up beside it and one does see customers crowding upon them, enjoying their chai while watching the busy traffic of humans, goats, dogs, mules, cats and rats go by on the lively street.The more prestigious seating, though, is just across the lane, under a tree, on a platform beside an unknown person’s marble grave. The tea shop regulars sit there all day long, chatting with each other, over endless cups of Sirajuddin’s milky chai. The stall also serves the usual chai snacks such as fen and ‘biskuts’. The place serves daily from 5am to 10pm though it used to be open till late into the night during the pre-corona days.One rare afternoon, for some reason, the stall was found closed. The beautiful shelf was shut closed with a plain wooden lid. The sight was haunting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-chai-served-with-a-crossword-puzzle/story-UWsEVUIYQtju4TVmBBiiYI.html

The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhavan Jamdar directed the civic body to restore the supply to Oshiwara Link Plaza Commercial Premises Cooperative Housing Society, where 119 commercial units such as hotels, restaurant and shops did not get water for about a month. The society moved HC after the civic body discontinued its water supply on account of non-payment of property taxes. Their counsel, advocate Swarali Joglekar, pointed out that there were 28 major defaulters and because of their defaults in paying property taxes the action was taken by the corporation. Joglekar also pointed out that though BMC was citing non-payment of taxes as the reason for disconnecting water supply to the building, nine commercial tenements in the building are allotted to BMC, but the civic body has not paid a rupee towards maintenance charges to the society. A lawyer for BMC responded to the petition, pointing out that the action was taken, as huge amounts were outstanding against the society members. The lawyer said that property taxes to the tune of Rs2.65 crore and dues of the marketing department worth Rs86 lakh were outstanding since 1997, and therefore the action was taken. The civic lawyer, however, could not answer the court’s query as to whether a municipal corporation can discontinue water supply due to non-payment of property taxes. Observing that such action cannot be taken, HC directed BMC to forthwith restore water supply to the commercial building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restore-water-supply-to-andheri-building-high-court-to-mumbai-civic-body/story-3E0thOtfiA1eySbitES03N.html

The corporation has filled 1,224 potholes spread over 2,231.8 square metres until Thursday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the city on Monday, directed the civic authority to fill the potholes on the roads once the city witnesses dry spell. An official from TMC said, “The city had 1,323 potholes before we began the filling work. We have filled 1,224 potholes and only 156 potholes are now remaining. The city witnessed dry spell during which the work was carried out on war footing. If it does not rain heavily in the next two to three days, the roads will be in better condition.” Due to lack of pre-monsoon repair works, most roads in the city had developed potholes. The city witnessed protests over potholes in the past few weeks. Civic chief Dr Vipin Sharma had directed that action will be taken against the contractors and officials concerned if potholes on the roads are not filled. “We will be using cold-mix concretTe, cement concrete, paver blocks and bitumen, depending on the requirement and congestion on each of the roads, to fill these potholes,” the official said.Naupada and Diva have the maximum potholes in the city. The pothole-filling work is undertaken at Teen Hath Naka, Nitin Company junction, Louiswadi, Majiwada, Castle Mill, Modella Check Naka, Teen Hath Naka junction, Saket and Balkum areas among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-224-potholes-repaired-thane-municipal-corporation/story-7IfO5hkI4QWZJyPfpAwVXK.html

Thackeray, who participated in a video conference with Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday, thanked the Centre for the two ordinances issued for the reforms in marketing in the agriculture produce. Thackeray has also urged the Centre for the district-level offices of the insurance companies to ensure easy redressal of farmers’ grievances related to the insurance scheme. The Centre was also requested for more steps for the timely crop loan supply to the farmers.“The central government has recently made changes in the cost sharing for the premium on the crop insurance, reducing its own share. The Centre now bears equal share upto 30% of the premium while the state is left to bear the remaining cost. We have requested the Centre to go back to the previous formula of equal sharing of the premium,” said Eknath Dawale, secretary, agriculture department. Agriculture minister Dada Bhuse demanded for the soft loan at 1% interest rate to the farmers, their produce companies for agriculture infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-cm-asks-centre-to-cover-equal-share-of-crop-insurance-premium/story-1nEU1WOp18sXoiFOaU07iJ.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Decentralised debris processing first proposed in MMR 21 years ago, but Mumbai yet to get construction waste recycling plant: CSE report||Mumbai is yet to get its first operational debris recycling unit three years after the municipal corporation first proposed its inception, a report published on Wednesday by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Delhi, stated. Mumbai is among 40 cities across the country that is set to get the recycling units. The report showed cities such as Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Indore, and Ahmedabad have at least one construction waste processing facility, operated either run by the civic body or on a public-private partnership. The report has stated that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) was the first in India to come up with a decentralised solution for debris management in 1999 in Navi Mumbai, promoted by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action (Yuva) and the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) Ltd. The collaboration led to 1,500 tonnes of recycled construction and demolition (C&D) waste at Cidco Yuva Building Centre (CYBC). However, it was forced to shut down in 2012 after it failed to receive the policy or market support. “The C&D initiative had originally started with Mumbai. But the scale of transformation that should have happened unfortunately broke down. While work may have started, it needs to be ramped up with a clear roadmap in terms of utilisation and resource recovery,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE. In 2016, the Union environment ministry notified the C&D Waste Management Rules, which stipulated that permissions for new constructions or redevelopment will be granted only after local civic bodies develop their own plan to treat and recycle waste and private builders submit a waste management plan to the civic body and state pollution control board. In February 2016, the Bombay high court (HC) imposed a two-year-old moratorium on new constructions in the city for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) failure to dispose C&D waste. The Supreme Court lifted the moratorium in March 2018. By 2017, 53 cities were expected to set up recycling facilities to recover material from the waste but only 13 have done so till date. In 2017 itself, BMC had proposed recycling 95% of the city’s C&D waste. Of the 1,200 tonnes of C&D waste generated per day, BMC planned a 2.7 hectare recycling unit at Mulund to treat 1,140 tonnes of waste into sand, clay and bricks. Its construction was expected to commence in 2018 but never took off. “Mumbai, with the richest urban local body, is still waiting to have an operational C&D waste recycling facility even after additional pressure from HC, which has issued multiple orders asking for urgent setting up of a C&D recycling facility in the city,” the CSE report highlighted. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said tenders issued in 2017-18 did not get the right response from bidders. “On Tuesday, I took a detailed review and have directed that the tender be re-floated after amending some guidelines. We are hoping that fresh tenders will be uploaded over the next two weeks, and are expecting better participation from the private sector. We will act as a facilitator by providing an area to the contractor to set up a plant. If private land is available, then the plant can be set up by a private party, and we will pay a tipping fee for taking C&D waste to it.” Kakani added that some sites had been earmarked at Deonar and Kanjur dumping grounds where C&D waste was being dumped. “The quantity is not more than 300 tonnes per day this year during the lockdown as no major construction works were underway. Only demolition of dilapidated buildings has been the source of this waste,” he said. Apart from starting a debris-on-call service (to identify illegal dumping of construction debris through complaints in 2015), BMC had also identified 14 sites (private areas) in MMR that were chosen to dump construction and demolition waste to ensure natural areas like river floodplains and mangrove patches were not used. Chowdhury said Mumbai has a collection system but needs to establish a protocol to ensure segregation right from the construction site (into concrete, metal, plastic etc.), identify collection points, and then take it to a recycling plant to produce new material (paver blocks, tiles etc.). “It needs to be brought back into construction to substitute naturally sourced material. This demands a circular economy that can turn C&D waste into a resource. The construction industry has to mandate that certain percentage of their building material needs to use recycled C&D waste,” she said. Improper C&D waste collection direct source of air pollution Heaps of concrete, bricks and metal waste from construction are choking water bodies, green areas and public spaces in cities Toxic dust particles from the debris are polluting air, at a time when cities have to reduce their particulate pollution by 20-30% by 2024, under the ongoing National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) The Swachh Bharat Mission has recognised the need for C&D waste management. Ranking points for C&D waste management for Swachh Survekshan2021 have been doubled to 100 points, divided equally between management infrastructure and waste processing efficiency The regions of Mumbai, Thane, Dombivli and other cities in the MMR have been witnessing a year-on-year increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 10 (solid and liquid particles less than 10 microns suspended in the air) as a direct result of failure to control dust emissions from construction activities in MMR, transportation of C&D waste, condition of roads and ready-mix-concrete plants as major factors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decentralised-debris-processing-first-proposed-in-mmr-21-years-ago-but-mumbai-yet-to-get-construction-waste-recycling-plant-cse-report/story-vK1XtjCW3KUjU1Tge9rhMM.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay’s new app to scan documents, read aloud contents using artificial intelligence||Two final-year BTech students from Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay’s (IIT-B) department of civil engineering have developed a free-of-cost mobile application that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to scan documents and read them aloud to the user. The AIR Scanner app offers document scanner features such as scanning, organising and sharing documents. What sets it apart from the existing document scanners is the AI-enabled reading assistant which understands words in a page. The students, Rohit Kumar Chaudhary and Kavin Agrawal, were inspired to create the application after the Centre banned several commonly-used Chinese apps. “The AI reading assistant has two significant features— a dictionary and a narrator,” said Chaudhary. With a single tap on word boxes, the user gets its full-fledged meaning including examples, synonyms, pronunciation and translation in over 40 languages. Users can also import e-books and newspaper snippets and have the mobile application read it aloud to them. “Currently the app supports only English language for assisted reading. But soon we will be rolling out an update that will support Hindi and other local languages,” said Chaudhary. The developers are mulling filing a patent for the technology. Meanwhile, the institute claimed that the application would give stiff competition to existing document scanning applications. “In the times of Covid-19 pandemic, along with the online education and work-from-home model, it can prove to be of great help,” said the institute in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-s-new-app-to-scan-documents-read-aloud-contents-using-artificial-intelligence/story-FbwRot6vMOXBttctAZPnYN.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Dharavi revamp to see more delay as Maharashtra govt plans to float new tenders||The Dharavi revamp project, which aims to transform India’s largest slum into a plush township, is likely to suffer a huge setback, as the state government is planning to scrap the existing tender, which was bagged by the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based SecLink Technology Corporation (STC), and float a fresh tender.The ambitious ₹28,000 crore Dharavi revamp project, conceived 16 years ago, is likely to be delayed further if the new tenders are floated.The issue was discussed on Thursday by the committee of secretaries (CoS), which supported the view presented by advocate general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni in January. The AG said that fresh tenders needed to be called for as the costs of the railway land and rehabilitation was added later and not incorporated in the original tender document.In February last year, the tender to revamp the 601-acre project was bagged by STC and funded by the UAE royal family. However, the problem emerged in March when the state government led by Devendra Fadnavis acquired a 45-acre railway land for ₹800 crore. As this was not mentioned in the tender, AG’s views were sought on the development. STC, which threatened to seek a compensation of ₹2,299 crore from the state if it was not awarded the contract, however, took a U-turn. “We will respect the government’s decision and bid again for the project,” said an STC spokesperson. Dharavi residents are disappointed over the plan to float new bids. “We have been shown dreams of new houses from the past 16 years and now when the project was about to start, they added a new clause and derailed it,” said Raju Korde, president, Dharavi Redevelopment Committee.He said the residents will approach the courts, as this is deliberately being done to deprive Dharavi residents of redevelopment.Baburao Mane, who heads the Dharavi Bachao Andolan, says it is doubtful if a new firm can bag the project. “What was the reason behind not giving a green signal to SecLink, considering it had bought in the money and had the competency to execute the mega project? Currently, no one has this huge capital to invest in Dharavi,” said Mane. Mane’s worry is legit as STC had deposited ₹28,000 crore in an escrow account in Dubai and was waiting for the green signal from the state.The Dharavi revamp project commenced on February 4, 2004, but has been marred with controversies, with one of the key issues being the eligibility for the redeveloped flats, as it was found that majority of the present residents did not qualify for the new houses. The constant flip-flops by the government have also driven away many builders.What is the Dharavi revamp scheme The ambitious Dharavi revamp project which started on February 4, 2004, envisaged a plush township by architect Mukesh Mehta. The slum was divided into five sectors and it was decided to issue tenders simultaneously for each sector. The state government formed the Dharavi Redevelopment Authority (DRA) and also floated a global tender for all the sectors in 2007. The response was outstanding, as 101 companies took part in the process. However, over the years, the project kept languishing and finally in 2011, the entire process was cancelled. The same year, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) was given Sector 5, while the tenders for the other sectors were floated for this year. In 2018, the sector plan was scrapped and it was decided to float tenders for the entire area.February 4, 2004 Dharavi Redevelopment Project planned by the state governmentJune 1, 2007 Global tenders for expression of interest invited for the Dharavi Project. Nineteen consortiums selected after due processMarch 2009 Global slowdown forces five firms to walk out of the process, citing lack of clarity and delay in implementationJuly 7, 2009 Expert committee debunks the project and passes adverse remarks against its consultant.

28-08-2020||Mumbai||Tourism boost: Five-star hotels to come up at Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg, Tadoba reserve||In a bid to boost tourism in the state, the Maharashtra government on Thursday inked lease deed and memorandums of understanding (MoU) with two hotel groups to build five-star facilities at Sindhudurg and Tadoba national park near Chandrapur.Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) signed a deed with Indian Hotels Company Ltd, which runs Taj Hotels, for development of a five-star tourist facility at Shiroda-Velagar, Sindhudurg district, while the tourism department signed an MoU with Thriving Hotel Pvt Ltd for another five-star hotel around Tadoba reserve to boost tourism. The hotel groups are expected to construct the properties in a span of three years.“For us at the Tourism dept, it was a moment of pride. Our Mission Begin Again will get a boost as more hotel groups are coming to Maharashtra to give a boost to international tourism in Maharashtra… Both these hotels will bring more than ₹125 crore of investment to Maharashtra (sic),” State tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted after the deals were inked at chief minister’s (CM’s) official residence Varsha. He added that the department, through its schemes and plans, will see to it that the tourism sector contributes the maximum in the state’s gross domestic product (GDP) in the next six months.The state cabinet on June 10 passed a proposal to allot 54.40-hectare land at Shiroda in Vengurla tehsil of Sindhudurg district for a five-star facility. With the deal signed on Thursday, the land has been given at 90-year lease at a nominal rent for tourism development in state’s tourism district.The land, according to officials, has been leased at a nominal rent of ₹1 and one-time premium of 110% of ready-reckoner rate.The proposal was stuck in limbo for over 25 years. After the decision to allot land to the Taj Group was taken in 1994, the land was acquired in stages till 1998 by MTDC. Part of the land is in the group’s possession, while it has been pushing for possession of the remaining land.“Taj Hotels Group has officially come to Sindhudurg now. The district, meant to be a tourism hub, was awaiting this crown for 2 decades. The MVA Govt resolved the issues in the first 3 months & today an MoU was signed. In 3 years’ time, a Taj Hotel will be running in Shiroda,” tweeted Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the state has several beaches, forts, forests and tigers in Tadoba reserve. “We should introduce these places before the world in the right manner. The state is always encouraging investment in the tourism sector. With Taj Hotels coming to Konkan, the world will know the splendour of Konkan,” Thackeray said in a statement from the chief minister’s office.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar added that the development in tourism will lead to an increase in employment opportunities in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tourism-boost-five-star-hotels-to-come-up-at-maharashtra-s-sindhudurg-tadoba-reserve/story-l3OTVq8v47YtxX4cJlJ7EK.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Junior college admissions in Mumbai: Despite good Class 10 results, few students from state board in top spots||Despite the number of students scoring 90% and above in their Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations of the state board increased substantially this year (a 191% jump from 2019), students from the other education boards dominated top berths in junior college admissions in the city. Data from the provisional general merit list for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions has revealed that of the top 100 students in the merit list for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), only 35 are from state board schools. While 52 students are from the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) board, 13 are from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Even among the top 50 students in the merit list, only 20 were from the state board. The state education department announced a provisional general merit list on its official website earlier this week. This year, 2.42 lakh students have applied for admissions to 3.20 lakh seats in MMR. Of these, 19,437 have scored 90% and above – a 20% rise from 2019. Similarly, 3,802 students have scored 95% and above, which is a surge of about 28%. While students from the state board make up over 90% (2.21 lakh) of the total applicants for FYJC admissions, when it comes to the top spots, they are still less in comparison to that from the other boards. Experts said that the other boards have a higher number of top scorers because the number of students studying in these boards is increasing in the city. “Earlier, we had only a few CBSE and ICSE schools in the city, but as the number is growing, so are students who are opting for these boards. Thus, the competition is bound to increase,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Churchgate’s Jai Hind College. The number of students from ICSE schools applying for admissions in junior colleges seat went up from 7,881 in 2019 to 11,110 this year. The number of CBSE students also increased from 5,969 in 2019 to 7,708 this year. “With so many top scorers vying for a select few colleges, competition is bound to get tougher. Not all high scorers would get the college of their preference,” said the principal of a suburban college. The first merit list for FYJC admissions would be declared on August 30. This year, the admission process will be ‘zero contact’ due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Students will get text messages on their phones, and colleges will also release a list of selected students once the merit list is announced. Students will be able to check the college allotted to them through the FYJC admission portal. 2.42 lakh Total applications Board-wise applications 2.21 lakh SSC 11,110 ICSE 7,708 CBSE 1,300 IGCSE (International General Certificate of Secondary Education) 992 NIOS (National Institute of Open Schooling) 545 Others Percentage-wise comparison 95% and above 3,802 2020 2,974 2019 90% and above 19,437 2020 16,188 2019 FYJC seats bagged by students Top 100 52 ICSE 35 SSC 13 CBSE Top 50 24 ICSE 20 SSC 6 CBSE||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/junior-college-admissions-in-mumbai-despite-good-class-10-results-few-students-from-state-board-in-top-spots/story-hFetql1ATvS8Djps28Y6HJ.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death probe: ED takes Rhea Chakraborty’s father to check family’s bank locker in Mumbai||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday summoned actor Rhea Chakraborty’s father, Indrajeet Chakraborty, to access his family’s bank lockers to probe possible money laundering in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.Indrajeet, who had sought police protection to be escorted to the bank, was taken to the Vakola branch of Axis Bank at 2.30pm and he returned to the family’s home in Santacruz at 9.30pm. He was summoned specifically with the locker keys, said ED officials, who were present at the bank. The central agency had, on July 31, registered an Enforcement Case Information Report in the case after a First Information Report (FIR) was filed on July 28 by the Bihar police on basis of a complaint by KK Singh, the late actor’s father, against Rhea. Earlier on August 10, ED had questioned Rhea, Indrajeet and her brother, Showik Chakraborty. Later, her manager, Shruti Modi, and Rajput’s friend and roommate Siddharth Pithani, too, were questioned. Investigators had extracted information into the formation of four companies by Rajput and Chakraborty, and her family. Two of these companies were registered, while the other two were under the process of being registered. Investigators wanted to understand the terms mentioned in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed during the formation of these companies to understand how the profit sharing was designed. ED sources said Rhea had responded to all questions, but could not divulge details of the exact sequence of events. ED has also questioned Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda, Chakraborty’s chartered accountant (CA) Ritesh Shah, and Rajput’s CA Sandeep Sridhar in the case. Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14. The post-mortem report concluded he died by suicide. The probe was handed over to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by Supreme Court, after it upheld the validity of the Bihar Police’s FIR.The CBI started questioning Showik since Thursday noon, and at the time of going to press, he was still being quizzed. The agency also continued questioning Rajput’s cook, Neeraj Singh, domestic help, Keshav Bachner, and Pithani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-probe-ed-takes-rhea-chakraborty-s-father-to-check-family-s-bank-locker-in-mumbai/story-RvQZk9CGMWEaNrLKWI3fSL.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC dismisses PIL questioning operation of PM Cares Fund||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the operation of the PM Cares Fund, created by the Central government to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in India.The bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Anil Kilor found no substance in the PIL filed by Arvind Waghmare, a practicing lawyer from Nagpur. Waghmare had sought a direction to the chairperson of the fund, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to appoint three other trustees, with at least two of them from among opposition members of Parliament (MPs).He had also sought a direction to the fund to disclose on its website all the contributions received and outgoings and to update the information once a week to ensure transparency in the operation of the fund.Waghmare submitted that the scheme of the fund itself required it’s chairperson to nominate three eminent persons in the field of research, health, science, etc, as other trustees, but no appointments were made in terms of the trust deed. He had questioned the validity of the decisions taken so far by the fund, on this ground of non-appointment of other trustees.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh strenuously opposed the PIL, contending that it was “more of a publicity interest litigation with underlying political agenda”. He submitted that the improper intention of the petitioner could be gauged by the fact that he contributed an amount of ₹1,001 to the fund on May 8, and filed the PIL the next day as a ‘contributor’.As regards the appointment of trustees, the bench noticed that the chairperson has been vested with the power to nominate three eminent personalities as trustees. “The words ‘has the power to nominate’ are clearly enabling. They only confer capacity, power or authority and imply discretion. This provision nowhere says that it shall be mandatory for the chairperson to nominate three trustees. There is nothing in the provision which even hints at some duty to exercise the power,” the bench said.The bench accepted Singh’s contention that acceding to the prayer for appointment of two opposition MPs on the trust would amount to making changes in the trust deed and rejected the prayer.“The wish so nurtured by the petitioner in person, in our considered view, cannot be fulfilled as it has no mooring in law,” said the bench. It clarified that since PM Cares Fund is a charitable trust registered under the Registration Act, it required no further clarification from the court that such a body would be governed by its deed of trust. It added that if no provision was made in the trust deed to induct some members of the opposition parties into the board of trustees, “an outsider like the petitioner” cannot knock on the doors of the HC to indirectly get the trust deed amended.With respect to the relief about disclosures of receipts and outgoings of the fund, the bench said there can be no two opinions about the underlying object of public disclosure. It is to ensure proper utilisation of the fund money. However, the court added that this object can be seen to be more than fulfilled by registration of the fund as a charitable trust under the Registration Act, 1908, which contains adequate provisions for obtaining such information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-dismisses-pil-questioning-operation-of-pm-cares-fund/story-AkMSBj32QeLY5UuWpuGCwL.html

While the neighbouring cities of Thane, Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar and Badlapur have seen a drastic decrease in the number of cases, and some have a recovery rate of more than 90%, KDMC is struggling to maintain the recovery rate at 85%. Currently, the number of active cases in KDMC is 3,343. Residents blame lack of control over lockdown violators and inefficient crowd management for the rise. Civic officials, however, claim citizens ignore symptoms. Dr Prashant Patil, Indian Medical Association, Kalyan chapter, said, “With festivities and public holidays over the weekend, many ignored the symptoms to avoid testing. They only underwent tests when the symptoms aggravated. This led to fluctuation in numbers in the past two weeks. After the Independence Day weekend too, the number was in the range of 200 to 250 cases.” Rajat Rajan, social worker, Dombivli, said, “As per lockdown norms, pillion riders are not allowed, but we see even three people on two-wheelers. Similarly, people step out of their houses regularly to visit shops and markets. Very few housing societies check visitors. With no efforts towards crowd management, the number of cases in KDMC has not seen a decline yet.” Michael Gomes, 43, resident of Kalyan West, said, “Earlier, there were set timings, housing societies would open gates only for few hours in the day. This would ensure less movement of people and that too only for essentials. Now with offices and markets opening up, housing societies do not have any time limit.” He said: “The virus was initially restricted to slums or crowded pockets, but is now spreading to housing societies as well. Although KDMC seals the entire wing if a positive case is found, many societies manage to get away with it.” Activists claimed that the corporation should take a leaf out of neighbouring Bhiwandi and Thane cities to find solutions. “In Bhiwandi, the newly appointed commissioner took into confidence various social organisations and religious leaders to create awareness. In Thane city, various teams of volunteers who are a part of the survey and contact tracing give real-time updates. However, KDMC has not adopted any policy to take help of residents to curb the spread. Although people are cooperating there are at least 2% of them who end up crowding the markets or loiter around unnecessarily,” said Sriniwas Ghanekar, activist, Kalyan. KDMC officers claim they have been making awareness announcements in markets and public places for more than four months since the pandemic began. They have also roped in various volunteers to conduct door-to-door survey and contact tracing. Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC, said the cases are more due to increased tracing and testing. “We have taken various steps especially in the first week of August to contain the spread of the virus. The war rooms set up in each ward take necessary action. The daily reports on the cases in all wards are assessed and accordingly we also conduct testing camps.” Dr Pratibha Panpatil, pandemic officer, said, “We did not have our own testing laboratory initially which led to a delay of four to eight days to get the test results. After KDMC started its own testing facility, we are focusing on tracing high-risk contacts. We contact them directly and also offer swab collection facility at home. The rise in numbers depends on the number of tests on that day. Our recovery rate is improving as we are able to provide timely treatment.” She said that compulsory testing is also imposed on shop owners and grocery store workers through medical camps, while senior citizens are also given priority. “With increased screening, we are focussing on controlling the spread of the virus. Our initial focus was on improving treatment and recovery facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-dombivli-tops-in-covid-19-cases-in-thane-district-residents-blame-civic-body/story-72ychLDc97kTIw1asoG31L.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||‘10 in every 100 Covid patients above 50 years in Mumbai succumbed’||Ten in every 100 Covid-19 patients above the age of 50 years in Mumbai have succumbed to the infection, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The case fatality rate in patients above 50 years is 10.64%, higher than Mumbai’s average of 5.4%, shows the data available for 132,221 cases and age-wise break-up for 7,419 deaths. Among those over 50 years, the 80-89 age group has the highest case fatality rate of 21.2% – 664 of the 3,131 who tested positive died. While 9,463 patients in the 70-79 age group tested positive, 1,496 died, with a case fatality rate of 15.81%. The highest number of deaths was recorded in the 60-69 age group – 2,122 deaths from among 18,454 patients, and a case fatality rate of 11.49%. The case fatality rate is lowest in children below 9 years (0.49%), with 12 deaths out of 2,439 cases. Doctors have attributed the higher fatality rate in older patients to a ‘compromised’ or ‘exhausted’ immune system, along with co-morbidity. Dr Shashank Joshi, a senior city-based doctor who was part of the Maharashtra government’s task force set up in April to reduce mortality in the state, said, “Senior citizens are more vulnerable because they have weaker immunity and their immune surveillance mechanism fails. There is something called as immunological aging. The body’s ability to mount a robust response becomes weak with age. Senior citizens also have higher incidence of co-morbidity such as hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases.” According to Dr Joshi, patients with co-morbidity are a vulnerable group, as they have a higher chance of getting a more severe infection. He said, “The Covid-19 virus docks in the ACE2 receptor, so there is local activation of some chemicals. It is an angiotensin converting receptor, which means it has a direct link to heart and diabetes, and the body’s metabolism. That is why they have a higher chance of getting a more severe disease, and the more severe the disease, the higher the chance of a patient passing away.” Children, on the other hand, have an organ called thymus which makes T lymphocytes, and is the main organ which fights respiratory viral infection. “Children are born with protection to clear the virus,” Dr Joshi said. Dr Om Shrivastav, a senior city-based consultant for infectious diseases, who was also part of Maharashtra government’s task force to formed in April to reduce the case fatality rate in the state, said, “The obvious reason is that as you get older, your immune system grows weaker, and that is the reason why you are not able to fight Covid. Immune systems in older patients behave in a more exhausted way. It is also due to co-morbidity and poor lifestyle. But it is not simply a matter of age and immunity, because there are younger people who have weak immune systems and older people who have strong immune systems.” A senior civic official said, “Testing on time and reporting symptoms like cough or breathlessness on time is crucial, especially in older patients. BMC is doing door-to-door surveys to locate senior citizens with co-morbidity and low oxygen saturation, so they can be made aware about the risk they have from the illness, and receive medical help on time.” So far, BMC has screened 874,275 senior citizens, and found 3,097 of them to have oxygen saturation less than 95. Of these, 5,036 senior citizens live in containment zones and five were found to have oxygen saturation less than 95. Mumbai on Thursday recorded 1,350 new cases, and 30 deaths due to Covid-19. The total number of cases has gone up to 140,888 and the toll is 7,535. There are 19,463 active Covid-19 cases. The case fatality ratio for Mumbai is 5.3%, and the discharge rate is 80%. Until August 25, Mumbai has done 725,519 tests, with a positivity of 18.9%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-in-every-100-covid-patients-above-50-years-in-mumbai-succumbed/story-xNO3hq2zQkdOa3pjdrBdoK.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Central Railway introduces QR pass scanning system at 15 railway stations to curb crowding||To control overcrowding and unauthorised travel on the local train network, Central Railway (CR) introduced QR-based e-pass scanning system at 15 of its suburban railway stations on Thursday. The systems will be introduced at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Dadar, Mulund, Kurla, Thane, Diva, Ghatkopar, Dombivli, Kalyan, Byculla, Wadala, Mankhurd, Panvel, Titvala and Badlapur.Two new local train services were also introduced on the harbour line on Thursday, in a move to control crowding in train compartments.Local train services were suspended from March 23 but were resumed on June 15 only for people working in essential services. Nearly 700 local train services are being operated on both the Central and Western Railway (WR) daily.CR and WR are currently undertaking trials of the QR code-based passes. If successful, use of the passes will be continued after resumption of local train services for the general public. A standard operating procedure (SOP) will be created at that time. The Railways, along with the state government, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Mumbai Police will prepare the SOP together.“We are trying our best to control crowding on the local train network. Presently, if we come to know about crowding, immediate measures are taken. We have also introduced two new local train services,” said Shalabh Goel, divisional railway manager, Central Railway.The Railways also plans to implement the system of social distancing currently in use. Passengers will have to stand in a queue and within drawn-out circles, to maintain distance. They will then be allowed to board the local trains.“We might also ask passengers to wait outside the railway station if there is crowding on the platforms or on the station premises. A complete SOP has to be prepared for the operation of trains for the general public.” said a senior CR official.CR in a pilot project will also be introducing automated control gates in September at CSMT and Churchgate railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-railway-introduces-qr-pass-scanning-system-at-15-railway-stations-to-curb-crowding/story-0Q1ESTfdRkvCHR7UB2kMBM.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||BMC to extend rapid antigen testing across civic peripheral hospitals and dispensaries in Mumbai||To further boost Covid-19 testing in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to start Covid-19 diagnosis using rapid antigen testing kits across all civic-run peripheral hospitals and dispensaries. Since July, BMC has conducted more than 80,000 rapid antigen tests. In the next stage, to ramp up testing at secondary healthcare facilities, BMC will provide 500-1,000 rapid testing kits to all 175 civic-run dispensaries. Alongside, testing will also be initiated at 16 peripheral hospitals. “So far, most tests are being conducted at Covid care centres (CCC) and hospitals. Now, to test more people, we have decided to allow antigen testing at dispensaries and peripheral hospitals,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.For this purpose, more than 70 laboratory technicians have been trained in the first phase at the three major civic-run hospitals — King Edward Memorial (KEM), BYL Nair and Lokmanya Tilak General hospitals. “Our priority will be to test people with symptoms. Then we will test close contacts of positive patients,” added Kakani.BMC conducts more than 2,000 antigen tests daily. In the first instalment, the civic body procured 1 lakh antigen testing kits. Now, as 80% of the kits have been used, BMC has placed an order to procure another 50,000 kits. Health activists have welcomed the civic body’s move. Dr Ravikant Singh, health activist, said, “Even though the Covid-19 case curve has flattened in the city, it is important to stretch testing facilities in all corners of the city so that the civic body doesn’t lose any patient. This will also provide better access to people to get tested faster.”Till August 25, BMC has conducted a total of 725,519 tests that include antigen and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, of which 137,678 individuals have been diagnosed with Covid-19, bringing down the positivity rate to 18.97% from 23% in July.Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of non-profit Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said, “It is a welcome move by BMC, but they shouldn’t rely only on rapid antigen. The test often provides false negative reports which can prove disastrous and contribute in spreading the infection further. A balance should be maintained between RT-PCR and antigen testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-extend-rapid-antigen-testing-across-civic-peripheral-hospitals-dispensaries/story-yFAe5O8hiEOD8bNqOKhmyN.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Redefine role of SRA in Mumbai: Experts submit action plan to CM Uddhav Thackeray||The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the stark realities of high-density and unaffordable housing in Mumbai. To address these issues, noted experts have submitted an action plan to the state government to find a solution to the problem of housing for slum-dwellers, low and middle-income groups, single women, migrants and gaothans/koliwada in Mumbai. The recommendations are part of the ‘Resurrecting Mumbai’ report in which 24 academicians have targeted issues of transport, housing, health, education and economy.The report, which has been submitted to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, will be released on Friday. In it, experts have suggested redefining the role of the slum rehabilitation authority (SRA), wherein it fulfills its first objective of undertaking comprehensive planning of slum land by modifying development control regulations to enable the production of affordable housing through the slum redevelopment route. Experts believe that SRA is failing in its current role. In their report, they emphasise that any land which is currently occupied by slums should be reserved for affordable housing only.Dr Amita Bhide, dean and professor, school of habitat studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, said, “SRA today is not a public institution which people can approach. It is acting only as a liaison. Even the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) is not taking the lead in its central role for the provision of affordable housing. The role of both these institutions needs to be looked at again.”Other experts who looked at housing solutions for the report include senior urban planner Shirish Patel, senior architects PK Das and Neera Adarkar, and Gautam Chatterjee, chairman of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority.The experts have suggested that Mhada take an active role in constructing social rental housing. The report stresses on density-based development policy and abandoning the concept of free housing. With 31,700 people per sqkm, Mumbai is the second densest city in the world after Bangladesh’s Dhaka.“The government has to play an active role in social rental housing. It needs to be subsidised and looked at as a social welfare program. We need a comprehensive policy to create affordable housing stock in the city,” said Das.The report further mentions that the government must consider a cafeteria approach while looking at the rehabilitation of slum-dwellers.“These could include rental housing, in-situ development, or even the option of buying extra space. Slum-dwellers need to be empowered and included in the decision making,” the report accessed by HT states.Prachi Merchant, urban planner and convenor for the project said, “The whole idea was to look at providing an action plan that can be implemented by the state government. We provided an outline of issues that the experts deliberated on.”The contributing experts have emphasised on “inclusivity” as a concept and also suggested formation of a “sectoral task force of experts” in Mumbai, who will help in strategic planning for the city. “This will put into momentum a participatory process of governance, which will help to initiate policy reforms, flagging governance issues and finally, in the formulation of new and disruptive ideas for the new normal,” the report states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/redefine-role-of-sra-in-mumbai-experts-submit-action-plan-to-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-mZBWsIGGWc6FCVuVy84epJ.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||HC seeks BMC’s explanation on suspending employee||A Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) employee who was suspended in April 2019 on the grounds that he had given statements as a witness in the industrial court without the permission of his superior has approached the Bombay high court (HC) seeking that his suspension order be quashed and action be taken against officials who issued the notice. The employee said his suspension was an act of vendetta for saying the truth, and hence the order should be set aside. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition filed by Kiran Waghela, was informed by advocate Bhavesh Parmar that his client was an employee of BMC since 1995. In 2019, the industrial tribunal issued Waghela a witness summon and asked him to be present for the hearing of a case between the corporation and the employee union, filed in 2005. Parmar submitted that though Waghela had to depose before the court on April 20, 2019, he sought an adjournment till April 23 which was granted. Waghela then prepared an affidavit which included the contents of his deposition and forwarded it to his superior on April 22 for approval. The superior acknowledged the receipt of the copy but did not reply to it. On April 23, the industrial tribunal found the corporation to be in the wrong based on the affidavit and passed orders. Later that day, Waghela’s superior issued a suspension order. Referring to a 2015 Supreme Court judgement which states that an employee cannot be suspended for more than three months, Parmar submitted that his client approached the industrial court in June 2019 for reinstatement but his application has not been heard till date, hence he approached the HC. Parmar said that as Waghela was suspended for speaking the truth before the court, the action of his suspension was illegal and should be set aside. He also sought action against the officials who victimised Waghela for being truthful. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed BMC to file an affidavit explaining its stand and posted the matter for further hearing on September 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-seeks-bmc-s-explanation-on-suspending-employee/story-fyASArhlit9b8RQIVOChGI.html

A set of select letters will be compiled into an e-book that will be put up on Kindle and promoted by Mpower on World Suicide Prevention Day.Neerja Birla, founder and chairperson of Aditya Birla Education Trust, said, “Mental health concerns among children are increasing, especially behaviour disorders and suicides. The motive behind the campaign is to reach out and bring hope to anyone on the school campus who may be going through a hard time or is contemplating suicide. As much as 90% of suicides can be averted provided the signs are identified early and access to help is available.”Speaking about the initiative, Piya Marker, director-head of TABIS, said, “It is our endeavour to share positive experiences with anyone who needs to believe that this too will pass and it definitely does. The students along with their school counsellor initiated it in 2019. Encouraged by the response, our students collaborated with Mpower to take this endeavour to the next level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ahead-of-world-suicide-prevention-day-aditya-birla-school-students-write-letters-of-hope/story-9VmggDYdCYro3NyCg6cwmK.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar asks Centre to compensate Maharashtra for ₹22K-crore GST losses||Maharashtra finance minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday urged the Central government for an early release of the pending Goods and Services Tax (GST) losses sustained by the state to the tune of ₹22,534 crore. Pawar, who participated in the 41th meeting of the GST Council headed by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday through video conference, said the Centre should raise loans from the market to pay GST compensation to states and then recover the amount from the cess it has been collecting on certain services.“Compensating state governments towards their losses in GST collection for five years and helping them in fighting the economic crisis is the responsibility shouldered by the Centre. Almost all the states are bleeding financially, not only because of the financial crisis due to the global pandemic but also owing to the delay in release of GST compensation which is resulting in setback to development works,’’ said Pawar who is also the state’s deputy chief minister. He added, “It is the responsibility of the Centre to match up the revenue losses owing to the introduction of the GST regime.” Pawar suggested that the Centre avail loans from the open market at cheaper rates than states. “By raising such loans, the states should be compensated for the losses in a timely manner. The Centre can repay its loans by extending the deadline for the collection of cess beyond June 2022,” he said. Amid the exhaustive drop in GST collection during the lockdown, Maharashtra collection has dropped by ₹22,534 crore from April to July 2020. According to the provisions in the Central GST Act, the Centre compensates states towards their losses in the collection. The responsibility has been taken for five years since the roll-out of GST regime on July 1, 2017. The Centre compensates states from the corpus fund accumulated from cess on tobacco, pan masala, cigarette, motor vehicles, petroleum products, etc. In the wake of the drop in cess collection during lockdown, the Centre has not been able to pay the compensations to states.The losses in GST collection in Maharashtra in April and May were ₹15,178 crore, while remaining ₹7,356 crore is from July. With the addition of August figures, the losses are expected to cross ₹28,000 crore. The monthly estimated GST collection in the state is ₹9,708 crore, according to an official from the finance department. The Centre had paid ₹19,233.65 crore to Maharashtra towards compensation for GST losses in 2019-20; the highest in the country. Most of the losses were sustained in March owing to the lockdown.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, too, expressed concerns on Wednesday over the delay in the release of GST compensation to the states and said there was a need to reconsider GST regime. He was speaking in a video conference convened by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi with chief minister of non-BJP state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-asks-centre-to-compensate-maharashtra-for-22k-crore-gst-losses/story-RlEcBlGjQnNAYyglwS2ieJ.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Medical students to study pandemic management in MBBS||Weeks after its decision to introduce a new pandemic management module for undergraduate medical students, the board of governors (BoG) of the Medical Council of India (MCI) on Thursday released the official document for colleges, directing them to start the module starting August 2020.“The pandemic management module is designed to ensure that the MBBS student acquires competencies in handling not only the illness but also the social, legal and other issues arising from such disease outbreaks,” states the foreword of the module. “The emergence of Covid-19 and its rapid spread across the globe has further underlined the need to develop these skills in our graduates. One of the desirable outcomes of the competency-derived education programme is to enable the medical graduate to be able to understand, investigate, treat and prevent new and emerging diseases,” added the foreword.The module was put together by a team of experts and the academic cell of MCI. The group of experts included former director and dean of KEM Hospital Dr Avinash Supe, along with senior doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute in Chennai, as well as officials from MCI.According to details mentioned in the newly-launched module, it has been arranged in a phase-based manner and is expected to be covered by an interdisciplinary team under the supervision of the Institute-level curriculum committee. The course not only covers disease/epidemic management, intensive care, research and control, but also includes a chapter in communication with media during a pandemic.“It is expected that this longitudinal module extending from the foundation course to the final-year graduate programme will help in ensuring the creation of a medical graduate who will serve as a doctor, leader and a healer during a pandemic,” highlights a statement from MCI.“Work on upgrading the MBBS curricula has been on for over two years and the fact that globally we have faced a series of pandemics in the last few years led to the need for an exclusive inter-departmental module on pandemic management,” said Dr Supe. He added that the module looks at minute details of how to be prepared for a pandemic. Experts are currently also working on putting together a module on psychological effects of a pandemic. “This too will be released soon,” he added.Parents and students feel this module will better prepare the future generations of doctors for such situations. “The initial phase of a pandemic is when it can be controlled best, and being prepared for such a pandemic is the necessity of current times. Hopefully this new module will help mould better-prepared doctors and health experts in the future,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of an MBBS student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-students-to-study-pandemic-management-in-mbbs/story-nYVo4ub54dBhcmOFda4sZN.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Two killed, three injured as parts of three structures collapse in Mumbai||Two people were killed and one injured after part of a cessed ground-plus-two structure collapsed in Nagpada of Byculla on Thursday afternoon. In two separate incidents, two people were injured in a balcony and house collapse in Chembur and Deonar. In Nagpada, around 1pm, a part of the toilet of Mishra building, collapsed and three persons got trapped. All three were residents of nearby structures and did not live in Mishra building. Of the three, two – Aliya Qureshi, 12, and Noor Qureshi, 70, – were declared dead at Sir JJ Hospital, while 35-year-old Saumita Banoo escaped with injuries. Mishra building is over 50 years old. Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) officials said they had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) to the developer in 2017 for redevelopment of the structure, but he failed to start the redevelopment work. “We repeatedly issued notices to the developer for failing to initiate redevelopment. We will verify the reason for the delay and take action,” said Arun Borse, from the engineering department of Mhada. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, who visited the site, said, “Mhada and all other authorities have regularly issued notices to the developer, who is also the landlord of the structure. But he managed to get a stay from the court several times, due to which the whole process was delayed.” Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner, of BMC’s D ward, under which the building falls, said, “It was a Mhada structure, and BMC has no role to play here. However, the building has been vacated. We are told some repair work was done in the building on Thursday morning, but we do not have any information.” Local Congress corporator Javed Juneja said, “The situation is the same everywhere. We always end up with deaths or injured residents in south Mumbai during the monsoon. The state government needs to have a holistic plan to protect those living in dilapidated or cessed structures. The residents have approached the Mumbai Police to take action against the builder.” Further, a part of a balcony wall collapsed in Chembur East around 11.42am. One person was injured in the incident and admitted to Rajawadi Hospital. The injured is admitted to the ICU in critical condition, BMC’s disaster management cell said in a statement. The statement added a ground-plus-one structure collapsed opposite Deonar police station collapsed. The incident was reported around 2.42pm. A woman suffered minor injuries and has been admitted to Shatabdi Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-killed-three-injured-as-parts-of-three-structures-collapse-in-mumbai/story-LQFHszcxBtvZh3eqKBaRlJ.html

Rao was admitted there on July 19 after he tested positive for Covid-19. He has been taken back to Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai, where he was earlier lodged.Deepak Pandey, inspector general (south region prisons) has confirmed the development.Rao was first taken to Sir JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. His family had alleged the 81-year-old was discharged hurriedly to obstruct his bail plea. “He was not normal at the time of discharge. June 2 was the date of the hearing on his bail application on health grounds in NIA special sessions court, and police argued against his bail showing [a] hospital ‘normal’ report. The judge accepted that and refused bail on June 26,” read a statement from Rao’s family.Later, Rao continued to show signs of delirium, and after voices were raised from various quarters, he was admitted to Sir JJ Hospital again on July 13. After he tested positive for Covid-19 infection, he was shifted to St George Hospital.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also intervened and issued notices to the Maharashtra government to ensure the health conditions of Rao were taken care of and adequate medical facilities were arranged.The commission had also directed the state to constitute a medical board to examine Rao’s health condition. NHRC asked the state to provide Rao the best possible treatment at a private hospital and also to ensure that to bear all the medical expenditures. He was then shifted to Nanavati Hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/varavara-rao-discharged-from-nanavati-hospital-returns-to-taloja-jail/story-GPqF6YE0keHMHyoKjySEjI.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai tea stall owner arrested for trying to extort ₹35 crore from filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar||Officers of the anti-extortion cell (AEC) of Mumbai Police’s crime branch arrested a 33-year-old Dharavi-based tea stall owner for allegedly trying to extort ₹35 crore from filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar by claiming to be gangster Abu Salem, who is in jail. The accused, Milind Balkrishna Tulsankar, told police that that he came up with the idea to make quick money after losing livelihood due to the Covid-19-induced pandemic.According to the police his tea business was shut down in the lockdown so he had no other means of earning. Tulsankar then moved to his village Khed in Konkan after seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases in Dharavi, but struggled to earn money there as well. He claimed he was fascinated about underworld and watched videos of gangster Abu Salem who is infamous for extorting money from Bollywood personalities. This gave him the idea and he chose to target Manjarekar as he was contesting the election. Tulsankar found his number on an election-related website.Tulsankar first called Manjrekar on August 23, but since the filmmaker did not take the call, he sent two threatening messages demanding ₹35 crore through hawala. He had also mentioned a hawala operator’s name, Abdul Rashid, in the message, said a police officer.After getting the message, Manjrekar lodged a complaint with Dadar police station. However, considering the seriousness of the incident, AEC started a parallel investigation.Inspectors Ajay Sawant, Sachin Kadam and assistant inspector Raju Surve’s team analysed the caller’s details and found his location. Following this, Tulsankar was detained and brought to Mumbai on Thursday. After he admitted to the crime, he was arrested. He further said that he was aware that Salem was in jail and that some gangsters operate their business from jails. He was produced before a local court on Thursday and has been remanded in police custody till September 2.So far, it has not been established that the accused has any connection with gangster Abu Salem or the underworld. However, the police would explore the angle in the probe, another officer said.HT tried to contact Manjrekar for a comment, but he had not responded to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tea-stall-shut-owing-to-lockdown-man-tries-to-extort-35-crore-from-filmmaker-mahesh-manjrekar/story-NDfzSyiGKv1AlJTZUUcFCM.html

The police department set up a check-point right outside the PSPCL headquarters on the Mall Road on Thursday. Over four dozen employees, including a chief engineer, were challaned. PSPCL director (commercial) Gopal Sharma’s car was also checked and the registration certificate (RC) of the vehicle seized. Around a dozen sub-divisional officers (SDOs), in private vehicles, were challaned while entering the office for ‘violating covid-19 directions by not wearing mask.SDO KPS Brar said, “I was wearing a mask, but they said a cloth-made one will not do and issued a challan.” “I was stopped and they took the RC of my car, but when I took up the matter with senior officials, they returned my RC,” said Sharma, director, commercial. Employee leader Manjit Singh Chahal said police was vindictive. “No law permits police to steal electricity and then not even pay the bill,” he said. SSP Vikramjit Duggal denied allegations that the department was settling scores. “It was a routine checking. Some senior officials of the PSPCL raised the issue with me. I have clearly told them there is nothing vindictive,” he said, adding that the police was only doing its duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-cops-slug-it-out-over-power/story-FZi4vInJgoIVDnsCwjTswM.html
28-08-2020||City||New twist to resolution seeking action against Jitin Prasada||CLAIM Party’s Kheri chief says it was passed on the directives of an office bearer of state unitLucknow: The controversy over a resolution demanding action against senior Congress leader Jitin Prasada has taken a new turn. Prasada was one of the 23 signatories to the letter that senior party leaders had sent to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, asking for a full-time, effective, “active” and “visible” party president.Now, Lakhimpur Kheri District Congress Committee (DCC) president Prahalad Patel has claimed the ‘resolution’ was passed on (Wednesday) on the directives of an office bearer of the state party unit and it was sent by a functionary close to the top party leadership.“Yes, the resolution was provided to us by Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee secretary incharge for Lakhimpur Kheri (Kumud) Gangwar,” said Patel.Although Patel refused to say anything beyond this, he is heard pointing towards the role of a party functionary close to the top leadership, in an audio clip being circulated on the social media.“I have been appointed the district president. I have to do whatever I am asked to do. This resolution condemning 23 leaders was sent by Dheeraj Gujjar. I refused to sign due to objections to some lines in the (draft) resolution. Three lines were removed thrice. Gangwar is in charge (of Lakhimpur Kheri) and he was also being pressured,” Patel allegedly said in the audio.Patel was also heard hinting at a turf war and the influence of a former MP’s son on the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC).When contacted UPCC secretary Kumud Gangwar said there was no question of any pressure on him or the DCC president.“I was present at the DCC meeting being incharge of the district. There was no pressure on me or the DCC. I spoke to DCC president after the audio came to notice. DCC president is denying saying anything,” said Gangwar.While the UPCC is keeping a close watch on the developments, other senior office bearers refused to say anything on record.“DCC’s resolution against Jitin Prasada is an expression of the feelings of partymen,” said a senior UPCC leader. Another leader said the resolution may have been the outcome of a turf war between Prasada and a former Congress MP from the region. In a tweet, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, “Unfortunate that Jitin Prasada is being officially targeted in UP. Congress needs to target the BJP with surgical strikes instead of wasting its energy by targeting its own.”Sibal, along with Prasada, was one of the 23 signatories to the letter sent to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Senior leader and former Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Raj Babbar too had signed the letter.“Yes, I had signed the letter. But the issue has been already resolved at the Congress Working Committee. I am not aware about the demand being made for action against Prasada,” said Babbar. Prasada too had on Wednesday said the issue was over after discussions before Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Earlier, Lakhimpur Kheri District Congress Committee, in its resolution passed on Wednesday, said: “Mrs Sonia Gandhi is the unanimous leader of the Congress. We fully trust the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. If there is any change in the leadership, Rahul Gandhi should be made the Congress president. These leaders have pointed fingers towards Mrs Sonia Gandhi’s leadership at this time of Covid-19 pandemic. Mrs Sonia Gandhi is not in good health and the BJP has been targeting the Congress governments in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Under such a situation, signing the letter indicates that they (leaders) don’t have any faith in the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and the Congress. These leaders have done whatever the BJP is doing.” “The District Congress Committee (DCC) demands disciplinary action should be taken against all those who signed the letter and they should be expelled from the party….All over UP, there is only one leader, former minister Jitin Prasada, who has signed the letter. His family has been against the Gandhi family. His father, the late Jitendra Prasada, had contested election against Sonia Gandhi. Despite this, Sonia Gandhi gave him the Lok Sabha ticket and he was made a minister. His act is gross indiscipline and action should be taken against him,” read the resolution.Earlier, a day before the Congress Working Committee meeting, UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu, Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’, legislators and other senior party leaders too had signed a joint statement targeting those who had signed the controversial letter.“Some leaders claiming to be representing the feelings of partymen from across the country have sent a letter to the Congress president. The truth remains that they don’t represent feelings of workers and office bearers in different states. Congress workers across the country are fully aware that they have remained cut off from the Congress’ brave fight against the BJP and have derived maximum advantage from the Congress. Their claim to be representing the feelings of party workers was baseless and unnecessary,” said the leaders in their joint statement. “For all of us, this is the time to unitedly stand by the leadership of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and fight the forces destroying Constitutional values and democracy and we will fulfil this responsibility,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-twist-to-resolution-seeking-action-against-jitin-prasada/story-hTVRAzm4eZlUZCNSfEwsHO.html
28-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 in Maharashtra: State to survey comorbid patients; tally 733,568||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded its second-highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases with 14,718 infections, taking the count up to 733,568. Active cases also rose to 178,234, accounting for 24.29% of the total. The death toll of the state went up to 23,444 after 355 deaths were reported, of which, 236 were in the past 48 hours, another 83 deaths were from past one week, while the rest 36 were from the period before that, health officials said.The recent rise in single-day toll numbers, including a record count of 422 on August 18, continues to pose a challenge for the state, which records the most fatalities in the country. To improve the situation, the state government is now planning to conduct a statewide survey in all households to identify comorbid patients in each and every district and cities. The idea is early detection and treatment of the most vulnerable section of society, so as to help reduce Covid casualties. The plan was discussed in the cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. The state is likely to start the survey from September 15.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray insisted that the state should take up a survey to identify comorbid patients. He was of the view that it will help us in close monitoring of these people, which will lead to early detection of Covid-19 and its treatment. It will further reduce number of Covid deaths in the state as well,” said a senior minister, wishing not to be named.“We are planning a survey, which will be conducted across the state with the help of Asha workers and others. We are doing micro-detailing of the survey and looking to start it from September 15,” Rajesh Tope, state health minister, told HT.“Ultimately, the purpose of conducting the survey is to reduce deaths as most of the people who have lost their lives due to Covid-19, of them, most were having co-morbidities. Early detection can save their lives,” he added. In the last 27 days (in this month), the state has reported 8,450 deaths, which is highest in a month so far. In July, a total of 6,988 deaths were reported, while in June, May, April and March, total number of deaths recorded were 5,638, 2,286, 449 and 10 deaths respectively.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded as 3.2% on Thursday. It is slightly less than Gujarat, which has highest CFR in the country as present. On Wednesday, Gujarat’s CFR was 3.27% with 2,945 deaths (89,994 cases), according to statistics shared by the state medical education department.“On an average, daily over 312 people are losing their lives in the state after getting infected with Covid-19. It is concerning that we could not control the deaths even after making so much of effort,” said a senior official from state health department.Besides, the peak in cases is yet not flattening. In fact, number of fresh infections is rising continuously. On Wednesday, it recorded its sharpest single-day spike with 14,888 cases. For the first time, the state has breached 3-lakh mark of Covid-19 cases in a month, owing to the surge. The total number of new cases reported in August till date is 311,750. With four more days to go, it is likely to rise even further as the daily cases are also going up. For comparison, the state has recorded 247,392 cases in July and 102,172 cases in June. In May, April and March, it had got 57,157, 10,196 and 302 cases respectively.There was also a projection that daily cases will rise in August. The state has maintained that peak is arriving in different areas at a different time. Further, they are conducting more tests than ever, which led to a rise in daily infections. The state health minister has recently said they expect the downward trend of the Covid-19 infections after mid-September. On Monday, Mumbai recorded 1,350 cases, taking its tally to 140,888. Of them, active cases are 19,463.On June 27, Mumbai had reported its highest single-day spike of 2,077 cases. It has been maintaining a sort of stability in fresh cases in the past more than a month. City toll stands at 7,535 after 30 deaths reported on Thursday.Pune city continued to contribute maximum infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 1,772 cases on Thursday. Its tally stood at 94,897 cases. Nagpur city has become the third-highest contributor in daily cases with 1,086. Its tally stood at 17,865. Pimpri-Chinchwad, satellite city in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), recorded 1,085 cases, pushing its tally up to 44,092. Apart from them, Pune district, Nashik city, Jalgaon district and Satara district have recorded 819, 740, 603 and 532 cases respectively.On Thursday, it has conducted 68,157 tests and total number of tests conducted till date are 3,862,184.As many as 531,563 infected patients have recovered and been discharged from various hospitals across the state till date.

28-08-2020||City||One-day assembly session was just a formality: Hooda||Accusing the treasury benches of suppressing the voice of opposition in the one-day monsoon session of Haryana assembly, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda termed it a formality.Hooda, who was interacting with mediapersons at Kurukshetra on Thursday, accused the ruling party of curtailing the session to a single sitting on the “excuse of eight to nine members getting infected with the virus”.He said the Congress had demanded that if the government wanted to complete the formalities, only the “very important” legislative functions should be dealt with and the remaining bills, attention calling proposals of the opposition, adjournment proposals and private member bills should be discussed in the presence of the chief minister.The former Haryana CM said the Congress had given attention and adjournment motions in the House, but the government did not allow discussion on these burning issues.He also raised question over the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis by saying, “If eight members of state assembly, including the CM and speaker, are found infected in a random test before the assembly session, what about the common man?” “This development has put a question mark over the health services in the state,” he added. Hooda wished the chief minister an early recovery and said the decision of the government to conduct JEE-NEET exams during the pandemic was shocking and disturbing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-day-assembly-session-was-just-a-formality-hooda/story-38hxBMVVnFbFQtrA1jeELI.html
28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Congress MLA urges Haryana governor to withhold assent to bill validating de-licensing||The Congress MLA from Faridabad NIT, Neeraj Sharma, on Thursday urged Haryana governor Satyadev Narayan Arya to withhold his assent to the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (Second Amendment and Validation) Bill passed by the state assembly on Wednesday. Speaking at a press conference, Sharma said insertion of a new clause section 3 (a) in the Act which would give power to de-license land parcel has been done to favour influential people, including developers. “I have written to the governor, requesting him to withhold his assent to this bill which is not in public interest,” the first-time MLA said. He said that party MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra had also sought referral of the bill to a committee of the assembly before it was passed by the legislature. Batra had sought a review of the definition of vacant land under section 7-A of the bill, an argument supported by leader of the opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The assembly had on Wednesday passed the bill to validate past actions of the TCP department since 1975, including de-licensing of land taken under the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act. The amendment and validation bill, if assented to by the governor, would come as a relief to the developers of Gurugram-based Ambience Mall besides several similar cases involving de-licensing of land. The Punjab and Haryana high court had in July quashed the TCP department’s October 18, 2001 and September 1, 2010 orders to de-license two chunks of land (eight acres and 3.9 acres) out of 18.98 acres approved for constructing Ambience Lagoon Island residential complex. The de-licensed land was then permitted by the department for raising a commercial complex, the Ambience Mall. De-licensing here meant that a part of the land for which a residential licence was issued was taken out of the purview of the residential licence. On HC’s orders, the CBI had also registered a criminal case in the matter. Officials said that over 54 similar cases of de-licensing were detected by the department after the HC ruling, which needed to be validated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/congress-mla-urges-haryana-governor-to-withhold-assent-to-bill-validating-de-licensing/story-VJuwBQ6cYuj6oSUCKcseZO.html

Reacting to the allegations of scam in excise department, Dushyant, who also holds the excise and taxation portfolio, said the department has made a new record in the excise duty collection. “The excise department has never made such a high revenue collection as during the Covid-19 crisis, which reflects that there is no scam,” the deputy CM said in a news conference. “Since the formation of the state till today, it is for the first time in this year that the government has collected additional excise duty of more than Rs 27 crore in the first quarter,” he added. Dushyant said the new excise policy could not be implemented in the state from April 1 due to the lockdown. The state government gave permission to open liquor vends from May 5 under ‘Unlock 1’. The cabinet has amended the policy and decided to implement it till May 5, 2021. The deputy CM said GPS tracking devices would be installed in the vehicles coming out of distilleries. He said by the end of September, all distilleries will have surveillance cameras.He said that during the lockdown, an inquiry has been conducted against the officers issuing permits and passes from March 27 to March 31 and action will be taken against those found guilty as soon as the investigation is completed. He said in yet another first, an additional retail license fee of Rs 62 crore was received in the first quarter. The deputy CM said during the pandemic, the state government has imposed ‘Covid’ cess on liquor. In the first three months of implementing the cess, the excise department has earned Rs 75 crore, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-scam-in-excise-department-more-revenue-generated-than-previous-years-in-1st-quarter-of-2020-dushyant/story-jerJY03Z4nb5ZmBU9NEt4M.html

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Vigilance probe ordered into liquor smuggling in Haryana during lockdown||Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Thursday said the state government has ordered a vigilance probe into the findings of the special enquiry team (SET) constituted in May to investigate into the instances of pilferage of liquor from warehouses during the Covid-19 lockdown. The inquiry had revealed glaring deficiencies in the functioning of excise and taxation department and indicated collusion of officials in smuggling and the illegal sale of liquor. “There was no rationale for physical movement of stocks during lockdown… it is evident that there was huge unauthorised movement of liquor. The complicity of excise, police officials cannot be ruled out. Probe needed as movement of not a single soul, except those involved in essential duties, was permitted during lockdown,” reads the inquiry findings, for which an investigation by vigilance bureau has been ordered.“The state vigilance bureau will investigate the findings of the SET. We should trust the vigilance bureau,” Vij said in a veiled reference to deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s rejection of the SET findings. Explanation of officers soughtThe state government has also sought explanation from IAS officer Shekhar Vidyarthi, the present excise and taxation commissioner, and IPS officer of AGMUT cadre Pratiksha Godara, who is a former Sonepat superintendent of police. Godara, who was on an inter-cadre deputation to Haryana,is back to her parent cadre. Vidyarthi’s explanation has been called on the basis of SET findings as he had ordered closure of liquor vends during the lockdown by only giving verbal instructions. In the absence of written instructions, permits and passes for movement of liquor were issued during the closure period by some districts. Vidyarthi was also held responsible for dilly-dallying pieces of information sought by the SET and hampering the visit of the enquiry team to a distillery. Also, departmental inquiries have been ordered against excise and police officials mentioned in the SET report. The SET was mandated to check whether the stock of liquor that was there on the date of sealing a warehouse was actually available or not, to examine the cases of seizure of illicit/ non-excise duty paid liquor in Haryana between April 2019 and March 2020 by the police and excise departments separately, action and fines imposed by the excise department following liquor recovery. The probe team was also asked to collect and collate the results of investigation of the FIRs registered from March 15, 2020 till April 10 for pilferage of liquor from L-1 and L-13 godowns and also from the police ‘malkhanas’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vigilance-probe-ordered-into-liquor-smuggling-during-lockdown/story-TCX4wjZqmged2XvSBAHENI.html
28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Private job quota bill: Cabinet’s nod must to withdraw ordinance, says Haryana government||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s move to table a private sector job quota bill in the assembly on Wednesday did not come about as the state government will have to take the cabinet route to seek the withdrawal of an identical ordinance from the Centre. The governor had reserved the quota ordinance, approved by the cabinet, for the consideration of the President. The proposed legislation was sent to the Union home ministry by the Raj Bhawan for scrutiny by the central ministries concerned before the President takes a call. Dushyant, though, wrote to the governor to seek the withdrawal of the ordinance, top officials aware of the developments said the cabinet will have to sanction the move to withdraw the ordinance. “The ordinance has not been promulgated. Since it has been sent for the President’s consideration, the ordinance is still under a process. So unless it is withdrawn by the governor by writing to the Central government, a replica bill cannot be tabled. The move to withdraw it can only be approved by the cabinet,” said officials. Since chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar got indisposed due to coronavirus infection two days before the assembly session, a meeting of the cabinet could not be convened to seek the withdrawal of the ordinance. ‘An argument in favour of propriety’ Former advocate general Ashok Aggarwal said it is the government’s prerogative to introduce an identical bill.However, the decision not to do so when an ordinance is reserved for President’s consideration is a step in consonance with the highest traditions of constitutional propriety. “Once the governor has expressed an opinion for seeking the presidential assent, it is appropriate not to hurry up or to make an overreach by presenting a bill in the assembly. Let the higher constitutional functionary take a view,” Aggarwal said. The law expert said that the Supreme Court had held that an ordinance is also identical to a law passed by the legislature. The governor’s move to reserve the ordinance for the consideration of the President is being seen as a setback for Dushyant, whose Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) had made a poll promise to implement the quota. Article 201 of the Constitution says that the President can either declare that he assents to the proposed law or that he withholds assent. The President can also direct the governor to return it to the House for reconsideration. Why was it reserved for President’s consideration The ordinance was reserved for the President’s consideration as its section 23 gave it an overriding effect over other laws and has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana also was seemingly in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The Constitution does not provide a time limit for the President to assent to a bill or withhold it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-job-quota-bill-cabinet-s-nod-must-to-withdraw-ordinance-says-hrayana-government/story-9laQfsEZktcAIYTerRwUdO.html
28-08-2020||City||Strengthen infra to monitor polluting units in Haryana: NGT to state board||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to strengthen the infrastructure to monitor and take timely action against the erring polluting units and submit a complete action-taken report. Hearing a petition via videoconference, the bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed, “We find that in the report of Haryana, only issue addressed is the frequency of inspections. There is no mention of strengthening of monitoring infrastructure, including laboratories.”The bench also raised questions over the report submitted by HSPCB mentioning the status of fluoride contamination and availability of potable water to the affected inhabitants.The HSPCB has been told to give the action-taken reports to the CPCB by December 31.The bench’s order came on the subject of revision of existing monitoring mechanism to oversee compliance with environmental norms by state pollution control boards, including duration for mandatory inspections of ‘highly polluting 17 category’, ‘red’ and ‘orange’ and ‘green’ category industries and policy of auto renewals of Consent to Operate under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act as well as the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The matter was earlier taken up on November 5, 2019 and the NGT considered the findings in the report of the joint committee that the water quality had deteriorated in major parts of the state on account of non-compliance with environmental norms and absence of strict enforcement of law. The CPCB had recommended that HSPCB maintain regular vigilance and levy environmental compensation against violations in view of rampant non-compliances by the industries.HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “We have already taken up the issue of fluoride contamination and availability of potable water to any affected inhabitants with the PHED. All regional officers have been told to get the groundwater checked for all parameters, including fluoride content and its source. They have been asked to take action against the erring industrial units.”“As far as the infrastructure development, including the labs, is concerned, the board is vigorously working on it and we will submit the compliance report accordingly to the tribunal as well,” he added.It is worth mentioning here that in its July 10, 2019 orders, the NGT had directed the CPCB in coordination with the HSPCB to shut down polluting industries in ‘critically polluted’ and ‘severely polluted’ areas.As per the reports of polluted industrial areas or clusters monitored during 2018 by the CPCB, Gurugram is on the 9th rank, followed by Panipat (11) and Faridabad (63). As per the scores, Gurugram and Panipat are in the category of ‘critically polluted’ area, whereas Faridabad is in ‘severally polluted’ area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/strengthen-infra-to-monitor-polluting-units-in-haryana-ngt-to-state-board/story-nS2ek5cVsVfSCiqtMPsV6N.html
28-08-2020||Gurugram||Haryana allows restaurants and hotels to serve alcohol at tables; bars to remain shut||The Haryana excise and taxation department on Thursday allowed restaurants and hotels to serve liquor at tables along with food, although bars will continue to remain closed. In an order issued by the department, restaurant and hotel owners have been asked to get their liquor licences renewed for the current financial year. The decision has been taken a week after Delhi made a similar move.In renewing the licence, the state has also decided to give a 20% rebate to those licencees who will deposit the fee for third quarter (October till December) and fourth quarter (January till March 2021) within the next 10 days. Currently, the annual liquor license fee is ₹18 lakh per annum. In the state, restaurants were permitted to resume operations at 50% capacity from June 8. But they were not allowed to serve alcohol. In July, the excise department allowed only star-rated hotels in the city to serve liquor in rooms. The permission was granted to three-star, four-star and five-star hotels, while restaurants, pubs and bars were prohibited. At that time, for hoteliers, one-third of the licence fee was waived off, bringing it down to ₹2 lakh for one-quarter.Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (east), said that the recent move will give the much-needed boost to the hospitality industry. “After Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi, Haryana too has decided to permit liquor being served at the table. Bars will remain closed following the guidelines by the Union ministry of home affairs. The licence renewal process for the second quarter could not be conducted due to the lockdown. Therefore, the licence holders can get their licences renewed for the second quarter which ends on September 31. Further, a 20% relaxation will be given to those paying fees for third and fourth quarter together.”Restaurant owners, however, have expressed concerns over state government’s decision keep shops and restaurants shut on weekends, which, they say, would impact their business. Sharad Batra, co-founder, Café Delhi Heights, said, “There is an intention on the part of the government to give a breather to restaurants and hotels. The decision is a welcome move to further revive the hospitality industry, which is one of the biggest revenue generator. Even the decision to give rebate will help the owners even if they have to take loans from the bank to pay the licence fees.”The only drawback Batra sees in the current situation is the weekend lockdown imposed in Gurugram. “The business was already impacted in the second quarter due to a nationwide lockdown. Now, Haryana has ordered to keep malls and markets to shut on weekends except those dealing in essential goods. Nearly, 60% of the monthly revenue, which is generated on weekend, is being affected. Our biggest worry has been that if lockdown is imposed again with increase in Covid-19 cases, how are we going to survive?”Sameer Dhar, owner of Nowhere Terrace BrewPub Cafe at Crosspoint mall, agreed with Batra. “The entire sector has incurred loss this year. Therefore, paying fees for the third and fourth quarter would be challenging, especially when the state government is not allowing us to work on Saturdays and Sundays,” said Dhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-allows-restaurants-and-hotels-to-serve-alcohol-at-tables-bars-to-remain-shut/story-vQyWEoVaiQDmPFs5OACPYJ.html
28-08-2020||Pune||With BJP, AIMIM, VBA on same page, Sena hints at reopening places of worship||Places of worship are likely to reopen as the state government has hinted of opening such places for the public in September.Right-wing outfits along with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi are on the same page when it comes to opening of religious places.Imtiyaz Jaleel, AIMIM, Member of Parliament from Aurangabad, wants the government to open all religious places by September 1. He said Muslims will offer prayers in a mosque if the Maharashtra government fails to open religious places, which have been shut due to Covid-19 pandemic.“State government’s insistence on keeping religious places shut lacks a logic when normalcy is returning. If the government fails to open these places from September 1, I will offer prayers in a mosque at Shahgunj in Aurangabad on September 2,” said Jaleel on Wednesday at Aurangabad.He said the Hindu community should also come forward to make the government open temples from the beginning of the next month.Sensing pressure building from all sides, the government has also hinted of opening places of worships in September. Sanjay Raut, a Rajya Sabha MP from Shiv Sena, said he believes the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will take a call on this issue in the first week of September.“As per my understanding, a decision on reopening gymnasiums and religious places of worship would be taken in the first week of September,” said Raut while interacting with reporters in Mumbai on Thursday.Sena along with Nationalist Congress Party and Congress share power in MVA government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Raut’s statement comes a day after BJP, which is Maharashtra’s prominent opposition party, has called for state-wide ghantanad (bell ringing) protest on August 29. According to state BJP president Chandrakant Patil, the state-wide protest will see participation from religious leaders and heads of temples.Besides BJP, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi president Prakash Ambedkar has also threatened to agitate in Pandharpur on August 31 to press the demand for the opening of lord Vitthal temple.Earlier the chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said he was not in a hurry to relax lockdown norms rising coronavirus pandemic cases in the state.Several temple trusts too have demanded reopening of places of worships citing that the closure has cost financial distress to thousands whose economy is dependent on temples. The Shirdi temple trust has claimed that the lockdown has led to a loss of Rs 1,000 crore to the temple town, whose economy is dependent on the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/raut-says-mva-will-take-call-on-reopening-of-places-of-worship-in-first-week-of-sept/story-ZBjxNDNYr2IhUpgddKoBSL.html

28-08-2020||Delhi||Limited entry, exit gates once Metro restarts||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has prepared a list of entry and exit points at each station on its 10 corridors across its 389-km network and plans to deploy officials to enforce social distancing rules when it resumes operations.Metro services in Delhi were shut on March 22 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). People familiar with the matter had indicated on Monday that the government may allow the resumption of Metro services after over five months in September, when the fourth phase of a plan to restart businesses and activities restricted in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) kicks in. The DMRC has prepared detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) and is ready to resume operations whenever the Centre decides, a DMRC official said on condition of anonymity. The SOPs, however, are subject to approval by the Union home ministry. Also Read: ICMR starts second all-India sero survey; results expected in SeptemberA DMRC spokesperson refused to officially comment on the preparations. As per the draft SOPs, customised entry/exit will be allowed at each station to control footfall. According to the draft, only 257 out of the total 671 entry/exit gates at 242 stations will be opened for passenger movement. Officials said initially, a maximum of two gates will be open, that too at stations with heavy footfall such as Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate. Also, Metro officials in the rank of assistant manager, manager, senior supervisor in the operation and management and project department will be assigned ‘special duty’ to manage distancing norms inside stations and enforce Covid rules. “...They (the nominated officials) shall be fully responsible for station orderliness and shall visit at all places of public interface of their nominated stations at regular intervals,” the SOP document read. “(They will ensure) social distancing is maintained by staff and commuters at various places of metro station, i.e, at frisking points, at platforms, before entry/exit at AFC gates, in front of customer care/ticketing centres, at lifts and escalators etc,” it added. Also Read: Delhi tally hits 48-day high, 76k+ new cases across IndiaThe officials in-charge of maintaining social distancing in stations will work in two shifts, which ends at 8.30pm, as per the SOP document. This led to speculation that services could be curtailed. However, senior DMRC officials said the timings could only be made clear after the home ministry takes a call on the resumption of services. The officials, who will be deployed in the station premises, will also be tasked with ensuring that every passenger is scanned thermally at the entry, passengers and station staff wear mask at all times and that sanitisers are available at entry points. They will also supervise the cleaning of the station area. Senior Metro officials also confirmed that as per DMRC’s draft SOPs only three people will be allowed inside a lift, and all those using the elevators will have to maintain a gap of one step between themselves. Also Read: Rush at stops defeats social distancing in Delhi busesApart from ensuring social distancing within the station premises for the safety of passengers and staff, the DMRC has also given out an elaborate plan on the entry and exit of passengers. The draft SOPs show that at 31 stations on the Red Line (Shaheed Sthal to Rithala) 32 of the total 70 gates will remain open, on the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli to Huda City Centre), which has 38 stations, 39 out of 116 gates will be kept open for passenger entry. According to the plan, while stations such as Central Secretariat, AIIMS, Janakpuri West and Shivaji Park will be opened with just a single gate open for access, stations such as Noida City Centre, Mayur Vihar-1 and Kashmere Gate will have two entry/exit gates, one for each interchange line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/limited-entry-exits-at-metro-stations-special-officials-to-enforce-covid-rules/story-Ha7j82uq89rNXAwDBaODfK.html
28-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro stops work on Phase-4 line after notice over green rules violation||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday said it has stopped digging work on the Keshopur-Peeragarhi stretch of an upcoming corridor, days after the forest department accused it of violating environmental norms.HT had on Tuesday reported that the city forest department had pointed out multiple environmental violations on the Janakpuri West-RK Ashram phase-4 corridor, where the DMRC was working on the Krishna Park-Mukarba Chowk section. This is an area that has been marked as a deemed forest land and work continued despite multiple restraining orders from the city’s forest department. This includes the area around the Najafgarh drain, which is a birding hotspot since it is frequented by thousands of migratory birds.The report had highlighted that DMRC was issued at least two notices by the deputy conservator forests (west division) ordering them to stop work after trees on the stretch were damaged by digging work and by continuing work on a 5.34km deemed forest land without requite permissions from the central government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. “We have stopped work on the Keshopur-Peeragarhi stretch and will resume work after all mandatory approvals are met,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said on Thursday. SK Muan Guite, DCF (west division) had told HT that the DMRC did not have requisite permissions to undertake work on a 5.34-km stretch on Road Number 26 between Meera Bagh and Mukarba Chowk and a portion of the Najafgarh drain, both of which are deemed forest areas. Hindustan Times visited the construction site at least five times between February and August and found that the DMRC has continued construction on the stretch despite the restraining orders.Multiple notices were issued between February and August, asking the DMRC “not to carry out any construction work on the portion of Road Number 26 and Najafgarh drain”. The department also filed an FIR against the DMRC on August 14 to stop work. Responding to the allegations, the Metro corporation had said, “The issue of deemed forest has come in only recently in the month of August as the same was never pointed out by the forest department in any visits conducted. The location of the same is also not established through any authenticated record. It is being established through Google Earth image only where the exact location of the 5.34 kilometres is not known. It may be outside the DMRC alignment as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-metro-stops-work-on-phase-4-line-after-notice-over-green-rules-violation/story-Pga4F1WyddJdDNVBjk4dHJ.html

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Students in a fix as dates of JEE Main, NDA exam clash||Students desirous of taking both the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Main exam, organised by the National Testing Agency (NTA), and the National Defence Academy (NDA) exam, which is conducted by Union Public Service Commission, on September 6 are in a dilemma as the dates and time of the two tests are clashing.Some students have written to the NTA asking that the exam dates be changed, but no communication has been received from their end.Ravi Kumar of Nayagaon wants to follow in the footsteps of his father and join the Indian Army. But his JEE Main and NDA exam have both been scheduled on September 6. “For the Indian Naval Academy and technical entries of the Indian Army, a good JEE score is required. Many students keep this as a backup in case they don’t clear the NDA exam. I will have no option but to skip the JEE exam, but it will hurt my chances of joining the army later.”EDUCATION MINISTER HAD ASSURED HELPIn July, education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had assured students that those with overlap between the two exams will be accommodated, but now after the admit cards have been officially issued, the students have been left in a dilemma.Mandeep who hails from Mansa district in Punjab said, “Candidates [applying for JEE Main] were asked if they were also appearing for NDA. I had checked yes but still I was allotted a date clashing with the NDA exam.” The copies of his admit cards accessed by the Hindustan Times show that Mandeep is supposed to sit for his online JEE Main between 8am to 12pm, and for the written NDA exam between 10am-12:30pm and 2pm-4:30pm.Anuj Kaushik, another student who will be appearing for both the exams in Chandigarh said that he had sent two emails to the NTA with copies of his admit cards about a week back asking that the date for his JEE Main exam be changed, but no action was taken.‘4.5 LAKH STUDENTS APPEARING FOR NDA’Kunal Singh, who runs a coaching institute in Sector 34 for students appearing in both NDA and JEE exams, said, “Nearly 4.5 lakh students will be appearing for the NDA exam. Usually two exams are held per year, but this year only one will be held owing to the pandemic. Many students are likely to be affected by this mixup and they must speak up so that preventive steps can be taken before it is too late.”Kunal added that since the JEE Main exam was being held daily between September 1 and 6, NTA must adjust the exam date of affected candidates to prevent the clash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-jee-mains-nda-exam-date-clash-cause-of-concern-for-students/story-AEU8GCp8rfr1noqf6QznvJ.html
28-08-2020||Pune||Devotees bid adieu to Gauri-Ganesh under safety cover in Pune||PuneThe Gauri Visarjan followed after the fifth day of Ganpati immersion at a quieter and well organised way, although in some parts of the old city, especially near the riverbed, there was some tussle among devotees and the police who were trying to keep them away from the river beds following the Covid-19 norms.“This year 90 per cent of the people have opted for home immersions for their Ganpati idols due to coronavirus pandemic and 10 per cent have approached the river bed or even utilised the mobile haud (tanks),” said Dynaneshwar Molak, head of the solid waste management department, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).According to PMC, since August 22, 4,069 idols were immersed either at river bed or in mobile tanks, while 2,671 idols were given to the idol collection centre located at 187 spots across the city. The civic body also offered 150 metric tonnes of ammonium bicarbonate powder for free to devotees as it helps dissolve idols within 24 to 36 hours.On Thursday, people were seen biding adieu to Gauri along with Ganpati and it was a quite affair. “We decided to bid adieu to our Ganesh in our bucket of water. This year was in fact very pleasant and with everyone at home, it was a typical traditional way of celebrating the festival,” said Rashmi Ghodke, a resident of Hadapsar.Dhanashree Sant, resident of Kothrud will be using the mobile tank which has been allotted the street corner for her idol.Another resident Apurva Shukla said, “PMC has done a good job by sending these mobile hauds (tanks), this system has allowed citizens to see off their bappa at their doorstep for only one family member goes to hand over idol to collection personnel while other family members bid adieu from their balconies. The people collecting are following social distancing, wearing gloves, masks and aprons. They are also instructing devotees to maintain social distancing and immersion was done in a systematic manner at my residential society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/devotees-bid-adieu-to-gauri-ganesh-under-safety-cover-in-pune/story-2lXuL6T5mpFoz6SMAt5xHP.html
28-08-2020||Pune||Hit by Covid-19 pandemic, Pune libraries use every trick in the book to survive||First hit by the digital boom of ebooks and now, the lockdown necessitated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, reading and lending libraries in the city have been struggling for survival. Of the 190 libraries across Pune (100 privately-owned and 90 government libraries), at least 100 have witnessed reduced subscriptions and revenues over the past few months. Going online, waving off late fees and entry only on reservations- city libraries are now coming up with different ways to still be relevant. One of the city’s largest libraries, the British Council closed its Pune operations in June. The library is now online and informed its members of this decision via mail. The mail read, “As the coronavirus situation is evolving in India, the British Council supports and cooperates with national and state government authorities to put all necessary measures in place, and ensure the continued well-being of all whom we engage with in the course of our operations.  In light of the various state government advisories on closing all educational institutions and avoiding mass gatherings, British Council Library in Delhi, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune will remain closed for public access starting March 15 until further notice. We are also extending your library membership by six weeks and no overdue charges will be levied for the closure period for late return of books and other library materials; so you don’t face any inconvenience during this time.”Besides this library, 90 other libraries and reading rooms registered with the Pune district library officer will remain closed till August 31, following the Maharashtra government circular. However, with the constant support of bibliophiles, some of the privately-run libraries are braving the Covid-19 situation and opened to business in July. Apart from financial loses, libraries were losing at least 60 per cent of their members. Ulka Awasthi, owner of Reader’s Library in Aundh recalls how senior citizens started withdrawing their membership or putting it on hold when the lockdown was first announced. “It was a wave of panic when the lockdown was announced. Many, who were interested in reading books, took as many as 10 books with them, while some of them began withdrawing their membership or requested me to keep it on hold,” said Awasthi. Meanwhile, vorocious readers like N Varke from Aundh believe books are the best source of infotainment and had been patiently waiting for the library to open. “I am 70 years old and since my children live abroad, only my wife and I stay here. We tend to read a lot and are not interested in TV series. We feel that books are the best company we have. Hence, even though it is risky, we go to a library in Aundh.”“A few of the members wanted to stock up on books during the lockdown. I kept the library open for half-a-day in April, becuase if I closed it permanently, I would lose subscriptions. It helped me pay half the rent too. Now, the library is completely sanitised, however, some still do not come here. There are a few senior citizens, who are avid readers, who come to the library every alternate day and exchange books. The situation is tough for our business,” added Awasthi of Readers’s Library which offers children’s books and a vast collection of Diwali Ank for its readers at Rs 250 per month.Owner of Books Meridien, Dhiraj Kothari, suggests prior appointment to avoid crowds at the library. “Readers are a bit cautious, but book lovers can’t stop exchanging books. Hence to help them, we have online book reservations wherein they can simply pick up the book off the counter instead of spending time within the library. Due to the lockdown, I lost 60 per cent of my members, but now the situation is slightly better,” said Kothari.Seema Sharma is yet to visit her library in Kothrud as it will be closed till August 31. “I stay in Bavdhan and my library is in Kothrud. My son loves to read and because of Covid-19, we have not been able to go to the library to get books. He has finished reading his entire collection at home,” said Seema. Nagar Vachan Granthalaya, which is a 172-year-old library in the city, with five branches, opened for business after three months of lockdown in July. “We started operations on July 1 and received a good response from our members. Some were very grateful that we opened our doors and also ensured social distancing and sanitisation. Many members said that they were bored at home with books. Initially, we kept the library open between 10am and 2pm, but now it is open throughout the day. We even waived off the late fees for many of our subscribers who had books with them before the lockdown,” said Suvarna Jayant Joglekar, secretary of the Laxmi road branch. The library has 2,000 members and several new members joined post the opening of the library. It charges Rs 30 per month for books in English and Marathi and offers home delivery service, which is currently shut down due to Covid. Unfortunately, Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad library has not been able to open its doors for its members. “We are ready to welcome our members, but sadly we are following the government protocol to keep it closed till August 31. Most of our members, which are close to 1,000 who pay Rs 300 per month, are senior citizens who are vulnerable to Covid. Thus, we are closed but this closure is adding to our losses,” said VD Pingale, director of the library.
