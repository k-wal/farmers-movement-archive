17-08-2020||Chandigarh||Large hearted Ganpati gets smaller as festivities are toned down due to Covid-19||City-based fourth generation sculptor Khokhan Adhikari, 50, looks forward eagerly to Ganesh Chaturthi, when he and 15 small-time sculptors from his native West Bengal make idols to earn a decent amount that helps them get by every year. Khokhan’s paternal uncle Govardhan, 65, runs a similar operation and employs 12 artists each year.The Covid-19 outbreak, however, has changed the way religious festivals are celebrated, hitting people like Adhikari hard as costs of religious idols have crashed because of lack of demand even as Ganesh Chaturthi is just round the corner on August 22. Last year, Adhikari, who has been running his idol making unit at the Kalibari temple premises in Ram Darbar for the last three decades, got an order of over 400 medium and small size idols of Ganesh and 50 big idols, their height ranging from 6 to 12 feet. While the price of a large sized idol is Rs 10,000, the smaller ones are in the range of Rs 500 to Rs 2,500, but this year larger Ganeshas have all but disappeared and demand for smaller sized idols cut down by half, curtailing their overall turnover to one-fourth. The number of hired hands has come down to just four from 15.The eldest of the Adhikaris, Govardhan, whose idol-making unit is in Shiv Mandir, Baikund Dham in Ram Darbar, too had a flourishing business last year, but this time orders are limited. Govardhan’s son Subhash, 40, and three of their relatives have made the idols, without any of their regular outstation artists for the first time in 35 years.“Because of pandemic, people are avoiding gatherings even for pooja, so no one has ordered the big idols and ask for smaller ones that can easily be immersed at home. Earlier, apart from Ganesh Chaturthi, we used to get some work preparing tableaux for temples during Janmashtami and then Durga Pooja. But this time there was no work during Janmashtami and Durga Pooja too is going to be the same,” says Anubhav Adhikari, 19, a second year BA student, and who helps his father in the business. “Every year we use to get 14 to 15 sculptors to meet the demand, but this time because of the pandemic we have only four artistes from Bengal,” he adds. “Demand has been increasing every year, but this year things have changed,” says sculptor Nepal Noskar, 70, who has been coming to Chandigarh from West Bengal for the last 34 years without a break. Artists who left Bengal have got work but those who stayed back are struggling as there is no work over there with Durga pooja plans cancelled, he adds. This year, the cost of idols has also gone up by 20-25%, with Adhikari (Khokhan), who is flying in his artists this time and coping with limited demand, is trying to cover costs.  “The only thing that I will remember of the Covid times is that for the first time in my life I got a chance to travel by air,” says Parikhit Sardar, 55, who also has been visiting Chandigarh over the years.“Hope Lord Ganesh will see to it that the situation improves by next year or we’ll have to look for other work,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/large-hearted-ganpati-gets-smaller-as-festivities-are-toned-down-due-to-covid-19/story-lRzGXM6fOVIhBD79v53SdL.html

A three-member SIT, under the supervision of the assistant commissioner of police (crime), Preet Pal was formed on Monday to look into the case. According to the police, on August 5 around 7.45pm, the victim, Dheeraj Ahlawat, who worked in the corporate banking department of a private bank, was last seen walking on a service lane near his house in Sector 46. After he failed to return later that evening, his family launched a search and looked around for him and enquired with friends and relatives. The following day, his family filed a missing person’s complaint at Sector 50 police station. An FIR under section 346 of Indian Penal Code was lodged based on the complaint. The victim’s brother, Jasvir Singh, alleged that the family told the police that Dheeraj could have been kidnapped as he dealt in huge loan amounts as part of his job. But the police dismissed their concerns, stating that he may have gone somewhere of his own volition.“He returned home on August 5 evening and changed into a T-shirt and went for a stroll in his slippers around 7.45pm. Before leaving, he grabbed the mask from his car and kept the car keys in his pocket. If he wanted to go somewhere far, he would have taken the car. He had no money on him. Both his phones were later found switched off. He did not have any personal enmity with anyone,” said Jasvir. Singh said that they had contacted a relative in Delhi police soon after, who told them that a body matching Dheeraj’s description had been fished out of a canal near Rohini on the night of August 7. “We received information on August 12 regarding a body and I went to the hospital in Delhi, where the body had been kept, to check. I identified the body, which only had an underwear on, through the rakhi, which my sister had tied on his left hand, and by his build. According to the police, Dheeraj’s body was found completely naked except the underwear when it was found. We suspect that he was kidnapped and then murdered. He was a decent swimmer,” said Jasvir. After his body was found in Delhi, the victim’s family informed the police in Sector 50 and a kidnapping charge was added to the FIR. A post-mortem was conducted on August 12 and police said that viscera samples have been sent to the forensics laboratory for examination. Jasvir said that they met the commissioner of police on Monday demanding a thorough probe into the death. “My brother’s work involved disbursement of corporate loans worth several hundred crores. It is possible that he was targeted due to some money related dispute,” said Singh. Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “A three-member SIT has been formed to investigate the case. We had registered an FIR immediately after the family had reported that the person had gone missing. The body was later found by Delhi Police and the charge of kidnapping was added as per the circumstances and facts of the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/missing-senior-pvt-bank-executive-found-dead-in-delhi-canal-sit-to-probe-case/story-d0hW7T62941HxmgQIfcXvO.html
17-08-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police to launch drive to check misuse of social media by teens||The city police, in a move to create awareness among teens on the misuse of social media, will start an awareness campaign with the help of schools, officials said on Monday. In this campaign, the cyber-crime cell officials will rope in experts to take online classes for school students and educate them on the use of cyber space, including social networking websites. The awareness campaign by the police come sin the backdrop of a 17-year-old British national of Indian origin being allegedly sexually assaulted, thrashed and threatened in Sushant Lok-1 on July 23 allegedly by 10 boys, whom he had met through a social networking app. The incident was reported on Saturday, following which a case was registered. Police commissioner KK Rao said that the motive behind starting such an awareness drive was to check the rise of cybercrime incidents involving students. “These days teenagers try newly launched applications and use them to upload their personal information and their pictures. Students take to social media to open their hearts and connect with strangers, without weighing the pros and cons of such situations,” he said. In May, a controversy had erupted after a social media group — comprising mainly schoolboys — that discussed purported plans to rape a classmate was discovered. In Gurugram, a 14-year-old boy had committed suicide soon after the incident by jumping off from the 11th floor of his apartment building. He was not part of the social media group but was scared of being named as a molester by a girl who made a ‘#metoo’ social media post after screenshots of the group went viral on social media platforms. Rao said parents need to watch the internet usage of children and must monitor their activities on social media platforms. “The social media platforms these days are mostly used by youngsters. Looking at the cases that are coming up, we realise that it’s the teenagers who are misusing them also. Lack of awareness is a major issue and these teens don’t know where to draw a line,” Rao said, adding that focus should be on sharing laws on misuse of cyber space. The police said they are taking the help of schools in carrying out their campaign. Sudha Goyal, director, Scottish High International School, said that the official age to use social networking website is 18 years and above. But that age rule is hardly followed and its easy to create fake accounts to register on any sites. “We can’t stop students from using the cyber space, but we can educate them . Just like we talk about “good touch and bad touch” during regular classes, our teachers regularly counsel students, specially the little ones, on issues of online stranger acquaintances, social media encroachers and cyber security. We will also start a fresh awareness drive to educate students and will rope in cyber experts for the same,” she said. Rohit Malik, director, Lancers International School, said that social media usage can have both positive and negative influence. “It all depends on how a student interacts with the medium. Even the parents need to create social media literacy so that children can use the medium for their benefit. Instead of asking students to just get off social media, which they won’t, we must educate them how and what to use and what should be avoided,” he said.Neeti Kaushik, principal of Mount Olympus School in Sector 47 said that learning is an integrated process where we learn together about threats and challenges of technology and social media through continuous interaction in the form of class wise group discussions by principal and teachers. “We believe that guidance and care should never stop and that the sole aim of guidance is to enable our learners with the life skill to choose wisely. We choose to instruct less and empower more so that our learners are able to think of consequences and make decisions that are trustworthy. We believe in keeping our learners constructively engaged and occupied in pursuit of health, knowledge, creativity and self-development. We focus on building a positive school climate that enthuses happiness, positivity and free expression without judgment,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-to-launch-drive-to-check-misuse-of-social-media-by-teens/story-hYUA7KnWvLB4zlsxNDcXPL.html

Farmood Ali Pundir, station house officer of Noida Phase 2 police station, said that the minor girl had gone missing on July 13 after she had gone to the local market to buy grocery. “The victim’s family launched a search when she did not return in the evening. They also spoke to their relatives and local people but failed to trace her. Five days later, the family filed a complaint of abduction,” he said. The victim’s family suspected the role of three local persons – Mahboob, Salman, Sabir and one unknown person in case. The police registered a case against them under sections 363 [abduction] and 366 [kidnapping and compelling woman to marriage] of the Indian Penal Code. Pundir said that the police questioned the suspects who revealed that a person named Dhramveer had fled with the girl to Badaun. On Sunday, a team searched the suspect’s house and arrested him. “We also rescued the minor from his house. The victim has been sent for a medical examination and report is awaited. She will be produced before the magistrate to record her statement. We will press charges of rape if the medical report suggests,” he said.

17-08-2020||Gurugram||Smuggling of Covid drugs: Two more held from Jhajjar; 13 arrested for far||htreporters@hindustantimes.com The special investigation team (SIT), constituted to investigate the black marketing racket of pharmaceutical drugs and medicines, including those used in the treatment of Covid-19 and cancer, arrested a pharmacist and a supplier of medicines from Jhajjar on Saturday, taking the total number of arrests related to the case to 13 so far. On Saturday, the five-member SIT conducted raids in Jhajjar and arrested a pharmacist named Naveen Sharma, and a medicines supplier named Deepak Sharma. The police said the accused men had sold over 7,100 prohibited injections and 12,000 tablets worth over ₹7 lakh to two Iraqi interpreters in Sector 57. The consignment, the police said, was supposed to be sent to Iraq and sold for a premium. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “During interrogation, the two Iraqi suspects, who were arrested from Sector 57, during the first raid, had disclosed the names of Naveen and Deepak. They had been in touch with the interpreters for over six months and had supplied the medicines and injections for a commission.” After the racket was busted, they had escaped to Jhajjar, from where they were arrested, said the police. Naveen runs a medical store in South City-1 and Deepak is a supplier of pharmaceuticals in the city. So far, the police have arrested four Iraqi interpreters, six pharmacists, two wholesale distributors and a medicines supplier, who are allegedly a part of the racket. The Iraqi interpreters were arrested on July 28, after conducting a raid in which the police had seized 48 vials of remdesivir, 55 strips of fabiflu and 18 packs of Lopikast ( drugs used to treat Covid-19) among other medicines. Since then, the police have followed a pattern of reverse tracking to uncover the nexus, with the probe widening to four cities — Delhi, Gurugram, Jaipur and Agra. A week after the racket was busted, the police had arrested several pharmacists and medical store owners from Gurugram and Delhi. The probe had revealed that the pharmacists, in turn, had procured the medicines, including remdesivir, from wholesale medicine distributors in Agra and Jaipur. One of the wholesalers was a distributor of remdesivir. The police have also written to the manufacturing company of the drug to get to the source and unearth the nexus. Earlier, the police had said that the role of some hospitals in Delhi was also under the scanner for facilitating the supply of drugs. Police probe has revealed that the Iraqi interpreters had been smuggling medicines to Iraq for at least two years, and since the pandemic, they had started dealing primarily in drugs used to treat Covid-19 that were in short supply and were sold at exorbitant prices in Iraq. The suspects worked as translators for medical tourism patients at private hospitals and enlisted the patients or their attendants as conduits, asking them to carry the medicines in flights to Iraq, from where they would be collected by an agent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/smuggling-of-covid-drugs-two-more-held-from-jhajjar-13-arrested-for-far/story-Xv2YAnLKEJ5FCOajDXjx1O.html
17-08-2020||City||Gurugram: District lagging in survey of vulnerable sections for Covid relief||Gurugram: During the initial stage of the national lockdown, the Haryana government had directed each district across the state to form unit committees, sector committees, and a zonal committee in early April to help streamline relief operations. However, even after four months, the properties surveyed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) have been less than one-third of the total in the district.Unit committees comprise a junior-level government employee, a local resident of a particular survey area and some social workers or members of civil society organisations. They were assigned the responsibility of identifying underprivileged households across the city who need ration and cooked meals, keeping a database of the elderly, single-women households, children with special needs as well as unorganised daily-wage earners through surveys and to identify their specific needs.On the basis of this information, sector committees led by MCG junior engineers and assistant engineers would provide assistance to unit committees, wherever required, and relay their operations and on-ground findings to the zonal committee. The Zonal committee members, which include four MCG joint commissioners, superintending engineer, and senior town planner (STP) in Gurugram, would then inform the district administration or the MCG for initiating relief measures in such localities. In this regard, a review meeting was held with all zonal committee members by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Monday.In the meeting, the zonal committee members revealed that so far only 97,000 properties have been surveyed by over 600 unit committees, whereas as per MCG’s property tax records there are 2.97 lakh properties under the agency’s jurisdiction in the city.According to a senior MCG official who attended the meeting, the main reason given by zonal officers for the progress rate in the survey work was attributed to unit committee members allegedly being frequently absent following which Singh directed them to take action against such employees and to terminate their services, if needed.“In most districts of Haryana, the survey work has either been completed or is nearing completion. MCG commissioner also passed on this information to all zonal officers and directed them to expedite work and initiate action against those workers showing negligence or laxity,” said the official, wishing not to be identified.In the meeting, officials of the zonal committee were directed by MCG commissioner Singh to expedite the pending survey, direct workers in the unit committee to explain their reason for poor performance so far, set them new targets, and review their survey at least twice a week. In addition, the zonal committee officers were further directed to review the performance of employees engaged in the survey work. The MCG commissioner directed that if the performance of the unit committee workers is found to be unsatisfactory, then to send a letter to their respective departments for action against them.“All zonal officers were directed to constantly review the survey work and get the work completed on a priority basis. In addition, zonal officers were further directed to provide a list of polling booths to the unit committee, which will give them the requisite information of the total number of people living in a particular area, their demography, location and such additional information, all of which will aid them in completing the survey at the earliest,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-district-lagging-in-survey-of-vulnerable-sections-for-covid-relief/story-pga2RysYoMsjnCzvHw0bFL.html

17-08-2020||Gurugram||Five men arrested for duping over 100 people of ₹1 crore on pretext of offering jobs||Five men were arrested from Gurugram for allegedly duping over 100 people of over ₹1 crore, on the pretext of offering them jobs in multinational companies, the police said on Monday. The police were apprised of the alleged crime by a resident of Bengaluru, who was duped of ₹13 lakh, on the pretext of being offered a job in his home town. The police said the suspects ran a placement agency and used to call victims, claiming to be representatives of prominent multinational companies. They also placed an advertisement on an online job portal and asked their victims to transfer money in order to process their job requests and for other related expenses. The suspects were identified as Sanjay Kumar, Sonu Kumar, Manoj Kumar, Dhruv Srivastava and Lokesh Kumar who were operating from Sector 43. They were arrested on Sunday and produced before the district and sessions court. Later, they were taken on a two-day police remand on Monday. The police said that as per their bank statements, they had duped at least 100 people and had raked in more than ₹1 crore. Currently, they had 9 lakh in their bank account. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said they received a complaint from one Ninganagouda S Amminabhavi — 40-year-old senior executive of a private company based in Bengaluru — who was allegedly duped of ₹13 lakh in total in three different transactions. “The suspects had called him, offering jobs in prominent companies and had asked him to deposit ₹5,500 in order to process his request. They lined up interviews with various companies and had shared their ID’s as well. Despite waiting for a week, the victim did not hear from the companies. He then started asking the suspects to refund his money, following which they again duped him of ₹2,73,000 on pretext of signing bond papers for which he took loan from friends and relatives. Finally, they again duped him of the remaining amount in the pretext of finalising his job offer.” he said. The police said the gang members had created several fake email ids and domains of the companies to dupe their victims. The police had received several complaints from residents across the country, following which they handed over to case to the cybercrime cell on Saturday. Goel said the police began tracking this gang after they received a direct complaint from Bengaluru-based executive on August 15. “The gang operated in an organised manner and had different people performing different tasks, such as making calls, creating bank accounts with fake documentation, and withdrawing cash. They had opened a bank account after getting the company registered and they were running a call centre out of Delhi where more than 20 boys and girls were working. They used to duped people and later transfer money into their account through e-wallets to escape police scanner ,” he said. The cybercrime police arrested Manoj and Dhruv on Monday from Sector 43. Earlier on Sunday, the police arrested the three main suspects, Sanjay, Sonu and Lokesh, who shared the location of the other two. The police said the business was started by two brothers, Sanjay and Sonu, in 2017 from Gurugram. “They later contacted their relative Lokesh. In March last year, they decided to start their own call centre but came in contact of Dhruv and Manoj , who had already set up a call centre in Delhi. Dhruv and Manoj gave them the idea of duping people by buying data from various vendors and platforms. They majorly targeted people from south India,” said Goel. The police said there are conducting investigation if more people are involved in the fraud. A case under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 120 B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and Section 66D of Information Technology(IT) Act was registered at the Cyber police station on Saturday. The police recovered seven mobile phones and ₹75,000 in cash from the suspects’ possession. They also freezed their bank account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-men-arrested-for-duping-over-100-people-of-1-crore-on-pretext-of-offering-jobs/story-BqjxuhC2L4rRle335LHdIM.html
17-08-2020||City||Gurugram: Unauthorised sewage disposal can now earn hefty fine, prison term||Gurugram: Unauthorised disposal of sewage in open areas, drains, or private plots will now result in a tank owner being slapped with a minimum penalty of ₹25,000 and might also lead to a prison term of up to six months, a public notification issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Monday stated.The notification further stated that a 20% hike on penalty fines will be imposed on subsequent detections by the same violator, while under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) the violator could also be imprisoned for up to six months. Until last month, the fine for unauthorised dumping of sewage waste was ₹5,000.In many parts of the city, especially the new sectors – 56 to 115 – residential areas are still not connected to master sewerage lines of Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). Thus, the practice of unauthorised dumping of sewage is very common in such areas.A January 2019, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) report had stated that at least 80 million litres of untreated sewage is being dumped in storm water drains across the city which results in choking water bodies and drains, polluting the underground water table, and leading to water logging during the monsoon season.“To curb the unauthorised disposal of sewage, twelve agencies have now been registered by MCG through the tendering process. Details such as the list of agencies for each ward and their charges per trip, etc., have also been uploaded on our official website – www.mcg.gov.in from where residents or RWAs can avail their facility. We realise the problems associated with the unauthorised disposal of sewerage and have accordingly revised our penalties for such violations,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG. MCG has also listed numbers – 9811356914 and 8700089711 – on which residents can contact the civic body to avail the services of registered tankers.Coincidentally on Monday, the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) also issued a direction to commissioners of municipal corporations and deputy commissioners across the state for “strict compliance of septic tank management policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-unauthorised-sewage-disposal-can-now-earn-hefty-fine-prison-term/story-PXgUbGyTnwxgiOK47CVWFO.html
17-08-2020||City||Noida: Cobra rescued from metro station’s canteen||Noida: A two-foot-long baby cobra has been rescued from the canteen of Okhla Bird Sanctuary Metro station in Sector 94. The Metro staff spotted the snake sitting under a table. A rescue team from Wildlife SOS, an NGO that caters to protection of wild animals, rushed to the spot with protective gear and rescued the cobra. Officials of Wildlife SOS said that the cobra might have come through the green patches which have come up due to rainy season. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS, said the rescue team had received a call about a cobra sighting at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary Metro Station around 8pm on August 14. “The Delhi Metro staff were shocked to find the snake under a table in the canteen. They immediately alerted the NGO’s emergency helpline +91-9871963535,” he said. Notably, the Okhla Bird Sanctuary Metro station is located on Magenta Line of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). A rescue team reached the spot in half-an-hour. “The team rescued the cobra swiftly. Cobras are shy in nature but when suddenly confronted they may attack in self-defence. Juvenile cobras also have the potency of venom, so it is very important to remain cautious,” Satyanarayan said. The rescue work was completed in 20 minutes and the cobra was later released in the forest range in Tughlakabad.The Wildlife officials said that during monsoon the natural homes of these reptiles get flooded and hence they come out. The NGO receives the highest number of calls for reptile sighting during this season, they said. A DMRC spokesperson said that whenever they spot reptiles, they inform the wildlife department. India is home to a variety of snake species ranging from extremely venomous like cobra and common krait to relatively harmless and non-venomous ones like sand boa, wolf snake and rat snake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-cobra-rescued-from-metro-station-s-canteen/story-bpCsI2mf2CKmlPsxeRKv2L.html
17-08-2020||City||No Covid-19 fatality in GB Nagar after August 1||NOIDA Gautam Budh Nagar has not reported any death due to Covid-19 in the past 16 days, bringing down the mortality rate to 0.66% on Monday. The district’s fatality rate on August 2 was 0.79%, according to the state’s Covid data.However, as many as 1,113 new positive cases have been detected in the district from August 2 to August 17. The last time when GB Nagar had reported Covid-related death was August 1. The recovery rate has also improved in the district, as it has gone up to 86.96% (August 17) from 82.89% on August 2. According to an analysis of the Covid data, GB Nagar (with 43 deaths) has the lowest mortality rate among the districts having more than 2,000 cases across the state. Among such districts, Deoria tops with 4.66% fatality rate, followed by Balia (4.26%), Kanpur (2.94%), Meerut (2.79%), Jhansi (2.75%), Varanasi (2.17%), Bareilly (1.96%), Prayagraj (1.84%), Gorakhpur (1.59%) and Lucknow (1.24%). Among all 75 districts in the state, GB Nagar stands at 69th position in terms of the fatality rate.In terms of Covid-related deaths (till Monday), Kanpur leads with 309 deaths, followed by Lucknow (217), Varanasi (125), Meerut (123), Agra (104) and Prayagraj (102), the data shows. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said the district administration is leaving no stone unturned to check the case fatality ratio (better known as mortality rate) and increase the recovery rate. “Our district has lowest mortality rate among all the districts in the state, which has more than 5,000 cases. It is mainly because of aggressive testing and early detection, coupled with quick isolation and effective treatment protocol. Not only that, our teams of doctors, sometimes, assert to keep Covid-19 patients having co-morbidities in hospitals rather than providing them home isolation. It might appear rude to those patients, but the fact is that we can’t take chances with people’s lives,” he said. Echoing similar views, district’s chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that early testing of the symptomatic patients and organizing health camps in different localities for identifying the patients with co-morbidities and influenza like symptoms are the main reasons of downward trend of mortality rate and active cases. “Focussing on critical age groups and patients with co-morbidities has resulted in low fatality rate and more recoveries. Also, our doctors at different Covid-19 facilities are doing exemplary job in treatment of the infected people,” he said. Dr Vivek Gupta, head of micropathology in Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, said that early detection of cases and timely treatment of patients have helped reduce the mortality rate. “If my observation in the laboratory is any indication, the cases are on receding trend in the district. And, since the patients with other ailments are being tracked on time, the mortality rate has to go down,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-covid-19-fatality-in-gb-nagar-after-august-1/story-LSEjhTPU9EDi1cappodrjP.html

Police officers said that they have registered an FIR into the incident and are probing it from all angles.The incident took place around 12.30am on Monday when several staff members of the petrol pump deployed to disburse fuel and the guard, 47-year-old Naresh Kumar, was stationed at the exit of the station.“Two men arrived at the pump around 12.30am on Monday and approached the guard. They wanted water and the guard informed them they could get it from the RO system installed at the station. After having the water, they went near to the guard and one snatched his double barrel gun while the other fired a shot at him. The guard sustained a gunshot wound to his chest and fell down,” said Saurabh Gupta, the owner of the pump. “The two men immediately fled to the other side of the road where probably their other accomplices were waiting in vehicles and fled the spot. They also took away the licensed gun of the guard. The incident was captured in the CCTV installed and the police have taken it for investigation. The guard is admitted to an ICU of a private hospital in Nehru Nagar in Ghaziabad and is under observation for three days,” he added.He added that the two assailants did not come close to the office of the fuel station where the cash is generally kept. The guard is from Shahjahanpur district and resided locally at nearby Mainapur village, he added.“The two men were unidentified and the guard was shot at during the incident. He is admitted at a hospital and is under treatment. We have registered a case and are investigating all angles,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, acting superintendent of police (rural).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-unidentified-men-shoot-at-petrol-pump-guard-flee-with-his-licensed-gun/story-FJ3ClO7RwF8FqYL7lHVZmI.html
17-08-2020||City||Ghaziabad completes over 98% contact tracing||Ghaziabad The district, which was struggling to trace contacts of Covid-19 positive patients till mid-July, has completed over 98% contact tracing till August 16. According to official records of the district health department, the teams involved in contact tracing have traced 41,933 contacts of 6,526 (out of total 6,634) positive patients till August 16. This provides the district an overall contact-tracing rate of 98.3%, officials said. Notably, the district had managed to trace the contacts of only 65% of the positive patients till July 16. The officials said that in August, they have been able to trace an average of 10.16 contacts per positive patient while the figure stood at 4.6 contacts till July 16. The contact-tracing activity is vital to control the spread of infection. The officials said that the district administration also roped in electronic surveillance services of the district police to trace contacts of patients who often give away wrong mobile numbers or addresses. “The contact-tracing activity was slow till July, but we brought back focus and our teams responded well. With the activity going on at a fast pace, we have been able to trace more contacts of positive patients overall and the average contact per patient has further increased in August. The teams have done 98.3% contact tracing and the data has been uploaded on the portal,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that the health department has also taken up testing of 96.29% of the contacts traced. “Of the 41,933 contacts traced, testing of 40,381 have been done so far. We have an average of about 6.42 contacts traced per positive patient since March (till August 16). We have been asked by the state officials to trace at least 10 contacts of every patient to contain the Covid-19 spread,” said Gupta. “Of about 1,600-odd positive cases in the first 16 days of August, we have traced contacts of 1,302 patients while the work is on for other patients. During the period, we have traced 13,238 contacts of 1,302 patients with an average of 10.16 contacts per positive patient,” he added. The officials said that of the 13,238 contacts traced in the ongoing month of August, they have been able to test 12,840 (96.99%) of them. With the overall 98.3% contact tracing done, the district has moved to green category as per the criteria. “For moving to green category, the district must trace over 95% contacts of positive patients and also test over 95% of traced contacts. So, the district is now under green category. Based on different criteria, the districts are placed under green, yellow and other categories,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, nodal officer (Covid) from the state health department. For the contact-tracing exercise, the administration had also roped in services of the district police in July and 18 police officers from as many police stations across the district were assigned special duty for tracing of contacts, along with officials from the administration and the health department. Under the arrangement, tracing teams visit the houses of contacts and also use electronic surveillance in order to track locations of people. The contact tracing activities are also monitored from the integrated command and control centre which is operational at the district headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-completes-over-98-contact-tracing/story-XnONwudnuZkhkUhKXuRfyO.html
17-08-2020||Gurugram||Number of hospitalised Covid patients shoots up; no cause for worry, says CMO||The number of Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in various private hospitals of the city has witnessed an increase in the last few days. Although hospitalisation figures are dynamic as they continue to change every day, the number of such patients have reached above 90 in the last one week. From 64 Covid-19 patients hospitalised on August 6, the figures had soared to 96 as on August 16. Health officials said that they were evaluating all the cases. Data shows that on June 30, at least 417 Covid-19 patients (Gurugram residents) were admitted in various hospitals. By July 7, the number had come down to 197, dropping further to 175 (July 14) and 165 (July 20). On July 27, the hospitalisation numbers reduced to double digit, with 96 cases. The number further declined consistently and reached 64 on August 6.However, in the last 10 days, the numbers have again started to increase. On August 10, at least 89 positive patients were in hospitals. It increased to 98 on August 13. After a few patients getting discharged, the numbers reached 96 on Sunday. On Monday, 91 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus were undergoing treatment in various hospitals, according to the district health bulletin. Currently, 720 Covid-19 cases are active in the district out of the 10,360 cases reported in the city so far. At least 9,510 have recovered and 130 have succumbed to the virus so far. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that healthcare teams are evaluating the increase in hospitalisation figures. “Firstly, surgeries and other health treatments have started in hospitals. So before patients are admitted, they are tested for Covid-19. If a patient tests positive, they are included in the hospitalised positive patients list. Also, many a times. a symptomatic patient prefers gets admitted in a hospital rather being home isolated. Secondly, there are no critical patients of Covid-19, except one who is on ventilator.” Currently, the administration has reserved 1,486 general isolation ward beds, inclusive of 192 Intensive Care Unit beds and 92 beds with ventilator support system, in 40 hospitals of the city . The number of hospitals include 37 private and two state-run hospitals (apart from All India Institute of Medical Sciences – Jhajjar).As reported by HT earlier this week, the health department was thinking of reducing the number of reserved beds in various private hospitals for Covid patients from the existing 25% to 10-20%, as number of cases continues to decline in Gurugram. Several private hospitals of the city have also approached the health department to reduce the number of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. Yadav said that a reduction in number of reserved beds can be considered only after the positivity rate falls below 5%. Gurugram’s current positivity rate is 7.1%. He said that government hospital like ESIC, where mildly symptomatic patients are being admitted, might function as isolation wards, but with a minimum of 10 beds for Covid patients. There are no plans to reduce the number of beds in Medeor Hospital, a Covid-19 designated facility for critical patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/number-of-hospitalised-covid-patients-shoots-up-no-cause-for-worry-says-cmo/story-3jKxqeXV8vWxiDDdhfcfXJ.html
17-08-2020||Gurugram||After drastic drop between March and July, admission in city’s emergency wards sees an uptick||archana.mishra@hindustantimes.com With a decline in the number of active coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city and increasing relaxations after the lockdown, various private hospitals are reporting a rise in admissions in the emergency units with cases of accidents, injuries, cardiac and brain strokes being reported. After witnessing a drastic downfall of almost 50-60% in the inflow of emergency patients between March and July due to the lockdown, doctors said that emergency numbers are gradually rising as people are overcoming their fear of getting infected and are no longer hesitant to visit hospitals. “In the last two weeks, our emergency facility has seen an increase of 16-17% in footfall,” said Dr Salil Malik, consultant and head of department, emergency medicine, Max Hospital, Gurugram. “Compared to last year, the emergency unit noticed a fall of 40% patients between March and July this year. With the gradual unlocking and regular traffic becoming operational, trauma cases are coming with the patients reporting fever, dengue, pneumonia and urinary tract infections,” said Malik. Dr Nikhil Mishra, chief of medical services, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, also agreed that in the last two weeks inflow of patients in emergency has increased by 15%. “It is less than 2019. If were having 1,000 patients in the emergency in 2019, the number got reduced by almost 50% this year,” said Mishra. Hospital data shows that in 2019, emergency cases, such as those of assault, poisoning, drug overdose, injury, renal issues and trauma, among others, were somewhere between 1,100- 1,300 between March and August 2019. This year, during the same period, the number has dipped to 520-590, with mostly cases of renal issues and injuries being reported. Earlier in March this year, the Central government had issued an advisory, directing medical institutions and hospitals to postpone elective surgeries. Later, between May and June, these services were resumed. “Fear of contracting Covid-19 made people avoid multiple visits to the hospital,” said Dr Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of emergency department, Naryana Hospital. According to him compared to 2019 (between March and July), there has been a 40-45% drop in the patients coming to the emergency. Likewise, a significant drop of 30-40% in the number of patients who got admitted. “The decline was also due to a drop in accident cases and drink driving during lockdown,” he said. Apart from the decline in the number of road accidents, there has also been a drop in the number of emergency cases coming in from other states primarily due to fear of travelling, according to Dr Ritu Garg, Zonal Director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute. “In comparison to last year, the emergency footfall is currently at 60 -65%. Earlier there was a dip in emergency footfall as people were keeping indoors and were apprehensive of coming to the hospital for treatment. Now with relaxation in the border movement, we have seen a rise in the number of emergency visits,” she said, adding that most of the patients getting admitted in emergency are cases of cardiology, neurology and gastroenterology.Kumar, however, said that they are also getting 40-50% cases of brain haemorrhage or brain strokes, although the numbers are still low. “After a person gets a brain stroke there is a window period of four hours. A patient must be admitted in the hospital within this time period or else it further increases the risk. Some of the cases are being reported after this window period is over. To avoid infection, people are still putting their brain health at risk,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-drastic-drop-between-march-and-july-admission-in-city-s-emergency-wards-sees-an-uptick/story-tiGekBxLibrqiR0yqUG2QJ.html

On Monday, Mann and AAP state observer Jarnail Singh visited the city to attend a ceremony at Shingar cinema road to welcome leaders from Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) into the party fold.Jarnail Singh said, “The working of the ruling government can be judged from the fact that its leaders are joining the opposition.”Lashing out at the CM over the hooch tragedy, Mann said that ‘Raja Sahib’ had not fulfilled even 29 promises listed in his 129-page election manifesto. “He is rather offering patronage to the mafia taking its reins from the Badals. The CM reacted only after AAP staged a protest over his absence even when the state had witnessed a major tragedy,” he said.Mann said that the party will announce the name of its CM candidate before contesting the 2022 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-mafia-being-run-under-the-patronage-of-cong-leaders-says-aap-state-chief/story-PN9ninlERYPl1xv6IQBxSN.html
17-08-2020||City||Case fatality rate in Ghaziabad falls below 1%||The overall case fatality rate (CFR) in Ghaziabad has fallen to below 1% of the total Covid-19 cases, according to the state government’s Covid portal till 3pm on Monday.The state government’s daily health bulletin, which gives a 24-hour report, on Monday read a CFR of 1%. The Covid portal on the other hand gives real-time data that read 67 deaths over 6,730 cases gave a CFR of 0.99%, marking the first time that the statistic fell below 1%.While the number of cases in the district keeps on increasing, experts say that this was expected given the increase in testing. The focus, they said, should be on reducing deaths.Overall in UP, the CFR stood at 1.58% till August 17, according to the health bulletin, and 23 of 75 districts had a rate below 1%. The district administration officials said that the rate was achieved with putting in place certain measures and more efforts will be put in to further lower down the death rate. “The Uttar Pradesh chief minister had directed all districts to work hard to lower down the CFR. Now, we will try to reduce it further. We are constantly trying to maintain 3,000-3,500 tests per day along with extensive focussed surveillance activities to detect suspected cases. Once detected, they are tested and referred to appropriate Covid facility if found positive. The idea is to detect cases and get them treated before they move to stage of complication,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “For this, the district has also come up with an integrated command and control centre where all the Covid-19 related activities like those related to contact tracing, monitoring of patients in Home isolation and surveillance teams, assigning ambulances and other activities are integrated. We also have ICU beds reserved in private hospitals where the patients from government facilities can immediately be referred in case of need,” he said. A majority of death cases in Ghaziabad were reported in the month of June when 51 fatalities were added to the tally. Thereafter, the officials put in measures and the fatalities reduced to nine in July and three in August till now. “We have also come up with 200 L-2 (moderate cases) beds at Santosh Medical College,, while 200 are reserved as L-3 (serious cases) beds. Since the L-2 and L-3 beds are at the same premises, the time required in transferring patients was considerably reduced. At present we have overall 135 ICU beds in Ghaziabad with 98 in private hospitals and 37 in government Covid facilities,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. Upto August 17, 30 Covid-19 related deaths have taken place at hospital in Ghaziabad while 33 took place in Meerut besides two each at hospitals in Delhi and Noida. “We have also stopped referrals to Meerut besides strict monitoring of patients in home isolation is being done. With constant monitoring, there has been no fatality of any patient in home isolation,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a recent interaction over video-conferencing with the chief ministers of 10 states, including UP, on August 11, had encouraged them to take CFR to below 1%. “It is good that the CFR is on decline. However, the efforts to contain cases should continue. Rapid antigen kits have made a lot of difference for early detection of cases and it must continue. Otherwise, the RT-PCR test reports take 2-3 days to arrive and suspected cases continue to be under risk. While attending different seminars it has come out that the effect is on decline. But monitoring should continue as many facets of Sars-CoV-2 are still unknown,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad. According to the official figures till August 16, the district completed testing of 153992 samples, which include 86688 through the rapid antigen kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/case-fatality-rate-in-ghaziabad-falls-below-1/story-XoI3orgZbnAOejD1I7W5rM.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||High court tells Delhi University to hold physical exams from Sept 14, varsity says huge task||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed Delhi University (DU) to conduct examinations for final-year students in the pen and paper mode from September 14 even as the varsity said “it was too short a time frame and there was immense pressure on the available manpower due to the ongoing open book examinations (OBE)”. The move comes days after the Union home ministry, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court, said colleges could reopen to conduct final-year examinations.The university had proposed to hold physical examinations for students who could not take the online exams, and those who want to better their performance in OBE, from September 20. But a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said the timeline was “quite unreasonable” and asked DU to advance the date.The court noted that the university had earlier said it would be able to gauge the number of leftover students who would write the physical exams only after it measured those who participated in the online mode. “By now, the online examinations have been conducted for an entire week. There should be enough data for the university to analyse the number of students who intend to sit for the examination physically in September,” the court observed.The court said the “university should expedite conducting physical examinations so that the entire process can be over at the earliest”. It said even though at least two weeks are required after the online examinations are over on August 31, for the university to gear up, physical examinations should commence by September 8.When senior advocate Sachin Datta, appearing for DU, said it would be too short time to complete preparations, the bench changed the date to September 14. It asked DU’s counsel to file an affidavit and indicate the end date of the physical examination, after he expressed his inability to inform the end date immediately to the court.The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) is not happy with the court’s order. Abha Dev Habib, treasurer, DUTA and assistant professor, Miranda House, said, “This will mean those students who could not appear for OBE because of adverse circumstances will now have to take health risks and appear for exams physically. Blind students, those living in different parts of the country and facing issues of connectivity will have to travel to Delhi, expose themselves to the virus and spend Rs 40,000-50,000 on travel and rent to take exams. These physical exams will be monitored, while all such important parameters to ensure credibility were relaxed for OBE.”An official in the DU’s admission branch, who wished not to be named, said, “It’s going to be a huge task to conduct physical exams amid the pandemic. DU has students from across the country and it won’t be possible for many to travel to Delhi since public transport right now is not completely safe. Also, it will be very difficult for the university to complete the evaluation process for the online exams before September 14.”The court expressed anguish over DU in not providing details of grievances to the redressal committee reconstituted by the Delhi HC itself for fairness and transparency. The bench said if the varsity claims that there has been hardly any complaints, it is all the more necessary that the complaints received were satisfactorily addressed by the grievance officer (1st tier) and placed before the committee (2nd tier).The bench, while hearing a bunch of pleas by PwD students seeking various facilities for the open book exams, directed the University Grants Commission (UGC) to take steps to issue a fresh advisory to all central universities to defer their demand of seeking provisional certificates for admission to postgraduation courses.The court directed DU to verify the number of PWD category students who were let out of OBE, and those in the segment who wish to sit for the physical exam even though they may have taken the online mode, for working out modalities of a place of stay and transportation from their present residence to Delhi.The court was informed that the students had gone back to their home towns due to the lockdown and arrangements would have to be made to bring them back. The court directed Delhi University to create a separate e-mail ID, where students can e-mail their requests along with details of foreign universities where they have secured provisional admission so that a request letter can be addressed directly by the Delhi University to the institute concerned.The court sought to know from the varsity the date by which the results will be declared for all streams of final-year courses and posted the matter for further hearing on August 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/high-court-tells-delhi-university-to-hold-physical-exams-from-sept-14-varsity-says-huge-task/story-5ixZU6gwUmJ8rILrhzsPHL.html

17-08-2020||City||Shadow over monsoon session as 20UP assembly staffers test Covid +iv||LUCKNOW Twenty UP assembly staffers, including security personnel, tested Covid-19 positive on Monday, casting a shadow over the monsoon session of the state legislature that is commencing here from August 20.Assembly speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit confirmed that about 600 assembly and other government staffers were tested and 20 were found Covid positive.It is felt that the number of Covid positive people may increase further once members of the two houses and other staffers are tested for the virus in the coming days. “Yes, 20 persons, including security personnel of the assembly, have been found positive for Covid-19. Those who have tested positive include an officer of the under-secretary rank. We are waiting for the final test reports as about 300 staffers, who will be deployed to perform various works/assignments during the monsoon session, have been tested,” said a functionary of the assembly secretariat. A meeting of leaders of all political parties in legislative council was also held and a decision to test all MLCs and Vidhan Parishad staff for Covid-19 was taken.“We will test all members and the staff. Tests will begin on Tuesday and continue till August 20,” said Vidhan Parishad chairman Ramesh Yadav after presiding over the all-party meeting. On the question of whether the assembly will also get MLAs tested, speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit said: “We are informing all members about the places in the Vidhayak Nivas or a point close to them that will have facility for testing w.e.f. August 19. Testing facility will also be available in the Vidhan Bhawan complex.” Asked whether the test will be mandatory for members, Dikshit said: “We will arrange facility for Covid-19 tests for all members.”SENSE OF FEARMeanwhile, a sense of fear gripped a section of the assembly staff as testing began on the assembly secretariat premises on Monday. “We will come to know about our fate only after the test results. We are not afraid. But we are certainly anxious to know about the test results,” said a functionary. Although senior officers of the assembly secretariat refused to comment on the issue, a large number of positive cases has raised serious concerns about the health of those to be deployed for work during the brief monsoon session.On first day, the assembly will be adjourned after mourning the deaths of its sitting members -- cabinet ministers Kamal Rani Varun and Chetan Chauhan -- who died after being admitted to hospitals for treatment of Covid-19.The state government proposes to carry out legislative business in the remaining two days, tabling ordinances that have been promulgated after the last session and the bills to replace them. The Uttar Pradesh assembly has a sanctioned strength of 403 members. As seven seats are vacant, the effective strength of state assembly has come down to 396 members. When constituted in 2017, the assembly had nearly half of its members in less than 50-year age group.Amid serious concerns in the corridors of power about the prevailing pandemic, a considerable chunk of members, including ministers, have tested positive in the past few weeks.Besides ministers and ruling party’s members, leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary and other Samajwadi Party members have also undergone treatment for Covid-19. Adding to these concerns are the deaths of Kamla Rani Varun and Chetan Chauhan. PRECAUTIONS The assembly and council secretariats are taking all safety precautions. In both the houses the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ lobbies, along with viewers’ galleries, will be used to ensure a vacant seat between two members to follow social distancing during the session. The assembly has decided to have ultraviolet filters in the air-conditioning system. Automatic sanitiser dispensers have been installed at the entry gates. The security personnel have been given infrared thermometers to scan members who would be asked to mandatorily wear the ask in the house. A mask is likely to be gifted by the staff to members who reach the house without wearing a mask.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shadow-over-monsoon-session-as-20up-assembly-staffers-test-covid-iv/story-P1L6V9qa5BWgYdXqW1kJjO.html
17-08-2020||City||IITs should focus on finding solution to problems of rural India: Naidu||New Delhi: Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu , during a virtual address at the diamond jubilee celebrations of Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi on Monday, said IITs should pay attention to the problems of rural India and start major research programmes to boost the rural economy. Naidu also said higher education institutions should focus on finding solutions to problems faced by mankind. “With more than 50% of our population still dependent on agriculture, it is important for IITs to start major research programmes to boost the rural economy through the development of sustainable technologies...Indian institutions will be counted among the world’s best only when they start impacting societies around them by developing optimal and sustainable solutions to the problems faced by the nation,” he said.Calling for greater investment in research and development projects that focus on finding solutions to societal problems, he urged the private sector to collaborate with academia in identifying such projects and fund them liberally. “Higher education institutions should not work in silos, and should form a symbiotic relationship with the industry to develop cutting-edge technology. The industry experts in various areas should act as mentors in guiding researchers. This type of collaboration will help in fast-tracking projects and produce quicker results,” he added. Union human resource development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, who had also attended the online event, lauded IIT-D for its contribution in the nation’s fight against Covid-19. “From developing the world’s cheapest RT-PCR-based Covid-19 diagnostic kit to supplying over 40 lakh PPEs to India and the world, the institute’s researchers have done a remarkable job,” he said.Speaking on the occasion, IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao said the institute is now on its next phase of growth. “In the next phase, the target is to touch a billion lives through IIT-D technologies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iits-should-focus-on-finding-solution-to-problems-of-rural-india-naidu/story-7BITPynysWnRRguAgpsLoM.html

17-08-2020||Chandigarh||Concerns over Dalai Lama’s security after Chinese spy’s arrest in Delhi||The exiled Tibetan community residing here has expressed concern over the Dalai Lama’s security after a Chinese spy, who was allegedly snooping on the spiritual leader, was arrested in Delhi recently.Lau Sang or Charlie Peng, who is accused in a ₹1,000 crore hawala racket, allegedly bribed some Tibetan monks living in Majnu-Ka-Tila, a Tibetan settlement in Delhi, to gather information on the Dalai Lama and his close aides.Sang, who was holding a fake Indian passport, created a web of sham companies to launder hawala funds and paid ₹3 lakh each to some monks in Majnu-Ka-Tila to spy on the Dalai Lama.Deputy speaker of Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile Acharya Yeshi Phuntsok, on the sidelines of a press conference, said it was a concerning matter and the Government of India should stay alert.“Chinese come here for trade, but the real motive remains something else,” he said.Though he was caught, he must have sent some vital information not only about the Dalai Lama or the exiled government, but also about the Indian establishments to his handlers, added Phuntsok.He said it was not the first instance of China sending a spy to snoop on Dalai Lama.“Whenever we hold some programme in Delhi or other places, they come under the garb of media personnel. We can’t prevent their entry as they are given visa by the Indian government,” said Phuntsok.He said the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), its security department and state agencies looking after the Dalai Lama’s security details were fully alert.Reportedly, a man of Tibetan origin was arrested in Dharamshala in 2013 for spying for China. Later, it was revealed that he was working as a double agent and was on the rolls of Indian intelligence agencies.SHANTA BATS FOR RAMPING UP SECURITYMeanwhile, veteran BJP leader and former chief minister Shanta Kumar has expressed deep concern over the matter and demanded that the centre and state governments ramp up Dalai Lama’s security.“It is quite disturbing that a Chinese agent was residing in India for such a long time carrying out hawala transactions and snooping on the Tibetan spiritual leader,” Shanta said in a statement issued here. He suggested chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to meet officials in Delhi and seek a thorough probe into the racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/concerns-over-dalai-lama-s-security-after-chinese-spy-s-arrest-in-delhi/story-fRTAdsyi0tLBZJbR1mVrNM.html

The DRI has also seized foreign currencies worth ₹45 lakh. Three people have been arrested in the case.The racket was manufacturing drugs in Hyderabad and was sending it to Mumbai via a private bus. A laboratory set up in a residential unit in Mumbai and a chemical factory in Hyderabad were raided by DRI, leading to the huge recovery of drugs. DRI officers received specific information about the arrival of drugs on August 15 in Mumbai from another state. Following this, a consignment was intercepted as soon as it arrived in Mumbai from Hyderabad. The consignment, which contained mephedrone, was concealed in a private passenger bus and had no person accompanying it. DRI officers, however, succeeded in locating the recipients of the consignment in Mumbai and their premises were raided. The raids resulted in the seizure of mephedrone and ketamine.“We have also seized some samples of other psychotropic substances that indicate sophisticated distribution network both within the country and abroad,” a DRI officer said.In a three-day intensive operation, DRI officers raided multiple premises and in Mumbai and Hyderabad and seized a total of over 250 kg of different drugs (mephedrone – 210 kg, ketamine – 10kg and ephedrine – 31kg) worth nearly ₹47 crore in the grey market.

From this lab and factory, a huge quantity of various chemical raw material was recovered. The chemicals were supposed to be used for further manufacturing of the drugs, DRI officers stated.“The mephedrone was manufactured in Hyderabad and sent via bus to Mumbai, while the ephedrine was intended for supply to another major city. The syndicate had a well-established chain of supply both within and outside the country. The payment for the raw material and finished products took place through hawala channels,” DRI officer said.Three people have been arrested. One of the accused has a criminal past and was arrested by DRI in 2017 in a drug trafficking case.Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant drug popular among the urban college-going crowd. It is also known as MD or meow meow, etc. and is known for its effects similar to that of MDMA, amphetamines and cocaine.Ketamine, popularly used as a party and date rape drug.

17-08-2020||Mumbai||Degree admission third list: Cut-offs high; one more list on Aug 25||The University of Mumbai (MU) released its third merit list for admissions to degree courses on Monday evening, with only a handful of names in the lists of popular courses in coveted colleges and no seats in arts section in some colleges. Looking at a large number of seats that remain vacant after three merit lists in a majority of its affiliated colleges, MU has asked institutes to release a fourth merit list at 11am on August 25. The third merit list for the Bachelors in Arts (BA) course at Jai Hind College had names of 82 students, all who scored between 93.83% and 93%,. The second merit list for the same course had ended at 94%. “The difference in cut-offs between the second and the third merit list is very miniscule because we had only a handful of seats vacant in popular courses. We witnessed very few admission withdrawals,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of the institute. St Xavier’s College at Dhobi Talao had no third merit list for the BA course. “Withdrawal of admissions is otherwise a very common trend because students who have opted for numerous colleges end up finding a seat in a course and college of their choice with every consequent list, but this year, surprisingly, only a handful of students have opted out of courses,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, Churchgate. Compared to the second merit list, the cut-offs at the sought-after colleges didn’t drop by more than a couple of percentage points. The only exception was BSc, which witnessed a steeper drop in cut-offs at most of the colleges. Most unaided courses, especially Bachelors in Mass Media (BMM) and Bachelors in Management Studies (BMS), Bachelors in Accounting & Finance (BAF), etc remained in demand and their cut-offs at most top colleges remained on the higher side. Wilson College in Worli was one of the colleges that witnessed a seven percentage point rise in their BA cut-off in the first merit list this year compared to last year, and their third merit list for BA and BMM still remained on the higher side. “I believe most withdrawal of admissions will take place in BSc course, once admissions to professional courses (medical and engineering) commence,” said a spokesperson for the college. Students whose names appeared on the third merit list have time till August 21 to finish the process of confirmation of admission. MU is also keeping the pre-admission registrations link open between August 18 and 21, for students who are yet to finish the process in order to be eligible for the fourth merit list. After August 28, the colleges will have to release a list of vacant seats across courses, if any, and students will then have the choice to opt for these seats by approaching each college individually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/degree-admission-third-list-cut-offs-high-one-more-list-on-aug-25/story-5Cr2aXQIn0eBtq6Ptum6AO.html

They should levy the charge only if they have a government order. When I asked for the copy of the order, they didn’t have it,” one of the parents said. The protesters were seen arguing with police personnel and members of the school management. Amita Sachdeva, principal of the school, could not be reached for comments despite several attempts. District education officer (deputy) Sudhir Kumar Kalra, said, “The education department has not received a written complaint against the school. I found out after the protests that the school is levying annual charges after a high court ruling, but private schools should first wait for a letter/order from the director of the education department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-protest-outside-pvt-school-in-ambala-over-levying-of-annual-charges/story-LbBOHuSYl2N6ICRxEUawnL.html

17-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Railway engineers develop battery-operated rail engine||With the aim to reduce expenditure on fuel, engineers of Ludhiana railway station have developed a battery-operated rail engine. This will be used mainly during shunting to move the train rack from one place to another. The engine’s maximum speed is 15 km per hour, which is ideal for shunting. However, the engineers are working to increase speed and power. The engine can work on both tracks –overhead transmission and normal tracks. Mohan Swaroop, senior divisional electrical engineer, Electric Loco Shed, said the WM-4 engine, which has been developed into a battery-operated engine, was produced in 1974 and brought to Ludhiana in 2001. The engine was in use till 2009 and then sent to the electric shed. It was used till 2015 for shunting, but it was not used on track without overhead transmission and hasn’t been used for the last five years, Swaroop added.“We have fitted 48 bolts and 800 ampere battery sets and installed an in-built charger. When it will work on overhead transmission tracks, the batteries will get fully charged automatically in 40 minutes,” the senior divisional electrical engineer said.“It will minimise cost with almost no pollution. It will also helpful reduce response time and lower chances of mishaps,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-railway-engineers-develop-battery-operated-rail-engine/story-z77o59dEnQES2fdnIV0fzN.html

This is the third locust invasion this year. Earlier, swarms of locusts had entered the district twice from Rajasthan via Pakistan’s Sindh province. This time, the infestation is by locusts that emerged from breeding during the previous invasions. Raj Karan, a farmer from Kalali village, said he has lost cotton crop on seven acres this time. “We had suffered losses earlier as well. But this time, the attack is by locally bred locusts. Agricultural officials had failed to kill the entire swarm last time, which is why the new ones have emerged,” he added. Karan further said that the infant locusts have more capacity to cause damage. Rishal Singh, another farmer from Adampur village, said, “The government and the district administration had claimed to have tackled the situation. But if that was true, then where have the new insects come from. We have lost our bajra, cotton and guar crops. Over 70 acres have been damaged in our village. The government should initiate a special girdawari and compensate the farmers whose crops have been damaged,” he added. The farmer further said the government was relying on old techniques such as beating of drums and vessels to scare away the locusts. They should have provided choppers and drones for spraying pesticides and chemicals at affected areas, he said. Dadri deputy director (agriculture) Zile Singh Yadav said, “We have started an operation to kill the locusts with the help of farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infant-locusts-damage-crops-in-2-dadri-villages/story-XrcQOZVAjqLQz6jK5W6LgP.html

17-08-2020||Chandigarh||BJP-JJP govt did not defend jobs of 1,983 PTIs, says Deepinder||Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda on Monday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party government of not defending the jobs of 1,983 physical training instructors (PTIs) in Haryana due to political reasons. Addressing a press conference, the MP said the jobs of PTIs could have been saved had the government put forward the facts of the case. “The PTIs’ selections were set aside merely on technical grounds. The apex court never put any question mark on the merit or qualification of the 1,983 PTIs,” said Deepender.The selections were made by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) in 2010 during the Congress rule. A single bench of the high court had on September 11, 2012 set aside the selections on account of the changes made in the selection process. The decision was upheld by a HC division bench and later by the Supreme Court on April 8, 2020.An apex court bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice Navin Sinha had said that HSSCs decision of June 30, 2008, to cancel the written examination, the July 11, 2008 decision to call eight times more candidates than the number of vacancies for interviews and the decision of July 31, 2008 to call all the eligible candidates for interviews were arbitrary. The decisions were taken without any reason to change the selection criterion published in 2006 which have the effect of downgrading the merit in the selection, the court said.Deepender’s father and former chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda had last week said that the Congress legislature party will bring a private member’s bill during the upcoming assembly session to facilitate the reinstatement of the 1,983 PTIs.Deepinder said the BJP-JJP government is also in the process of removing 1, 518 employees appointed to Group D posts from sports quota.“This government is doing layoffs for Ayush doctors, tourism corporation employees, assistant professors, temporary sanitation workers and computer operators from universities and colleges,” he alleged. He said the BJP government has consistently taken decisions that have harmed the farmers. “Three new ordinances introduced by the central government is an indicative of this mindset. Such serious policy decisions have been taken without the consent of the Parliament. The government wants to promote capitalists by demolishing the government buying mechanism which had been set up to protect the interests of the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-jjp-govt-did-not-defend-jobs-of-1-983-ptis-deepinder/story-pazoLOqGBzblix0MjxijmI.html

Later, Khattar remarked that people should refrain from using the name of martyrs for furthering their own political interests.On the decision to shift the statue, the CM said, “Earlier the statue was installed at a small place and not many noticed it. But now, the statue has been installed at a place where thousands of people come everyday and gain inspiration by seeing the statute.”He also said that a martyr’s memorial will be built at the Madan Lal Dhingra Park.Plasma bank inauguratedThe CM also inaugurated a plasma bank at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College, Karnal, and urged Covid-19 survivors to come forward and donate plasma.

On June 13, the state government appointed Gopal Sharma as director (commercial) and DIS Grewal as director (distribution). Sharma was shortlisted for both the posts. The two posts were filled but the post of director (generation) was kept in abeyance despite the fact that there were many eligible contenders for it as none found favour with the selection panel. The hiring is likely to take place in November as the government want to adjust a serving engineer. “The generation is a full-fledged wing of the corporation. There are issues related to the PSPCL-owned coal mines in Pachhwara, Jharkhand besides day-to-day matters of the three privately owned thermal plants in Punjab. Moreover, we are in the middle of the paddy season which needs proper power management,” said an official. The incumbent is appointed for a term of two years which is extendable up to the age of 65. As per the rules, anyone who has worked in the power sector for 25 years and has attained level of a chief engineer in the generation wing for one year besides having worked as superintendent engineer for three years can become director (generation). PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A. Venu Prasad said the process for recruitment will begin soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-of-pspcl-director-generation-lying-vacant-since-may/story-a6UWWee8C5uh9ZdCAAyUCI.html

Tourism industry stakeholders now want the government to relax the rules to give a fillip to the hospitality sector that is struggling for survival. In a letter to state urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, Tourism Sector Stakeholders’ Association president MK Seth said, “Most hotels in Himachal Pradesh remain closed and the ones that are open are seeing poor occupancy. Other tourist states such as Rajasthan, Kerala and Goa don’t have such strict restrictions and that’s helping tourism pick up pace there.” He said that tourists with valid documents are being turned back from Shoghi at the Shimla district border even after being allowed entry into the state from the Parwanoo barrier. “It is unfair that after hours of journey, tourists are kept waiting at district borders for re-checking. In several cases, they are even sent back,” he said. Tourists with Covid-negative reports, who apply for e-registration, have not got approval within 72 hours, he said, adding visitors are hesitant to visit Himachal Pradesh because of the mandatory Covid-negative report for the entire family. He said that restrictions in Himachal are the most stringent in the country and this was not only causing revenue loss to the government but also resulting in job losses and near collapse of the hospitality industry. ‘SIMPLIFY ENTRY RULES’ The association suggested that checking of tourists’ documents should be done at inter-state barriers only and those coming to the state for less than 72 hours should be exempted from the Covid-negative report requirement. The e-registration system should be simplified and approval from the district magistrate should be done away with, it said. The tourists should be asked to fill the information needed online and the booking of hotel units should also be done virtually. The rider of minimum five-day stay should be removed and the Covid-negative certificate requirement should be only for those who intend to visit Himachal Pradesh for more than 72 hours. The validity of the Covid-negative test should be extended to 96 hours and the report should not be mandatory for children below 12 years, Seth said. The association also wants food outlets, bars, and restaurants to be allowed to remain open after 8pm as night curfew has been lifted. Hoteliers want clarity in the standard operating procedure (SOP) if a guest tests positive. Association secretary Divij Sood said that the government must clarify if the entire unit or floor or only the room where the patient stays will be sealed and for what duration. “It is not practical to seal the entire unit as the hotel may be fully occupied and vacating the premises may cause harassment to guests. Instead, only the particular room should be sealed for 48 hours and sanitised,” Sood said. WHAT TOURISM INDUSTRY WANTS Checking be done at state border only Tourists coming to the state for less than 72 hours and children be exempted from Covid-19 negative report; validity of the report be extended to 96 hours Simplification of the e-registration system; approval of DM must be done away with In case of a Covid positive case in a hotel, only the particular room be sealed  Interest subvention and financing schemes be implemented through state-owned banks EASE INTEREST SUBVENTION SCHEME The association said that the interest subvention scheme launched by the state government was welcome but it had failed to provide relief to hoteliers as banks were not entertaining their proposals. Sood said that if hoteliers approach cooperative banks to avail benefit of the scheme, they are told to get an no-objection certificate (NOC) from banks from where the unit is financed. “The financing bank refuses to issue the NOC, saying there’s no provision to create a second charge on a property,” he said. Sood said that the association suggests implementing the scheme through state-owned banks and the condition of NOC be removed. “The working capital loans up to Rs 15 lakh should be given collateral free on the basis of an affidavit submitted by the borrower to repay the loan in time. Small registered tourism units should be given loan without the requirement of details of GST deposited. Loan to small units should only be provided on the basis of the number of rooms registered with the tourism department,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-s-tourism-industry-wants-covid-curbs-eased-to-revive-economy/story-5AaaGA5cUQs3qzsrCqMh7L.html

17-08-2020||Pune||Unable to build retaining wall, PMC issues notice to Gururaj society members to vacate flats||At least 500 residents of the Gururaj co-operative housing society in Dhankawadi are facing an eviction from their homes after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s building permission department issued a notice to the society warning them about the threat of impending floods.According to PMC, the possible flooding might endanger the lives of the residents since the retaining wall of the society was washed away during last year’s flash floods. The notice was served and signed by deputy engineer of building permission department (Zone 5) which clearly asked them to vacate the premises within 24 hours. The notice also states that the society building has become old and it was dangerous for the residents to stay there during the monsoon season. “The compound wall was not constructed by the society and so, we issued them a notice. It was a private compound wall which was washed away in the floods and it is the society’s responsibility to construct it in the larger interest of citizens’ safety. Tomorrow, if any mishap takes place, then the society is responsible for it and we have given the evacuation notice for the same,” said Harshada Shinde, executive engineer (Zone 5) of PMC. Gururaj society management committee member Devika Thorat said, “The PMC has waived off its responsibility of constructing the retaining wall for the society. The society’s fencing wall fell down because of the riverbed encroachment. The water entered our society last year and we sustained huge losses. We did a structural audit and none of the buildings are a threat. This notice has been issued only to put the blame on the society. The notice says that our building has become old without any PMC official visiting our building. How has the PMC decided that our building is old and is a threat to the lives of residents.” Dipak Ghadge, a resident of the society, said, “The notice has been issued to the society management asking vacation of the premises within 24 hours. Where are we going to go during the Covid-19 crisis period where even relatives will not be inclined to accept us? It is the time to remain quarantined where we are and not move to some other place. The PMC building permission department was supposed to construct the fencing wall which it has not done since the last one year. Now, it is a very convenient method to issue notice and wash their hands off the responsibility. Tomorrow in case the area is flooded, then the PMC will show the notice and say that we had warned the citizens in advance,” he said. Ashwini Kadam, a local corporator, said, “The PMC did not construct the fencing wall and it’s estimated cost is over Rs 1.5 crore. It is an old society and people belong to the middle class segment of the society. The threat to the society is more from PMC because of its inaction in protecting the lives of the citizens. The PMC must immediately withdraw the illegal notice issued to the society which has been solely done to put the onus on the society when the PMC itself is responsible for the delayed construction of the fencing wall,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unable-to-build-retaining-wall-pmc-issues-notice-to-gururaj-society-members-to-vacate-flats/story-e8cLWKGD1z57ojsp2axjQM.html
17-08-2020||Pune||Virus after-effects: Sporadic cases of lungs fibrosis reported among patients in Pune||As the number of Covid-19 positive cases surge in the city- sporadic cases of lung fibrosis among those who have recovered from the infection, are now being reported. Such cases were reported earlier in Mumbai’s KEM when 22 such patients had complained about breathlessness and fatigue. City hospitals are now preparing their staff and informing them about such possible instances when a recovered person might land up at the hospital complaining about similar symptoms.As of Sunday of the 1,30,606 progressive positive cases, 86,393 have recovered in Pune district, according to the state health department.Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri hospital, said, “We have had two instances where a Covid-19 patient who recovered from the virus complained of fatigue and breathlessness on exertion and upon further examination, we diagnosed fibrosis of the lung and reduced lung functions through CT and pulmonary functions.”“We have not received any more cases after that, but we are expecting that more such cases might come up with time,” he said.Dr Satyajit S Gill, medical director, Jehangir Hospital, said, “We have had a couple of patients who complained of difficulty in breathing and they had recovered from Covid-19. I cannot cite an exact number for now, but we have had such cases coming up.”“Usually when we get X-rays, it shows some lung changes, normally the lungs look dark because it has air, but in case of these patients, it looks white because it has some changes in the lung tissue. Since they have recently recovered they are likely to have the antibodies and their swab is negative and they have no fever or any symptoms except breathlessness. So even though they are cured of the virus, the impact continues to stay evidently,” he said. Dr Sanjay Gaikwad, pulmonologist, Sassoon General Hospital, said, “We have had a few patients who need oxygen even at the time of discharge because of lung fibrosis. There is a need for prolongation of oxygen supplementation even after the patient is cured of the virus.”“Till now we have not had any such cases, but it has been predicted now that few of them may come back and so we have arrangements in place to attend to such cases in the future,” he said.Dr HK Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital, said, “We have not had any such case as of now, but we are aware that such a case can be reported. In case of other lung infections, we know the sequence, but since this is a new virus, there is a lot we do not know yet.” What is lung fibrosis?Lung fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease when the tissues of the lungs are damaged and scarred. This thickened stiff tissue makes it difficult for the lungs to function properly and for the person to breathe leading to fatigue and difficulty in breathing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/virus-after-effects-sporadic-cases-of-lungs-fibrosis-reported-among-patients-in-pune/story-EJrZ6xCXLozrl3iG4OHlEN.html
17-08-2020||Pune||Rajesh Deshmukh is appointed as Pune district collector||The state government on Monday appointed Dr Rajesh Deshmukh as the new district collector of Pune, according to an order issued by Sitaram Kunte, additional chief secretary. Deshmukh, a 2008 batch Indian Administrative officer, comes as Pune district collector from Haffkine institute in Mumbai where he is currently managing director. In his order, Kunte asked Deshmukh to take charge as Pune district collector on immediate basis. Kunal Khmenar, another IAS officer, will replace Deshmukh at Haffkine. The new district collector is likely to take charge by Tuesday in Pune, which is one of the worst affected district due to Covid pandemic. On Sunday, Pune crossed Mumbai to become the district with highest number of total Covid positive cases in the state. Pune’s tally as on Sunday was 130606 while Mumbai reported total 128726 cases. “Currently I have two responsibilities here including Haffkine institute and Haffkine bio pharmaceutical. I am hoping to join as collector by Tuesday once I handover these responsibilities,” said Deshmukh over phone from Mumbai. On the Covid front in Pune, Deshmukh isn’t oblivious to the situation. “I have been monitoring the situation in Pune since the beginning. As Managing Director at Haffkine, I am involved in so many Covid related activities including setting up testing centres.” Deshmukh was instrumental in setting up two labs in March when state government together had only six laboratories across Maharashtra. He was also associated with procurement and assembling of equipments for various medical colleges. On controlling Pune’s covid spread, Deshmukh said, “The golden rule to control this pandemic is trace, track and test,” indicating that the administration has to trace more contacts, track them and finally carry out their tests. “Early intervention is the best strategy to tackle this crisis,’ he said. Deshmukh was previously the district collector at Yavatmal where he was credited with reducing the number of farmers suicide. He was also chief executive officer at Satara Zilla Parishad. Deshmukh’s order came two weeks after Naval Kishore Ram was transferred in Prime Minister’s Office as deputy secretary. Following Ram’s transfer, Pune Zilla Parishad Chief Executive Officer Ayush Prasad was given additional charge as collector. The main reason for delay in appointment of new collector, according sources, was because names considered by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar were not approved by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. However the appointment of Deshmukh indicates that Pawar finally convinced chief minister of his choice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rajesh-deshmukh-is-appointed-as-pune-district-collector/story-XgieCQDltVKAwHMSQYvYhI.html

Both of them were present at the district-level Independence Day function, where state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal was the chief guest on Saturday.The finance minister has announced that he will be in home quarantine as a precautionary measure after the SSP tested positive. In an official statement issued on Monday afternoon, deputy commissioner B Srinivasan also said that he is following the quarantine protocol and isolating himself as he was sitting near the SSP during the Independence Day function. The deputy commissioner has appealed to all those who met the SSP in the past few days to get themselves tested for Covid-19. Jattana chaired a function at Talwani Sabo on Sunday where a youngster was felicitated for ranking in the first 200 in the Union Public Service Commission’s civil service entrance exam, the result for which was declared recently.

17-08-2020||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: There’s no freedom from coronavirus... or humidity||It was a trifle disconcerting to see social distancing rules go for a toss during Independence Day celebrations at the Parade Ground in Panchkula’s Sector 6, where a small crowd was in attendance for the low key affair. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, too, quite forgot about covering his face and took off his mask briefly while speaking to mediapersons as he left the venue. Worse, even though the home affairs ministry guidelines had barred children from joining celebrations, school students were present, singing the National Anthem and playing the band. Though Independence Day is about India’s freedom from the British Raj, many people are starting to forget that we are not free from grasp the deadly coronavirus – as yet.Too warm for comfortThe heat and the humidity at Panchkula’s Parade Ground got a bit too much for some police personnel during Independence day celebrations – some of them were seen being taken off the ground on stretchers after they fainted. “They are standing here since 6 am. The temperature and humidity levels are very high. And to add to this, they have been wearing masks, so it just got a bit too much. They are also human,” said a senior police office on duty at the ground. We understand and hope our vardi wallahs are well now and back in action.Touch and goThe entire UT secretariat is in a tizzy after staff of the UT adviser’s office tested positive. “Important files of the departments go through the hands of the UT adviser’s staff. Even though two of them had taken leave after they complained of sore throat and fever late this week, but, earlier many office documents passed through their hands before being circulated in different departments. Now, more departments need to get their personnel tested,” said a UT employee requesting anonymity. Someone should have thought about sanitising all the documents and files first, what say?Update the Mohali MC website pleaseEven though it’s been four months now since the five-year term of the municipal councillors ended, the Mohali municipal corporation’s website, www.mc mohali.punjab.gov.in, is still displaying a message by former mayor Kulwant Singh, which reads: In pursuance of the policies, I will strive to work hard to provide you transparency in functioning of the Municipal Corporation and improve the civic amenities of the city. While all the former councillors are gearing up for new MC elections scheduled for October this year, someone had better update the website before the new lot comes in and everyone else has a tough time guessing who the new mayor is and who is not. First start, then stopThere was much confusion in Panjab University (PU) on August 3 when online classes for UG batches were started as, on the same day, the varsity’s registrar issued an order stating that classes would remain suspended till August 31 in the University and its affiliated colleges. While many wondered aloud how PU could start classes and suspend it on the same day. Things were cleared soon enough, however, because the DUI quickly issued a notice withdrawing the registrar’s order, saying teaching would continue as scheduled, much to the relief of students eager to complete their studies. Policing the cows in PanchkulaLife’s tough for traffic police in Panchkula, with the poor men managing not just traffic, but also stray cattle ambling into areas under their jurisdiction. Those driving towards Nada Sahib often see a police Gypsy parked on the highway with some men in khaki trying desperately to chase away the cows – some even sitting right in the middle of the busy road (the cows, that is!). “There’s a chance of accidents, so it has become a routine affair to chase away the animals,” a policeman explained. Nope, some creatures are not afraid of the vardi!Entry fees? What entry fees?The Chandigarh municipal corporation’s recent proposal to charge an entrance fees for parks has roused the citizens’ ire. They feel they are being robbed of their rights to enjoy some green and open spaces. “When Corbusier designed the lake and the parks of the city did he want to charge people for entry? What will they do next? Charge us for breathing the city’s air?” asked an incensed FOSWAC chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu. In these pandemic times, everything comes at a premium, doesn’t it?Be polite: PGI director’s appeal to staffIt’s not easy being Covid Warriors, facing the threat of infections while going about treating patients, but even then, the staff of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research are always expected to be on their best behaviour. So, during Independence Day celebrations at the institute, director Prof Jagat Ram, in his speech, requested all the employees to be disciplined. “Be empathetic and polite with the patients and work wholeheartedly for the Institute,” he was heard saying.

17-08-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana turns Punjab’s Covid capital as cases, deaths explode||The coronavirus cases and the deaths attributed to the disease have exploded in Punjab’s industrial and financial hub of Ludhiana to the extent that it has virtually turned into the state’s Covid-19 capital. Such is the situation that the district tops the state’s tally of case count at 6,500 as well that of fatalities at 226 till Saturday. What makes the situation even more alarming is that fact that Ludhiana also has the highest number of active cases (2,028). A look at the figures reveals that the neighbouring district of Jalandhar ranks a distant second with 3,773 confirmed cases, including 1,270 active cases and 96 deaths, followed by Patiala (3,577 cases), Mohali (1,732 cases) and Sangrur (1,490 cases). Ludhiana accounts for 22% of all cases and 29.4% of deaths reported in Punjab due to the coronavirus. Moreover, given that it is Punjab’s most populated (35 lakh) city and witnesses a massive interstate movement of people due to bustling commercial activities, Ludhiana continues to remain more vulnerable to the spread of virus more than any other urban pocket. It is hardly surprising that the city alone has 19 micro-containment zones. The overall scenario appears to be bleak at the best. Consider this: The district’s case count per 1 lakh population is 258.5, far higher than the state’s figure of 104.5. Of the 6,438 cases reported till August 13, as many as 1,718 were reported in the preceding seven days alone, pointing towards a steep rise. In contrast, Patiala and Jalandhar reported 994 and 820 cases in seven days from August 7 to 13. Cases in Ludhiana have nearly doubled from 3,439 in July-end to 6,560 till August 15. Of a total of 793 coronavirus patients admitted to Ludhiana hospitals, 143 are at level stage III (critical care), also the highest for any district in the state. The one reassuring aspect is that the district has conducted the maximum number of coronavirus tests in the state with the number of collected samples exceeding 90,000. Equally reassuring is the fact that it also so far has the highest number of recoveries at 4,304. DEATHS DOUBLE FROM JULY-END TO AUG 15 Figures also reveal that 95% of the 226 deaths in Ludhiana were reported the lockdown was relaxed in early June when businesses started reopening and people began venturing out of their homes. This was besides the return of a section of migrant workers to the district. The deaths rose twofold from 88 in July-end to 226 on August 15. Till the lockdown was lifted on June 8, the district had recorded only 11 deaths. The district’s testing number (90,966) is ahead of Amritsar (62, 410), Jalandhar (58,285), Patiala (54,503) and Gurdaspur (48,464). It has tested 1.5 times more than Jalandhar which has the second highest number of cases. Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, who was Ludhiana deputy commissioner till mid-June, said, “Unlike Jalandhar and Amritsar where people are cautious of visiting the civil hospital to get their test done, more people volunteered to be tested in Ludhiana even if they exhibited mild symptoms. More testing facilities in Ludhiana is another reason for a large number of samples being tested.” HOME TO MAJOR CHUNK OF INTERSTATE TRAVELLERS Of the 2,456 travellers having tested positive for the disease in Punjab, a major chunk is from Ludhiana, a hub of cycle, cycle parts, hosiery and sewing machine industry. A large number of people from the district travel to other states for business deals on a regular basis. As per official figures, 3.47 lakh people entered the state ever since the curfew was relaxed in Punjab. Of these, samples of 1. 51 lakh (43%) were collected. Rahul Ahuja, chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), says labourers in a large number have started returning to Ludhiana to resume work. “It is but natural for the city with the largest population to have the highest number of cases in the state,” he said. COPS, MC OFFICIALS WORST-AFFECTED As many as 260 police personnel and 20 civic body employees have tested positive for the disease. At least 160 cops are still getting treatment. Besides the death of an additional commissioner of police (ACP) due to the cononavirus in April, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) also succumbed to the infection last week. The infected civic body employees also included the personal assistant of the MC commissioner. INADEQUATE HEATH INFRASTRUCTURE Government hospitals in Punjab’s most populated city have no ventilators or intensive care units (ICUs) as they are completely dependent on private facilities for treatment of patients with severe symptoms. There are just 43 ventilators in private hospitals in Ludhiana. At least 17 patients are currently on ventilator support. While the cases are rising in the district, the health infrastructure has proved to far from adequate. Compared to 450 isolation wards in government hospitals in the district, the private hospitals have 787 such facilities of which 628 (80%) are occupied. Interestingly, only 159 of a total of 450 beds in government hospitals for Covid patients in Ludhiana are occupied. This is because nearly 1,000 of those having tested positive are being treated at home. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, a senior Akali Dal leader from Ludhiana, said, “The same level of rigour (for those found infected) cannot be observed at home. The government doesn’t have enough beds and they are left with no other option but to send a majority of positive patients home. This further increases the risk of spreading the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-turns-punjab-s-covid-capital-as-cases-deaths-explode/story-OSZA1o9zTspK4b5ZTinRtJ.html

17-08-2020||Chandigarh||Kotkapura violence case: SIT declares Sikh preachers innocent||The special investigation team (SIT) headed by inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh has declared Sikh preachers Bhai Panthpreet Singh, Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, Amrik Singh Ajnala, Harjinder Singh Manjhi, Giani Kewal Singh and 18 others as ‘innocent’ in the Kotkapura violence case registered in 2015.The SIT has removed their names as accused from the case.The development came with the SIT’s move of filing a chargesheet against then Kotkapura DSP Baljit Singh Sidhu and SHO Gurdeep Singh Pandher on Friday.As per the case, the Sikh preachers — Bhai Panthpreet Singh, Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, Amrik Singh Ajnala, Harjinder Singh Manji and others — were leading the protest against the then Shiromani Akali Dal government over the Bargari sacrilege incident, demanding the arrest of the accused.The police on October 14, 2015 registered an FIR against 15 Sikh preachers and unknown persons at Kotkapura city police station for allegedly instigating the protesters to attack the police with sharp edge weapons and opening fire on cops.The case was registered under sections of 307 (attempt to murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections of the IPC, Arms Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, on the complaint of then Kotkapura SHO Gurdeep Singh.Following the incident, Bhai Panthpreet Singh, Mander Singh, Rachhpal Singh, Balpreeet Singh and five others were arrested by the police in the case.The Faridkot court released the Sikh preachers on October 16, 2015. The SIT also recorded their statements in the case. The probe found that the preachers and others were protesting peacefully over the sacrilege incident.The SIT claimed that then DSP Baljeet Singh Sidhu and SHO Gurdeep have framed many innocent persons in the violence case. It said Pandher and Sidhu made an attempt to destroy 11 pieces of evidence, manipulated and fabricated crucial facts of the case. The SIT claimed that they were part of a conspiracy to create a self-defence theory to justify the police stand that protestors had attacked the police in Kotkapura.Pandher, who is presently under judicial custody, was arrested by the SIT on June 25. Later Sidhu was also named an accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kotkapura-violence-case-sit-declares-sikh-preachers-innocent/story-JUaJheU6WJGjgT1OeI8UdO.html

17-08-2020||Mumbai||Chandrapur human-tiger conflict: Trained Karnataka elephants to join Maharashtra tiger trail in 3 months||Come November, Maharashtra will have a unit of six elephants to tackle the human-tiger conflict at Chandrapur. Three trained elephants from Karnataka will be brought to Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) buffer area. These elephants will join the three other elephants at the reserve area to curb conflicts across wildlife habitats interspersed with villages. The decision was presented before the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL) during its August 7 meeting. Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said, “All formalities to bring the three tuskers from Mathidogu and Dubare elephant camps in Karnataka have been completed. The three elephants already at the TATR buffer help in patrolling and are being trained for tracking tiger movement.” Forest officials said Bhim, one of the three trained elephants from Karnataka to make their way to Maharashtra to tackle conflict, was originally from Sindhudurg district. “The elephant, along with a herd of two other elephants, was captured in March 2015 after being involved in several instances of crop damage. The elephant was relocated to Dubare camp in Karnataka, where he was trained specifically in tracking tigers and patrolling forests. Bhim will now return back to Maharashtra as per the agreement with the Karnataka forest department,” said Kakodkar. While tracking tigers, elephants can help the forest department navigate through difficult terrain (dense forest patches that are not easily accessible through foot patrolling or vehicles) and unfavourable weather, in addition to providing an elevated view of the landscape, allowing easy and safe tranquilisation of animals, and surround tigers easily once located. “We are already in the process of recruiting mahouts (elephant riders). However, forests in Maharashtra are dry and deciduous, and elephants need a lot of fodder. In summers, it becomes difficult to feed them. As they are also let out in the evening, there’s a possible damage to the bamboos in the Tadoba buffer,” said Kakodkar. The forest patches of Chandrapur district, which are home to 175 of the 312 tigers, account for 56% of the estimated tiger numbers in the state, resulting in this landscape witnessing the maximum human-animal conflict in India. Of the 27 human deaths owing to tiger attacks in Maharashtra between January and August, 23 were from Chandrapur. So far, four tigers – including three from Chandrapur – involved in the conflict, have been captured. Training elephants to address conflict was proposed over a decade ago. However, the proposal was stalled after a mahout was attacked and killed by a trained elephant at the TATR buffer last year. In another case, the same elephant killed a woman in Yavatmal district in October 2018 as well as a man in the adjoining Wardha district. “We are exploring the possibility of recruiting experienced fodder cutters (assistants to mahouts) as mahouts since they are traditionally equipped to train the elephants better. Unfortunately, any class 4 recruitment for the forest department needs a Class 10 certificate. We requested the state to waive off this educational qualification requirement for the fodder cutters,” said Kakodkar. SBWL members explained that elephants are used for collecting and transporting wood at Melghat and Gadchiroli district. “A few years ago, elephants were brought from Gadchiroli for tourism purposes (safari) in spite of our opposition. However, using elephants to tackle conflict is welcome. Gadchiroli and Melghat elephants can be trained for tackling conflict. Also, tranquilising tigers using elephants and restricting the movement of the wild cats is a much easier and safer option,” said Kishor Rithe, member, SBWL. In December 2018, the swift capture of slain tigress (T1) Avni’s female cub was carried out with the help of trained elephants from Madhya Pradesh. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) then suggested the Maharashtra government to train elephants similarly like MP. “Bringing elephants to this particular landscape is extremely important, considering the present situation. It is always better to track tigers using elephants as they are versatile animals. It’s also one of the proven concepts of tackling conflict,” said SP Yadav, member secretary, NTCA. Experts said more focus should be on an alert system where villagers can be informed in time if a tiger is lurking in the vicinity. “The Chandrapur landscape is pretty vast and Maharashtra is lagging behind in terms of tiger monitoring using elephants, which is regularly done across Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttarakhand since at least a decade now,” said Nitin Desai, director (central India), Wildlife Protection Society of India. TIGERS IN CHANDRAPUR Apart from the 82 tigers in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), The Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India 2018-19 study, identified 23 tigers in Central Chanda, 31 in forests, 39 in Brahmapuri, taking the tally in Chandrapur to 175 tigers. Combined with wildlife sanctuaries of Karandla (11 tigers) and Tipeswar (five tigers) and Bor (six), the tiger population in Vidarbha block was estimated at 219 (ranging from 185 to 252). The Chandrapur area has become overpopulated, which is a worry, and there is a need for controlling the tiger population, said YV Jhala, lead author of the report that called for dispassionate, and professional removal of problem individual tigers, as per NTCA protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chandrapur-human-tiger-conflict-trained-karnataka-elephants-to-join-maharashtra-tiger-trail-in-3-months/story-WeVvw7VxzBf3B8XmoxTvyL.html
17-08-2020||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar drops visit to Baramati, but NCP leaders say all’s well||The drama around Parth Pawar, the son of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, continued on Sunday – five days after his granduncle and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar publicly rebuked him. A day after a meeting between selected members of the Pawar family at Baramati, it is still unclear if the family drama has been resolved. On Sunday, Pawar reached his Modi Baug residence at Pune in the afternoon and was reportedly scheduled to go to Baramati. He had a telephonic conversation with Ajit Pawar, his nephew, after which the NCP chief reportedly cancelled his Baramati visit. “It is believed that that both (Pawar and Ajit) had a positive conversation pertaining to Parth. We are hoping that things have sorted out,” said an NCP insider. Pawar had ticked off Parth for deviating from the party line over the Ayodhya temple construction issue and for demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. The former Union minister called his grandnephew “immature” and said he doesn’t care about what Parth says. The senior leader’s statements gave rise to speculations over Parth wanting to quit the party and seeking a discussion over the issue with other family members before reaching on to a decision. On Saturday evening, a meeting was held at the Baramati home of Shrinivas Pawar (Parth’s paternal uncle), where the young leader, along with his parents Ajit and Sunetra, as well as Shrinivas’s wife Sharmila were present. The details of the family meeting were kept under wraps as Ajit and Parth maintained complete silence on the issue. Both of them also stayed at Baramati till Sunday evening. A day after Pawar’s public rebuke, Parth went to Silver Oak, the senior leader’s south Mumbai home, on August 13, where the young politician had a discussion with his aunt Supriya Sule (Sharad Pawar’s daughter) for over two hours, but could not meet his granduncle. “The party chief can never accept a stand other than the party line, only because Parth is his nephew’s son. Instead of making unnecessary statements, he (Parth) can work a lot in the Maval parliamentary constituency as the party is in the government and his father is a deputy chief minister and finance minister as well” said another NCP leader. Senior NCP leader and Member of Parliament (MP) Praful Patel said there is no family feud. “There is no issue such as Sharad Pawar versus Ajit Pawar. Parth’s issue is not a big one and there is no dispute. I have personally met members from the Pawar family, had discussions with them and it is not a big political issue. It is being given unnecessary importance,” Patel told reporters in Nagpur on Sunday. Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian from Pune, Girish Bapat, also said that it was a family issue and also ruled out any possibility of his party inducting Parth. Patel also said that the NCP is now bigger than the Congress in the state and the NCP chief has become the biggest leader. He further said that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is “stable” and mocked those saying that it will fall. “They are astrologers who know nothing,” said the former civil aviation minister. This is not the first time where the rift in the Pawar family has come out in the open. Parth lost the Lok Sabha polls to sitting Shiv Sena parliamentarian Shrirang Barne last year. Soon after the results, Sharad Pawar started promoting Rohit Pawar, the son of his other nephew, Rajendra. With Pawar’s encouragement, Rohit successfully contested the Assembly elections from the Karjat-Jamkhed constituency in Ahmednagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-drops-visit-to-baramati-but-ncp-leaders-say-all-s-well/story-6eoXnSOnzw6Tw8IHRaES9O.html
17-08-2020||Mumbai||Latur’s study model is key to 100% Class 10 success formula, say schools, teachers||“It has been a long busy year, but the results are worth the backbreaking hardship,” said 15-year old Sayli Khamitkar, a student from Latur who scored a perfect 100% at the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination this year. Sayli’s school, Deshikendra Vidyalaya, had 22 perfect scorers, while another school in the vicinity, Keshavraj Vidyalaya, had 25. Lal Bahadur Shashtri Vidyalay in Udgir had 14 students who scored 100% in the Class 10 exams. Of the 242 students who scored a perfect 100 across the nine divisions in the state this year, 151 are from the Latur division. Taking forward the much talked about the Latur pattern of study, schools in the district have been able to establish their hold over the elite ‘100% club’, a phenomenon that is seen in the state board results post 2016, after the state education department introduced bonus marks for art and culture for the Class 10 exams. Latur division’s phenomenal results, however, are not accidental. They are a product of years of planned and calculated study which is intrinsic to the teaching model of most schools in Latur. “We have a very serious and holistic approach towards board exams. We first take a test in the month of May every year before the new academic year begins for students. On the basis of this test, we divide students into A, B, C and D. The A division consists of the top scorers, while the B division is formed by the moderate students and so on. This way, we train every division as per their needs. Our teachers aim to complete the entire SSC syllabus by Diwali vacations (in October). Even the Diwali break, which is a long holiday for most students, is only a break of five-six days for our students. After they return from the break, they are given several papers to solve and the best students are then trained again to ensure that they do not lose out on a single mark,” said Manjuldas Gavate, principal of Keshavraj Vidyalaya. Of the 700 students who appeared for the SSC exams from the school this year, 303 scored 90% and above. At Deshikendra Vidyalaya, teachers who teach Class 10 students are in school practically the entire day. “The school begins at 7am and ends at 1pm. After this, we give students some free time to go home, eat their lunch and attend classes, if any. After the Diwali break, we identify about 250 students who are expected to score near-perfect marks and accordingly give them additional training from 5pm to 7pm every day. These classes consist of solving hundreds of question papers and getting doubts solved from experts who we call from outside to guide our students. Our students are motivated to get perfect scores from the very first day and we just give them the right advice,” said Manoj Mothe, the school’s science teacher. The Latur pattern of study is a model that emerged in the 1980s as an initiative of a group of passionate educationists in the district, who wanted to improve the status of education in the region. With the district being carved out in 1982, schools and colleges started consciously training students with the support of parents to improve the learning outcomes. “The term ‘Latur pattern’, however, was coined when the then education minister Vilasrao Deshmukh used it while felicitating meritorious students at an event in 1988”, said Vivek Ghotale, a Pune-based researcher and educationist, who has published a book on the district’s political process. As years passed, however, the pattern was used by coaching classes and private schools to develop a more rigorous study model, which promised students to help them crack competitive exams such as the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and Common Entrance Test (CET). For most students in Latur, the road to a good career starts by getting admission in the district’s reputed Rajarshi Shahu College, which is also known for its rigorous teaching style and good results. “The cut off for the first-year junior college (FYJC) seats in the institute is as high as 98-99% every year. This means that students have to start preparing from school to be able to make it there. This is a major motivating factor for students to aim for cent percent scores,” said Jashan Devpriya Dole, who teaches at a Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school in Udgir. Sayli for instance, had already made it to the college even before her SSC results came out. “The college takes a screening test for students a week after the board exams end (in April) and students who pass the exam get direct entry to the institute. I cleared the exam and have been attending online classes ever since. I am still behind some of my classmates who have completed the entire syllabus for Class 11 and 12 already,” said Sayli. Like most of her classmates, Sayli wants to crack the JEE test and become a computer engineer. While scoring 98-99% is achievable with rigorous study, achieving a perfect score also requires excelling at extra-curricular activities. Students who excel in drawing, dance, music and sports are allotted bonus marks. Ranging from three to 15 marks, depending on the child’s achievements, these points help the students get the perfect 100. “We train students from Class 1 to excel in different activities, which helps them in scoring well later. This is not for marks but to ensure their all-round development,” said Sanjay Vibhute, principal of Lal Bahadur Shastri Vidyalay in Udgir. This year, 5,714 students in the Latur division were allotted bonus marks for art, culture and sports, which is 14% of the total number of students who appeared for the exams from the division. Tanaji Patil, a teacher of Shri Shambhugir Vidyalaya, Wadgaon, who worked as a member on the Latur divisional board in the past, said, “These schools also give a lot of incentives to teachers and that motivates us to work for extra hours. Parents, too, are quite aware here and start planning for their child’s professional career from early on.” Ghotale said that while several schools in Latur help students from socially and economically backward backgrounds get good scores, only a few schools that dominate the top-scorers list are usually considered to be prestigious. “In reality, these schools get students from comparatively privileged socio-economic backgrounds, which means that their parents are aware as well as willing to spend for their education. Many of these students also take additional coaching from early years, which gives them the desired results,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/latur-s-study-model-is-key-to-100-class-10-success-formula-say-schools-teachers/story-6ohkz3ZyBCc1kgOcaWeI1M.html

In the past one month alone, Maharashtra has added 8,843 deaths or 44.13% of fatalities to the toll. On July 16, Maharashtra had 11,194 fatalities.The state government, according to a senior bureaucrat, is concerned about the high number of deaths in the state. “The chunk of deaths has come from urban areas, but now, fatalities are being reported from rural and semi-urban areas. The chief minister has already directed district officials and municipal commissioners to bring it under control through various measures, including early detection and segregating people with co-morbidities, etc. We will see the results soon. The state has planned to bring it down to under 2% in a month,” he said, without wishing to be named.Mumbai has the highest number of fatalities in the state with 7,133 and has a CFR of 5.5%, much higher than the state’s percentage.

We want to reduce the CFR below 1% [in the state] and we are implementing all [possible] strategies to bring it down.” Regarding the fatalities going up outside Mumbai, Dr Joshi said, “There are various factors. Peaks are different in different geographies. When a region or area is at peak the numbers of cases and fatalities would naturally be higher.”Meanwhile, on Sunday, Pune district, which comprises Pune city, Pune rural, and Pimpri-Chinchwad, surpassed Mumbai to become the most affected district in the state with 130,606 confirmed cases, while Mumbai, which recorded 1,010 new infections on Sunday has 128,726 confirmed cases.

Thackeray, while speaking to Covid-19 task force members Dr Shashank Joshi and Dr Rahul Pandit said that he does not want a second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak after relaxations were provided. Thackeray, who has been cautious in providing relaxation in the curbs put to control the spread of Covid-19, said that wherever there was a hurry to open up the lockdown, it had to be re-imposed after cases increased. “We are in the first wave and I don’t want a second wave in Maharashtra under any circumstances. And the second wave comes when we pat our backs on how we controlled the coronavirus and become complacent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-toll-crosses-20-000-as-tally-nears-6l/story-WCJoA3YKZj4Qy0Y531QzMM.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||Two kids suffer burns while trying to retrieve stuck kite in Nihal Vihar||Two children, aged 13 and 11 years, suffered burns on Saturday when they came in contact with a high-tension wire while trying to disentangle a stuck kite in outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar. The 13-year-old boy suffered 92% burns and is fighting for his life at Safdarjung Hospital. The other boy sustained eight percent burns and is undergoing treatment at the same hospital, police said.A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said that the two children were collecting kites outside their home in Laxmi Nagar, near Nihal Vihar, on Saturday morning. Around 11am, the boys saw a kite falling and ran to grab it. The kite got stuck in a high-tension wire and its string was dangling down, the officer said.“The 13-year-old boy tried to pull the kite using its string, causing him to get electrocuted and his body catching fire. The other boy who was standing behind him also suffered an electric shock and was thrown at a distance He also suffered burns,” the officer said, adding that many locals witnessed the incident and called the police.A police team immediately reached the incident spot and rushed the two injured children to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, from where they were later shifted to Safdarjung Hospital. A case of disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant and causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others was registered under Sections 188 and 337 of Indian Penal Code against unknown persons at the Nihal Vihar police station.“We checked the kite string and found some traces of metal on it. Prime facie, it appears that the presence of metal on the string may have led to the electrocution. We will seek assistance from forensic and electrical experts to ascertain the cause of electrocution,” the officer added.The father of one of the children is driver by profession while other’s father work in a private company, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-kids-suffer-burns-while-trying-to-retrieve-stuck-kite-in-nihal-vihar/story-ioNJAhPJejqyBwnXl0xS9O.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The apartment block’s very own writer||The coronavirus pandemic has temporarily put on hold the hyperactive lives of many folks, including of Ved Kumari Pahwa. “I was feeling especially frustrated during the lockdown... I was, and am still, very angry with corona,” says the lady, talking on phone from her fourth floor flat in Gurugram’s Sector 52.But then Ms Pahwa did what any writer like her does. “I wrote poems and couplets during my housebound days.”In her late 70s, Ms Pahwa was born in pre-Partition Multan, which is now in Pakistani Punjab. She lives with her son and his family, and has a daughter living in the US. During her 38-year-long career in education, she served as a school principal for 19 years until retiring in 2002 from Gargi Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, in south Delhi’s Green Park. It was then that she moved from her “big house” in Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave to her “caring son’s” home in Gurugram. “But I have my own life and interests, and I insist on doing things on my own despite my age,” says the lady. Ms Pahwa confesses frankly that she is very popular in her housing society and “every child here knows me, some call me Naani and others call me Daadi.”Until the coronavirus pandemic put an end to all sorts of outdoorsy activities, she would go to shopping malls, have cheese pizza (of course), browse about showrooms and then would settle down to pursue her favourite activity: “I would sit on a bench and watch people walking about.... wondering about their relationships to each other and getting subject matters for my poems.”Ms Pahwa doesn’t bother to send her writings to publishers. She, instead, gets them typed into a few copies that she circulates among her friends “who would read and offer me comments.” In fact, many of the people in her housing society are her loyal readers including “Mr Dua, Dr Sharma and his wife, Dr Shukla, Rajeshwar Vashisht, Nirmal Kanti, and many others.” She says her readers find her language simple and themes relatable to daily life. She also pens original bhajans that are occasionally sung in the kirtan ceremonies held weekly in the residential complex’s club.Just before the pandemic forced the first shutdown in March, Ms Pahwa hosted a launch of her most recent poetry collection Katra Katra Chun Liya, “which is an account of my personal experiences.” There were speeches and readings that evening “and about ten people who had already studied those poems in advance shared their views about them.”Additionally, during the first Monday of each month, a literary meet in the housing society would give Ms Pahwa the opportunity, along with other artistic people in the neighbourhood, to read her works to a willing audience.Like most writers, Ms Pahwa has a fixed place at home for her writing. “I’ve reserved this corner of the dining table for myself... it has my copy, my kalam (pen), my stapler and the glue... there is everything that I might need while writing so that I don’t have to get up and disturb my flow.”Suddenly getting somber, Ms Pahwa talks of the two great events of her life that did pull her down for a while. One was the death of her husband, a scientist, the same year that she retired from her job. And two years before that, her arm had gotten paralyzed. “It was very traumatic... the right part of my body still doesn’t work... I was right-handed so I had to learn to start writing from my left hand.”As is true with many people who harness their experiences into their artistic pursuits, Ms Pahwa says she has tried to distil disparate aspects of her life into her work. She continues to be full of plans. Her next project: “to get my new coronavirus poems typed.” And once the pandemic becomes history, she hopes to resume her mall hopping in search of ideas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-apartment-block-s-very-own-writer/story-aGsOZ6rqhTrAVYO6MyfODJ.html
17-08-2020||Gurugram||Certificate courses to upskill students to be initiated in city colleges||The state government has given its nod for the initiation of five new value-added courses in 35 government colleges across the state for the new academic session. The decision has been taken in view of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council’s (NAAC) accreditation process, which gives 30 additional points to colleges offering value-added courses. The state government has taken a slew of measures since last year for the improvement of NAAC grades of state colleges. All three government colleges in the city — Dronacharya Government College, Government College in Sector 9, and Government Girls College in Sector 14— will be starting a set of five new courses each this year. Each college will have its own set of courses. Some of the subjects in which these colleges will be offering certification will include digital marketing, gender studies, cyber security, marketing and advertising, business communications and green chemistry, among others In a written directive shared with principals of all colleges on Friday, the department said that it had granted permission for the initiation of five value-added courses in each college across the state. Each course would be for a duration of 30 hours and need to be implemented by college teachers. The department also said that final year students will be enrolled for these new courses in the first phase. Pooja Khullar, principal of the Dronacharya Government College, said that these courses were being started to upgrade the existing skill sets of the students in diverse concentrations and help them improve their placement prospects. “These courses will give an upper edge to the students during the placements. It will immensely benefit them since the courses are chosen from a diverse pool,” said Khullar. She said that teachers from the college will be trained online from experts from Ashoka University and GD Goenka University before the courses are started in the new academic session. Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the government had chosen a set of five courses for different colleges in the state that were supposed to undergo the NAAC accreditation process. “NAAC offers 30 points to colleges that offer value-added courses. With colleges slated to undergo NAAC review, this will be an additional gain for us. All the three colleges in Gurugram will be offering a different set of courses. There will be no overlap in the courses in different colleges. We plan to start with 50 students for each course,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/certificate-courses-to-upskill-students-to-be-initiated-in-city-colleges/story-LDruPlY4VzwExibVKYgvZN.html

The victim, a resident of Sector 54, had reached Sushant Lok -1 to attend a friend’s birthday party on the night of July 23. The suspects caught hold of the boy after his father dropped him outside the society’s gate. Investigators said the victim had met one of the suspects on a social media app for house parties in July this year. In a video of the incident, which was circulating online, the suspects are shown assaulting the boy, tearing his T-shirt and beat him up, and asking him to apologise to ‘a certain someone’, who police are yet to identify. There are four videos that were shot and uploaded by the suspects on social media, police said. According to the police, the incident took place in a residential society in Sushant Lok -1. Police said on July 23, at least 10 boys followed the teenager from Sector 54 enroute to Sushant Lok -1, where the victim was going to attend a party. The 17-year-old’s father dropped the boy and left. Immediately after, the group of boys, who were tailing him, surrounded him and started abusing and thrashing him on the road, the police said.Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police, said that the incident came into light on Saturday (August 15) after the family discovered that the boy had started missing his online classes and was not talking to them properly.“After being repeatedly cajoled, the boy finally revealed his ordeal to his parents and told them that he was beaten, abused and sexually assaulted by a group of boys whom he met on a ‘House Party application’ and had had a tiff with. The boy claimed that he had apologised later, but the suspects did not spare him and swore revenge,” she said. During investigations by the police it was revealed that the suspects had sodomised the victim and had sexually assaulted him, while recording some videos in order to blackmail him later. The family members said that their son did not retaliate or fight back or even attempt to call for help as he knew his life was in danger and he was outnumbered. His clothes were torn and he had bruises all over his body, which he tried to hide as he was scared of the suspects, they addedBijender Singh, station house officer of Sushant Lok police station said that the suspects had sodomised the boy and recorded the act. They had later threatened him not to tell anyone about the incident or else they would upload the video on social media. “We have got all the videos of the act and have roped in the cyber team to get the IP address of the suspects to arrest them. Their age are still unknown,” he said. A case under section 147(rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimation) of Indian penal Code and sections 6 and 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at Sushant Lok police station. Police said they have recorded the statement of the victim and family members and have got a medical examination conducted of the victim. “The victim has given us a few names, who have been identified and their movements are being tracked. We will arrest them soon,” said SHO Singh. On Saturday, the mother of the victim took to social media with a long post which read: “Nobody on earth except a mother dying in desperation of wanting justice knows what I’m going through because those videos have put a permanent damage on my mind & soul and I know that my son is not safe in a society where this horrific event went on for 5 mins and nobody came to rescue my baby! HE WAS ALL ALONE![Sic]”. The parents said that the boy now wants to leave India as he is emotionally, physically and mentally drained and traumatised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ten-boys-booked-for-sexually-assaulting-a-17-year-old-in-sushant-lok/story-9cnI57dtbQHy1kSiq3VlTJ.html
17-08-2020||Noida||Noida breathes cleanest air of the year, courtesy rain||Noida breathed the cleanest air of the year on Sunday thanks to the rain the city has been receiving lately. The air quality index (AQI) on Sunday stood at 53 (‘ satisfactory’ level), as recorded by Central Pollution Control Board, a value that the city had not reached even during the nationwide lockdown during which most industrial activities had come to a halt.The air quality of Noida and adjoining regions had improved during the coronavirus induced lockdown, which was imposed on March 24, with most industries being shut and vehicular movement at minimal. However, with various meteorological forces at play, the month of August is now on its way to becoming the cleanest so far, even as many commercial activities are back on track with Unlock 3.On Sunday, Noida saw an average rainfall of 8.6mm and the average level of PM 2.5,or particles in the air with a diameter less than 2.5mm,was at 19.94 micrograms per cubic metres (µg/m3). Since June 1, district has recorded a rainfall of average 19.5 mm.According to the records from CPCB and Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the air quality index (AQI) for Noida in April 2020 oscillated from 73 to 184 on a scale of 0 to 500, the AQI for May oscillated between 97 and 160, in June between 63 and 272 (poor), in July between 62 and 160, while the highest AQI was recorded at 119.The air quality is categorised as ‘good’ when AQI is between 0 to 50, ‘satisfactory’ when AQI is between 0 and 100, while its ‘moderate’ with AQI between 100 and 199 and, is considered poor for values between 200 and 299.“It’s primarily the meteorological conditions such as rains that have improved the air quality of the region, In May and June dust carrying winds from Rajasthan had arrived in the region negatively impacting the air quality. However, rains arrive by July and August, improving the air quality,” says Shambahavi Shukla, program officer (air quality), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).According to CPCB, for the month of April 2020, the average PM2.5 level was recorded at 45.86 (µg/m3). The average volume of PM2.5 for May was 50 (µg/m3). In June, the PM2.5 values remained almost the same at an average of 50.36 (µg/m3). In July it improved to 36.16 (µg/m3) and so far in August, the level has improved to 27.61 µg/m3.“The major reason for the improvement in air quality is rainfall. Rain suppresses the particles or dust, and that is why we sprinkle water to suppress particulate matter when the pollution is at its peak. Many industries not operating at a full swing due to the pandemic have also contributed to improving the air quality,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB (Noida).According to an assessment of CPCB’s data, however, Noida has not seen a single day of ‘good’ air.The air quality in Noida has been oscillating between ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-breathes-cleanest-air-of-the-year-courtesy-rain/story-BG70f59XYE98zIxYW4ANBK.html

The errant driver and the car are yet to be identified, the police said on Sunday.The cyclist, identified as Farooq Ahmed, was admitted to AIIMS Trauma Centre by an unidentified man, who gave his wrong details and contact numbers before disappearing from the hospital. Police officials suspect that the man who took the injured cyclist to the hospital could be the same person who had hit the cyclist. Ahmed worked as a security guard in the office of a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Siri Fort area, his relatives said. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said on Friday around 9.40 pm, the Hauz Khas police received information regarding an accident near Jija Bai ITI for Women and that the injured man was admitted to AIIMS Trauma Centre.“The injured man, Farooq Ahmed, succumbed to his injuries during treatment on Saturday evening. A case of rash and negligent driving causing death has been registered at the Hauz Khas police station. We scanned CCTV cameras around the area and found that a white car was involved in the accident. Efforts are on to trace the car and the person who was driving it at the time of the mishap,” said DCP Thakur.On Sunday, Ahmed’s family members and relatives reached the Hauz Khas police station and demanded swift action from the police in the case. Senior police officers assured them that they will nab the errant car driver soon. Ahmed’s brother-in-law Mohammad Sajid said that they learnt about it after someone called them from Ahmed’s cellphone and informed that he was admitted to the hospital. Ahmed was cycling to his work place when he was hit.“The caller had identified himself as a policeman deployed in a PCR van. However, we suspect that it was caller was the same person who hit Ahmed’s cycle, took him to the hospital and fled from there. No policeman was at the hospital when we reached there,” said Sajid.Ahmed had purchased the cycle around three months ago to commute between his home in Jasola and office. He is survived by his mother, wife and two children, said Sajid.On April 13, a 52-year-old doctor, who served as a Covid-19 nodal officer and was cycling back home from work, was killed in a hit-and-run accident near Malviya Nagar police training college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/33-year-old-cyclist-run-over-by-speeding-car-near-siri-fort-auditorium/story-glEFukoLModGPXaJLFJPFO.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||Covid effect: DDMA prohibits Ganesh Chaturthi pandals, Moharram procession; calls for strict vigil||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has prohibited processions, large idols in pandals, public gatherings and community celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi and Moharram in any public place in adherence to restrictions concerning the ongoing lockdown imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus disease (covid-19).While the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are scheduled to start on August 22, Moharram will be observed on August 29.On Friday, the DDMA issued an order that said: “During Ganesh Chaturthi festival, no idol of lord Ganesh shall be set up in a tent, pandal or public place, nor any kind of permission shall be granted for procession. People shall be encouraged and advised to celebrate the festival at their homes.”The order, which was signed by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, further said: “Similarly, no permission will be granted for procession(s) during Moharram and the public shall be advised to celebrate the same at their homes and not in public places.” HT has seen the order. Dev, in the order, said all DMs and district commissioners of police will hold meetings with religious leaders before any festival that has the possibility of a large gathering to get their cooperation to maintain law and order, harmony and also to sensitise people to comply with guidelines.Dev, who is also the chairman of DDMA’s state executive committee, said it should be ensured that the crowd does not gather at any religious or public place.All empowered authorities may resort to imposing fines for violating the directives, he said, adding that all enforcement authorities should be properly briefed about the strict implementation of the instructions a day before every festival, Dev said in the order.“The prohibition on celebrations is not surprising in the light of social distancing norms and the current covid situation. This year, the government and the police also did not issue no-objection certificates (NOC), citing lockdown-related orders. It is understandable. People will have to limit the scale of celebrations in the light of the pandemic,” said Ashok Bansal, general secretary of Ganesh Mahotsav Samitee in south Delhi’s Mehrauli.Bahadur Abbas, secretary of Anjuman-e-Haideri, the management committee of the Jor Bagh Karbala, said: “The government order imposes certain restrictions but does not impose a blanket ban on Moharram programmes. If social distance of not less than 2 metres between individuals is adhered to, it technically does not amount to public gathering. People should wear masks and there will be no crowded procession that violates covid guidelines. We are committed to the government’s Covid-19 guidelines.”Another order issued by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Thursday – seen by HT – said that idol immersion shall not be allowed at any of the Yamuna ghats, lakes, ponds or other water bodies. It also advised the ritual to be performed within residential premises. The Ganesh festival ends with a ritual of immersion of the idol in a water body – it is scheduled on September 1.IDOL IMMERSIONThe Delhi government has initiated the process of hiring contractors to create at least 15 artificial ponds in the city for idol immersion but public gatherings at the immersion locations are prohibited, senior officials said on Sunday.“Not everybody has adequate space for immersion or disposal of the idol at home or in their localities. Hence, it is important to have an emergency plan ready and adhere to the suggestion of artificial ponds which was made in January 2019 by a committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal to curb pollution in Yamuna. However, no processions will be allowed, social distancing have to be followed and there can be no public gathering during the immersion as per government orders,” said a government official who did not wish to be identified.Between August 1 and Friday, the Delhi government floated at least 15 tenders for artificial water bodies to be dug for Ganesh idol immersion in localities that include Kishangarh, Netaji Place, Delhi Cantonment, Inderpuri, Janakpuri, Mayur Vihar, Haiderpur and Moti Nagar. HT has seen the tender documents.Work contracts on these tenders are yet to be issued.More than 100 committees seek permission for community celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi in Delhi every year but thousands of people celebrate in their residences and they follow the idol immersion ritual too, often in smaller gatherings, said a government official.Idol immersion is a ritual associated with the Durga Puja too. The festival this year is scheduled to culminate with the idol immersion ritual on October 22. However, clouds of uncertainty loom large over the possibility of community celebrations and public gatherings – marked by decorated pandals, temporary food courts, cultural programmes, etc.The government is yet to take a call on Durga Puja celebrations which – if allowed, depending on the covid-19 situation in the city after a month – would require re-use of the artificial ponds and digging several more, the officials said.“Whether Durga Puja is allowed this year, will depend on the assessment of the covid-19 situation till mid-September. Even if pandals are allowed, there will definitely be restrictions on organising processions for immersion and size of gatherings in the pandals. However, in case Durga Puja is allowed, more artificial ponds will be needed for idol immersions,” said another senior government official who did not wish to be identified.More than 500 committees seek permission for community celebration of Durga Puja in Delhi every year.Robin Bose, general secretary of the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja Sammittee – which also happens to be Capital’s oldest one and celebrated its 110th anniversary last year – said: “Usually, forms for availing NOCs are available in police stations two months before the festival. This year, the forms are yet not available. Even if allowed, the celebration will be much smaller in scale in every aspect – idol and pandal to size of crowd. There will be no processions and social distancing have to be adhered to.”In 2019, the Delhi government had created around 30 artificial ponds for Ganesh idol immersion. All these were re-used – and around 85 more were created – for idol immersion after the Durga Puja festival. It was the first time Delhi had witnessed all idol immersions in artificial ponds.According to a report of the DPCC released in October last year, the water quality of Yamuna was found to be better compared to the period after idol immersion in 2018, in parameters that include total suspended solids (TSS), bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-effect-ddma-prohibits-ganesh-chaturthi-pandals-moharram-procession-calls-for-strict-vigil/story-0ljZPKBsU6bUGl3Yg2cf0I.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||19-year-old domestic help kills self, her family pelts stones at housing society||A 19-year-old domestic help killed herself at her employer’s home in outer Delhi’s Rohini on Wednesday night -- allegedly after being harassed and not being allowed to meet her family for the past three months -- prompting her family and neighbours to pelt stones at the residential society the next day, the police said.Four police personnel were injured in stone pelting in controlling the mob, said PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini).The police have arrested the employer, who runs a business in Chandni Chowk, and booked him for abetment of suicide. Since the dead domestic help’s mother alleged that some others also in the 11-member family would harass her daughter, the police also added Indian Penal Code section 34 (an act done by several persons with a common intention). The police have registered a separate FIR in the mob violence under nine sections of the IPC and two of the Epidemic Diseases Act. “We have not arrested any of the suspected rioters yet. We have asked them to join investigations,” said the DCP.  “For the last four-five years, the dead woman’s mother had been working at the home as a domestic help. But ever since the lockdown has been imposed, her 19-year-old daughter had been working here. She was kept as a full-time help,” said the DCP, quoting the victim’s mother. But, the house owner and his family allegedly didn’t let the teenaged domestic help leave the house. “One day when I came to meet my daughter, they refused to let me see her. After requesting the family, I was allowed to see and speak to her from behind closed gates,” her mother told the police in her statement. “She appeared unhappy,” the mother added. When her son came down to meet his sister, he allegedly wasn’t allowed.While the employer is in jail and his son refused to share speak to HT, the DCP said that the family has claimed that they refused to let the domestic help’s mother or brother into the house as they felt it could leave them exposed to the coronavirus infection. On Wednesday evening, when the domestic help received a call from her mother, she allegedly informed her that the occupants of the house had left for a family function. “They had locked the locked the house from outside,” said the DCP.When the family returned home around 11.30 pm, they found the 19-year-old hanging from the ceiling fan, the DCP added. While the police were still investigating the death and awaiting the autopsy report, the dead woman’s family and neighbours allegedly arrived in the society on Thursday morning and began protesting.“They were armed with stones and rods. I heard that they targeted the businessman’s house and smashed doors and windows of some other houses in the society. When I reached the spot, I found the police trying to control the situation,” said Amit Goswami, the local RWA general secretary, on whose statement the FIR against the mob was later registered at the Rohini (North) police station. The DCP said on Sunday that the situation is under control and the investigators are awaiting the autopsy report to determine if it was a suicide or if there was any foul play involved. “There were no external injuries on the woman’s body and no visible evidence of sexual assault,” said the officer.The dead woman’s family, whose members too have been named for the rioting, refused to speak on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/19-year-old-domestic-helps-hangs-self-her-family-pelts-stone-at-housing-society/story-MHASJ3IMaUBC0TbQNygMYI.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||5th Metro bridge over Yamuna, for Majlis Park-Maujpur stretch||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started work on its fifth bridge over the Yamuna river, as part of the Phase-4 Metro expansion plan. The 560-metre-long bridge, part of the Majlis Park-Maujpur Metro corridor, will be built between the Wazirabad and Signature bridges in north Delhi.The eight-station, 12.58-km corridor will connect north and northeast Delhi, and will, once ready, put Yamuna Vihar, Bhajanpura, Khajuri Khas, Sonia Vihar, Soorghat, Jagatpur Village, Jharoda Majraa and Burari on the Delhi Metro map.The city will also get its first double-decker viaduct — with Metro tracks on the upper deck and a flyover for vehicular traffic beneath — on a 1.4 km-stretch between the Yamuna Vihar and Bhajanpura stations. In another first, the DMRC will be constructing a cantilever bridge — a rigid structural element that extends horizontally and is supported at only one end, where the spans will be longer than the ones used in regular elevated corridors.  The bridge, to connect Soorghat and Sonia Vihar, is likely to be completed by 2023.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “A cantilever construction allows overhanging structures without additional support. Use of this technology will make the bridge look better, apart from lowering the number of piers that will be needed.”According to a metro official, the use of cantilever technology will also help ensure minimise hindrances to the flow of the river, because fewer piers will be needed to support the bridge. The official said, there are 15 piers in the 574-metre-long Kalindi Kunj Metro bridge. But just nine piers will be constructed for the Soorghat bridge, which will be almost twice length. “The spans of the Yamuna bridge have been kept as large as 60m and 80m to limit number of piers needed in river bed, so there is minimum hindrance to its flow,” Dayal said. The DMRC has constructed four bridges over the river to provide connectivity between trans-Yamuna areas and the rest of the city, between the following stations: Kashmere Gate – Shastri Park (Red Line), Sarai Kale Khan– Mayur Vihar Phase – I (Pink Line), Indraprastha-Yamuna Bank (Blue line) and Okhla Bird Sanctuary-Kalindi Kunj (Magenta Line).For Soorghat bridge, the DMRC has constructed a cofferdam away from the active course of the river by raising the ground level. Dayal said, “The level of cofferdam has been kept the same as the level of adjacent road to ensure supply of requisite construction materials.”Though the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor is one of the shortest in the Capital, it is one of the two corridors where the DMRC plans to construct a double-decker viaduct for metro and vehicular traffic.As per the plan, DMRC will construct double-decker viaducts on a 1.4km-stretch between Bhajanpura and Yamuna Vihar stations. The upper deck will have Metro tracks and the lower will have a flyover for road traffic.According to DMRC officials, the integration of two modes of transport are being integrated because of the densely population in the area. Further, traffic congestion in the area has also necessitated a flyover.A similar move is planned on the Tughlaqabad-Aerocity corridor, also part of the Phase-4 plan. According to officials, the double-decker viaduct will be constructed between Ambedkar Nagar and Saket G Block stations.The tenders for civil work for the project were floated last year. The DMRC started the construction work of its much-delayed Phase-4 in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5th-metro-bridge-over-yamuna-for-majlis-park-maujpur-stretch/story-oReeZmTnlKcxKDQhoMwUsO.html
17-08-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt sets up bravery awards, applications open||Starting next year, the state government will, every Republic Day, felicitate 10 residents of the national capital for their display of “exemplary courage”.

The act of bravery will be recognised and honoured during the Republic Day 2021 government function.”The awards will be given in a single category and winners will be awarded a medal, a citation and ₹2 lakh cash. “The number of awardees will be capped at 10 per year. Persons from all walks of life are eligible for these awards,” the circular added.The candidates will have to apply within two years of the incident. For 2021, as an instance, the respective act should have taken place between September 2018 and August 2020. Eligible candidates or any other person on behalf of the applicants can submit their applications with the respective district magistrate or deputy commissioner’s (revenue) offices.Delhi government officials and spokespersons in the chief minister’s office did not respond to calls and texts requesting comment.A senior DoE official, who asked not to be named, said candidates will have to fill up a form, available for download on the Delhi government home department’s website. “In addition to the bio-data, the candidates will have to give a written narrative of the incident within 200 to 250 words, clearly bringing out the sequence of events and the role of the concerned person. The entries will be screened and scrutinised by a special committee,” the official said.BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA Front — an umbrella body of over 100 associate RWAs-- said, “The initiative will help motivate youngsters in Delhi. For instance, if someone is being awarded for helping women, senior citizens or children from some untoward incident, it will motivate others to follow suit. However, the selection process for the awards should be transparent.”Students also lauded the initiative. “The national bravery awards see entries come from across the country, and competition is very strong. The chances of Delhiites getting more recognition for their courage will increase when we have our own bravery awards,” said Rishabh Ahuja, a student of class 12 at a government school in Rohini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-sets-up-bravery-awards-applications-open/story-Wqx7t9KcGa6dEGtvIEs7eO.html

17-08-2020||Pune||Ganpati idols find temporary shelf space in various stores across city||Ahead of the upcoming Ganpati festival as the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has restricted the sale of idols on footpaths and traditional markets amid the Covid-19 pandemic; stationery shops, bakeries, general stores, medical stores and cloth shops in the city can be seen selling idols.“Ganpati celebrations will be different this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and it has also affected the idol selling pattern. Many options are available to buy idols online, but still, some are providing idols in temporary shops,” said Rahul Khole, idol maker from the city.“As the PMC has not allowed the sale of idols on roadside shops, this year we have rented a small outer space of the stationary shop for a month at Tilak road, where we have displayed the idols,” said Khole.Usually every year one month before the Ganpati festival the city is flourished with idol shops where residents throng to buy them. There are makeshift shops on all the prominent roads and also there are specified areas where PMC has permitted sellers from outside Pune to come and sell the idols.These places include Shivajinagar road area outside the Shaniwarwada, road near Juna Bazar bridge, road near Sarasbaug garden and several others.Another idol maker Santosh Pakhare from Katraj said, “I have opened up my Ganpati idol shop in a relative’s clothes shop here in Katraj. One part of the shop we are using for the sale of idols and the other for the sale of clothes. We are getting a good response but the business has gone down this year by around 30 per cent.”“Having a different pandal of Ganpati idols with flashlights and the prominent display is better, but we will manage for this year as a safety precaution amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.Shreyas Rathi, a resident of Rasta peth, said, “Every year we go to Shaniwarwada road to purchase the Ganpati idol, but this year there are lesser number of shops and comparatively fewer options, so we booked our idol from a nearby shop which is a general store where the owner has also kept idols for sale.”“We always prefer Shaduchi mati (clay) idol and we got it near our house, so we are happy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganpati-idols-find-temporary-shelf-space-in-various-stores-across-city/story-uQGM9SXvaCybSJkjBNfraP.html

Even Independence Day was celebrated at home,” said Kiran Shinde, who generally visits Pheonix Market City on every Independence Day with his friends.However, mall owners have observed a rise in footfall over the last one week.“People are following all the SOPs and the best part is people who are actual buyers are visiting malls more which is helping shop owners gain more profit. There is a good footfall at footwear, jewellery shops,” said Arun Arora, Centre director, Pheonix Market City.The hotels, which are allowed to operate at 33 per cent capacity, are still struggling to find visitors.“With sightseeing and visits to temples not allowed, we are receiving only a few bookings for the Ganpati festival, most of the bookings are done by people who are on business trips,” said one of the owners of a hotel in Baner requesting anonymity.The markets, which are now open after the even-odd rule was scrapped, are also not recording good footfall.“Customers are seen visiting only innerwear shops while others have no takers,” said Salim Shaik, Muskaan dress materials, Kothrud.Federation of Traders’ Association of Pune, secretary, Mahendra Pitaliya said, “Footfall will grow as the festive season approaches. Our traders have noticed a rise in customers over the last few days, especially for home decoration material for the Ganesh festival.”The customers at Laxmi road were less as compared to every year during Ganesh festival.“As people have been impacted financially due to the lockdown, they are keeping the festive season simple and are not seeking expensive material for decoration,” said Ram Mehta, who runs a decoration shop at Laxmi road.“The charm of Laxmi road is missing, traders were always busy earlier, but now they sit idle at shops,” said Amol Patil, a customer at Laxmi road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/malls-hotels-in-pune-witness-lukewarm-response/story-6KYCeeQ72M1JQsdqTBAHCL.html
