22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Despite rising Covid-19 cases in Ludhiana, disinfection drives missing||While extensive sanitisation/disinfection drives were conducted in the city during March, April and May when number of Covid-19 cases were low in the city, sanitisation machines have gone missing from city roads at a time when Ludhiana has become the ‘Covid capital of Punjab’. Sanitisation drives in internal areas of the city with backpack machines have also been halted.Residents are demanding that the municipal corporation (MC) and district administration should start sanitising the city again as markets have reopened and are visited by large numbers of residents daily. Wherever possible, shopkeepers should be told to sanitise their respective establishments.Till mid May, nine jetting machines and fire tenders were deployed by the MC to sanitise city roads and internal areas. Also, backpack machines were provided to councillors for sanitising internal areas of their respective wards.Paramjeet Singh Sarna, general secretary, welfare council of Model Town extension block B, Bx and Cx, said,”Nothing is being done to sanitise the city even when large numbers of positive cases are being reported daily. The residents appreciated the MC’s efforts when it initiated sanitisation drives in the city in the initial months of lockdown, but nothing is being done when it is required the most. The state government and administration are claiming that the situation in Ludhiana is alarming, but necessary steps are not being taken.”Leader of opposition in general House of MC, SAD councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang, said, “No disinfectant is being provided by the MC, due to which sanitisation drives have been halted. Despite surging Covid-19 cases, the civic body is not paying heed to the problem.”Relatives of Covid patients also rued that their houses and areas are not being sanitised by the MC. A resident of Field Ganj, Jagmeet Singh, said, “My mother tested positive for the virus in the last week of July and was admitted to a hospital. Initially, no one came to sanitise our area or house. When we contacted the councillor, an MC employee came with a backpack machine, but he did not even enter the house and just sprayed the door instead.”A resident of Nehru Nagar, Balpreet Singh, said, “A few positive cases were reported from our locality last week, but, no one came to disinfectant the area and residents have been left to fend for themselves. The administration should take note of the problem as a large number of people throng market places nowadays and the civic body should take up regular sanitisation drives to control the alarming situation.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Sanitisation drives are still being conducted, especially in containment zones. On-call services are also being provided. Whenever the MC receives a call from the residents or councillors, teams are immediately rushed to sanitise the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-rising-covid-19-cases-disinfection-drives-missing/story-yIabTTa9QcjO9CSbGF84VP.html

The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Main is scheduled to be conducted from September 1 to 6, while the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) will be held on September 13. Earlier, JEE Main was scheduled to be conducted in April and NEET in May. Aspirants have been anxious over the delay in holding the entrance exams this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the National Testing Agency (NTA), more than eight lakh students have registered for JEE Main-2020. Experts say over 10,000 aspirants are expected to take the exam from the tricity of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali. DELAY HAMPERS MOMENTUM Markandey Singh, a JEE aspirant from Mohali, says, “The entrance exam should not be delayed further because it hampers momentum. We have been eagerly preparing for these exams.” NEET mentor Kunal Singh says, “I think the show must go on. Many exams have been conducted throughout the country in the past two months. Delaying entrance exams will be counterproductive for students. Those who burnt the midnight oil for two long years are getting frustrated, de-motivated and lethargic with the delay.” Medical aspirants don’t want any further delay in conducting the exam. “The entrance exams are already behind schedule. Now we are ready and don’t want any further delay,” says Panchkula-based NEET aspirant Shruti Goel. FINANCIAL BURDEN, TOO The students say that the delay in holding entrance tests increases the financial burden on them as they go for online classes offered by private coaching institutes. “Every time there is a delay, we have to pay more for the online coaching classes,” says Mandeep Singh, a JEE aspirant. Sadanand Wani, who heads a private coaching institute in Chandigarh, says, “The students who have got a good percentile during the last JEE Main exam are choosing not to appear again but those who want to improve their score are anxious.” MASKS WILL BE PROVIDED AT EXAM CENTRES To check the spread of Covid-19, the National Testing Agency has directed the exam centres to follow the standard operating procedures, including leaving a two-desk gap in the seating arrangement. Candidates will be given a fresh three-ply mask before entering the exam centres and all door handles, staircase railings and lift buttons will be disinfected.

The police have also seized cash, luxury cars, gold, and other valuables with a total worth of ₹10 crore from the suspects.According to the police, the suspects’ gang had duped scores of people on the pretext of inviting investment for opening outlets of retail grocery stores, cafés, hair saloon chains among others. Several investors had made investments ranging from ₹10-30 lakh, said the police.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Noida Central, said the gang had floated several shell companies in the last six years. The suspects had put up online advertisements to create an impression virtually that the companies are genuine. These ads were instrumental in luring people for making investments with the shell companies for opening various outlets, said the police.The police said the first complaint in the matter was filed by one Krishna Yadav, a resident of Gurugram, on August 5, 2020 at the Phase 3 police station. In his complaint to the police, Yadav told the police that he had seen an advertisement online about a franchise scheme for a retail outlet. “I contacted the mobile number on the ad and a woman then connected me to other people who posed as company officials and over time convinced me for making an investment with them promising high returns. I was told to pay the money as part of the investment and arrange a space for the outlet, while they would develop the infrastructure and provide the goods. I deposited around ₹23.54 lakh online in the bank accounts of the suspects. However, after the transactions they switched off their phones and went incommunicado,” he said. Yadav said he then visited the company’s office in Noida Sector 63 and found that the company had shut its operations. He then filed an FIR against the gang.Based on Yadav’s complaint, the Noida police registered a case against seven suspects under sections 404 (misappropriation of property), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 467 (forgery) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and launched a probe. The police said that more people who had been duped by the gang approached them and informed police about the fraud. The Noida police said so far at least 38 investors from different parts of the country have contacted police about being duped by the gang. A total of eight FIRs against gang has been registered in Noida, the police said. The police suspect over the years investors have been duped of ₹50 crore by the gang.The police said on Friday they received information about the movement of some suspects in Noida Sector 63. A police team reached the spot and arrested four people, identified as Ankur Verma and Sunil Mistri— residents of Indirapuram in Ghaziabad, Ravindra Kumar from Sahibabad, and Sunil Kumar from TP Nagar in Meerut. A suspect Rajesh Kumar, who had worked in some retail firms previously and had information about the franchise business, is on the run along with other suspects.The DCP said more people are suspected to be a part of the gang and an investigation is underway to nab them.After questioning the arrested suspects, the police team conducted searches at their residences and recovered 3.330 kg gold jewelry, 242 gram silver jewelry, ₹13.54 lakh in cash, ₹ 56 lakh in their bank accounts, five luxury cars, 63 laptops, 27 mobile phones, four LEDs, five printers, one swipe machine, two routers, two landline phones, 117 debit cards, 96 cheques books, 69 PAN cards, nine Aadhar Cards, 19 voter IDs, 17 driving licenses, 23 seals among other things. Ankur Aggarwal, additional DCP Noida Central, said the gang members had floated around more than five shell companies and advertised them through different mediums “They also set up an office in Noida Sector 63 in 2019 and duped scores of people. The suspects also put out ads for hiring staff and collected data, documents of the candidates who had applied for jobs with them. The gang used these documents for opening bank accounts and registering the shell companies,” he said.The suspects used the investors’ money to buy two flats in Indirapuram and Raj Nagar Extension, which would be attached as well, Aggarwal said. The gang members had registered their flats and some cars using documents to escape surveillance.“They had been duping scores of people since 2014. So far 38 investors from different parts of the country have contacted police about the fraud. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said Chander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/four-of-gang-arrested-for-duping-investors-of-nearly-50-crore-through-shell-companies/story-MNmr7R2WApZbq1dRpT7JSP.html
22-08-2020||City||UP-Rera recommends dues to be paid by buyers and developers at MCLR||Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) has proposed to the state government to order all development authorities and housing boards to charge a lower rate of interest, linked to the State Bank of India’s marginal cost of funds based lending rate (SBI’s MCLR), from home buyers, promoters, as well as group housing societies.If approved, the move could benefit many promoters throughout the state who are struggling to meet the costs of land and complete projects due to weak financial position and the down turn in the real estate sector. It could also benefit buyers who have demanded that the benefit given to the promoters by the Supreme Court be extended to them as well.Earlier, while deciding on specific cases, the Supreme Court (SC) had asked the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to reduce its interest rates on land costs from developers and linked it to the MCLR, which is also the rate at which the UP-Rera imposes penalties. MCLR is a method by which a bank determines the rate of its loans and is revised monthly. SBI’s MCLR is often considered the benchmark for all other banks in the country. The MCLR is currently 8% and UP-Rera follows a rate of 9.35%.UP-Rera secretary Abrar Ahmed said, “Several promoters had moved the court stating their projects were held up due to the dues with authorities. They claimed authorities were charging high interest of 12 percent to 18 percent for delayed payments. The SC in February and then in July had directed Noida and Greater Noida authorities to charge MCLR rate from January 1, 2010, and for period prior to 2010 authorities were directed to charge as per agreement. Further authorities were directed to prepare dues list of allottees and intimate them. Promoters will pay the 25 percent amount on getting the demand and rest amount will be paid in installments in one year.”The authority on July 30, he said, decided to pass on this benefit to all buyers including group housing and individuals and proposed the same to the state government.“The SC order was for only for promoters and that too for Noida and Greater Noida authorities. We propose that this be extended throughout the state,” said Ahmed. Rajive Kumar Chairman UPRERA said,”We have included all buyers either builders, group housing societies and individual buyers. Our aim is to provide relief to all buyers of all housing boards and development authorities in the state.”If, however, buyers defaulted as per MCLR rate too, then an authority can charge a higher rate mentioned in their agreements, added Ahmed.Ajay Chauhan Housing Commissioner UP Housing Development Board said, “Presently Rera guidelines on MCLR are advisory in nature. Once state government issues government order (GO) then it will become mandatory for all housing boards and development authorities. Presently we are charging 9%. In old dues cases we are charging rate as per allotment terms”Anil Kumar Singh, public relation officer, Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority said, “State government has issued guideline for penal interest to be charged from now onwards. It is MCLR plus 1 percent. For old dues once government gives approval to RERA’s recommendation we will charge as per direction.”Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) UP representative Sudhanshu Vadera said, “If RERA recommendations are implemented, it will be beneficial to promoters as they can restart the held up projects.”IC Jindal representative Flat Owners Association Ghaziabad said, “RERA’s recommendations are beneficial to group housing society allottees and individual allottees too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-recommends-dues-to-be-paid-by-buyers-and-developers-at-mclr/story-RqfYHwTs8Ywk0J93YuO4SM.html
22-08-2020||City||Amid pandemic, cycling is Noida’s new found passion||Noida Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, city residents have realised the significance of keeping fit and healthy. Eventually, cycling has emerged as one of the most popular outdoor sport activities in the city with more people now seen pedalling on the roads to maintain their fitness in a new post-unlock trend. While some cycling groups of the city say that they have seen a rise in novice cyclists -- mostly individuals in the age group of 30 to 40 years -- many families are also becoming a part of the rising bicycling community. As a result, bike shops are unable to meet the current demand. “There are over 30% more cyclists on the roads compared to the normal days. More people are turning towards cycling and joining our group. Amid the pandemic, keeping oneself fit is a challenge, and cycling provides a good workout either in group or solo. One can explore new places of town, do birdwatching and photography. Best thing is that we can also maintain distance while cycling,” says Rajiva Singh, who found a group called Joggers and Walkers Club that goes on weekly cycling tours ranging from 20km to 60km. Singh, a resident of Noida Sector 46, further says that many people who want to do solo riding often call to enquire about which bicycle they should buy. “We mostly suggest basic mountain bikes (MTB) to new riders which have broad tyres, more stability and less speed. They can later upgrade to hybrid ones which are more professional and expensive. A typical MTB model costs around ₹15,000, while a hybrid one comes for anything between ₹20,000 and ₹30,000,” Singh added. While the cyclists could be seen using most of the roads during morning and evening hours, expressway towards Pari Chowk, Surajpur bird sanctuary, India Gate and Red Fort in Delhi are some of the chosen routes of the several cycling groups in the city. “Since July, we have added more than 200 new cyclists to our group, taking our overall strength to over 450. We have 10-year-olds as well as people in their 40s. However, the most of new cyclists are in the age group of 30 to 40 years, followed by 16 and 22 years,” said Tarun Wadhwa, founder of a cycling group called Dare to Gear that enrols cyclists from Noida and Ghaziabad. Wadhwa, a resident of Noida Sector 41, says that most of the novice riders are opting cycling as a safe way towards fitness amid Covid-19 pandemic. A professional cyclist himself, Wadhwa said that he had pedalled for 2,200km in a single trip from Noida to Kangra in Himachal Pradesh. Noida-based Shobhit Jolly Sethi, a new rider who started cycling in July, says the idea was impromptu, yet good for fitness. “The idea that I should get into cycling was impromptu, and I’m enjoying it. I had a history of obesity. I would play badminton, but due to the lockdown it stopped. Here cycling emerged as a great alternative as it requires more muscles. I remember going for a 100-kilometre ride but ended up doing 50 kilometres. I took this as a challenge and practised more to reach that goal,” said Sethi. Owners of cycle shops are reporting booming business. They claim that many customers are being turned down due to short supply of bikes.“We have twice the demand now than it was in normal days. And it’s not just a case of this city, but it applies to most parts of the country. Most of the customers are buying bicycles for fitness. The demand is very high and we don’t have enough stock. The maximum customers demand of typical gear bike ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹15,000,” said Rajesh Girdhar, owner of Rajesh Cycle and Cyclofit sport agency based in Noida. “There is an issue with the supply as many parts are not made in our country, and even China is catering to the huge demand from Europe. This is supposed to be one of the major reasons why the supply is low,” said Girdhar.Varun Wadhwa, another bicycle trader from Noida Sector 63, said that since April this year the sale has increased four to fivefold. “Since July, the demand has risen even further. We have bikes ranging from ₹15,000 to ₹1.5 lakh. Most of the customers prefer those between ₹20,000 and ₹50,000. The sale is skyrocketing but the supply is quite low,” said Varun, who owns a store named Track and Fit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-pandemic-cycling-is-noida-s-new-found-passion/story-xKLUAQyH6iEwPIEYb7dqSI.html
22-08-2020||Noida||Resurfacing of Noida-Greater Noida Expressway likely to begin next month||The Noida authority plans to start resurfacing work on Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, which connects Delhi with the Yamuna Expressway, next month.Authority officials said four firms have been shortlisted for undertaking the resurfacing work on the 25-km long expressway and repair work is expected to start in September, after a delay of six months, once the authority selects one of the firms for the job.In October 2019, the authority had floated a tender to a hire private agency to resurface the stretch which connects Noida with Greater Noida. The process to hire a private firm was to be finished by March following which the work was supposed to start. However, the hiring process was disrupted in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, officials said.“A total of ten firms had submitted applications for the project and four of them have qualified for it. We now hope that the process to finalise one firm will be completed at the earliest so that the resurfacing work can start next month. We will resurface the expressway with a ‘hot-in-place’ technique that recycles already used material,” said Rajiv Tyagi, general manager, Noida authority.Around ₹69 crore would be spent on resurfacing the six-lane expressway using the ‘hot-in-place’ technology.The Noida authority has decided to resurface the e-way during the afternoon in a manner that does not disturb the flow of traffic. The authority will not resurface the road during peak hours in the mornings and evenings as it will lead to traffic congestion, said officials.Many commuters, residents had been complaining about the expressway’s condition and the inconvenience it causes them.“The Noida-Greater Noida Expressway is a crucial link not only between Noida and Greater Noida but also for those, who travel from Delhi towards Agra and other areas via the Yamuna Expressway. The Noida authority must repair the cracks and potholes promptly without wasting much time. The commuters have been facing issues for a long time,” said PS Jain, president, confederation of Delhi-NCR RWAs (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs.According to the Noida traffic police, over 1.5 lakh motorists use the Noida-Greater Noida expressway daily and on average, two to three fatal accidents (excluding minor ones that go unreported) occur monthly over it due to numerous reasons.The Noida authority had in January, 2019 hired Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) to survey the expressway to make it safe and smooth for motorists. CRRI in its report had said that resurfacing was crucial to offer a smooth flow of traffic on the busy expressway.“The authority has decided not to increase the level of this expressway. We will first remove the top layer of the road and mix the building material with bitumen to resurface it in order to keep the surface level the same,” said Tyagi.Resurfacing work on the expressway was last done in 2018 and is usually taken up every two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/resurfacing-of-noida-greater-noida-expressway-likely-to-begin-next-month/story-pQu7EWrexs8WrvK49jSavL.html
22-08-2020||Gurugram||Police bust casino operating from Faridabad home, six arrested||The police on Friday arrested six persons for running an illegal casino that allegedly operated from a house in Faridabad’s Sector 5.A total of ₹15,380 in cash and items used in roulette, baccarat, and other card games were seized, said police. Police said they raided the house based on a tip. Coins worth ₹48,500 and 104 playing cards were recovered from the arrested persons. Police identified the arrested persons as the house owner Rajesh Kumar, Gulshan Kumar, Divik alias Bittu, Karan Singh, Paras Kumar and Varun Singh. All are residents of Faridabad.Dharna Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), said that Rajesh Kumar was the main suspect. He allegedly used to invite people and organise the casino at his residence, selling counters valued between ₹2,000 to ₹20,000. During questioning, Kumar allegedly told the police that he used to sell coins during the day and people used to return at night to play. “Many people who could not make it to visit personally, used to play online,” said Yadav. Police said a case was registered under the Gambling Act at NIT police station on Friday night. Gambling is illegal in the state under the Public Gaming Act of 1867 and the casino had no licence, police said. Commissioner of police O P Singh said, “Kumar had bought the tables and other items from Uttar Pradesh. He himself was hedging bet. We have confiscated the tables and the set-up used by gamblers.” The neighbours of the area were unaware of the illegal activity being carried out and suspected that an office was operating there which is why people visited the house throughout the day, said police. “They thought people were playing cards or visiting for real estate deals. The house used to remain occupied till late at night, but the residents raised no objection as no one was bothering them and they never heard loud music or experienced no other nuisance,” said Singh.Singh said suspects were mostly into real estate and used to invest together in commercial and residential plots. “The suspects had visited Nepal and Goa several times to play at casinos. Kumar had placed poker in one of the rooms and had placed rollers bets and coins of ₹2000,” Singh said, adding that the suspect got an idea after he had read about casino running out of residential areas in the past. Police said there were no entry charge and nearly 20 people visited the house daily to gamble. The casino was allegedly operational round-the-clock. Police said makeshift casinos and high-stake card parties are often organised illegally around the festive season but Kumar had suffered huge losses during lockdown so he planned to start operations to cover his losses. “We have formed special teams to keep an eye on gambling and betting operations across the city. Strict action would be taken against people found involved in any illegal activity and will be under constant surveillance,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-bust-casino-operating-from-faridabad-home-six-arrested/story-MtOPzPkFuYR08qxGjD5yTP.html
22-08-2020||City||H-Rera to ensure flats are sold on the basis of carpet area||Gurugram With a number of people complaining that property developers were charging them for the “super area” and not the carpet area, the Haryana real estate regulatory authority said they will soon put a stop to this.Although “super area” has no exact definition, it is generally considered to include common areas such as gyms, swimming pools, stairs and other facilities. Carpet area is the inner area of a flat excluding the thickness of inner walls. KK Khandelwal, chairperson of H-Rera (Gurugram), said: “In a recent complaint, it was revealed that a developer who had permission to develop and sell 12 lakh square feet (sq ft) commercial space had sold 17 lakh sq ft in the same project. The excess space was sold in the name of super area. In another case, a buyer who had paid for a 1000 sq ft space actually got 350 sq ft less as rest of the money was adjusted for super area, which the developer did not define.” As per the H-Rera act, which came into force in 2017, developers are allowed to sell property on the basis of actual carpet area and they are not allowed to sell the super area, but because of vague definitions, they often get away with it. Khandelwal said that notices will soon be issued to all the developers to define their concept of super area. “We will study the submissions and ensure that there is no confusion on this issue,” he said. At the time of registration of projects, Khandelwal said the developers are now being asked to define their super area and actual charges asked from home buyers.“We will also ensure that developer is not allowed to sell area in excess of what has been allowed in the license. Also action is being taken against those who are advertising new projects without registering the same with the authority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/h-rera-to-ensure-flats-are-sold-on-the-basis-of-carpet-area/story-i8grDsAoKUic4CGTFSQKsK.html
22-08-2020||Gurugram||HSVP starts demolition of tilted buildings; locals complain of slow pace||Officials of Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Saturday commenced the demolition of buildings in sectors 27, 46 and 47 that had tilted precariously on Thursday, following a spell of heavy rainfall a day prior.In Sector 27 — where a four-storey building, along with the stilts on which it was built, tilted dangerously due to rains — a group of around 15 labourers was deployed to demolish the top floor, said Jaswant Kumar, HSVP official, who is in charge of the area. “The demolition process of the building has started and labourers are working on it. We are monitoring the process constantly. The owner will have to bear the cost of demolition,” said Kumar. Local residents meanwhile said that the demolition should be expedited to reduce the threat to the buildings in neighbourhood. “We have called in a crane, which has a boom of 60 feet. We have tied it to the safety jackets of the labourers so that in case the building collapses, there is no danger to the workers. The plan is to first demolish the top two storeys of the structure. Thereafter, a special crane would be brought in and efforts would be made to stabilise the remaining structure,” said Rajesh Khangwal, a local resident and a civil contractor, who, along with others, installed iron girders alongside the building to prevent it from sudden collapse. Meanwhile, in Sector 46, residents complained that the pace of demolition was slow and this was causing problem to neighbours who had to shift for security reasons. RK Yadav, president, Sector 46 RWA, said that 21 families had shifted due to the threat posed by the titled building. “The pace of demolition is slow and the authorities should expedite the process. Otherwise it would take a lot of time to remove these structures,” he said. Dharmvir Puniya, whose house is located just 30 feet from the tilted structure, said that poor storm water drainage and waterlogging had damaged the building. “The pace of demolition is slow. Only five to six per cent of the structure has been demolished so far. This is a four-storey building. At this speed, it will take a month to demolish it,” he added. In Sector 47, Mohd Ali, sub divisional engineer, HSVP, said that the work on demolition had started on Friday itself and they have managed to demolish the top of the tilted structure. “The labourers were able to demolish the top lintel and work is being carried out with adequate precautions. The threat to neighbouring structures has now been reduced, and the remaining demolition will be carried out in a couple of days,” he said. The structures in sectors 27, 46 and 47 had tilted dangerously after two days of heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday in the city. Around 30 families from neighbouring structures have shifted to safer places because of these incidents, said locals. The HSVP has formed a committee to probe these incidents and recommend preventive action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-starts-demolition-of-tilted-buildings-locals-complain-of-slow-pace/story-IRT609JAYCLX7tVP5C7ZhI.html

22-08-2020||Gurugram||Two held in connection with Sector 9 shootings||htreporters@hindustantimes.com  The police on Saturday arrested two members of a gang who allegedly murdered three men on Thursday in two seemingly coordinated incidents in Sector 9 area over a 1,000square-yard plot dispute in Basai. The suspects have been identified as Narender Pal, 52, and Bala Devi, 54, both residents of Basai in Sector 9, said the police. The police have so far identified three suspects in the case and have found that they had links with their gang leaders, who are lodged in Rewari and Bhondsi jails. Four crime branch teams have been assigned to trace the remaining of the gang members and a reward of ₹3 lakh each have been declared by the Gurugram Police on Friday.As per the police, the shootings in Sector 9 on Thursday may have been related to an enmity regarding a feud over a plot in Basai between two local gangs from the area. Joni Kataria, who is currently lodged in jail in a murder case, had an ancestral plot in Basai, which was usurped by one Hari Om. This led to a feud between the two. Joni and his brother Moni joined gangster Ashok Rathi’s group and killed Hari Om’s brother about two years ago. In retaliation, Hari Om, who formed his own gang with 30 local youths, murdered Moni Kataria in Rewari. Meanwhile, Ashok Rathi was shot dead by three of his close aides at his residence in village Alipur, near Bhondsi in November last year. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they the arrested members of the gang are the mother and the uncle of one Amit Kale, a criminal associated with Hari Om’s gang. He is allegedly involved in a number of cases such as murder, attempt to murder, extortion and land grabbing, and is presently out of parole. “He came out of jail eight days ago and, since then, was looking for an opportunity to take revenge from Joni Kataria. He located his members, following which he planned the murder with Hari Om, who is still lodged in jail. Both were earlier arrested for criminal conspiracy,” Sangwan said, adding that both were sent to judicial custody on Saturday. The police have identified Amit Kale, Pavan Nehra and Hari Om as the three primary suspects for planning and executing the Sector 9 shootings.Sangwan said that Kale was out on parole when he planned the shootings with Hari Om. Nehra is allegedly a relative of Hari Om. The police have also announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for information leading to the arrest of Nehra and his aides. The police have deployed personnel in plain clothes at suspected locations to keep a watch on other gang members as Nehra and his aides are yet to be arrested. Sangwan said they are investigating if any other gang is involved in the murders and are scanning all the call details of the arrested suspects to track down other members of the gang, who are currently at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-in-connection-with-sector-9-shootings/story-E1E5IXnm3BASbl2dfI52TP.html
22-08-2020||City||Residents struggle to give Covid samples, say wait for results endless||Even as the health authorities promised a hassle-free sample collection, people getting their Covid-19 tests done in the district say it’s an unpleasant affair.There is only one sample collection centre for residents living in Moti Nagar, Chandigarh Road and adjoining areas. The samples are collected from noon to 1pm and 5pm to 6pm at the urban community centre located behind Vardhman Mill.Residents rued that the limited time allotted for sample collection was resulting in long queues of patients at the centre, while the test reports take three to four days to come. There are no clear instructions as to what the patient having flu-like symptoms is supposed to do in this duration, they claimed.Gurjeet Kaur, a Moti Nagar resident, said visiting the Covid-19 unit is no less than an ordeal.“I had fever and cough and decided to visit the government Covid unit to get the tests done. I reached there at 9am, only to be told to visit again at noon. I told them I was not feeling well and may not be able to visit again. On this, the person sitting there asked me to visit the civil hospital or get the test done from a private facility,” she added.Another resident from Sector 39, Chandigarh Road, said the time slot leads to rush at the Covid counter, increasing the risk of virus spread.“I don’t even know if I have the infection or not, but I cannot take the risk of standing amid a crowd of patients having symptoms. I fear ending up infected,” said a resident who preferred to return instead of giving his samples due to the long wait.Sukhpal Singh of Guru Arjan Dev Nagar blamed the testing system for causing confusion. He said there is a huge time gap between the time of collection of samples and arrival of results.“What is the point of getting the tests conducted if the reports will take four days to arrive? There is no clarity over what the patient should do during this period,” said Sukhpal.When asked about the anomaly, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “We have received complaints about the limited time slot for sample collections at the Covid counter and we are in the process of fixing the issue.” Currently, samples are being collected at 10 government facilities across the district.GARBAGE DUMP ADDS TO WOESThe patients and their relative said that dumping of garbage alongside the government hospital is adding the problem. The dumping of garbage not only causes foul smell but also leads to the problem of flies and mosquitoes and other water-borne diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-struggle-to-give-covid-samples-say-wait-for-results-endless/story-GkT5ASemYHX5D0Qr1y1dNI.html

22-08-2020||City||Mohali: Self-reporting a must for primary contacts of Covid-19 positive patients||In the wake of rising Covid-19 cases, Mohali district administration has made self-reporting mandatory for all primary contacts of Covid-19 positive patients, failing to do so will amount to violation of the law and would attract criminal proceedings. “The non-compliance to National Directives and protocols, violations and negligence by the family members/co-inhabitants of the patient in home isolation can lead to further spread of the virus, which will jeopardize people’s health. So, the District Disaster Management Authority finds it imperative to take additional steps to thwart the spread of the virus,” said Girish Dayalan, district magistrate-cum-chairperson of DDMA. He said that self-reporting or intimation is now mandatory whereby all residents shall be obligated to immediately intimate the health authorities, by dialing 104 or contacting their nearest government hospital/local health authority (LHA) within 48 hours, in case they are aware of coming in contact with any positive patient. Besides, no Covid-19 positive patient who is under home isolation shall leave their residence (except for medical emergency) until the period of home isolation is over, the DC said.The family members/co-inhabitants including domestic help, where the positive patient has been home isolated shall strictly adhere to the health protocol. “Moreover, they shall self-quarantine themselves for a period of five days and monitor their health. If they develop flu-like symptoms, they shall get tested for Covid-19, and leave the house only after testing negative,” said Dayalan. “Any person violating these directions shall be criminally liable for proceedings under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and under Sections 269, 270 and 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 besides other provisions of the law,” he added.RWAs roped in to report home isolation violations The district administration had asked resident welfare associations (RWAs) and residents to report home isolation violations. It is incumbent that they inform the control room or the police station of the area if there is a breach in the norms by anyone. Though neighbours and RWAs may extend assistance for ensuring home delivery of supplies to persons undergoing home quarantine, taking all necessary precautions. “No visitors, guests shall be allowed to visit a house where a patient is under home isolation. Such visitors or guests shall be jointly and severally liable for criminal action,” said Dayalan. No movement from containment, micro-containment zones All residents in containment zones or micro-containment zones are prohibited from exiting the zone for any purpose or for allowing any person to enter the area. “The only exception is in case of emergency medical aid and provision of essential supplies and services,” he said. Further, given the government’s endeavour to conduct mandatory 100% testing in containment zones, no person shall resist or decline to give their sample to the health authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-self-reporting-a-must-for-primary-contacts-of-covid-19-positive-patients/story-aQcB64EQcmkk0uQ67m14LI.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Weekend lockdown, odd-even restrictions will kill businesses:Shopkeepers in Ludhiana||Markets in the city wore a deserted look on Saturday with the state government and district administration imposing weekend lockdown again from this week, opposed to only on Sunday. While all non-essential shops remained closed, a few shops selling essential goods were open at certain points, but witnessed low footfall. Only few residents were seen moving in the main markets of the city, including Ghumar Mandi, Chaura Bazar and Field ganj which normally witness heavy footfall on Saturday. Already reeling under losses due to low footfall and weekend lockdown restrictions, multiple traders associations and shopkeepers are raising a hue and cry over only 50% shops being allowed to open on weekdays on odd-even basis till 7pm. President of Model Town shopkeepers’ association, Amarjit Singh, said, “The government is not providing any relief to traders and imposing new restrictions everyday. How will shopkeepers earn profits to pay fixed expenses like salaries to employees, electricity bills and rent? The government is making residents afraid to visit marketplaces by saying the situation is alarming, due to which low footfall is being witnessed. If the present conditions continue, businesses will collapse, causing large-scale unemployment.” President of Chaura Bazar shopkeepers’ association, Parampal Singh Witty, and general secretary of the Punjab Cloth Merchants’ Association, Sonu Nilibar, said the decision will create confusion among shopkeepers as many establishments are being run without numbers marked outside.The questioned how the administration would to enforce the restrictions and said associations being told to implement the same would add to problems.“Many traders will be forced to shut down their shops due to lockdown restrictions. How will the government enforce weekend lockdown when private offices, restaurants and liquor vends are allowed to open? If the administration imposes stricter lockdown on weekends and does not allow any shop or restaurant to open, then there would be no need to shut 50% shops on weekday,” Witty said.Owner of Basant restaurants, Bhupinder Basant, said, “Restaurants have been allowed to open till 6.30pm, but low footfall was witnessed on Saturday, as fear has gripped residents. Many establishments are on the brink of closure and restrictions on carrying out business is adding to the woes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/weekend-lockdown-odd-even-restrictions-in-ludhiana-will-kill-businesses-shopkeepers/story-KIaWp4LjnBtC8amiQw99OJ.html

22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Human who won a pitta’s trust||The Indian pitta or ‘Naurang’ is like a ghost fleeing through the tricity and steering well clear of humans. So named because the bird sports a rainbow of dazzling colours, the Naurang is a rarity within urban clusters though encountered frequently in the Shivalik foothills. Even there, the bird’s call is heard more than its resplendent robes revealed as it prefers deep concealment among leafy boughs like a beautiful singer whose lilting tunes waft from behind a palace of veils. Given such an entrenched instinct to shirk human presence, it was nothing less than a mystical tryst between man and bird at a Sector 4 bungalow in Chandigarh. A Naurang accepted the hand of trust and help extended by a chauffeur, who had himself never seen such a beautiful bird before.Joginder Singh was resting when his eye fell upon a ‘mosaic on wings’ sitting unusually on the verandah floor and looking down and out. Thinking that the bird would fly away, he extended his hand towards the feathered apparition. Instead of spurting away with an indignant squawk, the Naurang took the extended arm as a bridge of trust and clambered aboard. After that it perched on Singh’s shoulder and then quaintly and quite possessively on his head! The bird seemed disoriented but harboured no doubt about the human’s intentions. Joginder took the pitta into his quarters and gave it water but the bird refused the offered scraps of food. “Joginder left the bird outside and it flew to a small tree. After some time, Joginder saw the bird was still there and he extended his hand again. The bird responded by flying to his arm and comfortably perching on it! By now, the bird seemed to have regained energy and flew away to a high Neem tree after spending a little more time with Joginder. After that, it was not seen again. We did not know the bird’s identification but were left charmed by its colours and the trust it reposed in our household,” Joginder’s employer, former IAS officer Gurnihal S Pirzada, told this writer. A MONSOON MELODY The large, brooding gates of the Panjab University (PU) are closed. They bear a determined expression as frontline warriors ranged against Covid expansionism. But an exquisite photograph taken last week of wild Rain lilies from PU’s Dr PN Mehra Botanical Gardens lends a sneak peek into the vitality of Nature pulsating within the ghost town of higher academia.A resource person with the Punjab School Education Board, Sukhwant S Raj, had gone to drop his wife to a PU block and wandered into the gardens. Upon seeing lily blooms sprawled like guillotined heads of rebels, he thought these were fallen Amaltas till the maalis made him wiser. One of them remarked that these were ‘gha’ (wild grasses) and needed to be pruned every alternate day to keep them in strict check! Doubtless, the gardeners did not share a high opinion of these rows upon rows of mini-tulip-like blooms that would otherwise conjure a scene straight out of an Amitabh Bachchan movie shot in Holland, the memorable Silsila! Untended by gardeners, lily bubs lurk under the soil and gallantly face every woebegone winter and scorching summer to suddenly rise and stage a flash dance of the monsoons. At the gardens, they stretch right across its deserted expanse like queues of diyas at a memorial of silence. Diyas, whose oil is rain drops, the wick kindled by a flash of lightning. Botanists refer to this lily as Zephyranthes citrina Baker.Raj’s passion, wonder and joy at photographing these tiny marvels was of a child who had stumbled upon a proverbial Aladdin’s treasure cave. “The lilies were such a refreshing sight. They radiated positivity. I thought that if we start our mornings with such spectacular visions of Nature, we will be filled with happiness and a positive dispensation at the start of the day towards everyone,” Raj told this writer. Truly said, everything under the heavens seems in utter chaos but the lilies claim the situation is excellent! vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-human-who-won-a-pitta-s-trust/story-zzJZImmwLV9Z8WcUngqKnK.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh University mix-up prompts PU to add admission alert on its website||To avoid confusion among students seeking admission in Panjab University, the varsity has added an admission alert on its official website to differentiate it from Chandigarh University.The admission alert on PU’s website clarifies that it is a central and state governments funded university located in Chandigarh while Chandigarh University is a private varsity located 25 kilometers off at Gharuan village. The alert states, “No official of Panjab University or admission cell is calling any prospective candidate for seeking admission to PU or for submitting admission fee etc.”PU’s Dean University Instructions (DUI) Professor RK Singla said, “We were getting many queries from students. The feature has been added to bring clarity to students who are seeking admission in PU.”On August 17, Dr Parveen Goyal of the University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) had also written to the vice-chancellor to issue an alert on PU’s official website regarding admissions. He said, “Many faculty members have raised the issue regarding confusion among students between these two universities. Sometimes a candidate from a different state who wants to take admission in PU lands in Chandigarh University, that is why I have requested the varsity to take this initiative.”This move comes two years after the issue was raised during a meeting of the PU senate. In 2018, the varsity had also constituted a nine-member panel to look into the confusion among the students between PU and CU.Panjab University senator, Professor Rajat Sandhir said, “Chandigarh University is taking advantage of the brand Panjab University has built over the years. There are several instances where students had to take admission to CU because of the confusion with the name. There seems no logic in using Chandigarh prefix before the name except for taking advantage of the PU brand. PU had also set up a committee to address this issue.”Spokesperson of Chandigarh University Prabhdeep Singh said, “On every platform, we have clearly mentioned that we are a private University and are located in Mohali. Even the initials of Panjab University and Chandigarh University are not the same. We fail to understand how there is confusion in our names.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-university-mix-up-prompts-pu-to-add-admission-alert-on-its-website/story-obyT6qFlCAD2KD42ONGfhP.html

Stating that only a few customers turned up in the last two weeks, he said he sold just two small idols on Saturday (Ganesh Chaturthi).His stall is set up near Sherpur Chowk and is easily accessible to buyers, but due to the growing number of coronavirus cases, residents are reluctant to step out of their homes.“Last year, I sold 300 idols of all sizes, which can take up to two months to make. However, I was able to sell only 60 idols till Saturday. The pandemic has hit everyone financially and our business has been severely affected,” said Naresh, adding that he is worried about making ends meets as he is the sole bread-winner in his family.Naresh said he learnt the art of idol-making from his father, who has been making them for the last 50 years. “I was 15 when I started assisting my father in making idols and used to spend my entire day with him. Gradually, I learnt to do it on my own.”However, he is not the only artisan hit by the Covid-induced slump.Harsh Kubar said this festival is important for idol-makers as they make earnings to last a whole year, but this time they are deep into losses.“I have prepared 10 Ganpati idols ranging 5 to 10ft, but no piece has been sold. Only 1 to 2.5ft idols are getting a few takers. These are available at the cost of ₹400 to ₹5,000,” he said.He said customers preferred smaller clay idols as these can be easily immersed, even in a bucket of water at home. “Due to the pandemic and lockdown on weekends, outdoor immersion is difficult, so majority of customers purchased smaller idols which can be immersed at home,” he said.RESIDENTS PREFER ONLINE PURCHASESome residents also chose to explore the online buying options to avoid a run to the market.Ishita Sharma of Punjab Mata Nagar here said, “I was reluctant to step out of my house to purchase Ganesha idol as the number of coronavirus cases is growing. So, I purchased one online. There was a lot of choice and all sizes were available so I bought a small one. However, my best friend made an idol at home with clay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/artisans-businesses-hit-as-covid-casts-shadow-on-ganesha-idol-sales-in-ludhiana/story-7lI3xMufmejG7oiojXElWI.html

As per the government protocol, we can ferry only 25 people. To top it all, passengers are not arriving due to the curfew. The trip from Ludhiana to Mohali will consume 40 litres of fuel. I do not know the logic behind plying the vehicle as it is completely unviable and will cause losses to the state exchequer,” he said.A group of conductors were anxiously urging passengers to board a bus for Ambala.“I have been in this profession for the past 20 years, but never have I seen such a situation. After the lockdown was lifted, passengers started availing the service, but in low numbers. It took us 15 to 20 minutes to get the adequate number of passengers as per government guidelines. But today, passengers have not arrived. It has been nearly half an hour and no one has come so far,” said the bus conductor.The few passengers who did make it were equally exasperated.Manpreet Kaur, who was travelling to Mohali, said air-conditioned buses are not plying due to the Covid-19 situation. “I have been sitting in the vehicle for nearly an hour amid hot and humid weather wait for the bus to finally start moving. I have been told that the bus will not ply till an adequate number of passengers do not arrive,” she rued.Deepak Kumar, who runs an eatery inside the bus stand, said the business has been reduced to 30 percent since the pandemic struck.“There are various contributing factors which have led to the downfall of business. As school, colleges and other educational institutions are shut, students are no longer travelling in buses. Moroever, bus service to rural areas has been stopped, resulting in low footfall. The curfew has further deepened the crises,” added Deepak.Meanwhile, Punjab state PunBus contract workers’ union vice-president Satnam Singh said the curfew led to a 70 percent dip in the number of passengers.“We urge the government to take strict action against the bus operators, especially sleeper buses from other states, who are running in the city. Not only are they causing a loss to the state exchequer by not submitting the bus stand fees, they are also violating the Covid guidelines, causing risk of infection,” he said.Passengers were also seen standing near the Jalandhar and Patiala counters, waiting for their buses to reach stipulated occupancy.A few passengers and staffers at bus stand were not wearing masks and sitting in close proximity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-footfall-at-ludhiana-bus-stand-as-passengers-fail-to-reach-amid-curfew/story-JSb1cUlDgZlmheWRxbI9GK.html

Those arrested include a panchayat member, and a woman sanitation employee at the civil hospital. The accused are Gurpreet Singh Gopi, 22, panchayat member of Maheru village; Gurpreet Singh Peeta, 24; Ranjeet Singh Rana, 25; Davinder Kaur of Khurshaidpur Colony in Nakodar and Kiran, 28, of Lamba Pind. Kiran has been working as a sanitation employee at the civil hospital for seven years.Police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said the accused were to sell the infant for about Rs 4 lakh and distribute the amount equally. As per preliminary interrogation, on August 20 about 12.40pm, the accused Gopi and Gurpreet reached the rear of the civil hospital in a Bolero (PB08-CG-2473) and were constantly in touch with the three remaining accused, Ranjeet, Davinder and Kiran over phone.Kiran kidnapped the boy from the ward and handed him to Gopi and Peeta, who carried the infant with them to the Gandra-Pandori road, where it was handed over to Davinder and Ranjeet. The ward has no CCTV. The infant’s family came to know about his kidnapping a few minutes later, and raised an alarm. Following this, a case under Section 363 (kidnapping) was registered against unidentified persons. A team led by assistant deputy commissioner of police-1 (ADCP-1) Vatsala Gupta, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Harsimrat Singh and CIA head Harwinder Singh was formed to crack the case. “The team conducted a detailed probe and arrested Gopi from his office. Others were nabbed from their houses. The new-born boy was safely recovered from the room where Rana and Davinder were staying,” Bhullar added. All accused would be taken in police custody to question them further on the involvement of more people in the racket and to establish where were they going to sell the infant. The new-born was handed back to the family in the civil hospital in the presence of doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kidnapped-new-born-rescued-in-jalandhar-5-held/story-lIZii7YQHhyI0BmIGonphI.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: To open or not to open schools? The dilemma of parents during a pandemic||It is unusual for my rurally posted veterinarian husband to call home at noon, which is peak patient time for him. Even before my hello he asked, “Did you pay the school fees? I just received a reminder from school.” As soon as he got my affirmative reply, he went back to his patients but left me with some lingering thoughts. When corona came knocking at our doors early this year, it was soon followed by “precautionary lockdowns”, a term alien to most of us until then. The lockdowns threw up challenges for which none had a Plan B. It brought with it a gamut of new experiences, namely health anxieties, job loss, work from home and for people with kids, home schooling. With the schools closed, classrooms became virtual and education altogether a new experience. It has been five months since online classes started for our six-year-old. We are satisfied if not elated about how things have been academically for him and us. The school is doing its job of delivering services and we are doing ours by modulating these services and paying for them. We have made peace with the fact that our Primarian may not go to school this year and have already decided to not send him even if schools open. We, a middle-class family in a tier two city of India, are blessed enough to have both financial and human resources to make this decision. But then again, we form only a quarter of the Indian population.A significant number of our fellow Indians do not have these blessings or means. The current pandemic has not been the same for everyone. Be it the story of a man from Delhi trying to reach his ailing son in Central India, another in Himachal Pradesh selling his cow to buy a phone for his children’s online classes, a girl from Kerala who committed suicide due to her financial inability to attend virtual classes or a woman from Karnataka selling her mangalsutra to buy a smart TV for children’s education; they all brought forward the social divide we live in. Some stories were told, others were not.After three unlocks, the government has on its plate the final unlock to unravel. For the past one week there has been a consistent debate on whether the schools and colleges should open with this final unlock. As the government deliberates over opening educational institutes with parents (mostly privileged ones like us) opposing it, one does not know what the final outcome will be.Financial, emotional challengesChildren in rural India predominantly and a significant number in urban India too, go to government run schools. With impediments in terms of quality, standard and delivery already existent in the government education set up, this closure has further troubled and distanced our disadvantaged segment. Education in pre pandemic times, then imparted free of cost, has a become a financial and emotional challenge for the incumbents. Impressions of the pandemic are felt deeply by parents who are struggling to pay for phones, internet and to help their children in academics due to absence of physical contact with teachers.When we as parents of private school going pupils protest the opening of schools, we are depicting a myopic view. We are focused inwardly and are not reflecting on the implications of this closure on a larger segment who are rapidly running out of options. The true impact may not be that much but the fear of missing out may have emotional repercussions on our less fortunate youngsters who are aching to back to learning. Minority should not influence decisionsEvery stakeholder should have a say in the decision, it should not be made or influenced by a minority. I wonder how many parents whose wards are enrolled in government run schools signed those online petitions which are contesting opening of schools. How many of those who objected to schools resuming were dependent on mid-day meals for nutrition. I wonder if they are even aware of people like us who are diligently working to make 2020 a zero year for their kids.The schools should open with parents given the option of sending or not sending their children there. The question should not be “to open or to close”, it should rather be, “to send or not to send”. Every child has a right to education, to a better future and to a better life irrespective of his or her social class.drpoonam.cu@gmail.com(The writer is academic associate, Indian School of Business, Mohali)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-to-open-or-not-to-open-schools-the-dilemma-of-parents-during-a-pandemic/story-hgmeMtSgJ4U9ajmZ9t5l1O.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC dismisses bail pleas of three Haryana men in Rs 1.5-crore highway robbery case||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed the bail pleas of three Haryana men accused of robbing Rs 1.5 crore from two Delhi men in September 2019 in Sonepat.The high court bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan observed that they have been booked on the disclosure statements by their own relatives, and the co-accused, who have been arrested in another FIR, have already got recovered the amount of Rs 1 crore and have specifically stated that huge amounts were handed over to the petitioners. Therefore their involvement cannot be ascertained without the custodial interrogation, the bench said dismissing the plea. The incident was reported on September 18, when two Delhi men, who worked at a Mumbai-based courier firm in Chandni Chowk, had come for a collection in Samalkha and were returning back in a taxi when they were stopped by Hyundai Verna car without a number plate. Men armed with two pistols and other weapons threatened the courier firm employees and snatched cash from them. The initial report was of snatching of Rs 11 lakh only. Police had arrested seven persons who had confessed to the crime and the three, Farman, Ravi and Pawan, had filed the pleas seeking anticipatory bail arguing that the FIR was registered after two days and complainant in the case was not the victim but the firm.The state police had argued that two cars and a motorcycle along with currency notes were recovered and even the weapons have been recovered. The persons arrested in the case are involved in a number of cases and there is evidence against these three too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-dismisses-bail-pleas-of-three-haryana-men-in-rs-1-5-crore-highway-robbery-case/story-Cy1qsR7IVWV4WfGYiaRxtI.html

22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Life before corona and after||“Virus” in common parlance has become a sinister word. In the last six months, the mere mention of the word sets off alarm bells in our heads. One becomes wary of people who say they have travelled recently, or that their relatives have attended a marriage. The novel coronavirus is so feared, that one is advised to avoid not just the house of a positive patient, but an entire neighbourhood just because a case was reported there a few days ago. In offices, the visitor’s chair and the table are sanitised after the visitor leaves. God forbid if someone coughs or sneezes, the whole office is on tenterhooks and the visitor is cursed. If it happens in an elevator, there is panic!The novel coronavirus has drastically changed our lives – the mask has become ubiquitous, files are handled only while wearing gloves, and pockets and purses always carry hand sanitisers. Social gatherings, batch parties, marriages and religious functions are frowned upon and invitations turned down outright. Just the previous Sunday, I was invited to the marriage of a close friend’s daughter. Even though I was lucky to have made it to the extremely short guest list, I had to refuse politely. Sensing my reluctance while talking on the phone, my friend tried to reassure me, saying that all the groom’s and bride’s relatives had been tested for the virus. But the thought of my patients’ safety took priority, and I had a hard time refusing the invite.Picnics, outings, sightseeing trips, tourism and travel for leisure all have become things of the past. There was a time when my entire family looked forward to our annual visit to Barog, a hill station near Chandigarh, and it was an occasion for three generations of our family to get together to enjoy a drink in the lap of nature. But coronavirus has stopped such outings. Visits to movie theatres and malls, too, are strictly prohibited, and even though some restaurants have opened their doors, people are reluctant to go there. The new “normal” involves staying at home and ordering food online, watching a movie on Netflix and other such platforms. The government advisory says shun everything non-essential, and the mighty WHO is quoted repeatedly. All this because of a “virus!” But it was not like this always.There was a time not too long ago when the word “virus” used to be just another innocuous word in the dictionary. At best, viral fever was a dubious diagnosis to seek medical leave or skip classes, while viral pharyngitis or viral gastroenteritis were still acceptable as valid excuses, even though they just meant sore throat or indigestion! Although viral conjunctivitis was always a ‘keep-away-from-me’ diagnosis in medical circles, only viral hepatitis or viral encephalitis were accorded the reverence of serious ailments.Viruses are very small infectious agents made up of a piece of genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, that is enclosed in a coat of protein. It was Martinus Beijerinck who named a non-filterable infectious agent afflicting tobacco plants as a “virus” towards the end of the eighteenth century. By the early 20th century, many new viruses had been discovered, with some of today’s commonly known viruses being hepatitis, dengue, chikungunya and polio.The novel corona “virus” is highly contagious and the best way to prevent getting infected is to use a mask, hand hygiene and social distancing. The world henceforth would probably be described as BC -- Before Corona -- or AC -- After Corona. I just wish AC comes soon!dr_kochhar@hotmail.com(The writer is a professor in the gastroenterology department of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-life-before-corona-and-after/story-PBppiFowzuG3lc0t4VjCEM.html

22-08-2020||City||Haryana IG held for assaulting women in Pinjore||Haryana Police inspector general (IG) Hemant Kalson, 55, was arrested on Saturday for allegedly assaulting a mother-daughter and a couple after trespassing into their houses at Pinjore in Panchkula district. Two FIRs have been registered against Kalson on the complaint of Rattpur Colony residents. He is currently posted as the IG, Home Guards, in Panchkula. A 42-year-old woman in her complaint alleged that Kalson forcibly entered her house on Friday and started beating up her daughter. When she intervened, the accused allegedly misbehaved with her too. The woman said she also made a video of the incident. Acting on her complaint, a case under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the police officer. Another resident, Satender Singh, alleged that Kalson was in an inebriated state when he reached his house around 9:30pm, shoved his wife and hurled abuses at her. When he intervened, Kalson allegedly slapped and kicked him and even threatened to shoot him. On his complaint, a case under Sections 323 and 452 besides 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 510 (misconduct in public by a drunken person) of the IPC was registered.

22-08-2020||City||Tax evasion racket accused sent to 5-day VB remand||Mohali A local court here on Saturday sent all six accused — four excise and taxation officers (ETOs), an excise inspector and an employee of a transporter — arrested by Punjab vigilance bureau for their role in multi-crore tax evasion racket, to five-day remand. Those arrested are: ETOs Japsimran Singh, Kali Charan, Varun Nagpal and Satpal Multani; excise inspector Ram Kumar; and Shiv Kumar, a munshi of a transport company. The vigilance bureau busted a statewide tax evasion racket, involving government officials and transporters, on Friday and arrested the accused from among around 12 it booked for causing losses to the tune of ₹100 crore to the state exchequer by letting go goods carriers without paying taxes. Pressing for remand, public prosecutor Varun Sharma submitted before the court that the vigilance bureau has recovered certain documents having details of money transactions, besides the recording of phone calls of the accused. “Private transporters were under surveillance since March 22 and vigilance bureau knew the names of the officials of state taxation department. Why no effort was made to check the alleged corruption. The vigilance bureau is relying on a conversation dated March 22 between two unknown people. At that time there was curfew across the country and transportation of goods was happening,” argued defence counsel Vishal Garg Narwana, while opposing the remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tax-evasion-racket-accused-sent-to-5-day-vb-remand/story-YtLBod0roRf1YVMSXMmzRL.html
22-08-2020||Pune||Pune police put in place code of conduct for Ganeshotsav||The Pune police have put in place code of conduct for 10-day Ganpati festival, which stated on Saturday. The guidelines have been issued for mandals as well as citizens to avoid crowding and curb the spread of Covid-19. As per the code of conduct, police have banned any procession while mandals have been barred from erecting mandaps and devotees have been allowed to take darshan online. “This year as code of conduct has come into place, there will be no procession or in-person darshan. To ensure that nobody violates the rules, we will deploy SRPF, BDDS, QRT. There won’t be any outside assistance from the state,” said joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve. The police have also urged the citizens of Pune to follow the home immersion norms this year, as against the public immersion in artificial ponds and Mula-Mutha rivers that unfolds on a massive scale annually. Pune has around 4,75,000 Ganpati idols installed across the city on an average, according to the police. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mayor has also appealed to citizens to avoid celebrations in the light of the Covid19 pandemic. The 10-day festival will end on August 31. As an annual practice on the last day, which attracts crowds of around 25,00,000 people, the city administration builds special immersion ponds at popular immersions spots. However, this year, the service will not be provided, according to the mayor. For the immersion day, 7,700 police officials will be on the streets, according to joint commissioner Shisve. While 7,000 will be staff members, 700 officers will also be on the streets to prevent crowding. Usually, most of the 9,000-strong police strength along with additional reinforcements, are deployed on the streets on immersion day to manage crowds. However, the deployment numbers have reduced due to the stress on home immersion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-police-put-in-place-code-of-conduct-for-ganeshotsav/story-Edc7YP1pyOR5grwYkaL8yI.html
22-08-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||How UT went the Haryana way on Covid curbs After threatening to act for more than a month, the UT administration finally did, albeit partially. The city has been seeing a surge in Covid cases since July. Even after Punjab announced lockdown measures on August 20, senior UT administration officials maintained there would be no weekend lockdown, and they would wait for Union home ministry’s directions. That was August 21 afternoon. By evening, neighbouring Haryana announced weekend restrictions Around 10pm, the administration decided on weekend curbs. “There was a lot of pressure to take some action as cases are on the rise but we wanted to avoid a lockdown. Finally, we took the Haryana route,” a senior UT official said. Weekend restrictions an absurd idea: Health experts Many in the UT health department see the weekend restrictions as a knee-jerk reaction to the rising Covid-19 cases. A senior health official said it seems every action or reaction is to show concern in the media. Only a sustained lockdown of at least two weeks can slow down the spread. Another official said there can be no absurd idea than announcing restrictions for two days. “It will result in anything except stopping the infection from spreading,” he said. When Parida took back birthday greetings UT adviser Manoj Parida likes to speak his mind on Twitter but the other day, he was caught on the wrong foot. Soon after he greeted a Twitter user on her birthday, the adviser was accosted by the Chandigarh resident who complained that she had not received any response to her complaints which was more important than birthday tweets. Beating a hasty retreat, the adviser commented that he had now ‘withdrawn’ his birthday wishes. Outgoing SSP goes gaga over City Beautiful “You can leave City Beautiful but it will always remain in your heart,” tweeted Chandigarh’s first woman senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Vijay Jagadale as she relinquished charge after completing her three-year tenure. In a series of tweets, Nilambari expressed gratitude to everyone from the UT administrator, adviser, DGP, Chandigarh Police officials to the aam janta of Chandigarh. With the wish to “serve you in future”, she was full of praise for the people of Chandigarh with whom she had worked closely during the Covid-19 pandemic. Her tweets left many surprised as she had not been that active on social media for most part of her tenure. At 100, it’s a life of no regrets for Lucy Chandigarh-based Lucy Mary McDermott turned 100 on August 20. “I have lived a life of no regrets,” says Lucy, sharing the secret of her longevity. While the rest of her family, which stays in Sector 48, was disappointed that her grand birthday celebrations had to be put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Lucy enjoyed her day, saying: “It’s just another pandemic. Life moves on.” An Anglo Indian, most of Lucy’s relatives stay abroad and she was particularly excited about meeting youngsters in the family. Born in 1920, Lucy has seen World War II, the communal riots of Kolkata in 1946, Independence in 1947 besides living through the influenza pandemic and plague epidemic of the last century. A resident’s thumbs up to Chandigarh administration Even as many highlight difficulties they have been facing in Covid times, Chandigarh resident Chandrika Budhiraja is all praise for the administration. She returned from New York in July-end and says it’s all thanks to the proactive efforts of UT officials. Unable to get much help from the Indian embassy in the US, she directly contacted Chandigarh administration when the then nodal officer for foreign returnees, deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Shashank Anand, guided her through the process. She was escorted from the Delhi airport to Hotel Shivalikview in Sector 17 where she was quarantined for a week. She complimented Jatinder Malik, the nodal officer in-charge at the hotel, for the maintenance, meals and facilities for all occupants. She decided to come forward as she felt people were criticising the administration too much when the officials were in fact doing a good job, especially for foreign returnees like her. Honour or an afterthought, ask miffed RWAs Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) are peeved with the manner in which Chandigarh administration chose to honour them a week after Independence Day. An RWA president narrated how they were called to the office of a UT administration official to collect their certificate on August 21. “We felt like it was an afterthought. They chose to do the honours almost a week after the function. We were just doing our job and we have told the administration that we will not be accepting any certificates from them now,” he said. Reverse learning, in online mode Online teaching in Covid times has made many a professor remember their early days at teaching. Keshav Malhotra, a professor at Panjab University, admits he often feels like his days as an assistant professor have returned. That’s because online teaching has made him work, and learn more. It involves experimenting with technology. He says he needs more time and effort to prepare for delivering lectures through the virtual mode.

So, we have requested the authorities to close the roads heading towards various ghats where residents immerse the idols every year.”Ranpise said, “Every year, the fire brigade department before the Ganpati festival prepares the ghat section for the immersion process. This year due to the restrictions we have not appointed firemen to be deployed at the rivers and water bodies.”“The immersion of idols takes place on the second, third and fifth day as well, so we have requested PMC to close the roads,” he said.Mohol said, “Last year around five lakh idols were immersed in artificial water tanks during the Ganpati festival.

22-08-2020||Pune||Public-safety, a primary focus during 10-day festival||The 2020 Ganesh festival has gone to another level in terms of public safety, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Though there won’t be any grand celebrations by Ganpati mandals this year, the enthusiasm of Punekars to welcome Ganesha at home is high. On Friday, the city markets had a rush of people to buy decoration material, sweets and other things needed for the festival. Also, the Ganpati idol shops were busy in attending customers with proper social distancing. “I have come to Bohri Aali market to buy a decoration set for our household Ganpati celebration. We are not going to make it big this year, as we do every year but we also cannot stop our happiness to welcome Ganpati, it’s time to forget all worries now and we hope that with the arrival of Ganesha, the Covid-19 will also go soon,” said Sneha Jain, a local resident. Abhishek Khole, a local resident said, “We are blessed with a baby boy in the month of June this year and so Ganpati celebration this year is special for us. There are no big decoration plans as such, but to make it special we have come to the market to buy some good decorative material. It’s important to take all safety measures and keep social distancing even during the festive season.” There was moderate crowd seen on Friday across the city market areas like Bohri Aali, Raviwar peth market, Tulshibaug market, Laxmi road, Tilak road and other prominent places where people normally come for Ganpati festival shopping. At some of the famous shops there was a heavy rush and people were allowed to enter in queue inside the shop to maintain social distancing. One such shop owner in Bohri Aali market, Kailas Dave said, “From the past one week, the crowd went on increasing in the market and today a day prior to the festival there is a heavy rush. People are taking safety precautions but are coming to buy decoration material. We have also kept a sanitizer and are doing thermal checking of each customer before they enter the shop. People without a face mask are not allowed to enter the shop.” Similarly, crowd was seen at Ganpati idol shops across the city. This year, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not given permission to install temporary idol shops to erect pandals on road but still hundreds of idol businesses have sprung up in makeshift shops temporarily. Yogesh Jagdale one such Ganpati idol seller on Satara road said, “I have started the Ganpati idol shop in an open space of a building parking area. Every year, we used to have a pandal but this time as we didn’t get the permission we rented out this place for 15 days. And we are getting a good response, until now 70 per cent of our idols are booked and today is a crucial day for us. On the day before the festival maximum idols are sold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/public-safety-a-primary-focus-during-10-day-festival/story-6WXZYdsz9jD5PhHe698jRL.html
22-08-2020||Pune||On eve of Ganesh Chaturthi, social distancing, masks go for a toss in Pimpri market||The roadside vendors in Pimpri-Chinchwad were caught flouting social distancing rules and not wearing masks while selling decorative goods ahead of Ganesh Chaturthi. When an HT reporter visited the Pimpri market at 11.30am on Friday, 90 per cent of road side vendors were without masks on Karachi road. “Our health department has appointed teams which keeps watch on such people. The team is regularly conducting an inquiry, once they are caught, inquiries are done against them,” said Anna Bodade, assistant Pimpri -Chinchwad municipal commissioner. A vendor selling artificial flowers said, lack of communication is one of the reasons, the mask is a liability. “We cannot properly communicate with the buyers, have to repeat the sentences or shout if I continue wearing a mask while selling goods,” said Rajlaxmi Dunga who was selling artificial flowers with her family members. Shop owners in Pimpri market were wearing masks and following social distancing norms. “You will not see any shopkeepers on Karachi road without masks while doing business. It is just roadside vendors who come with their goods, sell it and go away,” said Milind Chawla, who runs a cloth shop in the market. Many vegetable vendors were also caught flouting rules of social distancing and not wearing masks. “Our teams also fine them when they are caught and every day we are getting such cases,” said Bodade. Few buyers objected while some continued without bothering about social distancing norms. “It has become a routine; these people do not listen. It is better we only take more precautions while purchasing goods from them,” said Manas Lad, who was buying artificial flowers in Pimpri. “If a vendor is not wearing a mask, I avoid buying vegetables from them,” said Jyoti Belsare, who was buying vegetables and fruits at the Pimpri Market on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-eve-of-ganesh-chaturthi-social-distancing-masks-go-for-a-toss-in-pimpri-market/story-8TDAuaEugOYgMxpRoVIEsO.html
22-08-2020||Pune||Pandemic-hit Pune set to welcome Ganesha with low-key celebrations||The 10-day Ganpati festival will start from Saturday in a completely changed format due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The Pune police department has appealed to Ganpati mandals to celebrate the festival in a small way within the temple premises. Some of the prominent Ganpati mandals in the city have erected small pandals whereas some of the famous mandals which are known for their huge pandals and decoration sets have cancelled the celebrations this year. Shrikant Shete, president of the first manacha Kasba Ganpati mandal said, “This Ganpati festival has a history of more than 125 years and this is the first time when we all are going to celebrate it in a very small way. We are thankful to the PMC that they have allowed us to erect a small mandal and celebrate the festival in a very simple way this time. I appeal to all public please do not come for darshan of bappa instead they can do it online on social media platforms. We are going to take various health and medical checkup drives during the festival days. If the situation comes under control until September 20 then it would be a successful Ganpati festival.” Talking about the first day pooja and simple celebrations by the five manache Ganpati mandals, Rajabhau Tikar, president of second manacha Ganpati mandal said, “Due to Covid-19, there won’t be any grand celebrations, dhol tasha or music band processions to welcome Bappa on the first day. Normally, we used to invite an eminent personality from the society for the pranpratistha pooja on the first day of Ganpati, but this year it won’t be possible. So we have decided amongst ourselves that the Ganpati mandal representatives only go to each other’s mandal to do pooja. We all have decided the pooja timings and accordingly it will be done with a limited number of people.” Every year on the first day of Ganpati festival there are huge processions organised by these manache and prominent Ganpati mandals in the city. In this procession, there are dhol tasha groups, musical bands, performing artists of traditional games and DJ sound system. All this has been cancelled now due to the pandemic. Another prominent mandal, the Dagdusheth Ganpati mandal which erects a huge pandal every year which is a replica model of a temple in the country. Mahesh Suryavanshi, treasurer of Dagdusheth Ganpati mandal said, “This year we have cancelled all the celebration plans and are going to make it in a simple manner. There won’t be any decoration or replica of temple to avoid the crowd during the festival. Darshan won’t be allowed to public as we do not want to risk lives of people during these tough times.” BOX Pranpratistha pooja of five manache Ganpati Mandals 1.

While the government terms that the ordinances will create an environment where farmers and traders have free choice of sale and purchase, farmers allege that with these ordinances, the government was planning to discontinue the MSP regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bku-rally-in-k-shetra-on-sept-10-to-protest-centre-s-farm-ordinances/story-URAyaSAySmlsWyIHhGOZQK.html
22-08-2020||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Assembly passes 27 key bills on Saturday||During a three-day session, the Yogi Adityanath-led government passed 27 bills in the state assembly including the Uttar Pradesh Security Force Bill and Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Properties Bill, 2020.UP assembly speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit said, “This three-day session was fruitful. In the last three days, a total of 138 petitions were received on which action will be taken. Most importantly, a record 27 bills were passed.”These bills will now be sent to Governor Anandiben Patel for final approval.Earlier, the state government had implemented major ordinances after the outbreak of Covid-19 related to cuts in the salary of ministers, postponement of MLA funds, and legislators and preventing attacks on frontline workers.The ordinances brought by the state government were required to get the approval of the Assembly under constitutional obligation.Earlier in March, the governor had promulgated an ordinance for recovery of damages to public and private properties from rioters and protesters, and to provide the setting-up of tribunals to adjudicate claims for damages and recover them.According to the statement of object and reasons (SOR) of the ordinance, it aims at dealing with “all acts of violence at public places and to control its persistence and escalation, and to provide for the recovery of damage to public or private property during hartal, bundh, riots, public commotion or protests.”The UP Cabinet had approved the ordinance on March 13, a day after a vacation bench of the apex court, comprising justices UU Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, refused to stay the Allahabad High Court’s order for removal of the government’s anti-CAA stir, name-and-shame posters.While hearing an urgent plea by the state government seeking a stay of the high court order, the apex court had refused to grant relief to the government saying that there was no law to support its action.Earlier in June, the BJP government had approved the Cow-Slaughter Prevention (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. The amendment called for stricter punishment for violators and permitted publication of pictures of the accused at prominent spots in the city.The cabinet meeting chaired by the chief minister approved the amendment to Section 5A of the UP Cow Slaughter Prevention Act 1955. It penalises cow slaughter with jail terms ranging from a minimum of one year to a maximum of 10 years and imposes monetary fines between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-assembly-passes-27-key-bills-on-saturday/story-IHKAScqZUOhTJreqT6zNjL.html

22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Police probing Chinese spy’s Himachal links||Shimla: The Himachal Pradesh government has stepped up the security of Dharamshala-based Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama after the recent arrest of Charlie Peng, a Chinese spy in Delhi. State director general of police Sanjay Kundu said on Saturday that the police are probing the Himachal links of Peng, 42, who is accused of a ₹1,000 crore hawala racket and allegedly bribing Tibetan monks living in Majnu-Ka-Tila, a Tibetan settlement in Delhi, to gather information on the Dalai Lama and his aides. “The police are probing the links of the recently arrested Chinese man in Delhi with Himachal. Though the Dalai Lama has avoided moving out of his residence amid the Covid-19 pandemic, we have put his security on high alert and all necessary measures have been taken,” the DGP said. The Dalai Lama, 85, has a three-tier security. ‘CONCERNING DEVELOPMENT’ Tibetan government-in-exile information secretary Tsewang Gyalpo Arya said that the arrest of the spy earlier this month was “a concerning development”. “China should concentrate on containing the Covid-19 virus that originated in Wuhan rather than sending spies or intruding borders. The only good thing is that the Government of India, the state government and Tibetan security are alert. We are in touch with security agencies in Dharamshala,” Arya said. Tibetan writer and activist Tenzin Tsundue said: “China seems to be provoking everybody in the world and I wouldn’t be surprised if they remembered us in this moment of frenzy. We have to be extra careful.” Stating that India has provided the best possible security to the Dalai Lama, Tsundue said, “Every Chinese national approaching the office of the Dalai Lama must be thoroughly checked without exception by Indian security. The intelligence agencies should share notes with their counterparts in Delhi, Kathmandu, Nepal border areas and Beijing for better coordination and analysis.” FORMER PLA MEN CAUGHT Though the Dalai Lama gave up his political role in 2011, Dharamshala continues to be the nerve centre of Tibetan activities, closely watched by the Chinese regime. In the past 16 years, eight Chinese travellers have been caught for suspicious activities. They were arrested for travelling without valid documents. Few were held based on information from Indian intelligence agencies and others on tip-offs from the central Tibetan administration’s security department. Most of those arrested, including Liu Xiadon, have been associated with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Xiadon was arrested in the second week of July at the inter-district barrier in the Rakkar area of Kangra. Police found Liu had undergone Chinese army training for three months in 1997 and served the PLA till 1999.

22-08-2020||Pune||Rapid antigen tests make up 20% of total tests conducted in Pune city since July||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has ramped up its testing drastically which has now taken the city to highest tests per million in the country in Pune city. A major boost to this was given as the civic body started buying rapid antigen testing kits since July.Out of the total tests conducted by the civic body, about 20 per cent of them were conducted through rapid antigen testing. As of August 17, out of the 3.64 lakh, Covid-19 tests conducted by the civic body about 75,000 are done using rapid antigen detection kits, according to Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner.With the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) pushing states and Union territories to test more people using rapid antigen testing since ‘Antigen tests is a promising tool for quick diagnosis of Covid-19’, the civic body is now looking to test more using rapid antigen testing.Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal informed, “As of August 17 out of the 3.64 lakh Covid-19 tests conducted by the civic body about 75,000 have been done using rapid antigen detection kits.”The civic body recently passed an order to body one more lakh of antigen testing kits, given that the city is now one of the worst affected in the country.In a letter to all the states dated July 16, despite the ICMR’s letter to all states to provide real-time updates on the number of antigen tests conducted, Maharashtra government does not provide the bifurcation in the number of tests conducted. As per the state health department report, out of 34,92,966 laboratory samples, 6,57,450 have been tested positive (18.82 per cent) for Covid-19 until Friday.While real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for testing for its high level of testing, the ICMR is pushing for RAT as it provides quick results and helps isolate patients faster. Test results for RT-PCR may take up to 24-48 hours to reach till the hospital or the local civic body which further delays contact tracing.The ICMR guidelines for rapid antigen detection tests are to consider a Covid-19 positive as a positive and start treatment while for a Covid-19 negative through a rapid antigen test, in case of symptomatic the sample needs to be sent for RT-PCR testing while an asymptomatic Covid-19 negative through RAT is considered a Covid-19 negative.The ICMR also calls upon all the states to ensure that all the antigen testing points are appropriately linked with RT-PCR facility, where symptomatic negatives will be tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/rapid-antigen-tests-make-up-20-of-total-tests-conducted-in-pune-city-since-july/story-sVs01ROC90u8i102jrm94H.html

Despite that PMC floated a tender for appointing an agency for the same work at the cost of Rs26 lakh.Muslim Mulnivasi Manch and Christian Charitable Trust, on Friday, held an agitation at PMC building and demanded to scrap the tender and stop the wastage of taxpayers’ money.Anjum Inamdar, founder, Muslim Mulnivasi Manch, said, “We are conducting the funerals of deceased patients infected with the virus from March. Due to pressure from Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) after a tweet by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, PMC stopped the work of one organisation. Even later, we along with some other organisations including Shiv Sena carried out the work.”“Despite that PMC has floated a tender for appointment of an agency for the same work which will be a waste of taxpayers’ money. So, we held an agitation,” Inamdar said.Ramchandra Hankare, head, health department, PMC, said, “Two NGOs are carrying out the funerals of the deceased infected with the virus only from those admitted at hospitals, but Covid deaths are reported from homes as well. There is no mechanism to carry out funerals in such cases.”“These organisations have now promised that they would also perform funerals of those who pass away at their homes. We have put the tender process on hold,” he said.Hankare said, “We appeal to more organisations to come forward and help us. If there will be a problem in the future, we will erect our machinery to perform final rites.”An officer from the health department said on anonymity, “PMC has a mechanism and its staff for performing funerals at Hindu cremations, but at burial grounds for Christians and Muslims, the PMC does not have staff.

The private agency engaged by the district administration, according to some doctors, is offering more salary and perks to join two jumbo facilities in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.With work for the jumbo facility at College of Engineering, Pune and Annasaheb Magar ground in Pimpri-Chinchwad is almost near completion. A Mumbai-based private agency Life Line has got the contract for providing medical and paramedical manpower for the jumbo facility located at College of Engineering, Pune.The city hospitals have previously complained that they are facing severe crunch of doctors and nurses as the public hospitals are offering higher remunerations even to fresh and inexperienced doctors who are hired on a contractual basis.Dr Ramesh Ranka, founder, Ranka Hospital, Maharshinagar, said, the private agency which has been given the work of recruiting medico manpower has contacted the doctors and para-medical staff.“They contacted my hospital staff and offered them more salaries and other perks. The agency has been sending messages on their mobiles. It is happening with other hospitals too. I have raised the complaint with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and various officers for same,” he said.Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal assured of action if the agency is involved in recruiting local manpower.“We have strictly told the agency not recruit any doctor or paramedics staff from Pune district. If they are doing this then we will take action against them,” said Agarwal.According to Ranka half of staff from his hospital has already left the job due to pandemic fear and other reasons. “If the rest staff would also get disturbed it would be difficult to manage the hospitals,” he said.Sujit Patkar, Life Line agency, said, “We are not poaching doctors from private hospitals in the city, but if anyone voluntarily comes to us, we are recruiting them. We are working at the national level and hiring staff from different states.”Hindustan Times in its August 1 edition had carried a report about how government’s lucrative offers are leading to a shortage of staff in private hospitals. Dr Sunil Rao, group chief operating officer, Sahyadri hospitals had said that his hospital staff was leaving because of lucrative offers by state government hospitals not just in Pune but also in Thane.“Nurses are offered almost Rs 45,000 per month for a contractual period of 3 or 6 months which is almost double of what we pay, a round of Rs 20,000 to 25,000 per month. These sudden recruitments by the government are leading to a huge staff crunch in private sectors. Almost 50 of our nurses have left our hospitals in just two months to join government hospitals in Pune and Thane,” Rao had said.Another doctor who owns 25-bed hospital said on anonymity, “Offer had been given to nurses from his hospital and one nurse is planning to leave the job. Government is bringing all the restrictions on private hospitals but they should also take care of our problems. Running a hospital is not easy.”Congress leader Aba Bagul has written a letter to the municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and demanded the inquiry in this matter.Bagul said, “If the private hospitals’ network would get disturbed, it would be difficult to manage the health system in the city. Even today 70 per cent Covid patients are in private hospitals. The administration is just concentrating on the jumbo facility but they should take care that the agencies of the jumbo facility should not disturb the private hospitals’ staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/agency-appointed-to-recruit-staff-for-jumbo-facility-in-pune-poaching-doctors-nurses-allege-private-hospitals/story-cdckF6Snxd4MfdbLUeY7DJ.html
22-08-2020||City||Karnal woman who accused school owner of rape held for extortion||Karnal Nearly one-and-a-half-months after a woman staffer at a private school accused the owner and a senior official of the revenue department of gangrape, police have arrested her and her husband for taking money to settle the case.“The woman and her husband have been arrested for taking Rs 7.25 lakh from outside the district court in Sector 12 on Friday and have been booked for extortion. An FIR will be registered under relevant sections,” said Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Surender Bhoria, adding that those she had accused had approached the police, claiming that she was demanding Rs 15 lakh to withdraw her complaint. The SP said police will also seek remand of the couple to recover Rs 6 lakh they had already taken.“I am being implicated in a false case and have never sought any money,” the woman has said.On July 7 this year, the woman had alleged that the school owner and the revenue official had raped her at the residence of the former, just a few months after being appointed assistant librarian at the school in 2018. She had applied for the post of a Hindi teacher. She has also accused the woman principal of the school of helping the accused by harassing and pressuring her.On her complaint, the school owner, the government official and the principal were booked under Sections 376D (gangrape), 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (act done by several persons in common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) the same day.Police said during investigation, it was found that the woman had filed the complaint two days after the school management accused her of extortion, as she was seeking a raise in her salary and other benefits from the school. The SP added that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was investigating the case as counter-complaints had been filed. He added that the school management had provided text messages and other evidence against the woman and the arrest will help solve the case. Vinay Bansal, advocate of the woman, has refuted the allegations and questioned the working of police. “The police were trying to implicate her to withdraw her gangrape complaint she has filed against school owner and government officer,” he claimed, adding that he was sure that the court will clear her of all the allegations. He added that there was no chemical coating on currency notes and police claims of arresting her red-handed were false. He also alleged that a number of other influential people from Karnal were involved in her arrest. A court sent the couple to judicial custody, even as the police pressed hard for their police custody.Karnal deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rajiv Kumar said a police team had arrested them in the presence of duty magistrate, while taking the money and they had been booked under Sections 384 (extortion), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/karnal-woman-who-accused-school-owner-of-rape-held-for-extortion/story-1QVaxG7LY423etVgVBGiLJ.html

22-08-2020||Delhi||50 kg tumour removed from woman’s abdomen in 3.5 hours at Delhi hospital||A 52-year-old woman from Delhi who had an unexplained rapid weight gain over the past few months was found to have a 50 kg ovarian tumour, which accounted for close to half her body weight of 106 kg.Post-surgery, the woman’s weight has dropped to 56 kg. She has recovered from the complicated surgery and is set to be discharged from hospital on August 22.The woman, who prefers to remain unnamed, had the tumour removed in a 3.5 hours surgery at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. The team of surgeons said it is the largest ovarian tumour ever to be operated in the world, with the largest tumour reported to date being a case from Coimbatore, where a woman was operated for a 34 kg tumour in her ovary in 2017. The Delhi patient began gaining weight rapidly over the past few months, which led to her experiencing breathlessness and acute pain in her lower abdomen, which led to difficulty in walking and sleeping. When the rapid weight gain didn’t stop and the associated complications increased, she consulted a neighbourhood physician, who referred her to Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals. Diagnostic investigations revealed she had a large, progressively expanding tumour in her ovary, which was putting pressure on her intestine (intestinal adhesions), leading to acute stomach aches and inability to digest food. As a result, she had developed acute anaemia, with her haemoglobin count dropping to 6 gm/dl, against a normal of 12-15.5 gm/dl. “The size of the tumour and patient’s exceptionally low hemoglobin made extract a challenge, and she had to undergo 6 units of blood transfusion before, during and after the procedure. That apart, there was no space in the abdomen for insertion of equipment via laparoscopy or robot assisted methods, so we performed traditional surgery with a multidisciplinary team from the gastroenterology, gynaecology and anaesthesiology teams,” said lead surgeon Dr Arun Prasad, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and bariatric surgery. “The patient was admitted with complaints of stomachache, breathing stress and weight gain. She was advised immediate surgery as further growth would have put pressure on other organs, leading to possible organ failure. Fortunately, the tumour was benign and the patient had no co-morbidities, which enabled a faster recovery,” said Dr Abhishek Tiwari, consultant, surgical gastroenterology, who was part of the team that performed the surgery. Fear of getting infected is keeping patients away from hospitals, where they are increasingly seeking treatment in advance stages of disease, which require more complex surgeries. “Many procedures that can be done using minimally invasive techniques now need open surgery. The complications also led to longer hospital and ICU stay,” said Dr Vinod Bindal, vice chairman of minimally invasive surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/50-kg-tumour-removed-from-woman-s-abdomen-in-3-5-hours-at-delhi-hospital/story-cxmghtOaZf8x0Ir2trgndP.html
22-08-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow admin to set up kiosks for distribution of Ivermectin tablets||Lucknow’s district administration will set up around 40 kiosks across the city to ensure free distribution of Ivermectin tablets among asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. A few of these kiosks will become operational from Monday, officials said. Ivermectin, a deworming drug, can be used as a supporting medicine for Covid-19 patients under home isolation and their contacts, according to doctors. Officials said the kiosks would come up at the airport, city bus stations, railway stations, etc. Additional district magistrate KP Singh said, “The use of the Ivermectin tablet has proved effective for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. It is also being widely prescribed by government doctors. Hence, the administration, in collaboration with the health department, is setting up kiosks across the city to ensure its free distribution.” Officials said the project would be implemented in phases. “Initially, all the entry and exit points of the city would be covered. It would largely include all four bus stations, railway stations, the airport and the highway entries and exits,” an official said. Experts would ensure distribution of tablets among the people at all these points, he said. The tablets would be given on the basis of the symptoms or if anyone has come in contact with a Covid-19 patient. On Wednesday, chief medical officer (Lucknow) Dr RP Singh issued a circular, advising people to take Ivermectin tablet, as per their body weight and age, if they test positive and are under home isolation. Doctors said the medicine was found effective against the virus in a lab in-vitro study. “In Australia, researchers claimed the viral load went down 5,000 times in 48 hours with this medicine taken in combination. Also, a Bangladesh scientist claimed a similar effect. At present, research on this medicine is going on at 28 places,” said Dr Kauser Usman of King George’s Medical University. “It is not a treatment for Covid-19, but yes, as a supporting medicine, its role has been identified to boost immunity. It can be taken under a doctor’s guidance for a proper dosage,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-admin-to-set-up-kiosks-for-distribution-of-ivermectin-tablets/story-YNDN2GIdWHf7EsDgZQbmNL.html

They have also stuck to simple paper flower decorations instead of using fresh flowers.While some have made idols out of chocolates and other sweet dishes, others have used clay in order to celebrate the festival in the safest way.Sumeet Patil, a Dadar resident, created Ganpati idol from quilts. Patil, an art director by profession, said: “We usually forget about the unused stuff at home that can be utilized in a creative manner...I just took a month to convert my idea into reality.”Baker Neha Divekar, whose son was stuck in Paris due to the pandemic, decided to celebrate the festival for the first time by installing Ganpati idol at home after his return home in June. “I knew that I wanted to install the idol but at the same time I was sure that I was not going to leave home to buy an idol. This is why I decided to attend an online class to learn to make an eco-friendly Ganpati so that the idol can be immersed at home itself. No guests have been invited..,” she said. Pranali Sahasrabudhe, a professor and a Vile Parle-East resident, said, “I have been installing eco-friendly Ganpati at home for four years now, but this is the first time that I have not used any decoration material that needed to be bought. So much so that all my flowers are made from papers available at home so that I don’t have to enter a market place to buy them. Moreover, I have even asked my extended family to remain at home and have assured them to video call during the aarti.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-mumbai-is-worshipping-ganpati-in-the-time-of-covid/story-0J6HpT3Yh8LvrAUJVJ5koK.html

Idols should be immersed at a nearby artificial pond if it is not possible to immerse them at homes, the statement said.•If possible, the send off of idols should be postponed until the time of immersions of idols installed during Maghi Ganeshotsav or during the month of Bhadrapad 2021, that is, next year.•Health-related advertisements should be displayed during the 10-day festival to help people keep themselves safe and avoid the infection. The government asked mandals to undertake health initiatives instead of organising cultural programmes.•Mandals should try to arrange for online darshan of Lord Ganesh’s idols. The government said mandaps be disinfected, thermal screening be arranged for and physical distancing related norms be strictly adhered to by devotees turning up at mandaps to seek darshan of Lord Ganesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-issues-guidelines-for-ganesh-chaturthi-list-of-do-s-and-don-ts/story-Uh6J3BeMXPHdKVLCNS23rI.html

A senior BSF official said that an AK assault rifle and a rucksack was recovered from one of the bodies. “The search operation is underway. It is yet to be ascertained if those shot down are Pakistanis. The motive of the accused will be clear once the operation ends.” Around 5am, BSF personnel noticed suspicious movement across the border fence in Pakistan near the Dall border out post (BoP). Sources said two men were seen trying to sneak into Indian territory. Despite being challenged, the duo kept moving ahead, prompting the BSF to open fire. After the firing, the officials said, a search was launched and five bodies were recovered. BSF officials said they were taking precautions during the search as the area could be mined. Last year, Punjab Police had busted a module smuggling sophisticated weapons and drugs from across the border by using drones. The police had claimed that the smugglers had cleared several sorties of drugs and weapons from across the border in Bhikhwind sub division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bsf-shoots-down-five-intruders-on-indo-pak-border-in-punjab-s-tarn-taran-district/story-KQ2Y0mgO22WjCQjcmEYsbK.html

In the latest move to give a boost to the hospitality sector, restaurants and hotels may soon be allowed to serve liquor but bars will remain shut as per the direction given by the Delhi government. However, the rules and guidelines are still awaited. While some restaurateurs are delighted by the move and state that it will help the grappling restaurant industry to take the plunge and witness a growth in employment, they also feel that there is a lack of clarity over the step as official statements are anticipated.“It is a welcoming move however we are still awaiting the final go ahead in writing from the authorities. This will help the industry that has been very badly affected. Sales currently remain at a paltry 10-15 % of pre-Covid-19 levels. And by some numbers, only 18% of the restaurants have actually opened up. This move will enable more and more restaurants to take the plunge and open up, which will subsequently lead to a significant increase in employment,” says Zorawar Kalra, founder, Massive Restaurants Pvt Ltd who also expects the dinner revenue to be greatly enhanced with the inclusion of liquor.Read: Delhi restaurants, hotels allowed to serve liquor; bars stay closedWith social distancing norms in place and patrons drinking at their table, it shouldn’t be a drawback opines Riyaaz Amlani, CEO and managing director, Impresario Handmade Restaurants, that has eateries such as Social and Smoke House Deli. He says, “As long as bars are not allowed to operate and people are drinking at the table while maintaining social distancing, we don’t see an issue in the government granting liquor permissions. It will give restaurants and bars some much-needed revenue in these trying times. Without alcohol and with limited operating hours, we are looking at generating only 30-35% of revenue vis-a-vis pre-Covid numbers. This will make running restaurants more expensive than remaining shut.”Vishal Anand, director, Moonshine Food Ventures (Farzi Cafe Aerocity & Saga) is too rejoicing the positive step, as he states, “This would certainly benefit the struggling restaurant industry which is one of the biggest employers. We eagerly await the final letter from the Excise Department as this would definitely improve our sales.” Read: Hotels to open in Delhi; weekly markets on a trial basis, but not gyms, yoga centresDinesh Arora of Unplugged Courtyard is elated by the move and hopes the decision gets will be finalised soon. He says, “We are waiting for the final approval and then we can kick-start our operations to serve alcohol to our patrons on the tables.”The news brings in a sense of relief for a few restaurants as payment of fees to serve liquor for the quarter was done earlier. “The step was much needed and we hope to see a definite increase in the revenue because even when people were visiting the restaurant for dine-in, our revenue was lacking and we had already paid the excise fees for the quarter. We are looking forward to reviving the space and serving customers,” says Radhika Khandelwal, chef owner at Fig&Maple and Ivy & Bean.Read: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay sets fans on frenzy with plans of opening restaurant in IndiaFor many, it is becoming tough to meet the salaries and pay exorbitant rentals during such times so an approval is really necessary to give a boost to the industry. Akshay Anand, vice president, Delhi Restaurant & Club Association and also the founder of Ophelia and Toy Room says, “When the approval is given, restaurants will allow to start serving on the table as the bar counter will still remain non-functional to avoid the crowd, and this is being practised in Assam, Rajasthan and Punjab. It will be progressive for our industry as when we took the properties, the rents were so high that we had always kept in mind that we will be serving alcohol.”However, Yangdup Lama, founder of Sidecar and Cocktails and Dreams, Speakeasy has a difference of opinion. He asserts, “The letter also states bars are not allowed but when you apply for a license in Delhi whether it is a restaurant or a bar, it says, ‘eating house’, so it’s conflicting as how do you define whether it is a restaurant and bar while the license, lease processes, requirements are same for both.” Interact with author/sanchita_kalra.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/the-move-to-allow-restaurants-to-serve-liquor-will-help-the-grappling-industry-but-guidelines-are-still-awaited-says-restaurateurs/story-QpTX51m7LMr7ztbAbRUcgL.html
22-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid impact: Five ways this year’s Ganpati festival is different||The annual Ganpati festival is here with entire Maharashtra geared up to celebrate it. However, the festival beginning Saturday will be celebrated differently in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Here are five ways the festival is different this year: No processions: The public processions held during the first and last days of the 11-day festival will be missed on the streets in cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. The police have prohibited any processions, which are one of the highlights of the festival. No dhol-tasha performances: The processions are accompanied by dhol-tasha troupes, another integral part of the celebrations. The sound of hundreds of dhols mark the beginning and the end of festivities in Maharashtra. However, this year, the music is missing. Idols smaller in height: After the government capped the Ganpati idol height at four feet, most mandals in Mumbai and Pune decided to install smaller idols. Online darshan: To catch a glimpse of the well-known Ganapati idols like those in Lalbaugcha Raja and Dagdusheth Ganapati, devotees will have to go online instead of visiting in person. Every year, families and friends throng the pandals. Home delivery: The idols for home installation were home-delivered by sellers to avoid crowding at stalls. The goods required for pooja were also delivered at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-impact-five-ways-this-year-s-ganpati-festival-is-different/story-cZ6EntXl0ISQXpiGv86vOL.html

22-08-2020||Mumbai||Social distancing, virtual darshan: Many changes in this year’s Ganpati festival||Ganesh Chaturti celebrations will witness many changes this year. While all major Ganpati mandals have opted for virtual darshan, most city-based housing societies have decided to keep the festivities alive by observing social distancing norms. Most smaller mandals and residential complexes have built artificial ponds within their society premises in order to ensure that people don’t crowd near larger water bodies for immersion (visarjan). Many societies have also decided to bring home a smaller and eco-friendly idol to make visarjan in artificial ponds easier. The annual Ganpati visarjan procession of DSK Madhukosh Society at Sakinaka, Andheri (E) will be a low-key affair. “We will observe all government rules and regulations of social distancing and only those with masks will be allowed to enter the mandal for Ganpati darshan --- that too one at a time,” said SD Kale, treasurer of the society. He added that several society members will act as volunteers. And on Sunday, the idol will be immersed in an artificial pond built within the society premises. “Society members who have brought small Ganpati idols at their respective residences will also use the same pool to immerse idols,” added Kale. Many Ganpati mandals in the city voluntarily decided to contain Ganesh festivities this year, keeping in mind the current Covid-19 situation in the city and state. At Vile Parle, members of over 30 Ganpati mandals got together couple of months ago and decided on a three-feet idol. They agreed on immersing all the idols in an artificial pond built around their area.“Since most people will avoid taking the visarjan procession all the way to Juhu Chowpatty this year, we have already built an artificial pond close to Vile Parle fire brigade station. Many local residential complexes have also told us that they will be using the same pond for visarjan of idols on Sunday,” said Pravin Shibe, member and advisor for Vikas Mitra Mandal, Vile Parle. Shibe added that most mandals around Parle exchanged the usual 15-16 feet Ganpati idols for smaller clay idols this year. “Times are such, health and safety of people is more important than celebrations so we have decided to keep festivities also at a smaller level this time round to avoid large gathering of people,” he said. Another housing society in Kandivali (W) has encouraged society members to opt for clay Ganpati idols that could be immersed in buckets at their houses. “We decided that instead of crowding people during visarjan, every member who brings a Ganpati idol home can immerse the same in a small bucket of water at home. This water can then be used at our society garden,” said Sheela Mantri, resident and general body head of Prakruti Apartments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-distancing-virtual-darshan-many-changes-in-this-year-s-ganpati-festival/story-WAbQ0yOdQjYNuH1PCvUQ1H.html

22-08-2020||Mumbai||Ganesha mandals skirt their way around idol height cut, complaints follow||Some city-based mandals have reached out to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) alleging violation of the height restriction guideline by Sarvajanik mandals for Ganesha idols this year.On July 11, in view of rising Covid-19 cases in the state, the home department of the Maharashtra government published a notification capping the height of Ganesh idols to four-feet for Sarvajanik idols - groups that install idols along roadside pandals and capped the height of household idols to two feet.The MPCB said the height restriction was just a guideline and not a law. “Some complaints have been received where mandals, requesting anonymity since they have followed the guidelines, have objected to height violations. This is a guideline in light of the pandemic to avoid large gatherings near mandals, and it is a request to mandals to follow it but not a mandate. However, from 2021, this will become a law and will be much stricter,” said Sanjay Bhuskute, public relations officer, MPCB.The Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), umbrella body of Ganesh mandals said idol makers had raised the height of associated materials such as thrones or other platforms (such as a horse, tiger etc.) on which the idol is mounted on while keeping the height of the idol around the suggested guideline, citing it is as a loophole in the restrictions. “One or two feet here or there is not an issue but the government guideline is specific to the idol and not associated structures. Despite this, we have still requested mandals to ensure any kind of crowds are avoided and focus on online darshan,” said Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS.The umbrella body has appointed a task force of volunteers during the pandemic to ensure citizens do not face difficulties during the pandemic. The task force involves almost 500 volunteers spread across all 24 wards. BSGSS also provided 2,500 masks - 1,500 to the Mumbai police, 500 to the civic body and 500 more to its own volunteers to ensure proper personal protection over the next 11 days.“There are two issues we are facing at the moment. The first is there is no clear understanding for those residing in containment zones how their immersion procession will happen as they are allowed to bring the idol but not come out of the contained area. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is not complying with our requests,” said Dahibhavkar, adding that the second concern was regarding the accessibility to the recently increased 167 artificial immersion spots in the city. They were 32 up till last year. “Citizens have not been informed about the exact locations yet. We are hoping there will not be any confusion on the day of the immersion processions,” he said.A senior BMC official said all help would be provided to citizens. “We are discussing the process to deal with immersion at containment zones. Guidelines for this and location specific immersion sites will be released over the weekend,” the official said.Meanwhile, MPCB will be recording noise levels across 25 locations in Mumbai and 158 locations across 26 municipal corporations across the state over five immersion days. Bhuskute said from 2021 the ban on Plaster of Paris use, compulsory immersion at artificial ponds, height restrictions would be mandatory for idol makers and mandals. “They will be under scrutiny based on Central Pollution Control Board guidelines. However, it is not clear at the moment whether these guidelines will be under implementation during Maghi Ganesh Chaturthi which falls in February,” he said. Around 25 Ganesh mandals in the city, including the Goud Saraswat Brahmin (GSB) community, have deferred this year’s celebrations to February 15, 2021 in light of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ganesha-mandals-skirt-their-way-around-idol-height-cut-complaints-follow/story-Ypj2M1aodRvjXAZS9QX7oL.html

The police have not arrested the woman yet. The complainant, Dr Kavita Tilwani, 48, is a Malabar Hill resident and runs the SP Nursing Home along with her brother. In her complaint to the police, Dr Tilwani said on Monday, an eight-month pregnant patient was admitted at the nursing home for pregnancy-related complications and the next day. On Wednesday, while the patient was in her room, around 20-22 of her relatives visited the nursing home to see her. Some of them were not wearing masks, stated the police complaint. When Dr Tilwani visited the room for the patient’s check-up, she saw that the patient’s relatives were crowding the place, even as three women sat on the patient’s bed. When Dr Tilwani raised objections over it and asked them to wear masks and leave the patient’s room, a woman sitting on the patient’s bed – Nafisa Abbas Lakdawala – started abusing her and also threatened to assault her, which led to an argument between the doctor and the patient’s relatives. Soon, the other staff members of the nursing home intervened, after which the patient’s relatives left the room. Dr Tilwani complained about the incident to DB Marg police station, following which a case was registered under section 4 of the Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2010, against Lakdawala. “We would verify the allegations made in the complaint and would soon record the statement of the accused and then file a charge sheet against her at the court,” said senior inspector Suryakant Bangar of DB Marg police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/patient-s-kin-threatens-doctor-in-mumbai-for-asking-her-to-wear-mask/story-hqVltvJdkGsGxlBUW7hBXI.html
22-08-2020||City||Four staffers at Sharad Pawar’s Baramati home test positive for Covid-19||Four days after 12 staffers at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s Mumbai residence were found positive for Covid-19, four people working on the farms of his Govind Baug home at Baramati in Pune district were also tested positive for the virus on Friday. “The four are daily-wage labourers who worked at the farms of Govind Baug. They are now undergoing treatment at a local government hospital,” said an aide close to the NCP chief.According to sources, the swab samples of the four people – three men and one woman – were taken on Wednesday. Earlier, the veteran politician, his family and staffers at the Silver Oak home in south Mumbai underwent tests for Covid-19. Pawar and his family members were tested negative but after the reports of 12 of his staff members came positive, the veteran leader had decided to remain in isolation for four days. All the 12 staffers were asymptomatic and are undergoing treatment at the NSCI facility in Worli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-staffers-at-sharad-pawar-s-baramati-home-test-positive/story-rl0b5ASEafqDmpoZ0uMc1N.html
22-08-2020||Mumbai||Schools in Mumbai seek clarity on conducting first unit tests||More than two months after the new academic year began in the state, albeit virtually, schools are demanding clarity on the conduct of unit tests. Citing that the state education department has not issued any guidelines for conducting exams, schools said some instructions were necessary before they could arrive at a decision. Every year, schools conduct their first unit tests in August or September before students go on a vacation for Ganpati festival. However, this year schools began only virtually on June 15 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The education department has also slashed the syllabus by 25% for the academic year. “In the absence of any uniform guidelines from the education department, several schools have started planning tests. In some schools, not all students have access to internet and mobile phones. Hence, such students are likely to stay out of the whole process. For this, a set of common guidelines are essential,” said Rajesh Pandya, teacher at Fatimadevi High School in Malad. Schools, however, added that since they cannot reopen physically, organising exams online is the only solution. “We have no other option but to chalk out a schedule now. Unit tests are held to assess students on what they have been taught in the initial months. If it is delayed, the following assessments will also be delayed,” said the principal of a suburban school. Vishal Solanki, education commissioner, said the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training was working on the issue and will come up with a plan soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-in-mumbai-seek-clarity-on-conducting-first-unit-tests/story-IFNOcSs1b8odQTZecKq2sN.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar launches ‘e-office’; sets December 25 deadline for electronic movement of official files||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday inaugurated the ambitious e-governance project called ‘e-office’ under which the official files will be moved electronically across different departments, cutting delays and ensuring accountability. As reported in HT on August 21, Khattar said the offices of chief minister, chief secretary and finance department have already switched over to the ‘e-office’. An official spokesperson said after the launch, 20 departments and three corporations formally switched over to electronic movement of files. “The official files pertaining to the chief minister’s office (CMO), chief secretary (CS) office and the finance department will now be moved digitally,” he said. Khattar directed the officers that by September 15, ‘e-office’ should be made functional in all departments of the state. He said by December 25, all files in the offices of the state government will start moving electronically. The CM issued directions to the officers that all new files should be moved through ‘e-office’ and the old files should be digitised. Chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora said ‘e-office’ will prove to be a milestone in the history of Haryana. She assured Khattar that by December 25, which is celebrated as Good Governance Day, ‘e-office’ will be implemented in all departments across the state. She said introduction of ‘e-office’ during the Covid-19 crisis was even more important as the manual exchange of files posed risk of virus spread. Arora said that so far, 18,000 e-files of 42 departments and more than 71,000 e-receipts have been forwarded 3.8 lakh times by 7,200 users through ‘e-office’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-launches-e-office-sets-december-25-deadline-for-electronic-movement-of-official-files/story-ysABnApU1xlzAoHPsbLzBL.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||HC restrains Railways from razing 1,000 houses in Faridabad colony||The Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained the Railways from dispossession of residents and demolition of 1,000 odd houses in Sant Nagar locality of Faridabad. The high court bench of Justice GS Sandhawalia acted on the plea of Chandan Singh and 195 others, the residents who had approached the court challenging August 14 notices of railway administration affixed on houses and in the colony about demolition to be carried out on August 22. While restraining against demolition and dispossession of residents, the HC has sought response from Haryana, Railways and Centre by September 7. Their counsel Vaibhav Jain said the notices were the result of an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in October 2018 directing the Railways to form a special task force (STF) to remove occupation from the railway land. Sant Nagar Colony is an identified slum and in existence since 60s. In 2016, the area was selected to be developed as a ‘Smart Slum’ and ₹12 crore was allotted by Faridabad Smart City Limited for the development of area, Jain said, adding that the development works regarding water supply, sewerage, drainage, road improvement, community toilet, landscaping, and smart solar LED streetlights were started in 2018 and currently underway. The colony has a population of approximately 2,500, he said. The court was told that the ‘cryptic’ notice affixed in the locality does not mention a date or any issuing authority. Furthermore, the petitioners were never granted personal hearing which is in total violation of principle of natural justice. Petitioners have not been told as to how they are in unauthorised occupation since they have electricity and sewerage connections, and the land belongs to various authorities apart from the Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-restrains-railways-from-razing-1-000-houses-in-faridabad-colony/story-wPs4ubrzyHQFAikzwfsGMN.html
22-08-2020||City||Poor planning, administrative apathy held Rohtak back from faring better than Karnal: Residents||Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s home city Rohtak has ranked 35th in the Swachh Survekshan 2020, lagging behind chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s Karnal in cities with population between 1 lakh to 10 lakh.Karnal performed better than Rohtak and secured 17th slot. Even though Rohtak jumped to 35th position from last year’s 69th rank, locals are of view that this city has more potential than Karnal. Rohtak failed to perform better due to administrative apathy, they say. Rohtak had grabbed 89th spot in 2018 and 295th rank in 2017.Rohtak MLA BB Batra of the Congress pinned the blame on district administration and political indifference for Rohtak’s poor performance.“The main factors are poor segregation and sanitation in the city. Residents are forced to consume contaminated water and this is a crime, which is being committed by the local municipal corporation. The water supply tanks are yet to be cleaned and interior roads are in poor condition,” he added. “The administration has failed to utilise ₹13 crore properly, which was released through Amrit Yojana. Karnal has been developed as a cleaner city than Rohtak in the past years as chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar represents that constituency,” the MLA said. “In Karnal, the chief minister has been allocating more funds than our city,” he added. Pratap Singh, a retired principal from Rohtak, attributed the reason of city’s poor performance than Karnal to faulty planning. “Water supply lines in most of the colonies are damaged and roads are in bad shape. The GPS tracking of garbage collection vehicles and maintenance of public places and toilets need to be taken seriously. People in Rohtak are not getting clean drinking water,” he added.Rohtak additional deputy commissioner Mahender Pal, however, focussed on how the city has improved its rank from 295 in 2017 to 35 this year.“Due to the efforts of municipal corporation, administration, and citizens, our city’s ranking jumped to 35 from last year’s 69. Our roads and streets are clean and the garbage collection facility is excellent. The civic bodies’ vehicles have been collecting garbage from doorsteps,” he added. ‘We are ready to accept our mistakes’Rohtak mayor Manmohan Goyal said the city lagged behind Karnal as it performed poor on four parameters.“We will have to set up a crushing plant in Rohtak so that debris can be used again. We will have to stop people from throwing construction waste on the roadsides. The swachh survekshan indictated that Rohtak has poor waste management and segregation. We are ready to accept our mistakes and will try to improve the ranking next year,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poor-planning-administrative-apathy-held-rohtak-back-from-faring-better-than-karnal-residents/story-agkFoA3yzboo6wkAJaIX4L.html
22-08-2020||Mumbai||Convert Covid-19 beds to non-Covid for monsoon-related ailments: Mumbai civic corporation to private hospitals||To ensure that those suffering from monsoon-related ailments like malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid, gastroenteritis and cholera receive proper medical treatment, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has directed all private nursing homes, clinics and dispensaries to use Covid beds for non-Covid patients.BMC deputy executive health officer Daksha Shah said, “The process of Covid patients being admitted in jumbo facilities has been simplified and there are enough beds in Covid care facilities for Covid cases. Directing small nursing homes to convert beds from Covid to non-Covid is more of a preventive measure.”Jumbo facilities were earlier conceptualised and built by BMC as Covid care centres (CCC-1 and CCC-2) to quarantine high-risk contacts and asymptomatic patients.They were then converted into dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) with oxygen beds, and dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) with ICU beds.As of August 19, the total hospital-bed capacity for Covid patients in the city was 17, 331 of which 9,236 beds are vacant. BMC has an additional 2,347 beds in CCC-2 facilities and 50,077 beds in CCC-1 facilities.As per data provided by BMC, until August 16, there were 592 cases of malaria and five cases of dengue. A senior civic official said, “It is noted that the highest number of malaria cases are reported in August and September every year. It is important to keep the health facilities well-equipped to handle such cases for the next few months.”Meanwhile on Friday, Mumbai reported 1,406 new Covid-19 cases, its highest single-day figure in August. The previous highest daily surge was on July 26 when the city saw 1,476 cases. Forty-two deaths on Friday took the total toll to 7,356. Of the 134,228 total Covid-19 cases recorded in the city so far, 18,299 are active cases. The case fatality ratio is 5.4%, and the recovery rate stands at 80%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/convert-covid-19-beds-to-non-covid-for-monsoon-related-ailments-mumbai-civic-corporation-to-private-hospitals/story-iWNB435asffx5WV6XM2hjM.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Covid count hits new high of 1,203||Haryana reported 1,203 new coronavirus infections on Friday, about 77% of which came from 11 districts. The new infections pushed the state’s patient tally to 52,129. Seven infected persons died of the contagion, taking the death toll to 585. Among those who died on Friday, two persons were from Kurukshetra district while one each was from Bhiwani, Panipat, Palwal, Karnal and Faridabad. As per a medical bulletin, 620 people recovered from the viral illness on Friday, taking the total number of recoveries to 43,413. The number of active cases in Haryana was 8,131 on Friday. About 39% of the new infections were reported from five national capital region districts of Faridabad (127), Gurugram (120), Rewari (111), Rohtak (65) and Sonepat (46). Six northern Haryana districts of Panipat (132), Ambala (98), Karnal (73), Kurukshetra (63), Yamunanagar (58) and Panchkula (43) threw up 38% of the new infections. In order to contain the virus spread, the state government on Friday ordered that all public and private offices, except those dealing with essential services, and all shopping malls and shops in the market area, except those dealing with essential goods and services, will remain shut on Saturday and Sunday. An official spokesperson said all other national directives and standard operating procedures issued by the National Disaster Management Authority that are currently in force will continue to be followed. The spokesperson said this order will have no effect on public and private transport and on tests/exams being conducted by the Haryana Public Service Commission and the Haryana Staff Selection Commission. Among the other districts, Mahendergarh reported 58 new infections followed by Hisar (56), Sirsa (48), Bhiwani (24), Fatehabad (21), Palwal (19), Kaithal (14), Jhajjar (12), Nuh (9) and Jind (6). Health dept puts price cap on Covid testsThe Haryana health department on Friday fixed prices for rapid antigen and immunoglobulin- enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (IgG-ELISA) tests conducted by the private laboratories for detection of coronavirus antigen and antibodies. In an order issued on Friday by additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora, the price for rapid antigen test was fixed at ₹650 per test and that of IgG-ELISA was fixed at ₹250 per test. The department had in June fixed ₹2,400 for conducting the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for detection of coronavirus infection by private labs. While nasal and throat swab samples are taken for the rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, the IgG-ELISA test is a blood-based examination for detection of immunoglobulin antibodies. ACS Arora said the decision to cap the test prices was made on the advice of the experts, after taking the cost of testing kits and consumables into account and on the basis of precedents in other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-covid-count-hits-new-high-of-1-203/story-YZ9dFgoYDTyEzMqAoEJ5OI.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||PTIs recruitment: HC dismisses plea against exam||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday dismissed pleas against August 23 exam being conducted in Haryana for the recruitment of physical training instructors (PTIs) in state schools.The pleas were dismissed after the state government listed out arrangements made by the authorities to accommodate 9,500 applicants.The petition had stated that some of the petitioners were suffering from chronic diseases while three of them were Covid-19 positive and in view of the lockdown imposed by the state, they would not be in a position to appear in the examination.However, the secretary, Haryana Staff Selection Commission, had told the court that the apex court had directed to complete the entire process of examination within a period of five months from the date commission starts working on it.Ninety-five centres have been set up in five districts whereas in normal conditions, the test would have been held at one station only.Each centre has been allotted only 100 candidates where apart from maintaining social distancing while entering the examination centre, it has also been ensured that one examination centre will not have more than 100 candidates whereas the minimum sitting capacity ranges from 240 to 600 candidates, the court was informed.The court was also told that two schools have been kept in reserve in each district so as to meet any sudden exigency on account of any centre falling in containment zone.“The candidates, who have symptoms of fever, cough and cold, would be made to sit in a separate room,” the court was told adding that all guidelines issued by the Centre are being complied with and transportation arrangements for the candidates have also been made.“The public interest for conducting the examination on the scheduled date far outweighs the convenience of the petitioners. The unfortunate circumstances of some of the petitioners cannot be a ground to postpone the examination wherein about 9,500 candidates have to appear,” the bench of Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal said, while dismissing the pleas.The recruits are to replace about 1,900 teachers whose appointment was set aside by the apex court on April 8 and the state was asked to complete process within five months.A single judge bench of high court had in September 2012 set aside the selection of these teachers made by the commission in 2010. They were recruited in pursuance to a 2006 advertisement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ptis-recruitment-hc-dismisses-plea-against-exam/story-E7hobQjxRzaL595D582hNP.html

Also, four policemen succumbed to the virus on Thursday.With the new cases, the total number of infected policemen in state has reached 13,180. Of this, 10,655 have recovered. There are 2,389 policemen who are active patients and are being treated at various medical facilities, a statement issued by Vinayak Deshmukh, assistant inspector general of police (law and order), Maharashtra police, said.Of the four Covid deaths in the last 24 hours, three were from Mumbai police.Head constable Ravikant Salunkhe, 52, of Cuffe Parade police station died on Thursday. “Salukhe was undergoing treatment at the Nagpada’s Richardson & Cruddas Covid Care Centre and breathed his last on Thursday. He did not have any co-morbidities. He was a good policeman,” said Rajkumar Dongre, senior inspector of Cuffe Parade police station. Salunkhe is survived by his wife and two kids.Early on Thursday, 54-year-old police inspector Vishwanath Tambe of Mulund police station succumbed to the infection. He was holding charge of administration at the police station.“Tambe had some co-morbidities and succumbed to the virus during treatment,” confirmed Lakhmi Gautam, additional commissioner of police (East region).Another police officer who lost life to Coronavirus was also from the east region police. Thirty-five-year-old police sub-inspector Vinayak Babar from Deonar police station died of Covid-19 on Thursday early morning.Babar had been tested around 10 days ago after he developed Covid symptoms. On August 9, he tested positive for Covid-19. He was admitted to Dr D Y Patil hospital in Nerul, Navi Mumbai for treatment.As his condition deteriorated, he was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) on Wednesday where he died a day later.“Babar was a good detection officer and was very active. The entire police station is shocked as he was so young,” said Vishwapal Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police (Deonar division).A native of Pune’s Purander district Babar was a resident of Kamothe, Navi Mumbai. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. His parents live with his brother’s family in Pune.In the fourth fatality, police Naik Shrikant Wagh died at the Shivaji hospital. Wagh was attached to the Kalwa police station of Thane police.On Friday morning, the state police headquarter received news about the death of head constable Gajendra Kamble from Rasayni police station of Raigad district on August 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/303-cops-test-positive-for-covid-19-highest-in-24-hours-in-maharashtra/story-eK4zT0uQ0iO47fOap0BJnN.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||HT Explainer: Haryana’s private sector job quota law and its fate||The emotive private sector job quota issue in Haryana has become the centerpiece of a debate after an ordinance approved by the BJP-JJP cabinet was reserved for the consideration of the President by the Haryana governor. Steered by BJP’s coalition partner, Dushyant Chautala’s JJP, the proposed law is a politically sensitive matter. Assistant editor Hitender Rao tries to explain the repercussions associated with it. What’s private sector job quota ordinanceIt provides for 75% of the new employment to local candidates for jobs having monthly salary less than ₹50,000 in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms and partnership firms situated in Haryana. Why has governor reserved it for consideration of PresidentHe has acted on the advice of the legal remembrancer. The law officer had advised that the ordinance be reserved for the consideration of the President as it provides for an overriding effect over other laws and has the potential to be repugnant to an act of the parliament. Constitutional validity of the proposed law Since it provides for preference in jobs to local candidates domiciled in Haryana, the ordinance is believed to be in contravention of Articles 14 and 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. Article 14 pertains to equality before law and Article 19 (1) (g) provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Why deputy CM Dushyant Chautala wants to table a replica bill in assemblyThe replica bill will replace the ordinance. If passed by the assembly, the bill will be sent to the governor, who will also have to reserve it for the consideration of the President.Implications of reserving the ordinance/billArticle 201 of the Constitution says that the President can either declare that he assents to the proposed law or that he withholds assent. The President can also direct the governor to return it to the House for reconsideration. Is there a time limit for the President to make decisionThe Constitution does not provide a time limit for the President to assent to a bill or withhold it. Political implications if enactment of the law gets delayed It will be seen as a loss of face for Dushyant Chautala’s JJP, which had made a poll promise to implement it. Viewpoint of BJP-led CentreAt least two then Union ministers, CR Chaudhary and Vijay Sampla, had answered in negative to Parliament questions about the possibility of reservation in appointments in private companies. Will the ordinance/bill withstand judicial scrutiny Law experts say the proposed law will not pass the legal test. Former Haryana advocate general Ashok Aggarwal says that domicile can never form the basis of employment. As per him, if public employment cannot be given on the basis of domicile, how can private jobs be. The government is not the employer in private sector jobs, he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-explainer-haryana-s-private-sector-job-quota-law-and-its-fate/story-8T3S0xR6JvSR9jxfsBKNnO.html
22-08-2020||Mumbai||Study: Sars-CoV-2 can infect pregnant women’s placenta||A new study, jointly conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) at Parel and Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has shown that the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can infect the placenta in pregnant women. The authors said their work is the first in-depth survey to identify the cellular basis of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the human placenta, and therefore assumes importance because it will help to establish the fact that cross transmission from the infected mothers to the children is possible. Analysing a database of RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequences of human placenta, the eight-member team said there is strong likelihood that the novel coronavirus infection can be passed on to the foetus because the placental cells possess the same receptors that the Sars-CoV-2 virus uses to attach itself in throat and lungs cells of Covid-19 patients. Since the global outbreak of the pandemic, the scientific community has been trying to establish whether Sars-CoV-2 can infect placenta. In Maharashtra, more than 15,000 pregnant women have contracted Covid-19 since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus infection in March, of which new born babies were diagnosed with Covid-19 in less than 1% of the cases. However, the researchers plan clinical studies to test placenta of Covid-19 pregnant women for conclusive evidence. “During pregnancy, the foetus is protected from maternal infections by the placenta. The placenta is an organ that develops during pregnancy and provides oxygen and nutrients to the growing baby, removes waste products and also blocks transmission of the infections from mother to the baby by creating a barrier,” said Dr Deepak Modi, head of Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory, ICMR-NIRRH. “However, the barrier can break if placental cells get infected, leading to mother-to-child transmission,” said Dr Modi, who was a part of the study. The study ‘Single-Cell RNA-seq Identifies Cell Subsets in Human Placenta That highly Expresses Factors Driving Pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2’ was published in Frontiers of Cell and Developmental Biology journal on August 19. The team conducted a secondary data study from an existing database of placental cell RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) sequences (published from the USA) to find if the RNA for coronavirus receptors are present in the placental cells. RNA is ribonucleic acid that is essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. While the current assumption is that there is no vertical transmission of the virus from the infected mother to the foetus, researchers found the presence of the virus in 12% of the 93 infected women from other published literature in the UK and US. They came to this conclusion after a systematic analysis said Anshul Bhide a co-first author in the study. The team found that cells of the placenta express ACE2 receptors – the same receptor that the Sars-CoV-2 virus uses to enter the cells in the throat and lungs of an individual who is infected with the novel coronavirus. “Additionally, the placental cells also express another novel coronavirus receptor called BSG or CD147. We also found that the placenta has receptors of other coronaviruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)”, said Nancy Ashary, the first author of the study. “For the virus to enter inside the cells, the Spike protein (also called as S protein) of the virus has to get sliced, which occurs by the use of enzymes called TMPRSS2 and cathepsin. We have found that along with ACE2, the cells of the placenta express the enzymes TMPRSS2, cathepsins and furin. These results provide strong evidence for the possibility of Sars-CoV-2 to infect the placenta,” said Dr Modi. The study also shows that if the virus enters the placental cells it will reproduce inside them as these cells have the necessary machinery for viral replication. These results imply that the placenta can not only get infected with the virus, but will also spread around locally. “There is a strong likelihood that if the placenta harbours viral infection it may be passed to the baby. Sars-CoV-2 is not a blood borne virus. But if in some cases the virus seeps into the mother’s blood, it will reach the placenta disseminating infection,” said Modi. With the identification of viral receptors in placenta, researchers have suggested that obstetricians need to closely monitor the infected pregnant women and study the placenta carefully since the possibility of the presence of the virus may not be as rare as it is believed to be. “We often hear that newborns have been diagnosed with Covid-19, but we don’t know the source of infection. It can be through the infected mother but also through horizontal transmission ie. hospital acquired infection,” said Dr Smita Mahale, Director, ICMR-NIRRH. “Just like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests that help diagnose the presence of Sars-CoV-2, we plan to test placentas to identify the virus.”Mohit Kumar Jolly, co-author and assistant professor, Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering, IISC, said, “Our study clearly shows that the organ (placenta) has molecular structures which get attached to the virus. There is also a possibility that the infection can spread to other parts of the body through placenta due to the presence of certain cells. But since this is a secondary data based study, we can’t say what percent of women in India are getting Covid-19 infection in their placenta.” Dr Aparna Hedge, head, division of urogynaecology at Cama Hospital, Grant Medical College, who was not a part of the study, said, “Even though it is not a clinical study, it provides a perspective of the possible spread of the virus in placenta. There have been several debates on it but no scientifically proven evidence is available. We need more clinical-based studies to establish any fact.” “The pilot results from the study are likely to be of immense help in understanding the role of Sars-CoV-2 infection of the human placenta and its consequences on pregnancy outcome and vertical transmission. Their study is amply supported by another recent publication ‘The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs by single-cell transcriptome study’. This ACE2 expression was still detected at 24 weeks of gestation. The high expression of ACE2 in these cells suggests that the placenta has the potential to be infected by Sars-CoV-2 and may cause placental dysfunction and pregnancy complications,” said Surendra Sharmam, director, Center of Excellence for Reproductive Health, Women and Infants Hospital, Brown University and editor-in-chief, American Journal of Reproductive Immunology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/study-sars-cov-2-can-infect-pregnant-women-s-placenta/story-h6xHnKDD1ECRXoCxGM9RhK.html

22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Illegal road tax collection on Haryana borders: Transport minister orders probe||Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma on Friday said shops have been opened on interstate borders where motor vehicle tax is being collected illegally. “Some people have opened private shops (kiosks) illegally in the areas of Haryana bordering Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh for depositing motor vehicle tax online,” the minister said. “They take money from the vehicle owners and give them a false receipt, but do not deposit the money in the state government’s treasury. A probe has been ordered,” he added. Sharma said such irregularities were detected during the checking of vehicles. Otherwise, he said, such malpractices are difficult to detect. Due to this, the state government faces losses and the vehicle owners are cheated too, he added. The transport minister said an inquiry has been ordered after a case in question was detected. He said strict action will be taken against those involved in fraud committed in the name of depositing motor vehicle tax (road tax) online. A case has also been registered in Bawal police station of Rewari district. A person had complained that on August 18, he deposited a tax of ₹8,500 for Rajasthan at a shop. The alleged accused gave him a receipt after taking money. However, when the bus reached Jaipur and documents were checked, no record of the said receipt was found and the receipt turned out to be fake. The transport minister said strict action will be taken against the accused in cases of tax evasion and fraud with vehicle owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-road-tax-collection-on-haryana-borders-transport-minister-orders-probe/story-ienKXfl4sXZHnnwVBaSO6J.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Parents protest outside Ludhiana school over fee payment||: Over 150 parents of students from Green Land Convent School, Chander Nagar, Civil City, protested against the school authorities on Friday for asking them to submit all charges including admission fee and transportation charges.The school authorities announced summer break from August 1 and decided to resume online classes from August 20, Thursday. They informed parents regarding the online classes, but sent the link to only those who deposited the fee. Following this, parents gathered outside the school and tried to meet the principal. When the school authorities refused to let them enter the premises, parents started protesting and raised slogans against school authorities for two hours. Many parents said they have faced financial losses amid the Covid-19 lockdown, due to which they have been unable to pay the fee. The parents said they want to request the authorities to waive off admission and transportation fee and other charges. Amit Khanna, a parent, said, “My children study in Classes 3 and 6. I visited the school to ask school authorities to waive off charges other than tuition fee. In this time of financial crisis, we are unable to pay the other charges but school authorities are not ready to cooperate. We received a message from school that online classes will be started from August 20. When we did not receive the link, we contacted the class teacher, to which she replied that students will be allowed to attend online classes only if they pay fee.”Another parent, Anny, a housewife, said, “We are ready to pay the tuition fee, but the authorities must waive off the other charges. The school authorities have asked parents to submit transportation fee and other development charges. My daughter studies in Class 3 and the authorities have asked us to deposit Rs 25,000, which includes all charges, only then she will be allowed to attend online classes.” School director, Rajesh Rudra, said, “We are just abiding the Punjab and Haryana high court’s orders which allows the school authorities to charge tuition fee and admission charges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-protest-outside-ludhiana-school-over-fee-payment/story-GSoaHNAJ7CI4ek74buUgoO.html
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Vaccinate livestock to prevent disease outbreak: Ludhiana vet varsity experts||With recent reports of illnesses among livestock at various dairy farms in Punjab with symptoms of respiratory problems and fever, experts of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University have advised owners to vaccinate the livestock against HS and FMD oil adjuvant vaccine for long term immunity, preferably with combined vaccine . Since the prevailing hot and humid climatic conditions are favourable for the growth of microorganisms, this can result in disease outbreaks, leading to sickness and high mortality of valuable dairy animals, causing huge economic losses to farmers. Scientists of animal disease research centre of GADVASU also investigated the outbreak of respiratory infection with high mortality at Khanna. Farmers have also been advised to provide fresh fodder and concentrate depending on the production, age and reproductive condition of bovines. Experts also advised farmers to keep animals at comfortable distance in airy and ventilated sheds. This weather is also favourable for the growth of fungus. Therefore, farmer should check that mould infested feed and fodder is not fed to livestock and feed and feed ingredients should be kept in a dry place. If urea was applied in fodder field then farmers were advised not to use this fodder minimum one week for animal consumption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vaccinate-livestock-to-prevent-disease-outbreak-ludhiana-vet-varsity-experts/story-wjYl8DrdpY18zcFHph88zK.html
22-08-2020||City||Markets in Kalyan-Dombivli limits witness crowding despite rise in Covid-19 cases||Despite the high number of Covid-19 cases in Kalyan and Dombivli, the markets at Shivaji Chowk and Phadke Road in the twin cities were crowded on Friday, with residents stepping out for festival purchasing on the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi. All the shops were open and hawkers selling flowers and other items required for the religious rituals on the footpaths. Many were without masks and did not adhere to the social distancing norms, either, raising concerns among activists and experts. “The markets in the city were completely crowded on Friday, with people flouting all the norms. When the civic body planned to open shops on all the days, they should have monitored the situation. KDMC has the highest number of cases in MMR. The cases will increase in the coming days, “said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Alert Citizens Forum, Kalyan. Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) on Friday recorded the highest daily surge of 424 for the month of August. KDMC also has the highest number of Covid-19 cases (28,829) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, positive cases as per the state government records. The active cases in KDMC stand at 3,168 reveal the civic body records. KDMC epidemic officer, Pratibha Panpatil said, “There was a spike in the positive cases on Friday due to the increased in the number of tests as well as the reopening of shops on all the days. There is a rise in the movement of the people on the streets and this will lead to a surge in the cases in the coming days. We are taking precautionary measures to deal with the situation.” According to Rakesh Mutha, president of Kalyan Shahar Vyapari Mahasangh, a traders’ body, the organisation complained to the civic body against permitting hawkers to sell. “All the retailers are taking the necessary precautions. However, on Friday, the hawkers were allowed to conduct business, due to which the streets were crowded. We have complained to the civic body against giving permissions to hawkers, as it leads to crowding and there is no control on the crowd, “said Mutha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markets-in-kalyan-dombivli-limits-witness-crowding-despite-rise-in-covid-19-cases/story-bBYkJcAp8MEhpqtoaI5buK.html
22-08-2020||Mumbai||Dadar market crowding raises fears of second Covid-19 wave in Mumbai||On the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi, hundreds of Mumbaiites threw caution to wind as they ignored social distancing norms and flocked Dadar market on Friday. Significantly, the G-North ward, which includes Dadar market, has the highest active Covid-19 cases (1,001) in Mumbai. The ward has reported more than 7,000 Covid cases since the outbreak of the pandemic in March. It was one of the major hot spots in Mumbai till June.Dadar market, one of the oldest and biggest wholesale markets in Mumbai, was partially shut down in April, when Covid-19 cases in Mumbai had started to rise. However, the market has gradually reopened over the past few weeks as part of the state government’s plan to resume economic activities and ease lockdown curbs. Chennai had witnessed a similar situation when more than 2,000 people contracted the Covid-19 infection from a crowded market in Koyambedu in May, after which it was shut down.While Covid-19 cases in Mumbai have plateaued over the past month, with less than 1,000 cases being reported on most days, Friday’s crowding at Dadar market has raised a red flag among health experts, who said the city could face a second wave of Covid-19 infections in the absence of stricter regulations. “Mumbai is not Covid-free. There are still infected people among us. In such a situation, opening up markets will add to the chaos. Considering Dadar is one of the biggest markets in Mumbai, the civic body should have been more patient. Now that people are thinking that the situation is better, they are flocking the market before Ganesh Chaturthi,” said Jitendra Tandel, secretary of Rugna Kalyan Seva Samajik Sanstha, a patients’ rights organisation. “Covid-19 is an extremely infectious disease. In 80% of the cases, its source of infection hasn’t been identified. In such a situation, the decision of the civic body to lift the lockdown in Dadar market is premature. Officers thought that due to rainfall and restrictions on local trains, people won’t flock the market,” said a senior BMC official. BMC officials now plan to seek help from Mumbai Police to ensure there is no crowding during the 11-day Ganesotsav that begins on Saturday.“As the market sells essential commodities of Ganesh Chaturthi, people rushed to the market from neighbouring areas. We are also in shock seeing the huge gathering. People need to be more responsible. They are not only risking their lives but also of others around them. We have no option but to seek help from police,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner in-charge of G-North. A police officer from Dadar police station said there were no directions for people to stay indoors or shops to be shut. “In such a situation it is not possible to control the crowd like the one at Dadar flower market,” said the officer. “In Dadar alone there are more than 3,000 household Ganpatis and more than 61 sarvajanik Ganpati mandals. The market also sees a floating population, which is not possible to control. We removed hawkers from the area, but that does not guarantee crowd control.”Health experts said it is a cause for concern and could lead to further spread of Covid-19. “This infection spreads like a chain. So, to control the pandemic, we have to cut the chain. For that we have to maintain social distancing, which is not possible in a crowded market like Dadar. This may lead to a second wave of infections,” said a city-based epidemiologist, who did not wish to be named. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC said the ward officer will pay a visit to the market and a decision will be taken accordingly. “We have already spoken to the police for their help,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dadar-market-crowding-raises-fears-of-second-covid-19-wave-in-mumbai/story-kXTIOHvic7az6fafwKtEzI.html

22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Markets to remain shut in Chandigarh on weekends||Reacting to weekend restrictions imposed in Punjab and Haryana in the wake of surge in Covid-19 cases, the Chandigarh administration too swung into action on Friday night, ordering closure of all shops and malls this Saturday and Sunday. The restrictions have been imposed “till further orders” though a review will be done on Monday.All government offices, including the Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA), will also remain closed during the weekend. “However, restaurants, hotels and private offices can remain open during the weekend. The decision will be reviewed on Monday,” said UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida. The order also does not affect those providing essential goods, such as medicines, groceries, milk and vegetables. However, liquor shops remain closed.Parida said there will be no change in curfew timings, which will continue to be in force from 10pm to 5am. “There will be no ban on movement of people during the weekend,” he said.“Chandigarh too announces weekend lockdown in tandem with Haryana and Punjab in hope to break the chain of virus in tricity; onus now again on the people to act responsibly and understand the gravity of the situation. Keep following the health advisories,” wrote UT administrator VPS Badnore on Twitter.‘Didn’t want people to rush to UT’Significantly, in Friday’s war room meeting, which was held in the afternoon, the administration didn’t take a decision on the issue of fresh restrictions. The decision came only after Haryana’s orders came out in the evening. Haryana had on Friday announced that all offices and shops except essential services will remain shut on weekends while the Punjab government had on Thursday ordered extension of weekend lockdown with daily night curfew from 7pm to 5am in the state.“With both Punjab and Haryana imposing weekend restrictions, we didn’t want to people to rush to Chandigarh for their weekend purchases. So, the decision was taken late night,” said Parida.The total tally of positive cases stands at 2,631 in Chandigarh. On Friday, 116 fresh cases were reported in the city.The UT had on July 20 suggested to both Punjab and Haryana to impose weekend curfew in the tricity, but both states had responded in the negative. Consequently, the administration didn’t impose the proposed weekend curfew in the city, though it had introduced other restrictions like closing down of Sukhna Lake on weekends. It had also reintroduced odd-even formula for opening of congested markets, which primarily included all rehri markets, motor markets and some internal markets of sectors.FOUR NEW MICRO-CONTAINMENT ZONESThe administration on Friday declared four new micro-containment zones.These include a block of 11 houses from No. 491 to 495 and No. 501 to 506 in Sector 15, a block of 32 flats from No. 6445 to 6448-C and No. 6449 to 6452-C in Sector 56, and a block of six houses from No. 1613 to 1618 (ground floors only) in Sector 40.

22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Now, track Chandigarh Transport Undertaking buses live on mobile phone||Now commuters in the city will be able to track the movement of Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU)’s local fleet on their mobiles.UT administrator VPS Badnore on Friday launched the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), as part of which a mobile application, “trycityBUS”, has also been made available to commuters. By downloading it, they can get information about timings, fare and routes of buses besides location of nearby bus stops. They can know the exact location and timings of the buses and alternative routes available for their travel.In the first phase, the ITS has been introduced in 100 buses covering 14 routes. CTU plans to cover the entire fleet of 350 buses on 64 routes by the end of the year.₹25-CRORE PROJECTThe World Bank-sponsored project, costing the administration around ₹25 crore, aims to modernise the transport system, wherein CTU services have been upgraded with IT-enabled solutions.There will be four cameras inside each bus to monitor the behaviour of the crew and passengers. The fleet will be monitored in the Central Control Room of CTU though global positioning system.An emergency button (panic button) will be available, both for the driver and the passengers to solicit urgent help from the police and ambulance, if needed. The digital system will enable the administration to monitor the exact location of buses, collection of revenue and the load of passengers on each route.There will be digital display of the timings of the buses at each bus queue shelter. Passenger’s information display screens have also been installed at Inter-State Bus Terminals (ISBT) in Sectors 17 and 43, railway station and 12 other bus queue shelters in different locations.“It is a big step for the tricity’s public transport system. It will attract more commuters to public transport and help reduce traffic congestion. We will be integrating the entire CTU fleet of local buses with the ITS by the end of the year,” said Uma Shankar Gupta, director, transport.After the work on both the software and hardware components of the system was completed in early March, the final trials were started. The trials were to be completed by March 18, and the system was to be launched on April 1.

This is the fourth lake to overflow this monsoon. Earlier, Tulsi and Vehar lakes at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) had overflowed, followed by Modak Sagar lake. However, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has not yet taken a decision on revoking the 10% water cut , after it had earlier said it will re-examine the 10% cut once the lake levels cross 90%.As of Friday morning, Mumbai’s lake levels are at 90.88%, in comparison to 94.91% on the same day in 2019, and 93.91% in 2018. The seven lakes have 1,315,423 million litres of useful water content.On Friday, the water cut in Mumbai was reduced to 10%, from the earlier 20% imposed on August 5 due to low rainfall in catchment areas.

22-08-2020||Mumbai||Parth’s comments are his personal opinion: Rohit Pawar||Rohit Pawar, Karjat-Jamkhed member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) and grand-nephew of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, said he disagreed with the views shared by his cousin Parth Pawar, over the probe in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case.On Friday, Rohit, the son of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, suggested that Parth was simply expressing his own opinion when he tweeted regarding the case. “Tweeting something means, a person is expressing his own opinion. But I have full faith in the Mumbai Police, Rohit told a Marathi news channel on Friday.Rohit was responding to a question on Parth’s reaction to the Supreme Court decision to hand the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).He also came down heavily on opposition parties, saying that their politics over Rajput’s death case brought a bad name to the Mumbai Police. “The opposition parties are playing politics in Sushant Singh Rajput case. Currently, education and health are important issues and need to be discussed. The opposition is opposing only because that’s what they are supposed to do,” Rohit said.Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope denied any conflict within the Pawar family. “Even if there would be anything, it would be temporary in nature and would be resolved within the family,” Tope told reporters in Pune. He also said the Pawars are an ideal family in the country and should be taken as an example.Parth has demanded a CBI investigation into the high-profile case – a move that went against the stand taken by NCP. For this, he was also publicly rebuked by the NCP chief. Pawar had called him “immature” and had also said he does not pay attention to what Parth says.“We give no importance to what my grand-nephew says. He is immature,” Pawar told media persons on August 12.Since then, there have been speculations that Parth is unhappy and may quit the NCP. He has also held meetings with other members of the Pawar family over quitting the party.Soon after the Apex court decided to hand the case over to the CBI, Parth in a tweet said, “Satyamev Jayate” (truth alone triumphs). The tweet made no mention of the case but it is assumed that he is referring to the SC judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parth-s-comments-are-his-personal-opinion-rohit-pawar/story-cnfPTq8lrnNYOrDjfgjrxJ.html
22-08-2020||Delhi||New safety guidelines as hotels, weekly markets set to open in Delhi||The Delhi government on Friday notified its decisions to allow hotels and local weekly markets to operate and issued standard operating procedures (SOP) for both, which include mandatory wearing of masks, strict social distancing and availability of hand sanitisers.Starting Monday, weekly markets will be allowed on an experimental basis for a week, between 4 pm and 10 pm. The markets will be allowed to continue after an assessment on August 31, a senior government official said. Both hotels and weekly markets cannot operate from containment zones.The government on Friday issued another notification, winding up all Covid-19 health centres set up at banquet halls to augment bed capacity when the number of cases rose sharply in June.The Delhi government’s SOPs are much in line with the guidelines issued by the central government for hotels and markets across the city. HT has seen the official orders pertaining to both hotels and weekly markets.RULES FOR HOTELSThe government has asked hotel managements to ensure hand sanitisers are available in entry points where all guests and employees will be screened and asymptomatic individuals will be allowed inside. Other measures include mandatory wearing of masks for employees and guests; rearrangement of seats in the lobby, restaurants, and other common areas to ensure social distancing; and prohibition of gatherings. Luggage will disinfected before being taken to rooms and immediate travel history and medical conditions of guests will be recorded. Guests will have to sign self-declaration forms and submit photo identity proof.Hotels have also been directed to impose restrictions on number on people who can board elevators at any given point; issue disposable menus and encourage takeaway orders and room service instead of dine-in; and ensure periodic sanitisation of all washrooms and rooms after guests leave.Aged employees or those on high risk because of health conditions should be encouraged to work from home.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday met members of hotel associations. “All stakeholders have to work together to strengthen Delhi’s economy. I want to thank the entire hotel industry because when Covid was at its peak, hotels supported us in enhancing the capacity of beds for treatment of patients. All hospitals, hotels, and religious and social organisations supported us in our efforts. Today, our situation is under control. I am happy that since we have lifted the lockdown, we have not felt the need to impose the lockdown again.”A spokesperson of Marriott group said: “We welcome the government’s decision to open hotels. All our hotels will abide by the state SOPs along with our internal SOPs that cater to enhanced hygiene and cleanliness measures. We see social distancing manifest itself in a big way when it comes to the operational and service-driven aspects of hospitality.”Sandeep Khandelwal of the Delhi hotel owners’ association welcomed the notification, saying the chief minister’s decision had saved thousands of jobs in the industryWEEKLY MARKETSAccording to the guidelines, weekly markets can operate only between 4 pm and 10 pm and vendors cannot use more than 24 square feet area for their shops, which will be separated by at least one metre. Shop owners will have to set up temporary hand wash points and keep sanitisers. Shops will not be allowed to keep carry bags of plastic or any other material.Masks are a must for all vendors and customers. Vendors will wear gloves too and shops will refrain from entertaining more than two customers at any given point, the SOPs say.Around 2,700 locations in the city host weekly markets by small-scale traders dealing in items ranging from garments, footwear, utensils, and books to toys and everyday kitchen essentials. These markets cater to millions, especially those living in low-income group localities, and provide employment to more than 400,000 people in different roles – from traders to small-time transporters and labourers. Brijesh Goyal, president of the Delhi-based Chamber of Trade and Industry, said the move would bring huge relief for them..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-safety-guidelines-as-hotels-weekly-markets-set-to-open-in-delhi/story-2gvIJyFv2Q9T2IIqrwpYnJ.html

The CM, the deputy CM, and the other AAP MLAs, have denied any wrongdoing, and the party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has accused Prakash of making false allegations at the behest of the Union government.The high court will hear the matter on Monday.In his plea, filed through advocate Stuti Gujral, Prakash has asked that the matter, which has been pending in the trial court in the arguments stage, be heard on the grounds that no substantive proceedings have happened in the last 18 months because of a pending petition in the high court.In 2018, Kejriwal and Sisodia moved the high court, challenging a trial court order allowing Prakash to have the lawyers of his choice rather than a special public prosecutor. On Friday, appearing for Prakash, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra told the court that there has been no progress in proceedings before the trial court for the last one-and-a-half years as a result of a March 14, 2019 order by the high court staying the proceedings until the lawyers’ issue was resolved.Appearing for the CM and deputy CM, their counsel Mohammad Irshaad sought some time to get instructions from his clients, following which the matter was adjourned till Monday.The AAP government refused to comment on the issue despite repeated attempts. Delhi Police, on February 20, 2018, filed a first information report (FIR) based on Prakash’s complaint. Prakash alleged he was called for a midnight meeting to discuss release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi, and manhandled and assaulted during the course of the meeting. On August 13, 2018, police filed a 1,300-page charge sheet against 13 AAP leaders, including Kejriwal and Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/anshu-prakash-moves-court-seeks-early-hearing-in-assault-case/story-eCgzeLi46sL9glcX9JT95N.html
22-08-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal gives Rs 1crore to family of sanitation worker who died on Covid-19 duty||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday met the family of a 55-year-old sanitation worker of Hindu Rao hospital who had succumbed to Covid-19 earlier this month and offered them financial assistance of Rs 1 crore, the government said in a press statement. The chief minister said that while money could not bring back a lost life, it could help in supporting the families of such Covid warriors. “A sanitation worker, Raju, was infected while he was on duty at a hospital and later passed away. I have offered his family financial assistance of Rs 1 crore. We are proud of all these corona-warriors who have sacrificed their lives while protecting the people of Delhi,” Kejriwal told reporters after meeting the sanitation worker’s family in north Delhi’s Old Chandrawal neighbourhood. The compensation scheme was initially meant for healthcare workers. In April, its ambit was expanded to cover police officials, teachers, firemen, sanitation workers and anyone else engaged in any form of Covid-19 management duty. The scheme was given cabinet approval as a “mark of respect to Covid warriors. So far, more than 20 families have received financial assistance from the Delhi government. They include the families of a doctor, police officials and a civil defence volunteers, who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Earlier this month, Kejriwal had met a city doctor’s family and handed a cheque of Rs 1 crore.Raju, only referred to by his first name in government records, was employed with the north Delhi municipal corporation.  Raju’s family said that the compensation amount has come as a relief for them and now they can hope to build their own house with it.“My father was the only one with a permanent government job. My mother also works as a sanitation worker on contract. During the lockdown I lost my job as a housekeeping staff of a private company. My brother too doesn’t have a job. With this money, we hope to make our own house and pay off the loan that my father had taken for getting my two sisters married,” said Ravi Ghogaliya (35), late Raju’s son. Raju was suffering from diabetes and hypertension. He succumbed to the virus on June 26. The family had earlier said that even though he was a sanitation worker, he also worked as a ward boy in Covid ward, despite his repeated requests of not being put on duty there because of his co-morbidities. Sanjay Gehlot, president of the Safai Karamcharis Union said, “It is our responsibility to get one of the family members employed in place of their father as well as that they receive the compensation amount of ₹10 lakh from the corporation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-gives-rs-1cr-to-family-of-sanitation-worker-who-died-on-covid-19-duty/story-81M2vQsaZtiP25uu6uhsKJ.html

The police said the number was fake and was not of the customer care.“After contacting on the customer care number, she spoke to a man who identified himself as Deepak Sharma. He claimed that the refund for the order was being delayed owing to a problem in the server and asked for her bank details to transfer the refund at the earliest. He then sent her a link and told her to open it for the refund process, but when the link did not open, the caller asked her to forward the link back to him,” said senior inspector Rajendra Kamble from Manickpur police station. After she forwarded the link, he disconnected the call.The woman then received messages from her bank, which stated that ₹10,000 was debited from her account in two simultaneous transactions of ₹5,000 each. “She again called on the customer care number and spoke to Sharma, who said the amount was debited owing to a technical glitch and assured her that he will credit ₹10,000 and the ₹359 debited earlier for the order into her account,” said Kamble.However, the next day, the woman lost ₹33,900 from her bank account. She then tweeted to the food-delivery provider and an authorised customer representative called her and returned her the ₹359 which was debited for the food order.“The woman then sent an email to her bank, but their reply came only on August 11. They refused to help her as she gave all the bank details to the accused, the complainant told us. She then approached us and we filed a case against Sharma under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Information Technology Act, 2000. The cyber cell is probing the matter,” said Kamble.Such links are sent by fraudsters usually to hack into phones and access a person’s data, said Kamble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vasai-woman-orders-burger-for-359-loses-44k-in-online-fraud/story-lAnNLTkriyvMogSJLI6V4M.html
22-08-2020||Mumbai||P Varavara Rao’s neurological status unstable: Medical report||The Bombay high court (HC) has highlighted that a part of the medical report of Telegu poet P Varavara Rao from Nanavati Hospital, where he was admitted for treatment Covid-19 and other comorbidities, has stated that though Rao’s electrolyte levels have normalised, his neurological status is unstable as he is still disoriented in his talks. The report further states that depending on Rao’s condition and as per hospital protocols, they would permit Rao’s family to speak to him over video call. Meanwhile, the family and lawyer of the poet, who has been arrested in the Elgar Parishad case, are yet to receive the medical report of the octogenarian. While hearing the petition filed by Rao seeking bail on grounds of his health condition, a bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Abhay Ahuja, on August 17, had directed the court administration to hand over Rao’s medical report from Nanavati Hospital to his family and his lawyer as well as to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). However, none of them received the reports as of Friday evening. In its order published on Thursday night, the bench has reproduced a paragraph of the medical report which states that Rao’s health condition with regards to reduced electrolyte levels has improved but he is still incoherent while talking. It reads, “Prognosis: Mr P Varavara Rao’s persistent hyponatremia has improved after sodium correction but neurological status has not improved clinically as he is still disoriented with irrelevant talks. He is maintaining saturation on room air; his respiratory system has not shown abnormal signs as of now but has paroxysmal bouts of cough especially during feeding. As on date, considering the comorbid factors of age, persistent hyponatremia in Covid-19 case, the patient will require close monitoring.” According to sources in the HC, the report is expected to be handed over to Rao’s family and lawyer by Monday. Rao was first admitted to Sir JJ Hospital in July after he lost consciousness while in Taloja jail. Later he tested positive for Covid-19 and was shifted to St George Hospital on July 16. However, he fell from the cot during treatment and was subsequently shifted to Nanavati Hospital on July 19 for neurological treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/p-varavara-rao-s-neurological-status-unstable-medical-report/story-uSy2ucinNGCSQrEcD818hI.html

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation will develop this parking facility in the densely populated area.“The car parking facility will be a part of an integrated station complex at Nabi Karim. While an interchange facility for the Janakpuri West -RK Ashram Marg Metro corridor and the proposed Inderlok -Indraprastha corridor of Phase 4 will be underground, a six-storey car parking facility along with a three-storey commercial complex will be constructed above the station. The parking facility will be fully automated,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC.DMRC managing director Mangu Singh and north corporation commissioner Gyanesh Bharti signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Friday.DMRC officials said Metro will construct the integrated substructure for the station and the north corporation will construct the super structure for the parking as well as commercial facilities through its concessionaire. “They will operate and maintain the parking facility and the commercial block,” said Dayal.Lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, who attended the event via video-conferencing, said a joint monitoring team of the north corporation and DMRC should monitor the project and ensure it is complete on time.North Mayor Jai Prakash said, “Residents of the Walled City would benefit from the project once it is completed. This project would speed up development work in old Delhi. This facility will reduce parking-related problems in Nabi Karim area.”The Metro station, a DMRC official said, will consist of four underground levels. “The surface of the building will have ground floor plus eight floors.

22-08-2020||Delhi||Jamia violence: NHRC report does not give clean chit to anyone, says HC||Quoting the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) report on the Jamia Millia Islamia violence in December 2019, the Delhi high court on Friday observed that the police action was not done in a professional manner and the report “does not give a clean chit to anyone”. The court was hearing a bunch of pleas, seeking various reliefs including a court-monitored special investigation team (SIT) probe into the violence on the campus. Violence has broken out on the varsity campus on December 15 during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Police were accused of entering the campus and assaulting students. At least 10 vehicles were torched allegedly by protesters. The Jamia students had said that they were not involved in the violence and that their peaceful march was hijacked by outsiders.Also read: A blow-by-blow account of Jamia protest in last 24 hrs over Citizenship ActA bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan made these observations after the additional solicitor general (ASG) Aman Lekhi said the NHRC report itself states that the protests were not peaceful. “The protest was a mask for something far more grave and serious. There has to be an intelligence inquiry,” the ASG contended while adding that “calling the entry of police into the campus illegal and mala fide just because the students inside the campus were from minority community is completely untenable”. To this, justice Jalan said, “But the NHRC report also states that the entire police action was not handled very professionally. It doesn’t give a clean chit to anyone”. The ASG replied, “However, it does not say that police action as a whole was unnecessary.” Lekhi, while opposing the pleas seeking compensation and registration of FIRs against the police officers, said the police action was warranted. Reading from the NHRC report, ASG Lekhi said the report mentions that protesters hurled stones at the police, damaged public property and blocked traffic movement. He said the report also mentions that protesters were not as peaceful as they claimed to be and there was an influx of outsiders on the campus. As such, police action was necessary. He said the report also stated that there was a law and order problem and that the students were influenced by politicians and local leaders. He also blamed the university for not informing the police about prior incidents. Following arguments, the court adjourned the matter for further hearing to August 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamia-violence-nhrc-report-does-not-give-clean-chit-to-anyone-says-hc/story-qyXMgu820JxcW0zdOS1FNM.html
22-08-2020||Delhi||‘Citizens had to bend their heads in shame’: AAP, BJP spar over Delhi’s cleanliness rankings||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said he is saddened by the poor ranking of the three municipal corporations in Delhi in the central government’s cleanliness survey 2020 -- the result of which were shared on Thursday.Kejriwal on Friday asked officials of the BJP-ruled MCDs to work hard and improve the ranking. “Work hard. Sad to see the latest ranking of Delhi’s three municipal corporations in the cleanliness survey,” he told reporters.The three municipal corporations in Delhi bagged the 31st, 43rd and 46th ranks in the survey.Also read | Swachh Survekshan 2020: All you need to know about India’s cleanliness surveyThe Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday also criticised the municipal corporations, accusing them of failing to keep the city clean, citing the central government’s cleanliness report. “The BJP-ruled MCDs ranked very poorly at the cleanliness survey. SDMC was ranked 31, North MCD ranked 43 and EDMC 46, citizens had to bend their heads in shame for this. The MCDs have failed to ensure a decently clean Delhi. The MCDs had opened all the toilets for only one week for the survey, today all these toilets have been closed again. I appeal to the people of Delhi, to give the responsibility of civic bodies to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. We will build a cleanliness model for Delhi one the lines of quality education and health,” said Bharadwaj. While the AAP controls the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations in Delhi. The next municipal elections are likely to be scheduled in 2022. The BJP hit back at AAP’s comments. The party’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “I do not wish to get involved in the dirty ranking bogey being raised by the AAP leaders as I feel today is the time to respect the hard work put in by municipal corporation Safai Karamcharis during last six months of the corona pandemic. To the AAP leaders saying that people want the Delhi government to take over sanitation service, I wish to ask if they will restore the water facility with the municipal corporation like the way it was till 1997. The Delhi Jal Board has failed and it is because of them that Delhi witnesses waterlogging after the slightest rain.” The BJP-led municipal corporations blamed the AAP government for not releasing their “due” funds in time because of which many of the works and even salaries to the staff could not be paid timely. South Corporation mayor Anamika Mithilesh said, “If we don’t have a budget, how are we supposed to keep on working. We still try to generate our own revenue to make things work. The Delhi government has no right to point fingers at us without releasing our funds due under the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission.” The North and East corporation mayors too had said they were working to improve their rankings but did not have enough funds have majorly impacted their work. North Corporation mayor had on Thursday said he will call a meeting to focus on waste segregation and how it could be bettered to improve their future rankings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-spar-over-delhi-s-cleanliness-rankings/story-6UMQuhmV9aFaPqZpVjKodJ.html
22-08-2020||Gurugram||Commercial building constructed on land marked for public utility partially demolished||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Friday partially demolished a four-storey building allegedly constructed over private land in an area marked for public utilities in Sector 100. Officials said almost 60% of the building, which was constructed without obtaining permission from authorities, was demolished by the enforcement team before the building’s owner got a stay order from local court in the evening.Four persons were also detained by the police after they started protesting against the demolition by the enforcement team, but were later released after they tendered an apology, said DTCP officials.RS Bhath, district town planner, said that a large commercial building, spread over 45000 square feet, with an office on the ground floor and residential space on the other floors was constructed in an area that has been marked for public utility as per the Gurugram master plan 2031. “The owner said the building was three-year-old, but could not produce any valid permission for its construction from the authorities. The demolition was carried out from 10am to 6pm wherein around 60% of the structure was demolished. But the action was stopped after the owner got a stay from a local court around 6pm,” he said.The court had granted a stay to the buildings’ owner till the next hearing in view of the urgency involved in the matter, said Bhath.The owner of the builder could not be reached for comment.After obtaining the stay order, Bhath said, that few employees working for the building’s owner started protesting and misbehaved with the enforcement staff following which a police time detained them. “These persons were later released by the police after they tendered an apology,” he said. Police teams from Rajendra Park police station and Dhankot police post had accompanied the enforcement team during the demolition drive.Inspector Pankaj, station house officer, Rajendra Park police station said a team of 70 police personnel supported the enforcement team of DTCP during the drive. “No one was allowed to create any hindrance, and few persons who tried to protest were detained for some time and later released,” the SHO said.An adjoining structure, where a cement company had created a godown, was also given a notice to vacate the premises at the earliest, said officials. “They have given us in written that cement worth ₹1 crore is lying in the godown, and they should be given time to remove it,” Bhath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/commercial-building-constructed-on-land-marked-for-public-utility-partially-demolished/story-Kg4j3OnLRe3HExR651vpSJ.html
22-08-2020||Delhi||Hotels to open in Delhi; weekly markets on a trial basis, but not gyms, yoga centres||The Delhi government on Wednesday allowed hotels to resume operations and weekly markets to open on a trial basis, but continued the ban on gymnasiums and yoga centres in the national capital.The decision was taken in a meeting of the state disaster management authority (SDMA), helmed by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal and attended by vice-chairperson chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, among others. Hotels and weekly markets will be opening in the city after a gap of nearly five months.Kejriwal said the decision will boost Delhi’s economy, which saw a steep slump during the three-month nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of Covid-19. “The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is much better now. The economy of Delhi has to be brought back on track. For that, we had proposed the opening of all hotels in Delhi, which was rejected by the Central government earlier. We requested Centre again and we are happy that the proposal was finally approved on Wednesday. Now, all hotels in Delhi will open, while weekly markets will be opened on a trial basis. However, everyone must exercise precautions and follow social distancing,” Kejriwal said.Senior government officials said the opening of hotels and weekly markets shall be prohibited in containment zones and an order notifying the SDMA decisions will be issued soon.Hotel groups and associations were enthused by the lifting of restrictions and said coupled with the Delhi government’s July 30 decision to do away with the night curfew (imposed between 10pm and 5am), it would help attract more customers.According to the Delhi government, the hotel industry in the capital contributes 8% of the state’s gross domestic product and employs nearly four lakh people. Weekly markets, the government said, provide employment to nearly five lakh poor families.Hotels, gyms and yoga centres were allowed to open across the country from June 8 under the Central government’s unlock 3.0 guidelines issued on May 30. But in Delhi, these services remained prohibited as a preventive measure to curb the spread of Covid-19. The Delhi government had first sent a proposal to open hotels and weekly markets to L-G Baijal on July 30. The LG, however, struck it down saying that the Covid-19 situation continues to be “fragile” in Delhi and the threat is still “far from over”. On August 6, the government sent the proposal again, this time adding the demand to allow gyms and yoga centres to open as well, but the L-G did not respond. Instead, he scheduled the SDMA meeting on Wednesday.While hotels will now open in Delhi, senior government officials said a decision on opening gyms and yoga centres will be taken “at a later stage” by the SDMA. Weekly markets are likely to be allowed to operate on a trial basis for a week or 10 days.“The L-G was of the view that the economic activities should be opened up in a phased manner. It was also pointed out that even though the Covid-19 situation has somewhat stabilised, Delhi is still witnessing around 1,033 fresh cases on average every day,” an official who attended the SDMA meeting said, on condition of anonymity.Senior government officials said the health department is likely to issue a standard operating procedure for all hotels to follow, which will mostly be a reiteration of the guidelines issued by the Central government on June 4.Shwetank Singh, vice-president, development and asset management, InterGlobe Hotels, said the hotels in the state had been under immense stress for the longest time, while those in NCR cities such as Gurugram and Faridabad have reopened and returned to normal functioning. “We are in the process of installing MERV 13 air filters in our hotels to avoid the spread through the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. We have installed plexiglas shields at check-in desks and all our staff members will wear masks and gloves throughout the day. Sanitizer dispensers will be installed at all touchpoints. While making rounds of the premises and visiting quarantined guest floors as well as during guest interactions, our staff members will wear full PPE kits,” he said.Sandeep Khandelwal, chairman, Delhi hotels and restaurant’s owner’s association (DHROA) said the decision to open hotels will give life to 3,000 budget hotels in the city. “We now request the Delhi government to help our industry recover from the losses by giving relaxations and deferments in fixed charges of electricity bills, house tax, hotel licences and fire norms,” he said.Rohit Arora, area general manager, The Park New Delhi, said the hotel has introduced a gold-certified program - S.H.I.E.L.D. “Every team member has undergone mandatory hygiene, safety, sanitization and social distancing training. We have adopted a more stringent approach towards our sanitisation and hygiene standards. All government protocols will be followed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hotels-to-open-in-delhi-weekly-markets-on-a-trial-basis-but-not-gyms-yoga-centres/story-ROfjGtB1as5p6qiwcJUzHM.html
